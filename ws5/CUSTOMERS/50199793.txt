If you are saving everything, insisting on bringing stuff into your house that you don't need or setting things aside until you \\"decide about it,\\" then you will definitely want to read this hilarious book about clutter. She believes there are only four steps to eliminating clutter and gives the four primary causes of clutter.<br /><br />She explains how you can prevent clutter from returning, forever. If you are tired of sorting, wondering how you accumulated so much \\"stuff,\\" or just need to organize your house, then this book gives excellent advice and even a \\"clutter quiz.\\"<br /><br />The book begins with a funny letter and then introduces you to the clutter generation. There are wonderful bits of information like the inspiring:<br /><br />\\"Cleaning professionals say that getting rid of excess clutter would eliminate 40 percent of the housework in an average home.\\"<br /><br />Rita Emmett is also the author of \\"The Procrastinator's Handbook\\" which only took her 38 years to write. She is a recovered \\"Pack Rat\\" who knows how to motivate with humor and insight. She gives advice on how to organize books, notes, greeting cards, paper clutter, business cards and clothes. She delves into creative storage ideas and give excellent advice on how to sort a closet. She also addresses issues like:<br /><br />What do I do with all this furniture I just inherited?<br />Do I really need to put some things in storage?<br />Will removing clutter lower my stress level?<br />What do I do with all these holiday decorations?<br /><br />Her advice on e-mail has been very useful on a day-by-day basis. I like her idea of not even opening some e-mails. If I see \\"FW\\" it is gone. You may have to get a little selfish with your time, but it is \\"YOUR\\" time.<br /><br />I started to read this book while my mother was moving. She is now sorting her office, but we were able to effectively organize the rest of the house while I was there for a week. We had some funny moments sorting through the \\"junk box\\" and it was quite the healing experience to see a house filled with boxes turn into \\"home.\\"<br /><br />As an organizer at heart who has helped numerous people clean up the clutter and organize their houses, I can highly recommend this book. My mother says I should do this for a living, but currently I'm exclusive.<br /><br />One of my own secrets for reducing clutter involves giving away things to charity and consistently going through my house to find things I don't use anymore. I think if you take one room or one closet at a time, it is much easier to deal with clutter. I also find that putting a pile of unrelated items in the middle of a room makes it easier to decide what you don't need.<br /><br />Books organized. Check.<br />File cabinet organized. Check.<br /><br />I had to laugh when I noticed the picture on page 144. My mother used to teach me to organize my room as a child by pulling everything out from under the bed and everything that was disorganized in the closets. There I would sit organizing until I had a wonderful sense of satisfaction I never forgot.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewnts sorting through the \\"junk box\\" and it was quite the healing experience to see a house filled with boxes turn into \\"home.\\"     As an organizer at heart who has helped numerous people clean up the clutter and organize their houses, I can highly recommend this book.

She possesses varied attributes and is worshipped in Brazil, Cuba and Haiti. She is associated with money in Puerto Rico, where her symbol is a pumpkin. ~pg. 13<br /><br />Inspired by selected goddesses from world cultures, Oneil A. Williams has organized his poems of remembrance, longing, intimacy and wonder in seven chapters. He begins this collection with eternal questions addressing deep human concerns we can all instantly relate to. The unique organizations allows the reader to relate to the specific emotions and desires inspired by the goddesses of life, love, spirituality, nature, immortality, memory and cross-roads.<br /><br />In the second chapter Oneil A. Williams touches briefly on romantic notions, but his book is much more about a deep spirituality and at times he is having a conversation with the creator:<br /><br />\\"We cry for water.<br /><br />You send rain.<br /><br />You cry for us.<br /><br />We turn away.\\"<br /><br />My favorite poem in the chapter on nature is \\"Rain.\\" There are also humorous poems, poems about friendship and even a poem about being homeless.<br /><br />It's often hard to verbalize,<br /><br />Just what it is to be a friend.<br /><br />But you will surely realize<br /><br />When one is with you till the end.<br /><br />A friend is almost always there,<br /><br />Through good and bad, through thick and thin,<br /><br />And even when you cease to care,<br /><br />A friend will give you faith again.<br /><br />Throughout this work, the influences of Oneil A. Williams' travel experiences and enchantment with language is very apparent. He shows a deep insight into the conflicts life presents and his heart beats in his poems as he explores what it means to be human and what it means to love and to understand the world around him.<br /><br />\\"Enunciate.<br /><br />Don't hesitate.<br /><br />Incorporate the cause.\\"<br /><br />In \\"The Kaleidoscope of Color,\\" Oneil A. Williams celebrates his love for life, his passions and his connection with the creator.<br /><br />~TheRebeccaReview.comrates his love for life, his passions and his connection with the creator.  <br /> <br />~TheRebeccaReview.com  <br />	2005-10-13

Can these plants be saved by ordinary gardeners? When plants have been dug up from natural areas they can threaten or deplete the natural resources. Whereas, a collection of orchids could be an important gene pool for more rare species. Some plants like the Chocolate Cosmos is only found in gardens and was last seen in its native habitat back in 1902. Private gardens can become a refuge for plants that might otherwise now be extinct.<br /><br />Janet Marinell is on the forefront of the ecological revolution and has been the Director of Publishing at Brooklyn Botanic Garden for the past decade. She has won numerous awards for her writing, including the American Gardener Award. She is a popular lecturer on the subject of ecological garden design and plant conservations. By request, she makes frequent appearances across the U.S. and abroad to pass along her philosophy and gardening techniques.<br /><br />From the first page you realize you are about to be immersed in a magical book filled with page after page of rare plants you might never see in your lifetime unless you found them in this book. The contents include beautiful sections on:<br /><br />The Evolution of Plants<br />The Extinction Crisis<br />Protecting Natural Areas<br />Natural Gardening<br />Temperate and Boreal Forests<br />Wet Grasslands<br />Deserts<br />Trees and Shrubs<br />Climbing Plants<br />Alpine Plants<br />Ferns<br />Palms and Cycads<br />Carnivorous Plants<br />A-Z of Invasive Plants<br /><br />There are many unique features in this book but the most impressive part is the pictures of fields of exotic flowers, maps to show locations and explorations of each global habitat. The authors explore how plants have vastly impacted human societies and also presents plant classification that is easy to understand.<br /><br />PLANT explores the stunning world we live in and introduces the reader to exotic landscapes, forests drenched in mist and flowering plants you will fall in love with and want to save. The vulnerable yellow angels' trumpets emit a powerful fragrance that lures in night-flying butterflies while strange blooms of green cactus-like sunflowers grow from the Dorstenia. Larch \\"flowers\\" are born from bark like visual poetry and many of the plants we know about are also on the lists of plants that could become extinct. Like the more familiar Japanese magnolia, Echniacea or Ginkgo biloba. You may want to cultivate your own passionflowers or plant more bulbs.<br /><br />There is a lot to think about. Like, who hasn't sprinkled a wildflower mix into a part of their yard or in a field. There is information about a poppy seed that self-seed vigorously and it is found in \\"wildflower\\" seed mixes. It can compete with grasslands and can be very invasive, although stunningly beautiful.<br /><br /> A portion of the proceeds for this book will go to plant conservation efforts.

This book also contains some of the puzzles that have stumped the world's smartest mathematicians.<br /><br />The author, Johnny Ball introduces concepts to make math more fun and very easy to understand. Part of what makes this book quite enjoyable is the full-color pages filled with diagrams, pictures and explanations. The concepts are divided into four main chapters:<br /><br />Where do Numbers come from?<br />Magic Numbers<br />Shaping Up<br />The World of Math<br /><br />Children will learn about Roman numerals, infinity, secret codes, World News, how counting began, shapes, chaos and logic. Johnny Ball also answers the following questions:<br /><br />Did Cavemen Count?<br />How many molecules are in one glass of water?<br />What do the symbols on a Babylonian clay token mean?<br />How did the Mayans count?<br />How do insects use prime timing to survive?<br /><br />How did numbers evolve? See Indian numbers go from 10 symbols to what they are today. One was originally a horizontal line. Three, three horizontal lines. Which really helps to explain why three looks the way it does today. Really fascinating stuff even for adults to read about.<br /><br />As someone who enjoyed writing words upside down on my calculator in school, I thoroughly enjoyed this entertaining book about how math evolved through time. There is even a page comparing 1-100 in Babylonian, Egyptian hieroglyphics, Chinese script, Hindu, Hebrew, Greek, Roman, Mayan and Modern Arabic.<br /><br />The Math quiz is fun and one example:<br /><br />\\"Find two numbers that multiply together to give 1,000,000 but neither of which contains any zeros.\\"<br /><br />You may need to buy some food for the lessons on page 72. \\"How can you cut a doughnut into 12 pieces with only 3 straight cuts? How is it possible to push a large doughnut through a cup handle?<br /><br />The book concludes with a list of \\"Who's Who in the math world and then there are pages of answers to all the questions.<br /><br />One of the most entertaining books on math I've ever read. Definitely will be of interest to children who have any interest in solving problems or want to make learning about math way more fun.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\\"Who's Who in the math world and then there are pages of answers to all the questions.

When you decide to incorporate a style of meditation into your life then a whole-body Vipassana might bring you more peace of mind. It is a sensation-based style of meditation.<br /><br />Marshall Glickman has a beautiful writing style and his ideas connect perfectly with the modern reader who may or may not be familiar with meditation. His ideas are presented in a way that makes meditation come alive. I used to think meditation was complete stillness and lack of thought, but there are ways to focus on sensation that bring you to a deeper understanding of yourself. Some of the intellectually intriguing aspects of this work include:<br /><br />The Power and Pleasure Principle<br />The Biochemical Basics of Pleasure<br />The Neurochemistry of Karma<br /><br />There are chapters filled with instructions on how to meditate, but the real highlights of this book are the insights into living life effectively and understanding how our bodies function on the chemical level.<br /><br />\\"Focusing on sensations puts us more directly in touch with what's motivating us, while at the same time helping to free us from the storylines which tend to obscure our feelings. In this way, greater awareness to our sensations increases our emotional sensitivity.\\" ~Marshall Glickman<br /><br />If you have trouble settling into a meditation session, do yoga first. It helps your body to work out all the extra energy that might keep you from sitting still. You can also meditate while reclining in bed or while sitting in a chair. You don't have to meditate in a guru-style seated position. I normally meditate while laying flat on my back after an invigorating yoga practice. Some of the most blissful happy places I've ever been have been after doing a Chakra Yoga workout. I finally understood the place meditation could take you. I like imagining colors inside my body and working with sensations and the release of negative thoughts. I've noticed that when I do meditate I think more clearly and can solve problems more effectively. When I don't meditate, chaos creeps into my life.<br /><br />After reading this work, you may also enjoy Tobin Blake's \\"The Power of Stillness: Learn Meditation in 30 Days.\\"<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review've ever been have been after doing a Chakra Yoga workout.

The formality of the dining room table is being exchanged for a more relaxed gathering around the coffee table as the new mode for entertaining. ~Jennifer Joyce<br /><br />From the first page, Small Bites impresses with artistically designed culinary temptations. With minimal effort you can make soups, salads, skewers, wrapped Japanese style delicacies, sweets and even dishes of tempting vegetables.<br /><br />These dishes are known as tapas, antipasti, mezze or finger food. They are perfect for a lifestyle that promotes social gatherings like book clubs or parties.<br /><br />Unique selections: Fried Artichokes with Saffron Aioli, followed by an entire section on Latin Fiesta that includes classic recipes for a margarita. For the fried food recipes, you are sent to various pages of interest. Crispy Scallops can be dipped in Wasabi Mayonnaise and Ithaca Zucchini cakes are served with a dill yogurt sauce.<br /><br />The soups are served in small cups or creative containers. The Red curry Pumpkin Soup is made with coconut milk, chicken stock and fresh pumpkin. Cilantro and shallots garnish the spicy garlicky soup.<br /><br />The Dips chapter also contains a recipe for Mango crush and a complete menu that includes Lemongrass Beef Skewers and passion Fruit Trifle. Each chapter has a \\"quick\\" section with tips on fast foods you can make in a hurry. Roasted garlic with warm bread and Spicy peanut dip are easy to make and have just a few ingredients.<br /><br />The Salads in this book look like they are straight out of a gourmet magazine. Watermelon and Feta cheese? There is a salty/sweet theme to some of the dishes.<br /><br />If you love making skewers on your grill then the Citrus Swordfish Brochettes may entice you with the pomegranate dipping sauce. This chapter is filled with luxurious flavors of saffron, dried fruits, fragrant rose water, pistachios, black olives and smoked paprika. The shrimp are even dusted with Sumac. The theme is Middle Eastern Delights and each and ever page is filled with delicious satays for every taste and sauce dipping desire. Whether you are hungry for shrimp, lamb, pork or beef, there is a recipe.<br /><br />By the time you get to the chapter on Meats you may be a little overwhelmed with all the ideas and rather hungry for recipes like Five-spice hoisin ribs. These are made in the oven and only take 2 hours with minimal preparation and care.<br /><br />The fish chapter contains recipes for chicken breast bites. There is some mingling of ideas in each chapter and this book doesn't focus on any one food like chicken or beef. There is a good variety of every type of food you could imagine. For wrapped seafood, onward to the Wrapped, Tied and Rolled chapter which also contains ideas for rolling fruit with arugula and parmesan.<br /><br />If you are thinking \\"parties,\\" then look for the Wild Mushroom Crostini with Marscarpone and Sherry vinegar. Rent your favorite Bollywood movie and enjoy a spicy Indian feast complete with magenta pink tablecloths, small spice boals and scattered rose petals. The imaginative table settings add beauty to the pages filled with tons of tasty recipes. The \\"Rolled Zucchini Ribbons\\" are a stunning presentation and will catch the attention of your guests. The Artichoke Puff Pastry Bites are also easy to make because you can purchase puff pastry in sheets.<br /><br />The recipes are adventurous, delicious and are made from ingredients that are easily found at your local grocery store. The Sweets chapter includes such tempting delights as chocolate cupcakes with cherry colored icing and rose petals. Is there no mercy? Chocolate Crinkle Cookies would ship well at Christmas and thinking about Figs dipped in chocolate and pistachios is making me feel a bit heady.<br /><br />An entire section is dedicated to \\"useful\\" recipes - mostly sauces and dressings.<br /><br />Jennifer Joyce loves to travel in search of new flavors and recipes and her book is simply stunning in beauty and overwhelming in creativity.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2005-10-07

If we're not living \\"on purpose,\\" our souls can't rest comfortably. ~Martha Beck<br /><br />Stress is the number one killer in America and it is basically a reaction to physical, mental or emotional stimulus that upsets your body's natural balance.<br /><br />By defending yourself during a stressful situation, you are increasing the production of adrenal hormones that end up being responsible for most of the symptoms associated with stress. When the \\"flight or fight\\" response goes unchecked your emotional or physical health can suffer greatly.<br /><br />If you are looking for a comprehensive program, complete with information on the causes and effects of stress, then you will be very impressed with this workshop. Victoria Wizell has created a collection of information about stress to help you understand the reasons you feel the way you do under stress. She then presents effective hypnosis sections to reprogram your mind so you can handle stress more efficiently.<br /><br />What causes stress?<br />What are the main sources of stress?<br />When do most heart attacks occur?<br />What are stress triggers?<br /><br />If the body can be addicted to stress or even fall behind in cell repair when we have reduced rest because of stress, then this program could not only save your life, it could help you live a healthier life. The sections include:<br /><br />History and Facts about Stress<br />How to Cope with Stress and Manage it Through Hypnosis<br />Progressive Relaxation<br />Managing Your Thoughts<br />Time Management - Determining Your Values<br />Dealing with Your Emotions<br />Your Physical Nature<br />Managing Job Stress<br />Managing Your Finances<br />Spirituality: Understanding Your Inner Self<br /><br />Some of the main symptoms of stress include: Muscle tension, fatigue, migraine headaches, back pain, high blood pressure, problems in relationships, shortness of breath, upset stomach, insomnia, loss of libido, hypertension, aggressive behavior, abuse of alcohol or drugs, depression, indigestion, weight gain or loss, obsessions, fears, phobias, anger, low self-esteem, anxiety, withdrawal, feeling bored, inability to concentrate and spiritual emptiness.<br /><br />No matter what you are experiencing currently, hypnosis and knowledge about stress can help you get back on the road to wellness and peace. You will also learn valuable techniques for avoiding stressful situations or putting out the flames when a situation occurs.<br /><br />Victoria Wizell also presents healing thoughts about how to change your stressful situation. You can learn to relax through massage or deep breathing techniques. Just by exercising on a regular basis, you can burn up extra adrenaline. She gives advice on diet and explains the difference between the unconscious and conscious mind.<br /><br />A journal is highly recommended or you can use the Stress Management Workbook to record your experiences. There is an emphasis on accessing the subconscious mind (still under your total control while doing the exercises) in order to reprogram your thoughts. By increasing positive thoughts you decrease turmoil and create a new future.<br /><br />Quick Tips for Dealing with Stress Now:<br /><br />Embrace change with a positive attitude<br />Set realistic goals for your life<br />Exercise and get enough sleep<br />Meditate<br />Resolve Conflicts<br />Try Hypnotherapy - this course is a great place to start and it explores hypnotherapy from many angles.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />P.S.

Then the unthinkable happens. The disappointment on the children's faces is very apparent when their teacher cuts the icing/tops off the cupcakes. She feels that all the cupcakes should have the same icing or it won't be fair. Poor Caitlin ends up home with the sad little cupcake faces all on one sheet.<br /><br />Her dad then explains how the world is a place of great diversity. Children will appreciate the contrast of the row of houses that are all the same with families all dressed the same all looking quite generic and the row of creative houses with people of all races and income levels enjoying life together.<br /><br />\\"Is there nothing in the whole, whole world that's the same, Daddy?\\" she asks.<br /><br />\\"My love for you and your love for me is the same my darling,\\" he smiled.<br /><br />My father used to bake cupcakes for my birthday parties and for school when I was young, to this story was sort of close to my heart.

In a circle, we lit a single candle and passed it around. Each child had a chance to speak. Ryan was shy. But when the candle was passed to him, he looked at his fellow campers, nodded his head and said, \\"You know, this is the best week of my life.\\" At that moment, I knew that Camp Heartland would be a success. ~Neil Willenson<br /><br />A Journey of Hope is an inspiring book of artistic photographs, handwritten letters, children's drawings, stories, speeches, poems, experiences and teenage conversations. Neil Willenson and the children of Camp Heartland reflect on the beauty of a campsite dedicated to children with HIV and AIDS.<br /><br />In writing about the children who have deeply influenced Neil's life, there is sadness, but there is also a love of life and the knowledge that each child experienced beautiful moments during their life. Through no fault of their own, many of these children contracted the disease through blood transfusions.<br /><br />Many of the children who visit Camp Heartland have lost parents and relatives to AIDS and have their own fears, dreams and experiences with HIV or AIDS. These children are not only struggling with multiple medical issues, they also endure cruelty due to prejudice and misinformation.<br /><br />Some of the children come from troubled backgrounds where their communities do not support them and others have become beacons of light for children in their situation.<br /><br />\\"Please look at me and see<br />I am just a child trying to live with AIDS and HIV<br /><br />It was given to me by my mother<br />Passed on to me at birth<br />And now, I'm trying to live my life<br />Giving it my best while here on Earth\\"<br />~Stephanie, Age 9<br /><br />Camp Heartland is an escape, a place where children can meet friends who know what it feels like to have difficulty making friends. This is a place of love and acceptance, a place where children can talk about their illnesses. In this book you will read about their struggles and joys. There are poems from friends, stories from camp counselors, conversations that enlighten and e-mail journeys that are filled with humor and reality.<br /><br />Neil Willenson was honored with the \\"Use Your Life\\" award and his compassionate cause also helps to educate children and families.

They understand the variety of ways people mourn and also describe the many ways parents deal with grief.<br /><br />How do you end the pain of loss when you want to remember the life of your child?

At times the writing is a friend, understanding your pain and at time the writing is a counselor guiding you through a stage where you may experience a complete change in perspective.<br /><br />If you are buying this book for yourself, I want you to know that this book is very comforting and if you read a chapter at a time you may find it helps you to work through your overwhelming feelings.

Volkman<br /><br />TIR (Trauma Incident Reduction) can be used on the frontlines of disasters. It can help people cope with what has just occurred and it can permanently eliminate PTSD (Post-traumatic Stress Disorder) symptoms.<br /><br />This one-on-one, non-hypnotic, person-centered, structured therapy helps patients to run experience through their minds until insights appear. This time of reflection seems to encourage people to not only face what has happened, but to understand the impact and then to begin the journey out of trauma and into healing.<br /><br />As a survivor of PSTD, I can truly say this book is rather enlightening. I experienced many of the symptoms discussed in this book after a few very troubling years of major breakups, car accidents and dramatic life changes including surviving a hurricane in the Caribbean on my honeymoon. A hurricane is truly one of the most frightening experiences you can endure. My own experience happened 10 years ago during the same time of year as Hurricane Katrina.<br /><br />The process I went through to stabilize my own psyche involved many of the techniques discussed in this book, however my recovery was based on friends and family listening. In fact, the main concept in TIR seems to be \\"listening.\\"<br /><br />When a patient begins to experience PTSD they may not even realize what is happening. I didn't even know about PTSD or what a panic attack was until I read about the symptoms. People who experience devastation not only have to rebuild their lives, they have to deal with anger, anxiety, panic attacks, flashbacks, claustrophobia, insomnia, nightmares, rage, depression, fatigue, obsessive thoughts, guilt and a number of issues relating to PTSD.<br /><br />The techniques described in this book will help individuals dealing with adjustment disorders, acute stress, phobias, sexual abuse, domestic violence, mourning and depression. The topics also include crime, grief, loss, abuse, accident victims, loss of a child, loss of a partner and surviving the experiences in a war. There is an excellent example of a woman who goes from experiencing a great loss to recounting the memory and then comes to terms with her grief. Psychotherapists also tell about their experiences and how TIR helped their patients:<br /><br />When he finished, looked at me and was<br />crying, he said, \\"You Know, you are the only person<br />who has ever listened to me.<br />I feel better already. ~Alex Frater, Psychotherapist<br /><br />The next logical step after reading this book seems to be attending a workshop or ordering the TIR and Metapsychology Lecture Series. There is a list of TIR trainers with Q & A to help you decide on a teacher or find out about a website filled with information on TIR. The interviews with people who have training in TIR makes this entire solution much easier to understand. I would suggest reading the question and answer section in the Appendix B first because it truly introduces you to TIR.<br /><br />This book does seem to be written to encourage professionals to take a TIR workshop. Recommended to Psychologists, Social Workers, Traumatologists, Compassion Fatigue Specialists and anyone interested in Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.<br /><br />In my own life and the life of family members and friend I have seen that talking about incidents is more healing than repressing feelings. It might be painful to talk about your experiences, but that is how many people find a path to healing and sometimes you really can't heal the trauma until you face and understand the circumstances that caused the PTSD. The healing seems to be very rapid after you identify the causes and then implement solutions. TIR seems to take patients to a place where they can begin the healing process much more quickly.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewinclude crime, grief, loss, abuse, accident victims, loss of a child, loss of a partner and surviving the experiences in a war.

While this \\"riddle\\" has been unlocked by scholars and they claim it means we should transform through love, unlocking the physiological roots of emotions can be somewhat trying.<br /><br />How do you heal what you have forgotten? When the trauma has been forgotten, the results can still remain and can slowly destroy you, causing overwhelming emotions that interfere with your daily life.<br /><br />Survivors of accidents, disasters and traumatic situations of all types can experience anxiety, depression, unexplained physical pains and seemingly unrelated illness. At times suffering can be a doorway to awakening and then it can also be a very dark place that brings debilitating symptoms.<br /><br />\\"When people have been traumatized, they are stuck in paralysis-the immobility reaction or abrupt explosions of rage.\\" ~ Peter A.

Books	5	5	6	N	N	The Wedding Dress Guy Tells All	They say marriages are made in Heaven. But so is thunder and lightning. ~Clint Eastwood<br /><br />Soon to be cookbook author, Larry Star, is famous for selling his ex-wife's wedding dress on eBay. Now he uncovers the humor and disasters lurking in the typical relationship that follows the traditional dating to marriage route.<br /><br />In the process of making you fall off the couch laughing, he reveals a very troubling side of neglecting and sabotaging your relationship through a series of satirical plots and witty dialogue. With tips like: \\"Keep a chocolate bar within easy reach,\\" you can't help but love the humor. Larry Star vividly describes situations in which he must endure the demands of the princess with pink nails he married. Did he imagine her to be low maintenance? He trades in his low-maintenance girlfriend for a woman who knows the meaning of SPA.<br /><br />Many of the situations are amusing takes on reality and Larry Star has real talent for creating atmosphere. I had a good giggle over his story of the girlfriend's grandmother's house and the cats. His logic for proposing at the zoo is endearing. The shocking rearranging of the letters in  \\"marriage\\" was enlightening.<br /><br />From Shrimp Salad Fiasco to the witty conclusions in each \\"lesson learned,\\" this book is a fun ride that leaves you wishing his wife had displayed more of a sense of humor. While we don't really hear her side of the story, it did seem she didn't appreciate his wit or appreciation for freedom.<br /><br />This is a good example of how sarcasm destroys, why a housekeeper could save a relationship and why humor is a much-needed element in every area of life. Sarcasm and Romance don't mix, but they can be darn funny in retrospect. I think Larry got what he really wanted, but then he wasn't prepared for a woman who took her life more seriously and cared about her family and friends on a deep level. The \\"tube of stuff\\" he finds under the sink is actually a \\"star\\" beauty secret that can make you look thinner if applied on the stomach, etc. This girl was pretty smart if you ask me, she knew about Bio-Dyne.<br /><br />A captivating read with a slightly less than happily-ever-after ending.

I like my waffles very crispy and I found that you can make the waffles that way by cooking them a bit longer or by putting them in the toaster.<br /><br />Tod Dimmick used to avoid the kitchen, but he is currently turning out cookbooks so fast I can hardly keep up with trying all his delicious recipes. He went on the road and collected recipes from carpenters, fireman and men who are passionate about cooking.<br /><br />I fondly remember the first time my husband helped me make a pumpkin pie. He makes chili and pizza, but I have dreams of his talents expanding to Romantic Food 101. There is an entire chapter on aphrodisiac foods for date night.

The Ba-Gua map used in this course is the Later Heaven Ba-Gua (octagonal arrangement of trigrams).<br /><br />A compass is not used so it seems easier to understand. The Ba-Gua is the compass of the heart. I compared the Ba-Gua map to the one I had been using and it was the same one that had worked well in the past. Once you draw a floor plan, you can analyze your environment and decide on colors, placement of items and additional \\"cures/actions\\" for areas of concern to add a new vitality and Qi/Energy to your home.<br /><br />Some of the Sessions Include:<br /><br />Meditation for Qi Circulation<br />The Human side of Qi<br />Natural Healing Practice<br />Kitchen<br />Social Center<br />The Front Entry<br />Landscaping<br />Freeing Your Life from Clutter<br />Folklore Secrets<br /><br />There are ways to enhance energy through seasonal rituals like sprinkling orange peels on the floor. The rituals draw on a mindful approach and with the power of intention they can become a powerful force leading you towards more success.  Transcendental solutions are reinforced with body, speech and mind.<br /><br />Areas of the house you can enhance include: Career, Knowledge Cultivation, Family, Wealth, Fame, Marriage, Children and Travel.<br /><br />Each area has colors and items, like the Fame area has the color red and you could add more candles for the \\"fire\\" element. The phases of energy from wood to fire, earth, metal and then to water is taught in a way that is easy to understand.<br /><br />This program emphasizes intention and there are segments that include practices to enhance your energy and gives methods for shaking off negative karma. The Heart Sutra Meditation with a heart-calming mudra (hand positions you may recognize from yoga) was incredibly interesting and I could feel energy moving in my body. After the meditation, I felt renewed and it was the same experience as when you work with Chakras and visualize colors. You will go into a beautiful peaceful state that renews and refreshes.<br /><br />There are times when you will be using your voice to heal your body (chanting, mantras (sound vibrations) and other unique sounds) and this course goes into healing practices that make complete sense. There is also information on the colors to wear if you want more romance in your life and a variety of ways to solve real-life issues.<br /><br />You may find yourself changing the positioning of your house numbers on the front of your house, putting more candles in your kitchen or moving your bed to the commanding position in the room.<br /><br />David Daniel Kennedy encourages the reader to seek balance when removing clutter. While listening to this course, I reorganized my entire house and threw out at least nine bags of items I no longer needed. \\"Nine\\" seems to be a significant number in Feng Shui. This is great to listen to as you sort out your file cabinets. I feel like a weight has lifted.<br /><br />The illustrated study guide provides diagrams and additional information. There are examples of how people changed their home and instantly realized a new sense of comfort and security.<br /><br />One of the issues discussed in this course is how living in an apartment can affect your life. The people above us (who used to fight and were very noisy) finally moved out and the energy in my apartment below is now much calmer and we seem to be able to relax more.<br /><br />David Daniel Kennedy's Home Study Course is comprehensive and healing. It goes beyond simple furniture placement and color design and enters the realm of spiritual considerations. The meditations can be adapted for any religious belief system. The information could help you Prevent a Divorce, Enhance a Career, Allow more Financial Security into your life, Create a more Harmonious Living Space or even Clear out NegativeEnergy left by former tenants. There is a \\"Home Finders\\" checklist if you are looking for a new home. Lot, house shapes and color schemes are discussed.<br /><br />The first time I tried Feng Shui it was to increase income and I remember putting a fountain by the front door and then receiving a surprise check in the mail. I now see the connection between intention and the physical reality of my life.<br /><br />A good way to imagine how this will change your life is to imagine a dark room and then to imagine a room filled with sunlight and yellow flowers and the scent of oranges. There are subtle ways to increase energy flow and more dramatic ways. You can decide on what you wish for and then you can create the means by which the results will manifest themselves. This is all about making you feel happy, safe and comfortable in your home.<br /><br />After 24 audio sessions, Feng Shui will be much less mysterious and you will be able to apply the principles to your daily life.

The format is fun and encouraging and women of any age will enjoy the quiz, fun facts about women throughout history and creative ideas for changing the world.<br /><br />The celebratory nature of this book encourages participation. Catherine Dee's writing style is fresh and playful and she has a unique way of explaining life-changing issues like self-esteem and the role it plays in a woman's life.<br /><br />I struggled with my own self-esteem for over thirty years and had to deal with everything from immature people making fun of my body to cruel sarcasm meant to disempower me. I had friends who were anorexic but I had no idea how serious it was. It wasn't until a guy friend encouraged me to address my self-esteem issues, that I truly started to blossom into who I am today and still I have moments where sentences from the past will arise to haunt me.<br /><br />This book is essential reading for young girls because it will not only alert them to pertinent issues, it will save them years of heartache from low self-esteem and negative choices, not to mention having to deal with a negative body image due to the media's insistence on displaying unrealistic and enhanced images.<br /><br />There are helpful topics that have practical applications. Girls can read about how to start a journal and can also find book recommendations like \\"The Diary of Anne Frank.\\" There are many lists of books that will be of interest to women of all ages.<br /><br />\\"The Story of Cinderella\\" had me laughing out loud and the \\"Phone Tree\\" idea is quite brilliant.

His message literally changed the way I was looking at all my relationships. This tape set could change the way you view yourself and how you view the world.<br /><br />After listening to this tape set, I felt more peaceful and finally accepted a variety of concepts I had not fully understood before. Through his teaching, I learned how to incorporate spiritual practice into my everyday life.<br /><br />Henry Grayson is a keen observer of his own experience. He also has a vast knowledge base from which to draw from and he gives creative insights into spiritual concepts I had never heard before. His teachings will make you a creative force for good. He introduces a much more empowering love and encourages you to let go of the Ego's painful and controlling tactics so you can awaken as love.<br /><br />How can giving also be receiving?<br />Can my healing thoughts about others affect them in positive ways?<br />Why are humans attached to their suffering and how can you free yourself?<br />Is there a way to create a dream love relationship with my partner?<br />How can I make perceptual shifts to erase fear?<br /><br />There are sections for meditation and deep breathing where Henry Grayson guides you through the techniques and practice.

Then, changing into water, she sluices and spreads over him.\\" ~Wade Stevenson<br /><br />Wade Stevenson has created a book written by the body's desires, the mind's fascination with language and the soul's deep longings. His work is poetic, profoundly beautiful and eternally spiritual.<br /><br />As a man's desires merge with the mythology of the body, he experiences a completeness that occurs during the merging of souls. His unique connection with words invites the reader deeper into a profoundly spiritual and sensual relaxation into love.<br /><br />A bed breathes with the experience of intimacy as two bodies disappear into sequences of yearning and release. Within each chapter, many experiences bond together to form an ecstatic escape into romantic possession. The lovers are alive together and become the earth, the sky and sea as they merge into oneness in a variety of locations.<br /><br />\\"I want to give you the greatest happiness, she says. The happiness that some men wait all their lives for.\\" ~the woman<br /><br />Throughout the text, the woman of his desire speaks her truth and actively engages his imagination. She is shown in all her moods and moments and magical cuddling and coupling.<br /><br />Read this with your love, or give this book to your partner and see what happens. My husband read this book a few days ago and it deepened our connection substantially. I read it today as the sun was rising and realized I had lived moments in this book because my husband was so inspired. We have been married for ten years and suddenly we are acting \\"in love\\" again.<br /><br />What delighted me most about Wade Stevenson's writing is how close it is to my own experience of love. The water images and metaphors seemed to mirror my own inner imaginings. Like an ancient drum beating in an ancient land, the heartbeat of this book is primal and deep.<br /><br />The story begins in mystery and ends with a moment of fascinating sensuality. I am beyond impressed and want to read everything this author has written and will write. His words are magical and will take your relationship to new depths if you read the book together.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewhis author has written and will write.

Letters for Lizzie explores even deeper struggles as a man's heart makes a transition from wanting a divorce to fighting for his wife's life with every ounce of strength he possesses.<br /><br />Letters for Lizzie is a journey through a spiritual crisis where James O'Donnell is forced to reevaluate his life when Lizzie is diagnosed with advanced breast cancer. Together they travel through sickness and sorrow from Christmas in 1994 to July 2, 1996. While this book is filled with thirteen letters, James O'Donnell also provides a setting for each reading experience.<br /><br />At first you may question James' decision to relocate his family and take a cut in his salary to become a teacher, but as the story unfolds, you start to realize how God works in amazing ways to put you in a place you need to be so you can be loved and nurtured. Not only do they move close to an Advanced Research Center, the community they live in supports them and cares for them through their struggles with frustration, anger and failed expectations.<br /><br />As doctors struggle to keep Lizzie alive, she continues to weaken and yet manages to find the strength to write Letter Eight. Her strength and positive attitude wanes at times and yet even in this dark time she has a deep faith and commitment to God. In her letter she says:<br /><br />I know it has cost each of you dearly to ride this wild roller coaster with us, yet I am convinced that it is your prayers and God's mercy that have carried us through this ordeal so far, and I can't begin to thank you. The best way I know how is to share with you the wonderfully ordinary life we now live, which we no longer take for granted. ~Lizzie<br /><br />Written from a husband's perspective, James O'Donnell deftly describes the destructive qualities of the cancer diagnosis and gives insights into how to fight and how to surrender. I was surprised by the life affirming qualities of this work and how a story of cancer could be one of the most beautiful love stories I've ever read.<br /><br />Tomorrow my father will find out what it will take to fight his cancer and this book has helped me to understand how I should react, what I should say and how my life will change in the coming months and years. Like so many, I never thought cancer would invade my family and just the knowledge of illness causes you to reevaluate your priorities.<br /><br />If you are struggling with the emotional aspects of dealing with a cancer diagnosis or you are in the midst of fighting this disease, this book will bring comfort to your heart. In our world, where uncertainty is certain, this book provides a peaceful knowledge of God's care for us even when we think he has disappeared. James O'Donnell's conclusions are beautiful and he provides insight into troubling conflicts and difficult interpersonal relationships. In the end, kindness is what matters most and our presence in the life of someone who is suffering might be what is truly needed, even if we don't know what to say.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review~Lizzie    Written from a husband's perspective, James O'Donnell deftly describes the destructive qualities of the cancer diagnosis and gives insights into how to fight and how to surrender.

I've always been impressed by his ironing abilities especially if it allows me to sleep a little longer. I loved the chapter on finding the perfect gift, breakfast in bed and grocery shopping, not to mention the recipes for Cr&egrave;me Brûl&eacute;e and making Stir-Fry.<br /><br />I'll agree that men who can cook and clean are very sexy. Just tell a woman you do these things and she will probably forget all other men exist. Imagine how she will be bragging about you to her friends and relatives. There is also a chapter on how to Win Over Her Parents, Enjoy a Chick Flick and Grow the Perfect Lawn. Each task has a difficulty rating and a reward rating.<br /><br />The main concept in this book seems to be about showing a woman you care about making her life a little less stressful and much more romantic. Even the smallest effort will not go unnoticed and I can almost guarantee a woman will be most appreciative and plan romantic situations to reward such kindness. Plus, with all the time she saves not having to iron shirts, imagine the possibilities.<br /><br />Craig Boreth is a truly talented writer who has written for major publications. He also has quite the varied life experience as a landscape architect, chef, electrician and carpenter. He joins the ranks of authors like W. Bruce Cameron, Steven Andrew Guerrero and Mike Dugan who provide humorous insight into the male psyche and also love women and take pride in making a woman's life more enjoyable.<br /><br />I look forward to reading any book Craig Boreth writes because he also completely understands the female psyche and his wit and comedic timing is perfect.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2005-08-09

The main topics include:<br /><br />Insight<br />Balance<br />Resiliency<br />Your Authentic Self<br />Abundance<br />Corporate Soul/Work<br />The Goddess in You<br /><br />Within this beautiful little book you will find solutions for everything from boredom and loneliness to facing destructive patterns in your life. You can find affirmations to manage the daily complexity of your life or create an entire new future by finding out who you truly are and stepping into a new environment.<br /><br />Example of affirmation: \\"Repeating Same Patterns\\"<br /><br />I keep experiencing the same events in my life because I have not learned a lesson at the deep level of the soul. I am committed to changing my behavior, attitude, and negative belief systems. I learn from past mistakes. Life is a self-educational process and I am a perceptive individual. I watch others as they model what I need to learn . I love all my talents as well as my imperfections because that is what makes me the beloved person I am.<br /><br />Most of the affirmations encourage you to look at life in a more positive way and encourage a change in your thinking patterns so you can eventually start to move out of negative patterns of behavior.<br /><br />Lots of the affirmations solve life problems like a crying baby, unemployment, exercise hurdles, lost pets, regrets, insomnia and taking care of aging parents.<br /><br />As you look through this book you will realize how much you have survived in your short time on this earth and that alone can be empowering.<br /><br />Probably the most useful way to use this book is to buy two books. One to keep on your bookshelf for when you want to look up topics and one for cutting out affirmations and posting them around in places where you can read them daily. This book would be perfect as a set of cards. I hope the author will consider that option in the near future. You can make your own cards or laminate various topics. I think some of these affirmations can change your life. It can take years to start thinking differently and sometimes life can be a slow walk out of disempowering situations all while you have your eyes on heaven.<br /><br />If you are looking forward to a more peaceful and positive lifestyle, then this book can help you achieve those dreams.

Some of us simply need affirmation that we are investing our lives exactly as we should be, that we are answering our calling. Some of us need radical change, an overhaul, or an about-face. Some of us are on the edge of a breathtaking new adventure. And some of us aren't sure what God wants for us, but we're eager to know. ~ Nancie Carmichael<br /><br />Nancie Carmichael has created a book filled with elaborations on stories of biblical women who dealt with many of the same issues women deal with today. She illustrates her thoughts with quotes from famous authors and stories from her own life.<br /><br />If you have read the story of the Woman at the Well, it is a profound story of love and acceptance. She also develops ideas around the story of Mary and Martha, The Ten Virgins, Proverbs 31 Woman and Esther. While telling the story of Rahab she shows how a woman redeems herself and goes on to be an important part of religious history. It is a brilliant example of how one action can change the world.<br /><br />In the story of Naomi we learn to let go of destructive emotions. \\"Ask yourself, What am I clinging to that I need to let go? We can't live effective lives when we're loaded down with things of the past: bitterness, what-ifs, fears, regrets.\\"<br /><br />Throughout the text you will find questions for discussion, which would make this a good study guide for women of the Bible. There are also payers in each chapter for reflection and healing.<br /><br />I think if you find this book it is essential to your life and it will bring you greater peace and happiness. If you are struggling in a difficult marriage, there are ideas for taking responsibility for your marriage even though she does say: \\"God has not created you as the parent of your spouse; he has created you as the partner of your spouse.\\"<br /><br />The quotes in this book are especially healing and the message is one of hope and refreshment for weary souls.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2005-07-18

Love presents a fun little book about cat care from a very caring perspective. If you think of your cats as members of the family, then this will show you how to baby and pamper your pet cats, those most deserving members of the family.<br /><br />Some of the great advice includes tips for making your house safe for pets and how to bring a new kitten into your home or how to write a poem for your cat.<br /><br />\\"Cats also love it when you purr at them. It's a way to bond in cat-speak.\\"<br /><br />It has taken our older cat five months to get used to the new kitten and this weekend she finally is purring again when I pet her. Introducing a new cat into the family can be a little traumatic and I realized that a male and female cat adapt more easily than two females. Cats can be quite jealous and it can take time for them to adapt.<br /><br />I thought it was strange to read about applying suntan lotion to a cat, but after further research there are some natural solutions. I think if you choose a cat with darker fur and you have indoor cats, you won't have to worry about this.<br /><br />This book also has lots of humor, a list of Ten Cat-mandments and advice like:<br /><br />\\"Don't get angry if your kitty walks over the newly washed floor. Paw prints can actually be an attractive design element.\\"<br /><br />I knew I had officially lost it when I didn't want to wash a paw print off a window.

If so, you may be suffering from spiritual bankruptcy...While we can't ever free ourselves fully from all of life's demands, we can discover a sense of balance in our lives. Or we can identify ways to shift between the two extremes - finding a time and a place in our lives for contemplation, and then alternating that with other times of busyness and distraction.\\" ~Deborah Taylor-Hough<br /><br />In order to simplify her life, Deborah Taylor-Hough had to rethink her entire lifestyle. With five children and medical bills that loomed over her, she made some tough decisions that required her to put away her pride and look more realistically at how she intended to survive. Her courage is inspirational and the decisions she made showed that her priorities were her family and her commitment to her belief system.<br /><br />If you are dealing with a lack of meaning even with great wealth or societal emptiness despite an elegant lifestyle, this book takes a look at survival on the edge of bankruptcy and a search for contentment in a less than materialistic lifestyle.<br /><br />If you long for a life of contentment, it may be a life of simplified choices and a life where family becomes more important than keeping up with every other family on the block.<br /><br />While this isn't as far as building your own house or \\"Walden Pond,\\" it is a realistic view of life and how to avoid falling into debt by taking practical and necessary actions like avoiding the temptations at malls or not watching certain channels on TV.<br /><br />Deborah Taylor-Hough is a beautiful soul who has written a very practical guide for women who want to find a new balance in their lives. She also gives advice about tripling many recipes and freezing meals for the future (see her cookbooks), like before you give birth to a baby or know you are going to go through a time of stress. There are also recipes for making your own instant coffee mixes and homemade dry onion soup mix. Now I know why one house had closets that were scented with cloves - it keeps away moths.<br /><br />If you have children you may enjoy the recipes for craft dough, soap crayons and homemade paper crafts. If you want to refresh your laundry or even make your own laundry soap, this author has the recipes. I have used her recipe for Spa Milk Bath, but I also use essential oils. I found that sea salt is relatively inexpensive at a health food store and even the addition of oatmeal in a cheesecloth bag and buttermilk can make a completely wonderful spa experience.<br /><br />This book encourages you to be happier with less possessions and more quality family time. When you remember your childhood, what are the happy things you remember? I remember running around barefoot, swimming in African rivers and eating lemon meringue pie. I didn't care about the size of our house or the clothes I wore. I remembered the freedom to enjoy life and how my mother taught me to make strawberry jam.<br /><br />Other great ideas:<br /><br />Family cookbooks<br />Debt proofing your holidays<br />Winter picnics<br /><br />I loved this idea because it reinforces the ideas that happiness has nothing to do with how much money you earn and it has everything to do with being creative and maximizing the talents you have and rearranging your priorities.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewtant coffee mixes and homemade dry onion soup mix.

I remembered the freedom to enjoy life and how my mother taught me to make strawberry jam.     Other great ideas:     Family cookbooks  Debt proofing your holidays  Winter picnics    I loved this idea because it reinforces the ideas that happiness has nothing to do with how much money you earn and it has everything to do with being creative and maximizing the talents you have and rearranging your priorities.     ~The Rebecca Review	2005-07-18

Many students encounter the study of rhetoric in public speaking classes where they are focusing on preparing their own speeches. They learn to make clear presentations, logical arguments and how to perfect their delivery techniques. By studying rhetoric, it is possible to develop individual communication skills.<br /><br />In selecting the speeches for this volume, the editors were guided by a commitment to the Isocratean perspective and have attempted to bring together instances of rhetorical practices which represent the height of rhetorical culture.<br /><br />The first set of speeches have important implications for contemporary American society as the genetic foundation of rhetorical culture. This section offers speeches drawn from the Greek, Roman, and Judeo-Christian rhetorical traditions. They include:<br /><br />Oratory in Classical Antiquity: Pericles (Funeral Oration), Gorgias of Leontini (Encomium on Helen), Lysias (Against Eratosthenes), Demosthenes (The Second Philippic), Marcus Tullius Cicero (the First Catilinarian), Moses (The Decalogue), Jesus of Nazareth (Sermon On The Mount) and St. Augustine (Sermon on The Lord's Prayer).<br /><br />In Pericles's Funeral Oration, there is an expression of ideological principles like \\"the good of the many vs. the good of the one,\\" that are as important today as they were in the fourth century B.C.E. These speeches also help students to develop a critical , historical perspective on the thetorical foundations of contemporary society than it has to do with understanding the cultures of classical antiquity.<br /><br />The second set of speeches come from the Golden Age of Oratory and these speeches deal with individual freedom. They include speeches by:<br /><br />Martin Luther (I'll Take My Stand), Peter Wentworth (On the Liberties of Commons), Queen Elizabeth I (To the Troops at Tilbury & The Golden Speech), Jonathan Edwards (Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God), James Otis (Writs of Assistance), William Pitt (The Right of Taxing America), Edmund Burke (Two Speeches to the Electors at Bristol), John Hancock (The Bostom Massacre Oration), Patrick Henry (Liberty or Death), George Washington (First Inaugural Address), Thomas Jefferson (First Inaugural Address), Sagoyewatha (Speech to the Council of Chiefs of the Six Nations), Daniel Webster (Bunker Hill Memorial Oration), Maria W.

Memorology is a new field of research that studies how powerful forces of interference known as Memory Busters can muddle up your mind and lead to varying degrees of brain blockage and a condition of absentmindedness known as \\"the memory lapse.\\"<br /><br />It took me years to learn to put my keys in the same place, every single time. Now I also park my car in the same place when I go to the same stores. I used to lose my keys and my car on a regular basis. (Most annoying when you have to be back to work after a lunch break and shopping at the mall.)<br /><br />Only through a conscious decision to change my habits did I learn to stop being such a dreamer (when it wasn't practical) and to start being more practical (living life instead of wandering in a dreamy absentminded haze). It helps when you are not working three jobs at a time to get through college. Who had time to keep a journal?<br /><br />Memorology 101 teaches you to improve your memory through conscious effort. You may have information overload or developed unhealthy habits. Maybe you are just stressed out or in the midst of depression. There are so many reasons why people have memory lapses.<br /><br />Joan Houlihan and Adam Rosenbaum unearth the causes of memory loss and explain how you can \\"remember not to forget.\\"<br /><br />Main Subjects:<br /><br />Three Types of Memory<br />Sensory Memory<br />Short-Term Memory<br />Long-Term Memory<br />Why we Forget<br />Remembering Names<br />Healthy Habits<br />Brain Food<br />The Importance of Sleep<br />Warning Signs<br /><br />When I find myself in a real slump, I also take Emer'gen C LITE in some juice. It really wakes up my brain in the afternoon. One of the most freeing things I've done in my life is just to allow myself not to remember everything. If I can't remember something, I just blame it on hitting my head in a car accident. Strangely enough, my grades at college improved substantially after that incident.<br /><br />Things that help me on a daily basis (some of these ideas are mentioned in this book):<br /><br />Keeping a running list of things I need to buy. I write things down immediately when I think of them.<br /><br />Keeping a journal - to remember quotes, life changes, times and dates.<br /><br />Getting Organized in a major way - If I can't remember where everything is in my house, I go through cupboards and drawers and clean out things and reorganize. This book suggests starting with cleaning up a desk. Getting your file cabinet organized is a big challenge. I allow myself one drawer of complete clutter and one file cabinet drawer of complete chaos. Gives a girl something to organize on a rainy day.<br /><br />Reading more books instead of zoning out in front of the TV - this helps me to remember the past through the experience of others.

I remember finding one of his books when I was just out of college and even at that point, I was not ready for his message and didn't complete the reading of what I then considered to be a very complex read. I was in emotional turmoil, having just ended a serious five-year relationship. I had no idea how to overcome such pain and confusion. I felt completely powerless.<br /><br />Anthony Robbins is a powerful influence if you even take five main points and start to apply them to your life. I had to walk my way out of hell, but I know now that it was the daily decisions and empowering actions that took me from complete heartache to wanting to live again.<br /><br />Anthony Robbins sees himself as an integral part of other people's success and this attitude challenges me on the highest level. He can take you from wherever you are now to wherever you would rather be. He teaches you how to work with pain and pleasure so you can reward yourself for success in any area of your life. This CD also introduces you to Neuro Associative Conditioning (NAC). You learn to break negative patterns and to choose a new pattern of behavior. This can help you in weight loss, getting on with your life after serious heartache (emotional trauma), overcoming procrastination, overcoming depression, ending bad habits and escaping from addictions. You could stop smoking, get out of a bad relationship, change jobs and produce any result you want in your life.<br /><br />This is truly a great introduction to awaken you to change. If you are experiencing more pain when you think of taking action, Anthony Robbins can help you think through emotional roadblocks so you can take pleasure in your success. You will learn how to change disempowering associations and associate pleasure with new action.<br /><br />Anthony's message can help you take immediate control of your life. If you listen to this message and take it very seriously, watch out...your life is going to be different. Be patient with yourself and start to focus on what you truly want and magically your life will start to change. There are some great examples of perpetual persistence that blew me away. Even one example of success could teach you an eternal principle. So many successful people have crawled their way out of complete disaster and they just kept going and never gave up.<br /><br />Destroy walls holding you back<br />Awaken the power to change your life<br />Understand how your mind, body and emotions work<br />Start living your dream<br /><br />If you need a quick refresher course, this CD is perfect and the message will help you get back on track.

She is also inspired by rivers and Lake Superior as she describes grief, wonder, joy and yearning.<br /><br />The first few poems are almost an introduction to her style, but I wasn't fully captured until I read Inflorescence: Fennel. In this poem she describes cooking with fennel and I had just mixed up a spice mixture with fennel seeds. While she is cooking with the fennel root, I still had a sense of the licorice flavor permeating the flavor of the fish. She describes the aroma as a prayer rising through the rainbow trout's flesh. I though the prayer image was beautiful and gave the poem a sense of reverence. Anyone who loves to cook will relate to the images in this poem.<br /><br />Hiking Near Paradise was a real delight and will be for anyone who found a field mouse as a child. The Sound of a Mother Scolding Her Grown Daughter presents a scene from Orcas Island. The island is mysterious and Patricia Clark truly captures a contrasting moment in a very peaceful location. Here she feels vulnerable, longing for her mother's appreciation and understanding. She finds herself \\"ghostly,\\" pretending to read a map while crying. \\"I'm hunched over, trying to stop my hands / from shaking, doing what I can to wash the taste / of her words from my mouth.\\"<br /><br />\\"Missing\\" was the moment where I found myself crying. I read this poem three times in a row because the feelings are quite conflicted and Patricia Clark captures a moment of time where you can no longer move forward because the past is too strong and will not yet release you. As the river moves forward, Patricia is left wondering how she can even go to the riverbank, where such a tragedy has occurred. The images are of a river moving forward and a woman caught in the whirlpool of her own emotions, in total conflict.<br /><br />One of my favorite poems is the mysterious: Spirit Bundle. Here we find the poet at Lake Superior, crafting a container made from birch-bark curls and rugosa rose petals. She seems to be taking all her feelings and sending them off into the watery depths. Each object she uses to craft the small vessel seems to symbolize a part of her she is releasing into the unknown.<br /><br />\\"Then I laid it down - the baby ache, the grief<br />in the night, the hard knot wrestled free<br />from my chest.\\"<br /><br />To me, \\"Grove\\" symbolize all the longings a woman can have to be one with nature or to  return to the imaginative world of her childhood.<br /><br />\\"on a blanket dappled by clouds, reverting<br />to childhood, or dream of last fall<br />ankle deep in leaves, when I envisioned<br /><br />a dress knitted together from the delta shapes<br />of cottonwood leaves. Wearing it, I'd be<br />the trunk of a swaying thing, half-tree,<br /><br />half-woman, leaf color changing day-today,<br />mood-to-mood, river stories of the past<br />soaking into me...\\"<br /><br />Throughout the poems there is a theme of life well lived amongst the inevitable and momentary conclusions of existence. In the few poems where Patricia Clark feels deep tragedy, we feel deeply too. When she soars in the beauty of nature, we cannot help but follow her into her bliss. If you have lived in the Pacific Northwest, then you will feel the chill of a dank rainy day, take pleasure in the peaceful images of lakes and understand all to well, the danger of rivers.<br /><br />I would like to say that this book inspired me to write a poem. As I turned the pages, I felt a poem emerging. It was rather magical, to feel so inspired. It was as if Patricia Clark's depth of emotion awoke my own sense of longing.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewom birch-bark curls and rugosa rose petals.

It emerged that these horrific incidents were committed almost exclusively by victims of teasing and bullying....schools nationwide have been adopting anti-bullying programs and regulations.\\" ~Izzy Kalman<br /><br />Izzy Kalman is a school psychologist who has developed methods children can use to ward off aggression. He teaches children how to solve problems and explains the dynamics of bullying. Should you turn the other cheek or learn about the secrets of human nature and use them to your advantage?<br /><br />This book will teach children how to deal with issues like name-calling, physical attacks, vicious rumors, being excluded from cliques, insults and Internet bullying. You will learn the smart way to say \\"NO\\" and learn how to use humor to your best advantage.<br /><br />Izzy Kalman presents interesting facts about problems animals develop in captivity and how they are similar to human behavior patterns in regards to aggression and violence.<br /><br />\\"The worst bullying of all actually takes place within families. Children and parents bully each other...husbands and wives bully each other too...\\"<br /><br />So, if you must deal with bullying for the rest of your life, how do you stop your tormentors in their tracks? Izzy Kalman has a plan and if you follow his simple suggestions, you can take back your power. He shows children how to go from being a victim to an active participant in their healing. He shows you how much people hate to feel stupid and how being in control of your emotions makes you more powerful. If you don't get angry, you can make people back off more quickly.<br /><br />\\"Remember the three things bullies want: Power, respect and popularity.\\"<br /><br />This book shows you what bullies want, how they test you by bullying you and why you should refuse to get angry. When you keep your sense of humor and view people who bully as fearful individuals, it is easier to show compassion. All of the individuals who have tried to bully me have been very unhappy people and when I showed understanding they wanted to be my best friend. By being kind to people who hate you, you can actually make your own life more pleasant.<br /><br />Bullies to Buddies is written for children, but this book will be helpful for all ages because it goes to the root of the problem and pulls out the weeds. This book should be in every library and on every teacher's must-read list. Too many children are in emotional pain and this book could help to solve many societal problems in their infancy.

If you love visiting Seattle & Portland or you are a Vegetarian looking for an excellent dining guide, this should impress you. The size of this book makes it easy to keep in your backpack, purse or car.<br /><br />The Restaurants are found in Seattle, Bellingham, Olympia, Tacoma, Portland and Eugene. There are listings for Tea Houses, Juice Bars, Farmers Markets and Green Grocers. You could enjoy tea in a Chinese Temple, visit a fun PCC Natural Market (my personal favorite for natural foods and organic products) or sample Mulitethnic cuisines at many interesting locations. They even list Larry's Markets where I used to work.<br /><br />Some of the highlights:<br /><br />The Elliot Bay Caf&eacute; - Try a Veggie Reuben in the caf&eacute; in the basement of the famous Elliot Bay Books in Seattle.<br /><br />Shalimar - Exotic foods like Mulligatawny Stew or dishes with eggplant, mango and lotus stems.<br /><br />Persian House - Pomegranate sauces and lentil dishes and they have a nice buffet lunch at a very reasonable price.<br /><br />George Stevenson's creative writing style is refreshing and honest.

Noah also has a beautiful spirit and can be found counting insects as the two adorable Jackrabbits \\"with big friendly eyes\\" look curiously at the butterflies.<br /><br />I love the picture of Noah wrapped in a quilt and walking around in the rain with an umbrella. U is for umbrella and Q for quilt.<br /><br />The interior of the ship is also shown. We find \\"T is for Turtles, safe in their shells\\" and \\"M is for mice.\\" Noah is feeing them a bit of cheese.<br /><br />The last few pages show all the animals leaving and walking to a new home. There is a pastel rainbow and children will feel the excitement of the animals starting a new life as the Ark sits on dry land.<br /><br />The humorous rhyming text by Michael and Colleen helps children learn the alphabet and could also help them learn to write poetry.

Check every corner and dark place, make lots of noise, and then really chase them out of the child's room, down the hall and out the door. Don't forget to slam it closed.\\" ~MyLinda Butterworth<br /><br />Nicole is frightened of the dark and has a great imagination. She is terribly afraid of all the monsters crawling out from under her bed. Her mother buys a nightlight, but after the lights are turned out, Nicole notices that some of the clothes on the floor look scary. Are they clothes or monsters?<br /><br />MyLinda Butterworth is a professional storyteller and loves to visit schools, libraries, festivals and bookstores. She is also the author of \\"Frogazoom.\\" I love her writing style and here is an example:<br /><br />\\"Carefully she peeked out from under her covers to see if they had gone, but there were even more of them. They were opening doors and slinking out from under her bed. Even her toys were dancing.\\"<br /><br />One night Nicole's grandma and grandfather arrive for a visit. Nicole goes to bed but later cries about monsters being in her bedroom. Her grandfather tells her they can get rid of the monsters and then proceeds to yell: \\"Any monsters under the bed, you better get out!\\" Soon Nicole joins in and helps to chase the monsters out the door. Soon Nicole is happily asleep in a room full of love.<br /><br />I remember still being afraid of the dark in my 20s, so I can completely understand the fear of the dark especially after watching a scary movie. Now I see night as even more beautiful than the day and actually enjoy walking around my house with the lights off because it is so peaceful as the moonlight filters through the windows.<br /><br />Most children do experience a fear of the dark or a fear of monsters in a closet. Let us not even talk about monsters under the bed or why I now have a bed that is flat on the floor. For my entire life, since I can remember I used to walk near a bed and imagine someone reaching out and grabbing my ankle. This must have resulted from some childhood incident and may have involved my naughty younger brother.<br /><br />Matthew Mercer's art fills the pages with beautiful creative interpretations of monsters and little Nicole. The picture of her in the room filled with monsters is not overly frightening and may even make children giggle. He worked at Disney as a caricature artist and almost made me feel sorry for the poor little monsters that had to leave the house.<br /><br />A Delightful and Comforting story that will help children fall asleep faster, especially if you chase the monsters out too.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewom some childhood incident and may have involved my naughty younger brother.

One day you might make Grilled Sirloin Tips with Mushrooms and the next you might make an Ice Cream Cookie Desert.<br /><br />The recipes are all family friendly and easy to prepare.

Most of the recipes seem to have a prep time of around 15 minutes and you can have dinner on the table within the hour.<br /><br />Penny E. Stone also includes fun activities for kids, kitchen trivia and smart shopping tips like adding a pat of butter to boiling water when cooking potatoes to keep the water from foaming up. That is worth the price of the book!

Girls will love the idea of a little girl in a swimsuit who pretends to be a mermaid swimming in the sea. There are pictures of combs and brushes. The mermaid uses these to comb her hair and then she puts on a shell necklace and makes a wish.<br /><br />The pages are easy for toddlers to turn. There is a shell cutout in the middle of all the pages and the last page has a sparkly blue fish surprise. You can see the sparkly color through the shell cutouts. The blue sparkly theme appears on the mermaid's scales, in bubbles and in the hair bows.<br /><br />Sparkly Mermaid is a beautiful book for little girls who dream of going to the sea or just love to dress up in sparkly costumes.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2005-06-23

It certainly changed me forever...something stood still in my soul, and I started to attend. ~D.H. Lawrence<br /><br />Of all the places I've visited in America, New Mexico is where I felt closest to the earth. The heat radiating from the earth as you walk free and barefoot contrasts with a sudden hailstorm where you have to find shelter.<br /><br />Christina Nealson delves into this land of mystery and intrigues with her stories of places with great cultural significance. If you are a fan of D.H. Lawrence's writing, then you may want to visit the D.H. Lawrence Memorial in San Cristobal. Apparently Lawrence's ashes are in the walls of the shrine because his wife Frieda threw them into the concrete mix.<br /><br />Each listing has detailed information:<br /><br />Location<br />Description<br />Spiritual Significance<br />Solitude Rating<br />How to get there<br />Accessibility from highway<br />Facilities<br />Fee Area<br /><br />There are 111 full-color photographs, 6 maps of New Mexico regions and color-coded tabs on the pages for easy reference. There is a list of Native American Feast Days and a Historical Time Line of New Mexico.<br /><br />Picturesque churches, mineral spring resorts, tree shrines, white deserts, petroglyph sites, snowy mountains and Navajo hogans make this land a choice location for spiritual renewal. If you are planning a trip to New Mexico, then this guide will give you ideas for day trips and places to stay. The solitude ratings are helpful if you are looking for quiet locations.<br /><br />Places I thought looked fascinating and a few quotes from this book:<br /><br />Monastery of Christ in the Desert: \\"How long has it been since you've heard live Gregorian Chant?<br /><br />White Sands National Monument, Alkali Flat Trail: \\"My brain said snow, snow, until I stepped from my air-conditioned car into the piercing heat and the immensity of a million great dunes.\\"<br /><br />Casitas de Gila: \\"A short walk down the bluff puts you next to the stream, where a hammock invites you to dawdle.\\"<br /><br />Of all the books I've read about traveling, this one makes me wish I was a travel writer, wandering through untamed lands. Christina Nealson's writing style is comforting and her knowledge of this area shows her love of travel and her deep appreciation for the need to find a sacred sanctuary where you can relax and heal.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewre a hammock invites you to dawdle.\\"     Of all the books I've read about traveling, this one makes me wish I was a travel writer, wandering through untamed lands.

And Other Lies That Are True	Books	5	7	12	N	N	Passionately Honest	\\"Ultimately, the forces outside of us have little significance other than being a distraction. If men look to an illusionary outside world for answers, we will continue to get illusionary answers. There are challenges we need to face, alone in the dark, to learn to channel our strengths.\\" ~Mike Dugan<br /><br />Mike Dugan reveals all the challenges he faced in the past and how he thought his way into an intimate and fulfilling relationship by taking an honest look at male sexuality. He takes on the lone wolf, the dragon and the problems of antisocial behavior.<br /><br />\\"Men Fake Foreplay\\" is an honest look at male sexuality. This book will not only lead men to deeply fulfilling and profound spiritual moments, women will find the insights and understanding to be intellectually satisfying and emotionally fulfilling. It is rare for a wildly funny book to also steal my heart.<br /><br />Mike Dugan succeeds where many fear to even begin. There is insight into why women don't want you to change who you are, but instead want you to become more aware of who you are. He asks: \\"Where are the gentlemen?\\"<br /><br />Though a variety of intellectually intriguing examples, Mike Dugan shows the need for male role models in our society. I loved the story of the elephants and his comments about defeating inner dragons. This book is not just an analysis of the male/female connection; it is more an analysis of how men connect with their deepest self. Mike Dugan reveals how a boy becomes a man and explores the choices a man makes once he takes on the responsibility of caring for the women in his life.<br /><br />There is a deep, penetrating intimacy throughout this work. While this book is also wildly funny, I laughed my way right into an understanding of some profound male wisdom. One of the best lines in this book: \\"A man's power should be wielded compassionately.\\" Like a true comedian, he entertains you with a few jokes and then once he has your attention and respect, there is a place to discuss communication, feelings and sexual ethics.<br /><br />It took me a few minutes to get through the last two pages. I couldn't see the words. This is what I wanted from all the men in my life. I want to feel safe and nurtured. I want there to be safe places in my life where I'm loved as a soul.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewlings and sexual ethics.     It took me a few minutes to get through the last two pages.

If you love to cook with herbs and have the desire to learn more about planting herbs and using them to create aromatic dishes, then Basil to Thyme will give you many ideas for summer meals and winter feasts. Tim and Jan have included herbal lore and historical facts. They also give excellent advice on what to plant where. After reading this book I realized I needed to plant certain herbs together for the best results.<br /><br />Chapters 5-19 are dedicated to individual herbs. Each chapter begins with an introduction and planting advice. I learned about planting a border of marigolds around an herb garden to discourage pests or why you should never plant potatoes next to cucumbers. Apparently you should always plant sage and rosemary together. If you want to attract butterflies, then a very common herb can be planted.<br /><br />There is a section on container gardening and my herbs are now happily growing in terra-cotta pots from Italy. Collecting your own herbs is immensely satisfying and takes the hassle out of cooking with fresh herbs. Once you have the herbs planted, you don't have to put lists of fresh herbs on your shopping list.<br /><br />Another benefit is that the herbs are always fresh and they accessible for spontaneous cooking adventures. Instead of using dried basil, you may find yourself collecting fresh aromatic leaves from your garden. You can buy a bay tree for bay leaves.<br /><br />If you love tomato soup, there are many variations in this cookbook. The recipes that looked the most interesting:<br /><br />Tomato Bisque<br />Dill and Potato Salad<br />Olive Paste<br />Cucumber-Lime Salsa<br />Chive Herb Butter<br />Garlic Stir Fry<br />Ginger and Pear Muffins<br />Fresh Ginger Ale<br />Shrimp with Feta Cheese<br />Chicken Manicotti with Roasted Red Bell Pepper Sauce<br /><br />The recipes in Basil to Thyme encourage you to cook with your own herbs, but most of the herbs used in this book are readily available in your local grocery store. Even if you only have a very small space to grow herbs, it is possible to have a beautiful little herb garden that is sure to bring you a sense of comfort. If you have cats who enjoy chewing on herbs, plant them in the top of a two-tiered planter. That was my most recent solution and my cats seem to be ignoring the herbs and focusing more on the plants in the lower section.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewiful little herb garden that is sure to bring you a sense of comfort.

Robert S. Wayne, also the author of Venice in Context, knows all the secrets and introduces you to historically significant locations, complete with historical facts.<br /><br />Joel Godard is the perfect guide and he narrates the entire journey. He \\"literally\\" guides you through London in a step-by-step fashion. I just listened to this for the first time and I feel like I've been in London exploring Westminster Abbey and peering through the gates of Buckingham Palace. I started to feel homesick for comforting foods like fish and chips with vinegar and meat pies. When I was there as a teenager, London was fascinating, but no one was there to tell me what I was viewing.<br /><br />Tour One: Westminster Bridge, Big Ben, Houses of Parliament and Winston Churchill's statue - interesting information about why pigeons don't like landing on his statue.<br /><br />Tour Two: Westminster Hall, Oliver Cromwell, Richard I, Old Palace yard, Victoria Tower and Gardens, Emmeline Pankhurst<br /><br />Tour Three: George V, Henry VIII Chapel, Chapter House, Jewel Tower<br /><br />Tour Four: St. Margaret's Church, Westminster Abbey<br /><br />Tour Five: Westminster Abbey, Broad Sanctuary<br /><br />Tour Six: Cabinet War Rooms, Robert Clive, Cenotaph, 10 Downing Street<br /><br />Tour Seven: Horse Guards Parade, Banqueting House, Great Scotland Yard, Old Admiralty<br /><br />Tour Eight: Charles I, Trafalgar Square, Nelson's Column, George IV, Church of St. Martin-in-the-fields<br /><br />Tour Nine: Piccadilly Circus, Eros, Church of St. James's, Jermyn Street, Fortnum & Mason, Royal Academy of Arts, Burlington Arcade<br /><br />Tour Ten: Ste. James's Street, St. James's Palace, Pall Mall, Queen's Chapel, Queen Alexandra Memorial, Friary Court<br /><br />Tour Eleven: St. James's Park<br /><br />Tour Twelve: Buckingham Palace, Queen Victoria Monument<br /><br />On the inside front cover there is a map of the tour area. In the back cover, there is a clear envelope for the CDs. So, you could take this book with you and carry it around while you are on the tour. The pictures help you locate various historic monuments and buildings. The tours only take up a third of the book. The rest of the book is dedicated to history, royal palaces and fortresses and getting around London (on foot or with public transportation like the Tube).<br /><br />If you want to take a sightseeing bus, that is always an option. There are ideas about taking a river cruise or information on why you should stop in and see St. Margaret's Church and not just head straight to the Westminster Abbey.<br /><br />While this is a book for the Independent Traveler, I don't see why you couldn't buy two or more and take a walking tour with friends and family. You can then listen to this CD later to recreate your entire London tour. After listening to both CDs, I wish I was going to London with my mom in September. She is going to love this book and she will have an entire month to explore!<br /><br />Even if you don't plan to leave for London right away, this Book/CD set is perfect for when you are sitting out in the sun or cooking or doing just about anything that involves wishing you were traveling in Europe. Royal London in Context is the perfect gift for friends and family.

Tony Evans speaks about the biblical concept of agape love and shows that biblical loves is an act of the will. Meeting a woman's needs becomes a first priority.<br /><br />He doesn't discuss the male/female energies in each person; instead he focuses on women being responders and men being spiritual leaders. If you are following biblical principles in your life then this book is a summary of how a man should treat his wife.<br /><br />Tony Evans also believes in marrying and then dating your spouse to keep the romance alive.

It is fascinating to think that you can make nourishing items by letting things decay. I will never look at raking leaves in the same way again. My father was an excellent gardener when we lived in Africa and I observed the way he made compost piles and nourished the dry sandy soil. Soon, we had lovely vegetables and were happily enjoying fried squash blossoms and other such gourmet luxuries.<br /><br />When I was a child, the garden was were I was the happiest, getting lost amongst the corn, shelling peas on the back steps and digging up carrots to see if they were ready to eat. If you are trying to recreate some childhood memories or even just create a beautiful space to eat breakfast, this book has many ideas. This book gave me a lot of ideas, but now I'm going to have to think about moving because there is an \\"secret garden\\" idea in this book on page 77 that will need more than a deck!<br /><br />What I miss most about my childhood home, is the scent of the soil and the fresh peaches we used to pick to make ice cream. The authors also discuss fruit trees, growing strawberries and those types of delicious topics.<br /><br />If you have cats and have wanted to grow an herb garden, a two-tiered plant stand works very well.

What can you pass on?\\" ~Nancy J. Nordenson<br /><br />Nancy J. Nordenson draws on her own inner wisdom to solve issues in her own life. She also loves to read, as is evidenced by the many books she mentions. She quotes Jane Austen, Viginia Woolf, Gustave Flaubert, Dodie Smith and many others. She also includes passages from the Psalms.<br /><br />\\"Giving written form to thoughts is a concrete way of paying attention to them. It is also a way to untangle and expand them. Sometimes anchoring and examining thoughts through writing is the only way we can discover what we really do think and feel about a subject.\\" ~Nancy J. Nordenson<br /><br />I enjoyed Nancy's insightful approach and her wisdom is encouraging. If you feel trapped in everyday responsibilities, this book will give you many ideas for escaping the chaos and for finding a peaceful retreat. Here are the main topics:<br /><br />A Mind for Life - God, Integrity, Abundance, Powerful Thoughts.<br /><br />The Needed Balance of Faith and Reason/Heart and Mind<br /><br />Forward Movement - What's Next?<br /><br />Breadth of Life, Fullness of Thought - The well-stocked mind, books by your bed<br /><br />Accommodations for Thought - Solitude, A Season for Everything<br /><br />Mental Readiness - Captured on Paper, Preference for Knowledge<br /><br />Befogged - Clarity, Melancholy, Boredom<br /><br />Self-Knowledge - A Student of your own life<br /><br />Truth - A Sometimes Skeptic<br /><br />Questions and Answers - Unexpected Discovery<br /><br />Stretch and Strain - Simple/Complex<br /><br />Lifelong Learning - The Round Table of Counsel<br /><br />Rhythm: Work and Rest<br /><br />Action - Choose the Way<br /><br />The Pursuit of Wisdom<br /><br />I liked her ideas about distraction being the enemy of sustained productive work. She notes: \\"physical separation from distraction is the first line of defense...\\" That would work if my new kitten would decide if she wants to be inside the house or outside on the deck, for I do believe I can hear her meowing for both while I'm trying to write. She reminds me of my own nature, sometimes I want to be reading and doing everything else at the same time.<br /><br />This entire book basically is encouraging women to become more fully active in their intellectual lives and not to ignore their need to be entranced by a delicious book. She also focuses on a woman's spiritual development and draws much of her inspiration from books she has read, her own wisdom and biblical stories and principles.<br /><br />Just Think is amusingly enough a book that makes you think about what you want to think about in the near future.

Each profile of a legendary artist explores the influences and career highlights.<br /><br />To make this book come alive, listen to the songs at rhapsody online (you can look up entire albums or individual songs and also look up artists featured with the guitars to find out how they sound) while you read through the book. Just reading about Jeff Beck's guitar playing is interesting, but until you really hear him play, his style will remain a mystery.<br /><br />The first time I really started paying attention to guitars was when Prince played Live at the Aladdin in Las Vegas.  He should be in this book, for sure!<br /><br />Artists featured: Eric Clapton, Jon Greenwood, George Harrison, Pat Metheny, Django Reinhardt, Joe Satriani (Is there Love in Space? - Completely impressed me with his unique style.) and many other famous guitar players like Richard Thompson and Andres Segovia (classical guitar). Baden Powell was a real find because I love his romantic style and his music is perfect for the evenings when you want to relax.<br /><br />This relatively quick read if you just want to know about the main artists (unless you read this while online and look up the songs). This book will introduce you to a variety of guitar players and styles you may not even have considered were possible.<br /><br />Then, if you refer back to this book while playing, you can learn about melodies, riffs, etc. There is also a chord dictionary and an abundance of advice and technical support throughout the second half of the book.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you are learning to play the guitar or just have an insatiable appetite for information. If you don't own a guitar, buying this book will encourage a purchase. The History of the Guitar section will show you how guitars have evolved since the 1500s. I was very intrigued by all the guitars, especially the blue floral pattern on the Ibanex Jem. Steve Vai is a little wild for my tastes but I love the way he plays in \\"Lotus Feet\\" from his Real Illusions: Reflections album.<br /><br />This book will open up your guitar world!

Have you ever wondered how to make those preserved lemons? There is a recipe with simple ingredients like sea salt, cinnamon, cloves, garlic and olive oil. Once the lemons are preserved, you store them in oil for six months to a year. The Preserved Lemon Butter Sauce calls for 1 tablespoon chopped preserved lemons. This sauce can be served over salmon.<br /><br />One of the most intriguing recipes is for the El Farol Pincho Spice Mix that makes use of all sorts of spices and herbs I've never blended together before like, smoked paprika and oregano. You rub the unique spices on anything you can grill.<br /><br />If you love blue cheese, you may want to try to find \\"Cabrales.\\" Most of the recipes do use readily available ingredients although you may have to hunt for saffron in your grocery store or order it online.<br /><br />Recipes you may enjoy:<br /><br />Lemon-Rosemary Flan - the El Farol's biggest-selling dessert<br /><br />Marscarpone-Stuffed Figs and Dates - sprinkled with pistachios and arranged with orange slices.<br /><br />Grilled Artichokes in Saffron Butter<br /><br />Beef Empanadas - a masa harina/flour based dough filled with spicy turkey filling.<br /><br />Grilled Artichokes in Saffron Butter - one of the most popular tapas (small, savory Spanish dishes)<br /><br />The picture in this book that made me terribly hungry was the Ensalada de Uvas con Queso.

It is one of those books you'd like to jump into and I'm sure this cookbook has inspired many visits to San Diego, CA or the closest spa that could be found.<br /><br />Recipes you might find intriguing:<br /><br />Miso Soup with Tofu, Scallions and Enoki Mushrooms<br />Vegetable, Chicken and Barley Soup<br />Cabbage Hand Rolls with Gingered Wild Rice<br /><br />Apple Spice Muffins - Chef Michel Stroot uses applesauce and yogurt in place of butter and oil and also uses wheat flour and rolled oats.<br /><br />Curried Leg of Lamb with Currants, Mango and Deborah's Basmati Rice<br />Broiled Lamb Chops with Whole-Grain Mustard and Belgian Root Vegetable Mash<br />Seared Duck Breast with Cherry Sauce and Butternut Squash-Orange Risotto<br /><br />Each recipe is well organized with the ingredients listed in the order they are used. If you need to make a chicken stock, the page number is given for easy reference.<br /><br />The chicken stock recipe in this book is almost exactly how I've been making chicken stock since forever except now I've been using a leftover rotisserie chicken and the results seem to be about the same, if not more delicious. It works and it beats any stock paste mixed with water. You can freeze the stock and the flavor in soups will surprise you if you are used to using a bullion cube or stock paste.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2005-06-14

She loves romance novels and is currently working on her first novel and another book of poetry. In this work, there are three poems that stand out as perfect representations of emotional conflict and decisions made by a woman who understands love. In \\"To Part,\\" Raindrops are tears and the streets become an ocean. You can feel the hopelessness of the relationship or the storm. When you are in love the world seems more vibrant and here the contrast is no rainbow in the sky.<br /><br />\\"For My Heart's Sake\\" speaks of the inevitability of change, the ending of a relationship. This poem is filled with care and concern that is subtle and beautifully expressed in the line: \\"For your sake, I will leave silently.\\"<br /><br />There is an undercurrent of longing in many of the poems as Milena expresses the desire to be more than friends with a love interest who seems to have become forbidden fruit. The poem that surprised me and reminded me of my college days was \\"I'll set you free.\\" When I was Milena's age I also wrote about caged birds.<br /><br />Milena Gomez Alvarez seems to be exploring love's nuances. She explores the temporary quality of infatuation and her desire to be in love with a man who is as much her best friend as the lover of her dreams.<br /><br />\\"We make our own destiny;<br />Our Choices right or wrong,<br />True love does exist but if only we believe,<br />Together you and I, all there is to be.\\"<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2005-06-13

Once the old baggage is cleared up completely, there is nothing left to become restimulated.\\" ~Marian K. Volkman<br /><br />If you have endured emotional trauma or have started to observe unhealthy patterns of behavior, then Life Skills can make you more aware of resilient behaviors and strategies to resolve trauma.<br /><br />Discussions about Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) lead to ideas about what might be triggering the trauma. Marian K. Volkman also points out the idea that compulsive over-achievement can be the way someone is trying to forget the trauma. She also discusses:<br /><br />What Has Worked vs. What Hasn't Worked<br />What I Want vs. What I Don't Want<br />Life as Art vs. Life as a Journey<br />How to Increase your capacity for pleasure<br />Practical ways to appreciate beauty without the need to possess<br /><br />The book starts with an analysis of the quality of your current life and ends with \\"awareness enhancers and remedies.\\" Some of the ideas about how to calm and stabilize a person might work because they include a shift in focus. I think \\"getting out of the depths of your mind\\" is essential. The orientation remedy might not instantly remove heartache, but a shift in focus might help you get your bearings.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2005-06-13

They believe their external environment determines their lives. But the truth is that humans have the ability to produce the effects they want in the world simply by observing themselves from another point of view. ~Charlene M. Proctor<br /><br />Charlene M. Proctor has a creative outlook on life and has realized her power through persistence and through overcoming life's most challenging hurdles. As she worked her way through her education she learned how to manifest success, obtain greater independence and balance her masculine and feminine energies. She also has some interesting ideas about God.<br /><br />While this book is not overly religious, the theme does seem to be based on allowing our spiritual natures out to play. Spirituality doesn't have to be restrictive; in fact, Charlene M. Proctor shows how tapping into our spiritual selves can actually free us to become more conscious and to create new patterns of thinking.<br /><br />If there was one point this books makes it is this: \\"Take Charge of Your Destiny.\\" This is accomplished when we adapt our neural networks through conscious effort. We also have to become more conscious of how our bodies function and this book also points out how humans can become addicted to positive and negative emotions. Through conscious intention, we can change this. That is where our power comes into play. We can then start to create new realities. The seven lessons include:<br /><br />Insight<br />Balance<br />Resiliency<br />Your Authentic Self<br />Abundance<br />Corporate Soul<br />The Divine Feminine<br /><br />Charlene M. Proctor has an especially comforting writing style that nurtures your mind with ideas and enlightens you with creative solutions. There are special sections at the end of the chapters called: Consciously Create Your Day. To manifest abundance, she suggests the following affirmation:<br /><br />I accept my gifts with joy. Every day I rise in a state of thankfulness for all that exists, especially for the blessings in my life.<br /><br />To become more forgiving:<br /><br />I forgive because I am capable of expressing compassion. By forgiving, I release this situation from my energy field and feel clear-headed and full-hearted.<br /><br />Throughout the book there are places for you to record your journey and to analyze your progress. If you are more than ready to toss out limiting beliefs and to embrace hope, love and a new future, then this book might lead you to a more fulfilling life. Some of the very relevant topics for today include:<br /><br />Affirming the Best in You and Your Workplace - two contrasting lists of beliefs.<br />What is Self-Worth?<br />Christ Consciousness and the Symbol of the Divine Feminine - Ideas about the Gnostic tradition and the nature of wisdom.<br />How Do We Imagine Intellect and Emotion? (How God can be understood through the masculine and feminine qualities.)<br /><br />There are affirmation for: Fear, Forgiveness, Patterns, No Time for Yourself, Unrecognized Talents, Producing More Income and Overcoming Discrimination.<br /><br />At times this is a very intellectual and somewhat troubling look at history and how modern religion has repressed the joy women want to feel in worship and life. The author questions biblical beliefs and comments on ancient mystical teachings. I found it fascinating to read about the reasons the libraries in Alexandria burnt down and why many ideas from ancient times are so misunderstood in our current culture. Although I think it is good to read the Bible if you want to compare teachings. Reading this book will probably leave you with a lot of questions. If you are a Christian, the information will push a lot of belief buttons.<br /><br />This book might also help you understand why you became disillusioned with your religious beliefs or why you always felt something was lacking. Thinking of God as a Mother and a Father does seem morehealing. Charlene Proctor definitely has a purpose behind writing this book and if it doesn't awaken your goddess immediately, it will definitely awaken your curiosity and there are many ideas to think about that could enhance your life. Overall, this book is not really about religion as much as it is about empowering women and helping women become more powerful in order to love and nurture the world.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review, it will definitely awaken your curiosity and there are many ideas to think about that could enhance your life.

207964:US	50199793	RE3WD47BLWUT	014017897X	303469300	Montaigne: Essays	Books	5	59	61	N	N	A Portrait of a Fascinating Bibliomaniac	\\"My library is in the third story of a tower; on the first is my chapel, on the second a bedroom with ante-chambers, where I often lie to be alone; and above it there is a great wardrobe...Adjoining my library is a very neat little room, in which a fire can be laid in winter, and which is pleasantly lighted by a window.\\" Montaigne, On Three Kinds of Relationships<br /><br />From the start, Montaigne (1533-1592) shows his great love of writing about life and his ultimate pleasure: exercising his mind through the discussion of philosophy. He also loved to point out incongruity and excelled in making logical conclusions.<br /><br />His honesty seems to be his most attractive quality as he addresses the horror and beauty of life. At times he seems to almost be a reporter describing experience, detached and unemotional. Then when he delves into friendship he shows a new depth of emotion.<br /><br />\\"There is no action or thought of mine in which I do not miss him, as he would have missed me. For just as he infinitely surpassed me in every other talent and virtue, so did he also in the duties of friendship.\\" ~Montaigne, On Friendship<br /><br />Montaigne's writing is at times a history lesson. He draws from the writings of Ovid, Cicero, Horace, Socrates, Plato, Seneca, Virgil and Petrarch.<br /><br />His topics are fascinating and get even more interesting when he talks about the custom of wearing clothes, the Platonic paradox or why churches use incense. He explores the power of the imagination, truth and error, friendship, why civilized man is at times no better than a savage in his actions and freely discusses his ideas about education.<br /><br />I must say that when he discusses books, this topic overflows and ends up in other essays. So, while the chapter on books may seem short, you will still find some excellent quotes later on while reading about the three kinds of relationships or \\"On Physiognomy,\\" which seems to be more about the plague and death being inevitable and how philosophers contemplate death as a life-long exercise.<br /><br />I learned a great deal about Socrates and how the Athenians felt when he died and that swans sing when they die. It all seems unrelated, but somehow Montaigne casually introduces topic after topic with great intellectual flair. Finally we happen upon his survival when captured by a band of horsemen. Then, we understand why he has titled this chapter \\"Physiognomy,\\" because he is saved by the kind look on his face and his firmness of speech.<br /><br />We also learn about his beautiful library. Later he discusses topics of interest like how Emperors built huge arenas that could be filled with deep water filled with sea monsters. These topics all seem related to his love of research.<br /><br />While he discusses history at length and loves to add in quotes, he is also a keen observer of human nature. He sees life so clearly and freely says what most people fear will offend. Like that when we find a fault in other people, it might be a fault in our character or how strong we have to be to handle being criticized and why there are remarkable proofs of friendship when someone gives constructive criticism. Of course, many would not agree with this, although our friends do see us rather clearly.<br /><br />\\"One must learn to endure what one cannot avoid,\\" becomes more relevant near the end when Montaigne faces his own death. He discusses life so casually and even tells us about what he loves to eat and still doesn't enjoy. Life's simple pleasures are still of utmost importance even when he is suffering greatly with illness.<br /><br />My blinds had turned golden in the early morning when I finished reading this book. I had the longing to sit by a fireplace and read another book by Montaigne. While it took three days to read the essays, this book almost ended too soon. Reading the essays was like discovering a long lost friend or a book through which we can live vicariously in another time and place.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2005-06-11

Some of our friends are almost soul mates. They understand us and when we talk to them life is dreamy and happy.<br /><br />Catherine Dee has created three beautiful books filled with quotes and this is one of my favorite books. While reading this book I started to remember all the women in my life who were true friends and why one of my friendships has survived for over 25 years.<br /><br />This book contains much more than quotes. There are unique sections and lots of humor. In the section about the importance of listening (when you'd rather talk), there is a quick list of \\"How Not to Listen\\" that is rather funny. There are lists of \\"Talk Topics\\" and a humorous \\"Slumber Party Etiquette\\" section.<br /><br />Yes, this book is mostly about friendships between girls/women, but there is also a section about \\"boy friends.\\" The stories are sprinkled in between the quotes and fun facts. The story about the Whales was quite beautiful and shows how three friends celebrate the life of a girl named Joanne by going on a trip to Hawaii.<br /><br />Other cute features include: Friendly Facts, Inspiring Poems and Collectable Quotes.<br /><br />The Girls' Book of Friendship shows what it means to be a true friend and Catherine Dee has done an excellent job of collecting beautiful quotes to celebrate friendship. You will find quotes by women like: Oprah Winfrey, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Louisa May Alcott, Renee Zellweger, Jane Austen, Meg Ryan, Kathleen Norris, Jennifer Aniston, Maria Shirver and Rebecca West.<br /><br />My favorite quote:<br /><br />\\"Every so often you run into someone from your tribe, a magic person.\\" ~Carrie Fisher, Actor<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2005-06-08

How do you even remember everything that happens when almost unaware of time itself and captured in a mystery or moment of breathless wonder?<br /><br />Do poets hover above themselves in some dreamlike state observing this ecstatic union awaiting its birth in words? Does the soul watch the body's pleasure, silently? It seems it does because when poems arrive often they spill out onto the page in line after line of meaningful remembrance without much effort or thought. These types of poems seem born of longing, fantasy, dreams and the ancient desires all humans share. There is also humor in some of the rhymes or a casual elegance.<br /><br />Nikki Giovanni brings an amusing style to her poetry in \\"That Day.\\" The poem dances with the pleasure of the rhyme.<br /><br />if you've got the key<br />then i've got the door<br />let's do what we did<br />when we did it before<br /><br />Peeling an Orange by Virginia Hamilton Adair also shows the playfulness of love as two lovers play with oranges and the spicy scent of orange oil fills the air.<br /><br />There are poems that are more direct and sensual and they explore the depths of the human experience and often express our desire to feel loved until our bodies vibrate at a higher frequency. This subtle purr or contentment after a loving experience can actually be felt in the body, but it is often difficult to describe. Some of the lovers wish to die in this blissful state after union. Wendy Lee expresses this desire in \\"Seamless Beauty\\" where she wishes to \\"fall into a deep sleep and never wake up.\\"<br /><br />Many of the poems contain nature images, especially water, the moon and surprisingly...many images of moths. What more could I wish for? There are swarms of luminous moths or ecstasy in a desert sea. A few of the poems have culinary themes. Jay Farbstein remembers a scene in the kitchen and how the pleasure of tastes turns into a worshipful experience.<br /><br />Mostly, this is beautiful creative writing with a sensual theme. There are poems reflecting on past loves, poems about intense sensual encounters (Making Love by Walt Farran) and others where the poet wishes for future fulfillment. Like in Thirst by Linda Alexander:<br /><br />Like a blade of summer grass<br />turning towards a fragrance<br />of rain caught in the air's<br />cooling, I come back to you<br /><br />Wendy Maltz has created a sensitive and sacred sanctuary of healthy sexual experience in which lovers give sexuality a unique voice filled with imagination and metaphor. This is beyond romance, but never abusive or degrading. There is still a subtle mystery present in most of the poems. I loved the images in On Entering the Sea where Nizar Qabbani speaks of his experience as a \\"sliding under the skin of water...like writing with jasmine water.\\"<br /><br />The poems are divided into five chapters: Anticipation & Desire, Self-Awareness & Discovery, Admiration & Appreciation, Union & Ecstasy and Afterglow & Remembrance.<br /><br />The poets featured: Marge Piercy, Emily Dickinson, Patti Tana, Robert Browning, Robin Jacobson, Linda Alexander, Floyd Skloot, George Keithley, David Meuel, Debra Pennington Davis, Penny Harter, Nikki Giovanni, Rumi, Trudi Paraha, Vigrinia Hamilton Adair, Stephen Dunn, Abigail Albrecht, Sharon Olds, Octavio Paz, Nizar Qabbani, Anon, Cummings, Kenneth Rexroth, June Sylvester Saraceno and Penny Harter.<br /><br />What is especially delicious about this book of poetry is the introduction to a variety of new poets. For many of the poets, this is the first time their poems were published. I fell in love with Trudi Paraha's poetry. Her descriptions of painting love poems over sheets went beyond creative. She plays with words as if they owned her heart.<br /><br /> The erotic human experience is often a place of immense pleasure and most of the poets in this book seem to be writing from a place of relationship, trust and honesty. There is a nurturing quality to the lust, a beautiful connection between souls and an almost spiritual element in the union of lovers in a comforting embrace and heartfelt connection.<br /><br />David Meuel's poems are especially interesting. He speaks of talking in touches and listening to each other's fingertips. In just a few sentences he can create amazing situations of desire. \\"What Makes It Good\\" shows his talent and \\"Ten Years Together\\" displays a rare intimacy between souls.<br /><br />While you may think of erotic poems as poetry to excite passion, I found many of these poems were dipped in pleasure, but still retained an element of comfort. This is the type of book you can read at night before you go to bed and it may even produce beautiful dreams of the person you love. Intimate Kisses is as much a kiss for the mind as for the heart.<br /><br />Something like my soul slips from me<br />and goes to you,<br />without choice or question,<br />and wraps itself around you<br />all night, like the breath<br />of the moon<br />~Gina Zeitlin<br /><br />Intimate Kisses is an excellent choice is you have longed to know the experience of poets who can deftly describe the devotional side of desire.

Jewel is on a private jet, writing about her life.<br /><br />Jewel's \\"Chasing Down the Dawn\\" is an intimate, timeless and enchanting mosaic. Jewel creates a world where the main elements of life and the magical experiences are woven into her daily existence. Her experiences are processed through her self-analysis and then woven into words.<br /><br />While not organized in a chronological order, memories dance playfully with stark reality, unique vignettes give insight into the inexorable connection between Jewel's music and the way she views life. She becomes the guitar, her music is her gift, she is grounded in purpose, yet living in the stars with dreams she eventually manifests into reality.<br /><br />The story of her life is temporarily tragic and eternally beautiful. We read about the tragic loss of her mother as a child (the divorce), how she struggled to live in a world of men (no privacy), her childhood in Alaska and the sharp contrast between frontier life and traveling on a private jet. It is as if Jewel has lived two lives, one in the distant past and one in the dreamy future. Her vivid recollections are especially beautiful to read and there is a sacred side to her writing. She is not just experiencing her dream, she is creating each moment through conscious decisions.<br /><br />Jewel is a multitalented artist. She excels as a musician, poet and skilled writer and then her artistic nature also comes out in her photography. I loved the three pictures of the grain barn with the horse and rider shadows. She also shows us her honest comedic side in stories of how she \\"borrowed\\" a few items from a friend. She then concludes that stealing was a \\"manifestation of my lack of faith in myself.\\"<br /><br />Chasing Down the Dawn gives insight into Jewel's songs and what inspired her to write \\"Who Will Save Your Soul?\\" Her songs then reveal their history in her childhood memories, ideas about love, love of horses and nature, memories of people she has loved and lost and her world travels and life experience. Throughout this book Jewel and her father are on a journey to accept each other as souls and when her father sings her a sweet sixteen lullaby the circle is complete.<br /><br />To me, Jewel is a magical angelic singer who was sent to our earth to remind us of the magnificent creations we are, to remind us to love and to contemplate our deeper existence. The existence of our souls, how we can change the world for the better through our lives and how we can survive this earthly and temporary solitude within a physical body subject to emotional pain and ethical conflicts.<br /><br />Reading Jewel's short stories, vivid recollections and songs make the world seem a little less lonely. Her writing draws us into her magical world of experience and leaves us wanting to read more.<br /><br />If you love Jewel's poetic writing style, then I think you will love her poems.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br />Listening to Pieces of You and Spirito write \\"Who Will Save Your Soul?\\" Her songs then reveal their history in her childhood memories, ideas about love, love of horses and nature, memories of people she has loved and lost and her world travels and life experience.

Some of the recipes were contributed by Margaret Spader, George Lang, Tom Margittai and Amy Vanderbilt.<br /><br />The recipes reflect a comforting element of family dinners and homemade pleasure.

Then she discusses the importance of relaxation.<br /><br />If you have been looking for the Lemon Pudding recipe that makes its own top crust, this book has it and the ingredients are mostly flour, sugar, milk and eggs. Most of the recipes call for everyday ingredients or at least items you can easily find at your grocery store. There are a few recipes where you might want to order things like popcorn rice, although the variety of rice at the grocery store is impressive.<br /><br />While most of the menus serve 6-8, this is probably the case if you make all the dishes in each chapter. If you only want to make a chicken salad, you may need to double the recipe for four people.<br /><br />Some of the delicious recipes include:<br /><br />Irish Stew with Root Vegetables (also gives a recipe for Bouquet Garni)<br />Lamb Curry<br />Brunswick Stew<br />Pear-Ginger Turnovers<br />Braised Fennel<br />Warm Apple Strudel with Dulce de Leche Ice Cream<br />Strawberry Granita<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewpes include:     Irish Stew with Root Vegetables (also gives a recipe for Bouquet Garni)  Lamb Curry  Brunswick Stew  Pear-Ginger Turnovers  Braised Fennel  Warm Apple Strudel with Dulce de Leche Ice Cream  Strawberry Granita    ~The Rebecca Review	2005-06-01

It is the unknown, that which puzzles us and defies our rational approach to reality. ~Tess Castleman<br /><br />Tess Castleman walks were many of us may fear to tread. When you start to tell people your dreams you enter a new level of intimacy and can reveal everything from your deepest fantasies to your darkest fears. Dreams seem to be a good place to live out all our unattainable fantasies, like flying.<br /><br />Tess Castleman cautions against taking books of dream symbols too seriously and her advice is very relevant if you are looking to analyze your own dreams. The color red could have many interpretations (power, anger or sexual experience) and elements in your dream could even solve problems in daily life.<br /><br />The author believes our dreams are often more complex than they first appear. She unveils the mysteries in dreams on a daily basis and enters one of the most intimate places in the human psyche. Here our fears and desires are revealed in metaphors, feelings, images and symbols only we may understand.<br /><br />Jung is mentioned quite often and there are discussions about the animus and anima. There is also a list of an individual psyche that includes the Persona, Ego, Complexes, Shadow, Anima/Animus, Tribal Field, Archetypes, The Self, Collective Unconscious.<br /><br />The Tribal Field helps to explain synchronicity, while archetypes can help us understand our actions through universal images.<br /><br />\\"The tribal of communal field, one's inner desire, the movement of the Self, does not reveal itself in drop-dead-jaw-agape synchronistic phenomena alone. It may just as likely emerge as a mild, quiet, connecting link, like the notes in a melody that flow one into the next in a chain or matrix of meaning and music.\\" ~Tess Castleman<br /><br />One interesting aspect of dreams is that when you talk about specific types of dreams with friends, you might start to have similar dreams or even induce dreams where someone has not been dreaming that much before or at least has not been remembering details of their dreams.<br /><br />I love talking about dreams and analyzing my own dreams because I think they give us clues to how we are living our life, our destiny and our most secret and often hidden desires. For some reason, all my dreams lately have been about traveling to other planets and I think that might be symbolic of some change in my life in the near future. Blue has been a current theme. Just for fun, I will sometimes go online and type in things like \\"What does the color blue mean in dreams?\\" Some of the answers make perfect sense.<br /><br />Dreams can be mysterious and exciting, but what happens in the day in regards to synchronicity can also be quite entertaining.

I love talking about dreams and analyzing my own dreams because I think they give us clues to how we are living our life, our destiny and our most secret and often hidden desires. For some reason, all my dreams lately have been about traveling to other planets and I think that might be symbolic of some change in my life in the near future. Blue has been a current theme. Just for fun, I will sometimes go online and type in things like \\"What does the color blue mean in dreams?\\" Some of the answers make perfect sense.     Dreams can be mysterious and exciting, but what happens in the day in regards to synchronicity can also be quite entertaining.

Charles Stuart Platkin unveils misconceptions about weight control and shows you how to have long-term success.<br /><br />The Diet Detective takes you through your eating behaviors and you can decide if you want to include behavior modification strategies to your everyday diet. Through self-analysis you start to break negative patterns and destructive eating tendencies. He explains how most diets deliver temporary results and most people gain the weight back. How is this diet different?<br /><br />This is not a diet where you have to give up chocolate (Who could give up Leonidas Belgium chocolates?) or your favorite foods. What the author seeks to encourage is a healthier lifestyle. Since most diets don't bring the results we are looking for, Charles Stuart Platkin advises a lifestyle change. In most cases, he doesn't take away foods like popcorn and carrots; he shows you the best choice. There are a few lists of \\"items you ought to think about throwing out.\\" These include the usual suspects - sugar, soda, ice cream. I was a little shocked to learn about the calories in the Starbucks Classic Coffee Cake.<br /><br />I still think in moderation, you can handle a little ice cream, although I must say I feel terrible if I eat too much sugar in a day and it can produce the feeling of chronic fatigue for 24 hours. The author recommends good protein sources, a good variety of vegetables and healthy starch choices.<br /><br />I am happy to see that another author is talking about the muscle mass issue, because this could help many dieters over the initial hurdles of initial weight gain when you start to exercise. The author also explains why a drastic reduction in calories triggers the body's famine-survival mechanism. This of course slows down your metabolism.<br /><br />There are also ideas about \\"excuse busters\\" and self-talk is definitely your friend or enemy. My most recent self-talk to increase my exercise includes telling myself how good I'm going to feel after I exercise and eat my fruits and vegetables. Being proactive and buying clothes that are too small also seems to be good motivation. I also threw out any clothes that are too big for me, so I simply will have nothing to wear if I don't exercise.<br /><br />Another idea is not buying anything that you know you should not be eating and buying lots of things you know you should be eating. Then, when you are home and hungry, you make better choices. Doing Yoga also seems to help because it generally puts you in a much calmer state of mind and you feel more in control of your choices.<br /><br />If you are heading towards 40, then you may also want to read The Metabolic Plan to learn about amazing supplements and how you can stop the aging process, increase muscle mass and feel younger each year.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewhe author also explains why a drastic reduction in calories triggers the body's famine-survival mechanism.

In her journey she had to sidestep empty promises and quick fixes. Judy Gruen finally attempts Boot Camp training and when you see her picture on the back of the book, complete with flowered hat, you will know why this quite humorous.<br /><br />In this book she deals with many of the questions we all ask about dieting. Does dieting actually work or is an entire lifestyle change in order?<br /><br />How do you really lose weight and keep it off?<br />What is the chew less, move more diet?<br />How much water should you be drinking on a daily basis?<br />Can you handle gaining muscle mass/extra weight to look better?<br /><br />I was pleased to read another author discussing the initial weight gain when you increase your muscle mass from exercising. This was a great hurdle for me at the start and you almost have to toss or hide your scale at the start.<br /><br />If you have tried a number of diet solutions like the Apple Cider Vinegar diet, Weight Watchers or Atkins you will relate to Judy's diet frustrations. Fortunately she keeps her sense of humor and this book is her diary. Each entry explores something new she is trying and what does and doesn't work.<br /><br />Some of the more hilarious (although somewhat dangerous in real-life) portions of the book include cooking experiments gone awry. I myself learned not to pour alcohol onto baked chicken in an oven and then shut the door. Because I will say this, an oven can explode in a most interesting way. Which brings me to this thought: \\"What was in the raspberry vinaigrette marinade?\\"<br /><br />She tries Latin Dance, Yoga and Belly dancing. She tries Cardio-Kickboxing class, personal trainers, she tries going to chocoholic anonymous meetings. After fives months of \\"semi-dedicated dieting, energetic exercising and rigorous research,\\" she makes ten conclusions and then the May 26th entry ends up being the icing on the cake of this rather humorous book.<br /><br />I am only left wondering if she has discovered Leonidas Chocolates or read \\"Why Women Need Chocolate.\\" Then, I can only imagine a journey she would take after reading The Metabolic Plan.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />P.S.

She survived a violent marriage, chronic fatigue and living almost next door to her ex husband when he remarried. Her life is a study in patience, emotional turmoil resolved and survival of the most open heart.<br /><br />The start of the book contains a poem and then each chapter is an expanded vision of the elements contained in a part of the poem. After the poem, Oriah dives right into a retelling of her life, the conflicts she has experienced and how as a spiritual teacher, she too struggles to maintain emotional equilibrium. There is a subtle comfort in knowing that if Oriah can survive her life, then we can too.<br /><br />This is the beauty mingled with the various stunning insights Oriah has while trying to unburden her heart and pull us out on the dance floor of life. She loves to read and a number of the books she mentioned where books I had just recently read. She quotes Rainer Maria Rilke and Rumi. She discusses Daniel Ladinsky's translations of Hafiz. Her \\"headed for home\\" comments made me think of Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet.<br /><br />Throughout this work Oriah focuses on connecting, serenity, joy, an authentic lifestyle, living with passion, retaining energy and focus, being honest and finding happiness within the complex. She also provides meditations on worthiness, surrender, slowing down and letting go.<br /><br />This is not a five-step or a ten-step program, it is more an unfolding of experience through an exploration of Oriah's life experience. She has struggled, she has survived. She also knows there are no quick fixes and that many self-help programs are no match for real-life situations. Sometimes there is no easy way out of the pain and you have to endure heartache to learn your greatest lessons.<br /><br />\\"Take me to the places on the earth that teach you how to dance,<br />the places where you can risk letting the world break your heart,<br />and I will take you to the places where the earth beneath my feet<br />and the stars overhead make my heart whole again and again.\\"<br />~ Oriah Mountain Dreamer<br /><br />What did I love most about this book? The section where she talks about her ultimate fantasy of reading in bed with the man she loves. Yes, this book is mostly about Oriah, or the people she has met throughout her life, but the way she draws on her inner wisdom is by experiencing life and dancing with difficulty.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewdance,  the places where you can risk letting the world break your heart,  and I will take you to the places where the earth beneath my feet  and the stars overhead make my heart whole again and again.\\"   ~ Oriah Mountain Dreamer    What did I love most about this book?

Throughout the pages of this beautiful collection, the mysteries of love are revealed. It is more a celebration than an explanation and you will also discover trends and trivia.<br /><br />Is personality more important than looks?<br />Is there a scientific way to measure love?<br />What are the first signs of falling in love?<br />Can fantasy be a natural pain reliever?<br />Why should you whisper into the left ear?<br /><br />I remember being in love when I was just seven years old and I think all girls can relate to the desire to be in love all the time. Being in love makes the world more interesting, you feel more inspired and for women, this might just be a way of life.<br /><br />A few of the true love stories take place in exotic places. A sixteen-year-old gazes intensely at her newfound love while visiting temples in India and then while traveling in Egypt, a girl is frozen in place by the sight of boy she views from a distance.<br /><br />\\"Although our time together was short, it's a treasure I'll hold in my heart forever.

Within each tiny chapter, profound moments can occur as we are given insight into unfamiliar territory, a place of thought not commonly existing in daily life but familiar to spiritual teachers.<br /><br />Kahlil Gibran magically explores the connection between sorrow and joy and how the deeper the sorrow you experience, the more joy you can contain. Talking becomes thoughts that can no longer \\"dwell in the solitude of your heart\\" so they \\"live in your lips.\\"<br /><br />As Almustafa waits for a ship to take him back to the isle of his birth, he climbs a hill outside the city walls and looks out to sea. When his \\"ship arrives\\" he is suddenly filled with regret, yet knows he must follow his destiny and return home.<br /><br />\\"Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from his pain and his aloneness without regret?\\"<br /><br />The priests and priestesses ask him to remain in very poetic ways: \\"Let not the waves of the sea separate us now, and the years you have spent in our midst become a memory.\\"<br /><br />Almustafa only cries and doesn't seem to speak until a woman named Almitra appears. She is a woman who believed in him and he seems to have great fondness for her. We are not given any insight into their relationship, but his respect for her is unquestioned. She understands he must leave, but asks him to give the city his wisdom. She promises they will pass this wisdom down through the generations.<br /><br />While viewing pictures of Bsharri in Northern Lebanon, the mountains and the mist are almost a unique doorway into Kahlil Gibran's mind. He lived in a lush region where cascading falls, rugged cliffs and cedar trees influenced his art and writing.<br /><br />We can imagine his thoughts of home and this book was actually first imagined when he wrote a short story as a teenager. A Bostonian poet, Josephine Peabody, caught Gibran's attention at an art exhibition and she later referred to him as \\"her young prophet.\\"  She also wrote poems about Gibran's life and how she imagined his life in Bsharri. His life is woven into his writing in the most beautiful ways. He names his book for a woman he loves and his writing is infused with spiritual teachings and influences from his journey from Lebanon to New York.<br /><br />The story has an unassuming plot, but the lessons are eternal and the ending is surprisingly tender. I was left with a sense of longing that is still drifting along with me like the mists of Bsharri. The Prophet is not just a book to read, it is a spiritual journey to experience. It may take three or more days to complete the reading of this tiny book. I could only read about a third at a time because it is saturated in wisdom and many of the chapters want to be read and read again, until they are absorbed into your soul and written on your heart.<br /><br />\\"But if you love and must needs have desires,<br />let these be your desires:<br />To melt and be like a running brook that<br />sings its melody to the night.\\" ~Kahlil Gibran<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewlls, rugged cliffs and cedar trees influenced his art and writing.

But could he believe that Minta read them? She dragged them about the garden, sticking in leaves to mark the place.\\"<br /><br />In my attempt to understand Virginia Woolf's life, it would seem appropriate to read more of her work and understand how she viewed life in its beauty and horror. In To the Lighthouse there are brief glimpses of beauty in regards to nature, feelings and experience. Yet, the underlying emotion in this book seems to be a subtle frustration. The frustration of the reader attempting to stay focused and connected with the main themes and the frustration of the young James Ramsay, who only wishes to visit a lighthouse.<br /><br />\\"Brooding, she changed the pool into the sea, and made the minnows into sharks and whales, and cast vast clouds over this tiny world by holding her hand against the sun, and so brought darkness and desolation, like God himself, to millions of ignorant and innocent creatures, and then took her hand away suddenly and let the sun stream down.\\"<br /><br />Virginia Woolf's descriptions can at times appear as vivid recollections and there is almost a tension at the start as if at any moment a scene of emotional instability will break and the characters will fall apart. Yet, they remain calm in their own insecurities, never really drawing on our sympathies. A child dreams, a mother hopes, a husband tries to dash both the dreams and hopes.<br /><br />Then Virginia seems to be stepping in an out of her characters lives, experiencing little nuances of their existence. This results in a swirling of temporary chaos as you try to find your way out of the emotional complexity and sometimes overwhelming lists of people she introduces briefly. Only a few characters remain until the end and many of the temporary characters fly in and out of the story so fast, we can't quite grasp the importance of their introduction.<br /><br />The most interesting part of the book seems to be when the house starts to fall apart and is then rescued from the encroaching decay, swollen sea-moistened woodwork and rusting hinges.<br /><br />Some movies are better when viewed the second and third time and it seems this book gains a new clarity on the second reading. In the end I was disappointed not to learn about James' impressions of the final destination and honestly wished she had spent more time on the main characters. In the end it feels like bits and pieces all connected in some jigsaw puzzle of experience.<br /><br />If you love the sea and lighthouses, there are short moments of pleasure and the descriptions cause you to lose track of reality for minutes at a time. I did love the description of a star sliding in the sky and then the entire sea lighting up in red and gold.

It is that striving for which all other striving is merely preparation. ~Rainer Maria Rilke<br /><br />After recently discovering twelve little treasures, I was eager to read the first book, Letters To a Young Poet, by candlelight on my deck. In the silence of the night the candle kept me company while peering into the world of two poets captured in an intimate exchange of ideas.<br /><br />Franz Xaver Kappus first discovers the \\"Poems of Rainer Maria Rilke\\" and then seeks out his advice. Franz mails Rainer his poems and their correspondence lasts until 1908. This book contains ten letters from 1903 to 1908.<br /><br />The letters are from Rainer to Franz and none of the poems they discuss have been included. This would have been enlightening, but alas, I have yet to find the poems they discuss. It is not necessary to read the poems to enjoy the letters and after reading the letters, I now want to read Rainer's poems.<br /><br />Rainer Maria Rilke is quite generous with his advice and explores various aspects of life as observed by a poet. He explains how critical words influence a work of art less than praise and then delicately composes a brief analysis of Franz Xaver Kappus' poems.<br /><br />For the most part, Rainer seems to be giving advice about being patient, embracing struggle and how to understand the connection between primeval urges and art. He also gives advice about solitude and sexuality in regards to the artistic temperament.<br /><br />\\"Everything in nature grows and struggles in its own way, establishing its own identity, insisting on it at all cost, against all resistance.\\" ~Rainer Maria Rilke<br /><br />Letters To A Young Poet is a rare find and if you are seeking to gaze through a small window and to view a brief glimpse of the artistic life, then I can highly recommend this tiny treasure to you. If you read this book, I can almost guarantee you will want to find additional books by Rainer Maria Rilke because they will give insight into your own life and personal transformation. I especially loved the letter where Rainer discusses having patience \\"with everything that remains unsolved in your heart.\\" He suggests that we try to love the questions.<br /><br />Then I had a thought about the answers being of little importance when compared to the knowledge of the questions very existence. Mostly because the answers are the mystery and even Rainer admits that \\"they cannot now be given to you because you could not live them.\\"<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewner Maria Rilke because they will give insight into your own life and personal transformation.

Lawrence, Robert Browning, Lord Byron, Emily Dickinson and Thomas Moore, then many of these poems may already be very familiar. There is comfort in reading familiar poems and yet I'm always eager to find new poems.<br /><br />Patterns by Amy Lowell is a completely new poem to me and the descriptions of ribboned shoes, lime trees and daffodils invited me to read this poem more than once. What is truly stunning about this particular poem is the way in which Amy Lowell expresses her grief through the beauty of nature. She becomes the images as if she stepped into the painting and became the soul of nature.<br /><br />I also enjoyed \\"Of My First Love\\" by Hugh MacDiarmid:<br /><br />Silhouetted against grim black rocks<br />This foaming mountain torrent<br />With its source in desolate tarns<br />Is savage in the extreme<br />As its waters with one wild leap<br />Hurl over the dizzy brink<br />Of the perpendicular cliff-face<br />In that great den of nature<br />To be churned into spray<br />In the steaming depths below<br /><br />After describing this waterfall, he then describes the water as a lover's waving hair in a tremendous cascade and then turns this into a description of great passion for his lover's golden hair rippling out between his fingers.<br /><br />William Shakespeare makes his appearance in \\"Shall I Compare Thee to a Summer's Day?\\" I finally copied \\"Meeting at Night\\" by Robert Browning into my journal because I love the way the words sound like they are rowing through the gray sea to the warm sea-scented beach.<br /><br />So while every Classic collections seems to present The Passionate Shepherd to His Love and Love's Philosophy, you will also find The River-Merchant's Wife: a Letter by Li T'ai Po and The Mirabeau Bridge by Guillaume Apollinaire.<br /><br />One Hundred and One Classic Love Poems will comfort you with classics and surprise you with poems you may have yet to discover.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2005-05-17

He not only translated these poems, he lovingly selected poems of great beauty and meaning.<br /><br />While many of the poems do sing with his voice, a new understanding emerges and the message of an ecstatic union with God is very present. What is even more interesting than the poet's desire to worship God, is God's worship of humans, which can at times seem foreign unless you think of this as an admiration of His creation. Then, like two human lovers, God and mankind enter a space of love, adoration, blissful unconditional love and shared communion.<br /><br />In this regard, the poems are ecstatically beautiful, although not always about God. There are plenty of love poems that seem to have been written for human lovers:<br /><br />One regret that I am determined not to have<br />When I am lying upon my deathbed<br />is that we did not kiss<br />enough.<br />~Hafiz (c. 1320-1329)<br /><br />Hafiz influenced Emerson, Goethe and Brahms and Daniel Ladinsky explains how he wrote wild love songs to the world from God.<br /><br />Priests also long for the love of a woman and yet maintain the vows they took and some poets compare their love to the vows the sun and the moon took as they will never touch. One of the most beautiful poems contains references to giving God a \\"pet\\" name and that he responded more to prayers when he was loved this way. I loved Rabia of Basra's poem about the moon once being a moth:<br /><br />The moon was once a moth who ran to God,<br />they entwined.<br /><br />Now just her luminous soul remains<br />as we gaze at it<br />at night.<br /><br />Many of the poems are secretive, sensuous and tell stories from mythology.

As earthly sojourners in the 21st century we experience the outer world in society, organizations and communities as paradoxical, rapidly changing, and becoming more globally inter-dependent. This out world many times is at variance with our own inner world. And this is the therapeutic power of storytelling.\\" ~David Dunning, Corporate Leadership Psychologist<br /><br />Evelyn Clark works with many leaders who want to enhance creativity through storytelling. She also gives examples of the stories corporate leaders tell their employees. This gives insight into the philosophies of companies like Costco, Nike, Kodak, Mary Kay, FedEx and Southwest Airlines.<br /><br />So, how can you strengthen your company with stories?<br /><br />Employees need to understand the company's philosophy and the history. When leaders tell the stories of how a company came into existence or how a product changed lives, this gives meaning to going to work everyday. It is always helpful to know you are part of a greater plan, a company that is changing the world or at least making life better for people buying the products.<br /><br />Evelyn Clark focuses on visionary leaders who use stories to create the future they desire. How was a track coach inspired by his wife's waffle iron? The story of Nike is rather intriguing and then the stories of how the company has influenced lives gets even more entertaining. The company puts stories at their corporate website to inspire and many stories can be told online.<br /><br />You may find yourself gravitating to specific stories because you recognize the company or have an interest in the specific type of product a company is selling. The story of Kodak is more universal and if you have yet to see a Mary Kay car, then you may not be living in America. These are stories we can all relate to and Evelyn explains how to communicate through broadcast media or in print. Could you motivate your employees through a daily voice-mailbox message or would it be better to put the story at your website?<br /><br />Around the Corporate Campfire is filled with stories to inspire success in your company. Even if you don't own a company, this book is entertaining reading and could give you some interesting material for conversations with friends, especially if they enjoy shopping at Costco, REI or wear Nike shoes. Reading the core values of REI gives insight into why some companies succeed and why core values are crucial to success.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewuld it be better to put the story at your website?

The common man is now the hero and we are all trying to find out what is really important.<br /><br />I have seen this aspect in books I'm reading. There are many references to 9/11 and explanations of how this disaster changed lives, influenced books and now it is very evident it is changing our entire society in ways I had yet to consider.

Do companies now feel more vulnerable and why are people deferring retirement?<br /><br />So, what does this have to do with Brand?<br /><br />Dennis Flynn show how the role of Corporate leadership is changing and explores the ways you can design your future instead of reacting.

In fact, a store owner recently sent me to a blog to read about a product.<br /><br />\\"The focus should be on weaving the DNA of your brand into the DNA of the culture.

Michael Willard explains the vulnerable time in every employee's life: \\"The Portfolio Bubble.\\"<br /><br />If you want to ensure your career's survival, this is the book to read. As pension plans fail and companies continue to downsize, you may be considering a career change at 50 or even 60. This could be the start of an exciting page in your life and this thought-provoking book could inspire your journey to continued success.<br /><br />J. Michael Willard has a pleasant writing style, he has a full life of experience to share and throughout the book he provides entertaining examples from his own life. He also shows an understanding of how current trends in antiaging are changing society and encourages the practice of walking to increase inspiration.<br /><br />\\"...in the United States one person in seven is over the age of 65, and this figure is expected to rise to one in four by the year 2030.\\" ~J. Michael Willard<br /><br />Since people are living longer, there is more opportunity to contribute to society, well beyond the traditional retirement age. I have heard of enthusiastic men in their 70s starting companies or people skipping retirement altogether in order to pursue their lifelong passions and employment dreams. The author gives examples of Col. Harlan Sanders who didn't find his true purpose in life until he was 70.<br /><br />\\"In the portfolio zone, you are the brand.\\" ~J.

Something in our makeup seeks it and appreciates it. The people we admire most seem to be kind and thoughtful most of the time.\\" ~Roger Fritz<br /><br />Do you think Humble people lack confidence or are weak people with a loser attitude? Well, it turns out that many people equate humility with weakness. If you are suspicious of self-centered people and want to read about people who have their egos under control, then you will enjoy Dr. Roger Fritz' enlightening book about why the absence of pride can make a person a better leader. There are 10 interesting chapters:<br /><br />Why Arrogance Is Vulnerable<br />Loyalty Works Both Ways<br />The Upside of Defeat<br />When Pride Goes Too Far<br />How to Identify Pretenders<br />Quiet Dignity<br />Random Acts of Kindness<br />Defining Moments<br />No Need to Get Even<br />Why Egotists are Lonely<br /><br />The author discusses how arrogant people are short sighted and are therefore vulnerable to downfall because they don't acknowledge their weakness or gain support from others.<br /><br />\\"We look for those who do not push us aside as they chase their own ambitions and vanity.\\" ~Robert Fritz<br /><br />Throughout this excellent book, you will find a common sense approach, collectible quotes and insight into the qualities of a good leader. It was interesting to learn about how the strongest people don't need constant praise to excel. You can take the SQ test to find out how selfish you are (it is funny) and then explore why humble people prefer to be an example for others to follow.<br /><br />Some of the quotes I enjoyed:<br /><br />Positive People do not follow Negative People<br />Failure is a prelude to winning<br />Today there is a circumstance but tomorrow there is only what I made of it.<br /><br />Dr. Fritz has written 44 books and his work has been distributed in 35 countries and languages. His work encourages you to strive to be a better person and to face your faults head on in an amusing way.<br /><br />You may also be interested in:<br /><br />100 Ways to Bring Out Your Best<br />Building Your Legacy<br />Little Things Big Results<br />Magnet People<br />Bounce Back and Win<br />Fast Track: How to Gain and Keep Momentum<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewilding Your Legacy  Little Things Big Results  Magnet People  Bounce Back and Win  Fast Track: How to Gain and Keep Momentum    ~The Rebecca Review	2005-05-13

She also displays a great strength of character in her writing. Not only does she talk about her husband Octavio's memory loss, she discusses the responsibility of society and how she views her situation.<br /><br />After adopting three foster children, she discovered a richer life filled with love and challenges. Her son Alberto is responsible for the name of this book because he is always telling her to \\"relax.\\"<br /><br />What amazes me about poetry is the unique variety of expression. Ana Monnar has her own style and it is infused with real-life situations, emotional struggles, observations in nature and studies of color (Chapter 4 - Something Blue). At times she writes casual observations:<br /><br />Sitting under an umbrella<br />Eating fries and a Sloppy Joe<br />Entertaining a novella<br />Unflawed like a Vincent Van Gogh<br /><br />Then, she takes off into dreaming:<br /><br />My dreams were rapidly and significantly<br />soaring<br />So vivid it seemed - flamboyant<br />imagination<br />Extravagantly loving and indulgent<br />adoring<br /><br />Ana Monnar also includes a list of English Proverbs and a page of Famous Quotes. Throughout her book she is teaching life lessons through poetry. She talks about friendship, the importance of communication in marriage, how to deal with anger, fears, responsibilities, supporting those in need, unconditional love and dealing with complicated decisions.<br /><br />\\"Beyond My Comprehension\\" is a rather emotional poem about a forbidden love:<br /><br />I need to get you out of my mind<br />With all efforts and by all means<br /><br />Relax is filled with hopes, dreams, love and a sense of belonging to a vast universe of hearts beyond yourself. Ana Monnar's poems are comforting and fun to read out in the sun. You will feel healed by her thoughts and strengthened by her perseverance in the face of unending challenges.

Love and Intimacy<br />15. Your New Picture<br /><br />You will find questions like: \\"What do you want that you are not having?\\" At the end of the first chapter there is a \\"Deservability Treatment\\" where you can read affirmations and perhaps extract one or two sentences for daily reflection like: \\"I am willing to create new thoughts about myself and about my life. My new thinking becomes new experiences.\\"<br /><br />There are many places where you can record your own thoughts about various topics like love, sex, work, money, success, failure and God. There is a place to write a story of your life and to draw a picture of your inner child.<br /><br />The chapter on health might jumpstart a new healthy journey into nutrition and wellness.<br /><br />If you want to pass this book along to a friend, you could also buy a small journal and make notes in the journal instead of on the pages. This book could also be used as inspiration for journal writing. This book gave me a great idea - to create an entire book just of affirmations. A lot of our self-talk can make us miserable or enlightened.<br /><br />Louise L. Hay also focuses on reflection, meditation, visualization and relaxation. She presents a pathway to a more positive and fulfilling life that is filled with daily discoveries of beauty and nurturing elements.

My sniggling (something between a snicker and a giggle), giggling and laughing loudly intermittently got me sent to my room because I was enjoying life too much while my husband stared aimlessly at the TV.<br /><br />While many may say this is Bridget Jones at a Tony Robbins seminar, I have concluded this is much more Bridget Jones awakening to the words of Deepak Chopra. How could anyone miss: \\"your body's inherent wisdom.\\" She is so yoga at times all while reminding me fondly of my best friend in high school who would have me rolling on the floor laughing as we composed fake letters about boys we had met at the beach. Just as we imagined these delicious and uninhibited revelations of fantasy, Cathryn Michon will at times embellish life so as to awaken a woman's wicked naughty side, all while having innocent fun.<br /><br />Throughout this work-of-art-comedy-routine-in-print, you will be swept into a world of delicious wit, enlivening humor, total honesty, beyond total honesty and did I mention, TOTAL honesty? With a vocabulary to die for at times, Cathryn Michon weaves images of reality with precision.<br /><br />Through her writing we come to understand her preoccupation with spontaneous doughnut fulfillment and observe her self-destructive patterns of behavior leading her to certain doom. It is in these moments when inspiration strikes and revelations are born of an awakened consciousness in the face of death itself. She also confronts societal ills with a high-class clarity and explores the synchronicity of life. Like Bridget, she learns life's best lessons through putting herself through the paces. She must experience life, sometimes fail and eventually rise to the occasion as a Grrl Genius. This makes her loveable, human and oh so funny.<br /><br />The Grrl Genius Guide to Life is also filled with research on the subject of scientific discoveries. You will be amazed at what has been hidden by society and then revealed by the Grrl Genius herself.<br /><br />In fact, you may shock your friends by revealing the details of Einstein's life or explaining how the cotton gin was actually invented by a woman. I learned how to live longer by relaxing in steam rooms and how to understand the deepest of life's mysteries through careful observations.<br /><br />Sweep aside mundane realities, it is time to pull out the pink postits and cover your refrigerator with quotes like:<br /><br />\\"Today is the First Day of the Rest of My Genius.\\"<br /><br />I loved reading about the cooking competition and at times the writing reads like sardonic slapstick with an evil twist. The author has one of those naughty minds always willing to devise creative revenge tactics for playful investigation only.<br /><br />Various phrases and sentences also make for witty banter between friends in adapted versions. I said one line while talking on the phone and my friend thought it was brilliant. Do I feel like a genius after reading this book? Yes, and I felt very happy too because I love to find a humorous read that makes me laugh all the way through the book.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewion as a Grrl Genius.

251616:US	50199793	RCT23KDCYXILB	1566561868	955413533	On Entering the Sea: The Erotic and Other Poetry of Nizar Qabbani (Poetry Series)	Books	5	12	15	N	Y	A Tribute to Love and Life	I had thought your love would end my estrangement<br />but you passed like water between my fingers<br /><br />~Nizar Qabbani<br /><br />In my eternal search for poetry infused with images of water and passion, \\"On Entering the Sea\\" appeared on the Amazon horizon. How I love this site and the ability to locate life-enhancing selections of great beauty.<br /><br />The poetry of Nizar Qabbani requires atmosphere and an imagination willing to travel beyond the daily drudgery of existence into longings for home, passionate encounters and the mysteries of sensation. At times his poems have echoes of ancient works that intertwine themselves with modern complexity. His work celebrates the love of country, women and sensuous images of coffeehouses and Andalusian experiences.<br /><br />I write<br />to save the woman I love<br />from the cities of no poetry,<br />  of no love<br />the cities of frustration and gloom<br />I write to make her a misty cloud<br /><br />Only woman and writing<br />Save us from death.<br /><br />As an introduction to Nizar Qabbani, On Entering the Sea presents his work in a pleasing arrangement by translator. While the introduction by Salma Khadra Jayyusi presents an overview of the book, how I wished for a section at the end to explain the details behind many of the poems. Would this enhance my enjoyment or do the poems speak of moments so profound, no other explanation is needed? It could be said that many of his poems have a universal appeal and need no further explanation.<br /><br />While his words glow with a love for the female essence in life and in women, he also explores thoughts of protecting his home, lands he loves and a different perspective on war and loss. \\"Posters\\" may be shocking to some and yet it is a representation of how Nizar Qabbani sees the world and wishes for peace all while declaring war on pride. It is highly political and yet he delves into the heart of freedom for all people. Although, I think there are poems I have yet to read which apparently display a more revolutionary approach, although this is not foreign to poets the world over. I enjoyed reading Jerusalem:<br /><br />Jerusalem, beloved city of mine,<br />tomorrow your lemon trees will bloom,<br />your green stalks and branches rise up joyful,<br />and your eyes will laugh...<br /><br />He experienced so much pain and loss and was very controversial, especially in his hometown in Damascus where he challenged cultural taboos. Too often I think we as a society have condemned the erotic, all while longing for erotic pleasures of our own. Nizar Qabbani not only sets desire free in poems, he sets women free from oppression. In \\"Diary of an Indifferent Woman,\\" he writes as a woman:<br /><br />I want to escape from my own skin<br />from my own voice, from my own language<br />and stray like the fragrance of gardens<br />I want to flee from my own shadow<br />and from all addresses<br /><br />By the end of the poem he talks about crystal bottles with dead butterflies and the images become revelations of eternal struggles for independence and for the freedom to love. During his teenage years, his sister committed suicide, because she could not marry the man she loved.<br /><br />Time after time Nizar Qabbani displays an exceptional understanding of what it means to be female all while revealing what it means to be a man. Insatiable physical love and ecstasy from the sheer vision of a woman become spiritual expressions of love for God himself. \\"The Book of Love\\" is worshipful and timeless.<br /><br />The name of my love.<br />I wrote it on the water.<br />I did not know<br />That the wind rushes by without listening,<br />That names dissolve in the water.<br /><br />He also asks: \\"What is Love?\\" Then he humorously explains how he cannot change the woman he loves for she is \\"a storm trapped in a bottle.\\"<br /><br />Most of the poems are pleasing and passionate, but there are poems displaying private pain and horror as love is ripped from his hands by the ravages of terror. He perfectly describes his grief in an unusual moment where he is standing in the rubble of an attack and remembers his wife and the cadence of her name.<br /><br />As he finds her handbag in the rubble, we are convinced no man has ever loved his wife this deeply, and yet the universal message makes us realize how many have loved and lost and longed for a woman like Balquis Al-Rawi. The vision he paints of honey, jasmine moons, rubies and roses will remain in my memory for as long as I love poetry.  As in many passionate poems, the feelings of the poet flowed through me and appeared in tears. His poem about his mother's death is equally poignant and we are left with the scent of coffee, cardamom seeds and orange blossom water.<br /><br />If you are a lover of world poetry, the poems of Nizar Qabbani are essential reading. Through his poems you feel the ancient longings of all people in all lands and in his uncensored thoughts, we can truly experience life through his eyes. I can only hope more of his work is translated in the near future. The exciting element of his poetry is often how he absorbs experience and then defeats his own inner tyranny by writing exactly what he thinks to display the beauty of truth. You will hear echoes in his writing and realize how many contemporary spiritual teachers and poets have been students of his poetry.<br /><br />To peace...<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewd from his hands by the ravages of terror.

Throughout this brilliant work, Kay Redfield Jamison exhibits an insightful and calmly observant approach in the midst of manic-depressive complexity.<br /><br />She explores the reasons artists, writers, and composers are often fearful of the dampening of creativity through the use of chemicals like lithium. Although she often notes the tendency towards various addictions artists use to escape the erratic nature of mood disorders.<br /><br />The creative temperament seems to feed off emotional turmoil and often in the works of great poets we can feel the soul's turbulence. The reality of heightened imaginative powers, depression, insomnia, fatigue, rapid thoughts, inflated self-esteem, panic attacks, rage and emotional intensity of various varieties can all swim about in an ocean of ever changing periods of heightened creativity and suicidal tendencies. Within this ocean, brilliance is often born and fed by the storms raging in artist's minds.<br /><br />For the most part the author explains how many can life a normal life, yet as we read the descriptions and excerpts, we soon realize many danced too close to the cliff of despair and became a danger to themselves. Kay Redfield Jamison presents sweeping overviews of many authors and then delves into individual experience. She uncovers the lives of Robert Schumann, Ernest Hemingway, Vincent Van Gogh, Herman Melville, Virginia Woolf, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Alfred, Lord Tennyson.<br /><br />According to the author and extensive analysis of current research, moody musicians, volatile poets and troubled artists may in fact be bipolar. This theory is explored in depth with over one-third of the book dedicated to cataloging the researcher's sources.<br /><br />There is much to learn here, like the difference between cyclothymia and manic-depressive illness. Some of the artists heal themselves through artistic expression, especially in May if they don't commit suicide in the same month. Others produce more writing in autumn.<br /><br />Poetry led me by the hand out of madness. ~Anne Sexton<br /><br />As the lives of numerous mercurial writers are explored, a common thread of creativity weaves itself into a blanket of madness which seems to seek to suffocate its victims with torturous emotions and dark nights of the soul.<br /><br />This then becomes a fascinating and intellectual read for anyone who has an interest in writing, poetry, psychiatry or the artistic temperament. If you write poetry or enjoy writing in general, this book could be most revealing and will explain why at times you might stay awake for 24 hours writing like mad and then have absolutely no desire to write for weeks at a time. While the author focuses on more extreme cases of bipolar disorder, she does give hope to the world by explaining that many who have bipolar disorder do mostly live normal lives. If you can call being on an eternal rollercoaster of intense emotions normal or even bearable throughout an entire life.<br /><br />While people who are bipolar may have periods when they feel absolutely fine, there is always the fear of the unknown, the dark night that is again fast approaching. After reading this book you will understand authors like Dorothy Parker and Virginia Woolf in a new light even though the author doesn't mention Parker.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewymia and manic-depressive illness.

We listened to the whole album, and I asked to hear it again.\\"<br /><br />Andrew K. Stone captures moments in imaginative descriptions and uncommon observations. He not only creates an entire world of musical experience, he invites you to observe the relationship between two main characters as their friendship develops and one life spins out of control.<br /><br />Through a revelatory process, Kevin observes the life of Phiz, a musician. As Phiz rises to fame, Kevin observes how childhood experience haunts our lives as adults. This is as much a book about inner dialogue as it is about friendship. What is happening in Phiz's mind and what does Kevin observe and process through his own psyche? There are also moments with lyrics and many conversations between the musicians.<br /><br />It is rare for a novel to capture and keep my attention to the last sentence. Andrew K. Stone has cleverly woven a novel filled with an inside look at the music business. If you have any interest in the life of a musician, then this book has much to offer.<br /><br />The author is a musician and has played guitar and bass in Boston and New York-based bands. He also studied Communications and English at Boston University. Andrew K. Stone's writing style is appealing and intellectually fulfilling. He cleverly weaves a story of Phiz's life through Kevin's observations and much of the first few chapters end up being extremely significant at the end of the book.<br /><br />All Flowers Die is filled with excellent character development and lyrical insight. After reading this book you may find you want to read more about Kevin. He seems to have a superior mind and a deep thoughtful approach to life. I look forward to any novel Andrew K. Stone writes in the future. A finely crafted work!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2005-04-30

It's true.\\" ~Carrie Myers Smith<br /><br />With all the makeover shows on TV, we already realize it takes a lot of effort to look like a model. Since I tend to be one of those tall people who can't fit into petite clothes no matter how much I weigh, I'm always hunting for longer sleeves and wondering why being taller often forces me to buy clothes that are just too big for me. I had also started to disassociate myself from those who wield photo-capturing devices because I rarely liked how my pictures turned out. Is this because I'm comparing my pictures to pictures on the covers of magazines?<br /><br />As I viewed the most recent Swimsuit Edition, I did wonder if even men were not longing to view some women with hips or a more comfortable shape. The facts are, most of the models we view are tiny or look sickly in reality. If pictures add pounds, imagine how skinny they really are. Many models (size 2-8) say they feel sick all the time. Why do we all want to look like teenage boys? I don't. I'm proud of my hips and feminine curves.<br /><br />Carrie Myers Smith is also tired of the Media pushing an unrealistic image on the public and presents a realistic view of the fashion industry. Most of us will never be a size 4 or 6 and the facts are that the average American woman is a size 14. So, this book is definitely needed to show us the reality instead of the fantasy.<br /><br />There is the fantasy body image and then there is reality. You can be healthy and not be a size 6. If you are tired of quick-fix theories and want to be who you are, then you can read about what is \\"eating you\\" instead of what to eat. Topics Include:<br /><br />Why Diets Don't Work<br />Living Life on Purpose - Not by Accident<br />Stress-Savers<br />Self-Care or Self-Nurturing<br />Games Other People Play<br /><br />Carrie talks about the much-needed topic of \\"Healthy Living Saboteurs.\\" As my husband said, \\"Those are people who are purposely trying to sabotage your diet.\\" To him I say: \\"Honey, stop bringing home those boxes of cookies and giant tubs of cashew nuts.\\" OK, I can't eat either of those items, but still I think after reading this book I realized he does tend to bring home all the food I would never buy.<br /><br />There is also a spiral-bound version of this book or you can download a workbook from the books' site. Each chapter has \\"Stepping Stones\\" points for reflection.<br /><br />Do you need to:<br /><br />De-clutter your life? Donate Items to Charity?<br />Develop healthy habits?<br />Be happier with your body type?<br />Set realistic goals?<br />Hire a personal trainer?<br /><br />So, can you enjoy a few Leonidas chocolate squares and not feel guilty about it? Sure the author isn't presenting a diet plan. She is presenting an \\"Indi-Fit-ual\\" Plan. What are you trying to accomplish? There are many ideas for how you can multitask to fit in exercise. I've found I can fold laundry while doing the Walk Away the Pounds workouts, but you could also listen to motivational CDs while on your treadmill or take your pet out for a walk. I was thinking I couldn't go walking with my pets, but then I found a pet stroller for my cats.<br /><br />Carrie Myers Smith has decided that no one and absolutely nothing is going to get in the way of her self-esteem. So, reading this book gives you a good helping of personal power and creative ideas for implementing her ideas. I loved her \\"Bringing the Spa Home\\" section where she talks about creating a sanctuary. Can I just say: \\"Er'go candles!\\"<br /><br />This book could take any woman from tired and frazzled to self-nurturing and in control. It is amazing how much information this book provides in 250 pages. A must-read for every woman in our society who is fed up with being told she has to look like she is starving to death. While I know I'll never be a size 6 I have nothing against airbrushing a picture. I sure hope someone airbrushes the pictures from my last photo shoot. Hee..hee...<br /><br />Buy this book and then go sit out in the sun, read this book and enjoy life. Life is far too short to worry about being a size 6 when you may always be a size 14. Look into Yoga, Pilates and a walking routine, it helps with the stress of life.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewbook and then go sit out in the sun, read this book and enjoy life.

Without Christ there would be no Christian faith. No Christian ethics. ~ Charles Panati<br /><br />Throughout \\"Words to Live By\\" there is a definite message and that message is about living a good life through adherence to common sense and gems of folk wisdom. There are quotes from famous authors and discussions about wisdom, honesty, responsibility, self-respect, charity, love, happiness, life purpose, friendship, loyalty, tolerance, conscience, freedom, self-fulfillment, forgiveness, healing, hope, faith, honor and reputation.<br /><br />What comes from the heart, goes to the heart. ~Samuel Taylor Coleridge<br /><br />Each chapter begins with a statement that is prominent in our popular culture. These are familiar sayings that you will instantly recognize. In the \\"Life is a bowl of Cherries\\" chapter, we learn all about happiness and life purpose. The author gives the definition for Happiness and shows how the word originated from the Middle English \\"happi\\" which means to be favored by luck. He then goes on to state the significance, related virtues and opposite traits. The notes that follow are based on quotes, popular culture, historical records and interesting occurrences. If you have never heard the lyrics by Buddy G. DeSilva and Lew Brown, then you might be interested to read:<br /><br />The moon belongs to ev'ryone,<br />The best things in life are free.<br /><br />Charles Panati also shows how various sayings have been changed over time. For instance: \\"Money is the root of all evil\\" should actually be: \\"For the love of money is the root of all evil.\\" He shows how humans change the wording and George Bernard Shaw wrote \\"Lack of money is the root of all evil.\\"<br /><br />The facts are, this book is stunning from the perspective of detailed research. In order to find all these items and collect them in one book shows a definite love for understanding our current culture and cultures of the past.<br /><br />The section on Tolerance explores the main beliefs of a variety of religions from Hinduism to Christianity. You can read about the Golden Rule or compare the Gods of various religions. Is the God of Abraham much more harsh and why was God not tolerant of the other religions present in the Old Testament? To understand this more fully, I suppose it helps to know why God objected to the sacrifice of human children.<br /><br />Then, on to more annoying pretentious matters, like: \\"I told you so.\\" This phrase has apparently been traced back to Lord Byron in his work Don Juan.<br /><br />Mostly, this is a study of how familiar quotes came into being and you may find yourself jotting down quotes or enjoying the relentless detective skills that went into creating this book.

Her book encourage you to solve the unsolvable, calm yourself down in times of stress (breathing techniques), take risks and find out what is important.<br /><br />If you have noticed that your energy is often connected to your emotions, this book will be enlightening in that regard. Your emotional well being is very connected to your energy and just being around positive people can make you feel more energetic.<br /><br />We all know that unmanaged stress is a major health risk.

In the Dark Night, we may feel an intensity of despair, fear, and depressiveness that seems intolerable. Yet as we learn to bear the unbearable, we gradually settle into the darkness, sensing not only its heaviness and lack of light, but also its fertility. Seeds grow in the dark. So do we. ~Robert Augustus Masters<br /><br />Through Robert Augustus Masters' poetic expression, we enter a spiritual world filled with eternal paradox. In this world we are \\"dying to live\\" as we emerge from our own ashes or at least move from suffering to openness.<br /><br />Truth is the heart of paradox, the revelatory logic of Being. ~Robert Augustus Masters<br /><br />Robert Augustus Masters rises far above mainstream meandering mediocrity as his words merge with a divine knowing. This is original work, untainted by today's typical spiritual jargon. There is no placid perception here or regurgitated illumination. He intuitively understands spiritual paradox and goes straight to the heart of spirituality. The infinite and finite dance playfully together and then suddenly dive into a profound swirling of metaphors interspersed with poetry.<br /><br />Rainy shore, shimmering sheets of darkly slumping sky<br />Leaning am I into the windchilled thrill of daybreak<br />Ocean thunder and a deeper thunder within and all around<br />And I am ground, ground to sand<br />Drowned, drowned in torrents of broken cloud<br />Spilling shattered against another shore<br /><br />Robert Augustus Masters sheds new light on why we should love our enemies and logically presents his thoughts on why forgiveness enhances our lives. His poetic writing illuminates the mind with awakening concepts and his explanation of why we should move beyond hope and \\"enter into doing\\" helps us progress towards our goals much more quickly. When does our spiritual life truly begin? Is freedom from desire the cessation of desire? His work is also filled with practical applications for profound spiritual principles. He has worked as a psychotherapist and teacher and presents his ideas in a creatively truthful manner. Divine Dynamite holds a conversation with your heart and goes beyond cognitive understanding.<br /><br />In \\"What's Right about What's Wrong in Relationship,\\" I could relate to the endless effort of maintaining an intimate relationship, but also understood the necessity of being in certain environments to grow as a soul or to endure moments of turbulence (jealousy, anger) and chaos (obsession, possessiveness) in order to awaken or find \\"freedom through intimacy.\\" This chapter was especially meaningful and the poems in this chapter are intensely beautiful.<br /><br />Essay Highlights (Although I loved every one of the 44 essays!):<br /><br />Suffering Versus Pain - Until I read this chapter I didn't realize they were different. Suffering being more about acting out the pain.<br /><br />Riding a Wave of Everlasting Morning - The writing in this chapter is some of the finest I've ever seen. Metaphor heaven.<br /><br />Avoiding Death Is Killing Us - What is death and how can it be a beginning? How are we affected by spiritual cycles of death and rebirth?<br /><br />Divine Dynamite takes you away from ordinary existence and unlocks the chained labyrinths of the mind. If you enjoy finding solace in the complexity of sentence structure, you will enjoy the spiritual beauty intertwined with the ever-changing cycles of existence. Diving Dynamite is truly a work of art with transforming power and penetrating insight! If you are awake, this will be bliss.

Most surprisingly, they have been forgotten by those presumed to know them best: the Christian churches themselves. ~Peter Wittstock<br /><br />Do all Christians believe the same things in regards to what Jesus taught? Did Jesus encourage the disciples to draw their own conclusions?<br /><br />These are some of the questions Peter Wittstock answers in his new book. You may not agree with all the author's assertions, but this book does give insight into the life of Christ and his teachings.<br /><br />Peter Wittstock presents 125 commands complete with notes about the original Greek. His clear and vivid interpretations give insight to the reader and give a guide to authentic Christian faith. You can learn about why Jesus told his followers to \\"Do good to those who hate you, \\" or \\"Bless those who curse you.\\" Jesus also explains why we should not judge by appearances or why we should be ready to forgive so we too can be forgiven.<br /><br />If you love reading the KJV, you may find yourself looking up verses. I was looking for a book about the teachings of Jesus when this book appeared. Two of my favorite verses in this book:<br /><br />\\"Give and it will be given to you.\\" (Luke 6:38)<br /><br />\\"Very truly, I tell you, whoever keeps my word will never see death.\\" (John 8:51)<br /><br />Yet another book influenced by Sept 11, 2001.The author also includes \\"A Revelation Concerning the Destruction of the World Trade Center in New York City.\\" By reading the preface you will learn why this was included.<br /><br />While many churches state that belief is all you need to make it out of this world alive (gain everlasting life through belief in Jesus Christ), Peter Wittstock questions this amnesty to \\"everyone who believes.\\" He questions the spiritual delusion of individuals professing to believe in Christ, but struggling to keep the commands. I do have the feeling that the only person who could keep all of the commands would be Jesus himself, but at least we have a goal and the information needed to work towards a more faithful life.<br /><br />One of my friends reminded me that we have all been rule breakers from the start and it is comforting to know that Jesus Christ has open arms, willing to forgive us when we fall off the path or make a mistake. The section on \\"Obligation or Option\\" is an interesting study and the author presents the opinions of many spiritual teachers. Peter Wittstock also takes a lot of time at the start of the book to explain why he selected the 125 Commands instead of including all the commands. There are commands about fishing or weeping that were not included because they may not be relevant to the lives of followers today.<br /><br />If you have been looking for a book about Jesus' teachings, you may not be alone. I looked for years and as they say: \\"when the student is ready, the teacher appears.\\" Personally I've found that when I try to follow the commands I have more peace in my life and I am happier. The burden of the commands of Jesus are emotionally lighter than the burden of dealing with inner chaos. A good example is when you forgive and your burden is much lighter than when you hold onto a grudge or refuse to forgive. Through reading this beautiful book, I think you will gain insight into the life of Christians and also gain a new respect for those who are trying to follow these commands.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><br />Names of Christ by T.C.

Series)	Books	5	6	8	N	N	The Way The Truth The Life	Thou shalt call his name Jesus; for he shall save his people from their sins. (Matthew 1:21)<br /><br />Throughout the Bible, Jesus has many names. He is called the Lily of the Valley, the Bright and Morning Star, King of Kings, Son of Man and the Rose of Sharon.<br /><br />If you love the words of Christ, then this book will explain who He is and why more than 300 names reveal an intimate portrait of a man who gave his life for the sins of the world.<br /><br />Each name also has devotional prayers and could be used to enrich your devotional time. The names have been classified into:<br /><br />1. Literal Functions - prophet, priest, king<br />2. Metaphorical Functions - Shepherd, bread of life<br />3. Poetic Functions - lily of the valley or morning star<br /><br />The names in this book originated from the King James Version, but the author has added alternative names from the NIV for those unfamiliar with the KJV. This can be helpful because the KJV uses the word \\"Daysman\\" and the NIV uses \\"Arbitrator.\\" The main headings are the KJV words and then there is a note at the end of each section if there is a word change in the NIV.<br /><br />Even if you have been reading about Jesus since you were a small child, there is a wealth of information here you may have never considered. I was especially interested in the \\"bundle of Myrrh\\" comments. There is a beautiful story about a traveler who is refreshed by wild jasmine. The connection is then made with a bundle of myrrh. Myrrh is actually a fragrance/essential oil that makes you more introspective, encourages expression and exalts the spirit.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><br />Hear Him by Peter Wittstock<br />10 Keys to Unlocking the Bible by Colin S.

In each chapter you can also find small notes about what you will discover or learn. There is also a section explaining the reason for worship and a section with a prayer at the end of the chapter.

We must discard the conclusion that we are powerless in an infinite universe...it is time to awaken and greet a dawn we have never before encountered. ~Jean-Claude Koven<br /><br />Larry seems to be on a modern day Pilgrim's Progress journey where the obstacles are shadow \\"selves.\\" After finding himself drawn to adopting a new puppy, he meets Zeus and they embark upon a spiritual journey within the Joshua Tree National Park. In this quest to unravel cosmic mysteries they often journey beyond the normal plane of existence or at least move beyond the traditional spiritual paradigm.<br /><br />As Larry \\"downloads\\" information, his knowledge increases and the various states reminded me of a spiritual-style computer game complete with guided imagery and insurmountable challenges. What you learn at the start of the game is essential to understanding the end of the game, as terms are normally explained once and then woven into complex sentences that then become the intellectual playground.<br /><br />The main protagonist is placed in an Alice in Wonderland style world where nature is animated and teachers appear as birds, raccoons, rocks and trees. Instead of talking to flowers, Larry has extended spiritual sessions with a tree. There is an exploration of the inner world as seen in mythological mirrors.<br /><br />A tree becomes a psychologist and Kichi is a spinner of dreams and seems to represent Larry's subconscious world. Zeus is a dog guru who presents various situations and challenges for Larry to explore. This can present disturbing or even threatening situations and yet the purpose seems to be to convince Larry to evolve into a spiritual being who is awake and creatively attempting to break free from the veil of forgetting preventing him from realizing his true potential and personal power. (Beings incarnated on Earth live in a land of duality where belief and emotion are the main forces of motivation. The illusion is reality and godlike beings pretend to be just human because they have forgotten they are gods.)<br /><br />The chapters are arranged quite cleverly with each adventure discussing another aspect of what you learned in the previous chapter. Jean-Claude Koven is a master teacher in this regard, although the metaphysical wisdom is at times presented in a playful manner. Zeus seems to be his flippant side in the disguise of a dog. The what-what bird is a little condescending and seems to become counter productive as we continue reading. The bird seems to serve the book in the same way the word \\"Bingo\\" does. It distracts you from what you just read and opens the mind to new concepts. A rather clever tactic, but ultimately it becomes somewhat annoying until you decide to ignore the repeats.<br /><br />He does present interesting answers to the following questions:<br /><br />Why does the dark side emerge and can this be controlled in human beings?<br />How can righteous indignation be a powerful and damaging force?<br />Would life be simpler if we just believed in crevolution?<br /><br />This may be an eclectic read for many readers, although for some it may feel like home.<br />If you are new to esoteric philosophy you may enjoy an exploration into diverse topics. For those already practicing yoga and exploring chakras, there are a few chapters explaining this in more depth. He weaves in ideas about the phoenix bird, Akashic records, Great Cosmic Triangle, Myth of Creation, Pandora's box, Free Will, channeling, vision quests, sacred rituals, omnitude, why reality is falling apart, how to identify our internal archetypes and why we should be aware of the seething cauldron of shadow personalities. However, he shows how we should focus on expression (using these personalities to enhance personal power?) rather than repression.<br /><br />Like any good student of Alice in Wonderland, Jean-ClaudeKoven has woven mystery into a creative story that is more than it appears to be. He also has a few words to say about how you have to transcend your beliefs to fulfill your purpose in life. Is he saying that wanderers are free to avoid all the rules or that rules are unnecessary once you reach certain levels in your spiritual journey?<br /><br />Jean-Claude Koven makes two initial assumptions about reality, as we know it. He seems to believe we chose to incarnate on earth and that seventy million wanderers (light workers) are currently on earth to assist the planet's shift in consciousness and to spread the universal message of love. With this as the premise, he then delves into the eternal questions of life by incorporating wisdom from many cultures and redirecting focus in order to present esoteric notions and new age philosophy (all is one, all is God, raising the cosmic consciousness). He discusses political and social issues pertinent to our times and includes his thoughts on 9/11.<br /><br />Jean-Claude Koven has poured his beliefs into this story and has studied these topics for forty years. He does seem to be following the same paths as Deepak Chopra (Chakras), Neale Donald Walsch, Caroline Myss (sacred contracts and archetypes) and the Controversial David Icke (Virtual-reality dream world idea and links to the Cosmic Instruction Manual seems to be a basis for this book although no extra info on the VeriChip).<br /><br />In the end, this book does seem to promote the awareness that we are souls wandering a planet that is not really our home. If you enjoy phrases like: \\"Time is the canvas on which Creation paints the illusions of reality,\\" then you may find this to be a very enjoyable read.<br /><br />While it is interesting to read a book about our journey on earth, I still personally believe Jesus Christ is the way out of this world alive. I don't see why a belief in one of the greatest teachers of all time is threatening. Just as Larry is born into a new awareness through trials, human beings can also be born into a new life through belief in God's son.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewto be.

Quigley has created a beautiful book about how ordinary women make their lives extraordinary. She interviewed one hundred women to discover the common threads in female spirituality. As you read the quotes from the participants, you start to identify with a variety of ideas.<br /><br />Defining the intangible qualities of spirituality can be challenging and after reading this book you may start to realize that the doorway to spirituality is often through the tangible. What helps you make it through the day? Do you look forward to giving something back to your community through volunteering? Do you feel closer to God while reading a healing book, exercising, creating art, giving emotional support to friends or while singing in church?<br /><br />Michelle A. Quigley interviewed Marketing Coordinators, Saleswomen, Psychologists, Nurses, Teachers, Executives, Waitresses, Secretaries, Mothers, Social Workers, Librarians and Designers for Computer Companies.<br /><br />Each chapter focuses on a specific subject discussed during the interviews. The author includes quotes, observations and notes about her own journey. Many of the women had unique ways of defining spirituality. I also enjoyed reading the section on Spiritual Expressions. Through reading this book you can discover when women feel the most spiritual, when spirituality is difficult at various times in life and how spirituality can make your life more beautiful. There is also a section on the barriers and how you can overcome problems in your life to achieve the euphoric feeling of being close to God.<br /><br />While this book will be interesting to women, there is also a section specifically for men. In this section women explain how they view men who are spiritual and discuss their understanding of male spirituality. The final chapter is filled with encouragement specifically for women.<br /><br />Soul Awakenings is a journey into everyday spirituality and Michelle A.

I have a dream today!\\" ~Martin Luther King, Jr.<br /><br />Amy Pastan has created a photographic story with fascinating details and a fresh perspective based on the latest research. Through reading this biography, children will learn about inhumane segregation laws and why racism is wrong. Definition boxes teach children about nonviolent resistance or grassroots movements.<br /><br />After a trip to India, Martin decided to use Gandhi's nonviolent methods to promote change. This book teaches children that there are ways to change the world without violence and it also shows how resilient you have to be to see change occur in your lifetime. What is really striking about this book is the stories of how students endured such hatred in order to achieve their goals.<br /><br />Amy Pastan also tells the story of how Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote his famous \\"Letter from a Birmingham Jail.\\" In this letter he wrote: \\" Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.\\"<br /><br />There are inspiring stories of great bravery as children take to the streets to protest and demand their freedom. As men march with bold signs that read: \\"I Am a Man,\\" demonstrators start to demand to be respected as a human being.<br /><br />On the last few pages, the author explains why Martin Luther King's birthday has become an occasion where students learn about civil rights and why many dedicate the day to spiritual reflection or sponsor activities that promote change.<br /><br />\\"Our dreams will sometimes be shattered and our ethereal hopes blasted....Difficult and painful as it is, we must walk on in the days ahead with an audacious faith in the future.\\" ~Martin Luther King, Jr.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2005-03-21

It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. ~Marianne Williamson<br /><br />It seems impossible to eradicate the idea of war from our daily existence. War (somewhere on the planet) seems to be a part of daily life, as real as the internal wars of the soul. How can the world ever know peace when we cannot even find ways to be at peace in our homes or in our own communities? It seems we are always fighting an internal war and that war is represented in the experience of physical war.<br /><br />H.P. Willmott, Robin Cross and Charles Messenger explain the reasons behind the most dramatic event in human history. They show how the shock waves of World Wwar II still resonate in our world today. As they analyze the causes of the war and the consequences, we may be able to learn from the past to prevent future destruction.<br /><br />When I read a book like World War II, it does awaken me to the reality of what mankind is capable of in regards to fighting for freedom and trying to suppress freedom. There are shocking accounts of man's cruelty and contrasting accounts of those who would seek to free mankind from tyranny.<br /><br />This book is divided into nine chapters:<br /><br />The Path to War<br />War Begins in Europe<br />Germany Triumphant<br />The War Becomes Global<br />The Initiative Changes Hands<br />The Axis on the Defensive<br />The Allies' Great Offensives<br />The Final Battles<br />A New World<br /><br />World War II is not a calm read and you may find yourself becoming angry or sickened while reading about the atrocities of mankind. Perhaps it is necessary to feel that sense of revulsion in order to make better decisions in the future. There are also interesting moments where pictures show how soldiers adapted to fight in brutal conditions like the picture of the Finnish ski soldier or the pictures of beach landings. The stories of survival will give you a new respect for the soldiers fighting for freedom, while the stories of cruelty and brutality towards human beings will leave you sickened. The hope on the faces of liberated POWs with emaciated bodies and children starving to death because they had to give up food so soldiers could stay in the war makes you think about war on a much deeper level.<br /><br />\\"...it is a vast furnace lit by the reflection of the flames. And when night arrives, on of those scorching, howling, bleeding nights, the dogs plunge into the Volga and swim desperately to gain the other bank. The nights in Stalingrad are a terror for them. Animals flee this hell... only men endure.\\" Pg. 138<br /><br />Throughout this well illustrated book, you will find quotes, illustrations of propaganda, stories of heroism, notes from soldiers on the battle field and observers of the destruction, pictures of weapons, timelines, pictures of battle scenes all over the world and maps showing the advancement of various armies involved in conflicts. One of the most shocking pictures in this book does not even contain soldiers at war, it shows a million pairs of shoes at an extermination camp.<br /><br />Some of the more interesting topics include the making of penicillin, how POWs survived by making their own sandals, charts showing war losses, information on the changes occurring in society throughout the war, how civilians reacted to the war, children being sent to the countryside, the role of women in the war, why owning a radio was forbidden in many countries, why household items were turned into armaments or other goods for the armed forces and the food soldiers ate in contrast with what the civilians had to eat. My main interest while reading this book seems to be to see how human beings survived such a great terror and destruction of their daily lives.<br /><br />The section on Wartime Cinema is also of interest as it shows how humor lightened the mood of the world and how movies helped to give hope to the world's oppressed. It also shows how everything can be used for good or evil, because there are instances where movies definitely encouraged evil actions with a message of hate.<br /><br />The final chapter shows how the individuals started to rebuild the shattered world and the authors explore the differences between the two world wars and why the second was a continuation of the first.<br /><br />My thought about war is that it will continue to occur until humans spend more time loving and less time hating and being selfish. That is the only way the world can know peace. The irony is however very apparent, because when we love freedom, we have to fight for freedom. Freedom itself has never been free.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewthere are instances where movies definitely encouraged evil actions with a message of hate.

These guides help me to understand the world and the 1,200 photographs, illustrations and maps in the Eyewitness Turkey Guide are stunning in beauty. I loved the two page spread of the Library of Celsus (one of the most famous Roman sites in Turkey) that is still standing after an earthquake.<br /><br />While reading you enter into a world of bathing pools with the remains of marble columns, Medieval castles, Turkish baths, old harbors with remnants of city walls, waterfalls, modern cities, underground cities, rock-cut monasteries, outdoor markets, Roman mosaics, cathedrals with unique architecture, mosques with beautiful gardens and palaces.<br /><br />I'd love to walk through the Topkapi Palace, which is now a public museum. The authors explain how you need to take guided tours through various sections, so that is helpful information to know before you plan a trip.<br /><br />If you are interested in Turkish music, you can read about the traditional instruments. I'm currently listening to \\"Art of the Turkish Ud\\" and the album \\"Ahenk Turkish Classical Music\\" has me intrigued.<br /><br />The main chapters:<br /><br />Introducing Turkey - This section paints a portrait of Turkey by exploring beguiling seascapes, brooding mountains and the tranquility of lakes. Pictures hint at the beauty of the sapphire water and ancient ruins. You will want to jump into these pictures and soak up the sun. You can read about the history of Turkey and read about the Hellenistic Age and The Byzantine Empire.<br /><br />Istanbul Area by Area - This section shows you how Turkey's largest city is divided into four sightseeing areas. There are street-by-street maps, story boxes to explore specific subjects in detail and suggested routes for walking through the city.<br /><br />Turkey Region by Region - The rest of the country is divided into seven regions and each has its own chapter. Pictorial maps, town maps, the top sights and detailed information makes this a fascinating study.<br /><br />Travelers' Needs - A section with information on where to stay, where to eat, shopping and entertainment. You can choose to stay in an opulent palace or a smaller summer house. You could even sleep out under the stars.<br /><br />The authors explain how you can get great deals by paying cash and explore a variety of exciting entertainment locations, like ski resorts, whitewater rafting, pony trekking or sailing. It sounds romantic to take a rail tour or to explore ruins. There is a survival guide section explaining customs, etiquette, currency and how to use a card phone.<br /><br />Perfect for the armchair traveler or for planning a trip to Turkey. This is one of my favorite DK guides. It truly awakens the traveling spirit and encourages you to think about journeying out into the world.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewdivided into seven regions and each has its own chapter.

Kem Knapp Sawyer explores Anne Frank's life in Amsterdam and then shows how her life changed as she was forced to hide in the secret annex. She explains the frustrations Anne felt as she was locked in just a few rooms and how her emotions often overwhelmed her and how her situations brought on depression.<br /><br />Anne Frank's story has always fascinated me because it represents the risks human beings will take to protect the innocent and it also shows how individuals can endure great hardship in order to see a new day of freedom. Through her diary we can understand the world of a child hiding from death itself.<br /><br />There are pictures of the diary, pictures of the large bookcase that concealed the entrance to the hiding place and what Anne could see from the attic window. The author also explains how there are three versions of Anne's diary and how her diary was eventually published with original and revised diary entries.<br /><br />As the author notes, we can't always escape suffering and cruelty, but we can try.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2005-03-21

It is a great way to gain insight into a life and Helen Keller is a symbol of overcoming limitations. She refused to live her life shut away in a dark room and instead she taught herself to speak many languages, traveled to many countries and loved to read.<br /><br />Helen Keller's life is truly inspirational and although her life started out in such a bleak way, she overcame many obstacles and eventually exceeded everyone's expectations. She was actually world-famous by the age of 10. It is truly amazing to see the articles she wrote at age 12.<br /><br />After we read about the initial illness that left her blind and deaf, Leslie Garrett takes us on a beautiful journey through Helen's life. She was quite the little prankster as a child and also had a great sense of humor about life in general. She also had a temper and this is where Annie Sullivan enters the picture.<br /><br />We learn about Annie Sullivan's life and how Helen and Annie meet.  Leslie Garrett explains how Helen learns about life and how to live in a world where few people understand her. Annie shows extreme patience in very difficult situations and eventually teaches Helen how to deal with everyday situations. She also teaches her how to read and later on attends college classes with her to spell out the lessons into her hand.<br /><br />Leslie Garrett's writing style is perfect for this story and this is definitely one of my favorite DK biographies. After reading this story, you will never again think about life in the same way.<br /><br />\\"The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart.\\" ~Helen Keller<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2005-03-21

The causes could range from emotional stress (anger, jealousy, worry, fear, insecurity, resentment, hurt), watching too much stressful TV before bed, pain in your body from injuries, anxiety, depression or drinking to many cups of coffee during the day. Insomnia can also be an age-related problem and it does seem that the older I get, the more difficult it is to get to sleep. Having a new kitten has taught me a lot about the joys of sleep and Meesa also seems to love sitting on the edge of my yoga mat while I do yoga.<br /><br />I have noticed a direct correlation between emotional stress and a lack of sleep. When the mind is overly active trying to solve problems, it can be very difficult to fall into a restful sleep. Even answering e-mails later in the evening seems to keep me awake longer.<br /><br />Yoga can magically alleviate emotional stress and give you a center of calm and a place to relax completely into the moment. It is a way of loving yourself and nurturing your body and soul. Yoga is very much about \\"time for you.\\" It is a beautiful escape into your own personal power and into a place where you can feel complete peace and a sense of joy.<br /><br />This book contains excellent advice from an acclaimed professional yoga teacher and an experienced medical doctor.<br /><br />You will find information on the reasons people can't sleep, what the body does while we sleep, how sunlight and darkness affect sleep patterns, how to create good sleep habits, the secrets of a great night's sleep, relaxing Ananda Yoga Postures and affirmations, breathing exercises to lead you into sleep, what to do when you wake up in the middle of the night and want to go back to sleep and if you should consider a snack before bed and what type of snack?<br /><br />So, if you are tired of taking sleep medications, give yoga a try. You can incorporate this into your regular exercise routine or daily routine. I like walking first to get the nervous energy out of my body. Walking also seems to make me happier and when I'm happier, I sleep better.<br /><br />Yoga is a healing therapy that can truly help you to sleep. That is why I generally do relaxing yoga workouts in the evening. There are many different styles of yoga and you may find that one style invigorates your body, while a gentle practice will lead you to a place of complete joy and peaceful sleep. A cup of relaxing herbal tea and a quiet space with candles also seems essential to the process.<br /><br />Gyandev McCord has also created videos to teach the Ananda Yoga routines. Look for Yoga for Busy People and Yoga to Awaken the Chakras. I found that imagining colors inside your body is actually very healing and relaxing. It might sound different, but it definitely works for me.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><br />The Metabolic Plan - Good advice for staying young and balancing your life.<br /><br />Natural Health Magazine Complete Guide to Safe Herbs - Information on Valerian, Kava Kava and Chamomile.<br /><br />Ali MacGraw Yoga Mind & Body - Hypnotic musical score.<br /><br />Crunch Candlelight Yoga - Relaxing candles and soothing stretching poses.<br /><br />Hemalaya Behl's Yoga for Urban Living - Evening Bath helps you relax completely.<br /><br />Yoga Zone Flexibility & Stress Release - At the end of this workout I can truly say I enter a state of bliss.ons, give yoga a try.

I also think Kathy Kolbe is tapping into Intuition, because when you use Intuition, you are technically making decisions based off what you sense vs. the use of a rational process. There are times when everything inside you is saying: \\"GO,\\" and it is based much more on a feeling than a detailed or organized thought process.<br /><br />Kathy Kolbe also presents the idea of fatigue, fear and frustration leading to despair. Once you feel an overwhelming sense of despair, how many good decisions are you prepared to make? She also makes an excellent point about the actions you should take to avoid problems.<br /><br />After reading this book, you may start to tap into your personal power center. If everything inside you is screaming \\"no\\" or \\"stop,\\" then you may want to listen to that inner voice instead of dragging out the process through an extended session of contemplation. I liked her idea about not finishing a book if you are not enjoying it and I have been listening to my inner voice for quite some time on that point.<br /><br />So, with that said, I happened upon page 65 and realized I wanted to go to the website and take a test. When I arrived at the site, I found out you had to pay for the test. So, if you are interested in reading this book, spending time taking a test at a site and then analyzing your results, it could be a fun way to spend a few days learning about yourself.<br /><br />If you decide not to take the test, you can still enjoy this book. I'd be willing to bet that if you are reading this book, you have a good idea of whether your life is out of balance or whether you are in need of taking the test and gaining a sharper focus.<br /><br />The entire book is technically a conversation between Ev and Kathy. Ev being \\"everybody.\\" There are sections where you can record your thoughts. Are you instincts telling you that you have too much stress or too little relaxation? Should you sit down and figure out your priorities? Does knowing your purpose in life put this entire book into perspective? I personally think that if you have a specific purpose in life, you will start to make more instinctive decisions. This book will encourage you to:<br /><br />1. End the cycles of procrastination and action. You will act more quickly.<br />2. Step out of despair and start to believe in your abilities.<br />3. Take no action when nothing works - patience in the midst of conflict.<br />4. Act with a sense of purpose and passion.<br />5. Increase the joy in your life and follow your dreams.<br /><br />This entire book seems to be mostly about balancing your life in order to enhance your creative potential. You may decide to \\"target your top priorities,\\" or make a decision today based on your instincts. Most of my best decisions have come from an extended thought process and some of my worst decisions have been at times when I didn't follow my instincts. I think balance is needed. You could feel fearful or even face overwhelming disappointment, but still know that you are making the right decision. I read this book at exactly the right moment because I had to make a decision based more on instinct than a complex thought process.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewctions where you can record your thoughts.

Bruce Cameron is an expert in \\"male-pattern thinking.\\" He shows you how to beat your man at his own game by utilizing a wicked sense of wit, undying perseverance and playful naughtiness. This does not include undermining your man's ego, but it does send a clear message about being treated fairly.<br /><br />So, should you try to turn your man into Prince Charming, or are men charming enough in their own way? I think men are amazing, especially when they are a challenge. All the men I've ever loved have been irresistible challenges and reading a book like this truly inspires me in my quest for romance, witty conversation and a sense of comfort resulting from unconditional love.<br /><br />How to Remodel a Man can at times read like a comedy of errors. There are also elements of physical comedy woven into words that threw me into fits of laughter, as did the \\"poem,\\" \\"cooking adventure\\" and  \\"sock puppet\\" idea. There were moments during this book where I had to stop reading because I was laughing so hard I could not see the page. When you laugh until you cry, you know the writing is superior.<br /><br />Fortunately this book seems to be divided into three main sections: laughing out loud in places, general amusement (to give you a break), and laughing until you cry. The play-by-play account of Madame Butterfly could be the most enjoyable review of an opera yet.  Oh, and you might cry at the end because of the sheer beauty in the writing.<br /><br />In addition to the intriguing interplay of ideas between all the characters in this book (his children, guy friends and associates at work), you will also discover the answers to the following:<br /><br />What is invisible to men?<br />Is watching sports more about being \\"on the team\\" than competition?<br />What are the three sentiments a man can express to win a woman's heart?<br />Why do men deliberately fail at an assigned task?<br />What verbal game should you only use as a last resort?<br /><br />I adored How to Remodel a Man, not only because of the new insights into the male mind, but because there is heart in this book. I especially enjoyed the playful romance between the author and his art museum accomplice. Then there is a kitten named mitten. How can a man who takes care of his daughter's kitten have any faults?<br /><br />There are many ways to use this book to your best advantage. For instance, if your neighbors have been running about wildly all evening above you and have finally decided to drift off into a peaceful slumber, take out this book and read it for hours and hours. They may find you to be noticeably giggly until late into the night.<br /><br />I'd love to stay and chat, but I have to run to the store for an extra can of Lemon Pledge. You'll see why once you read this book, although the sports scoreboard idea may be more effective and less expensive.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewthe male mind, but because there is heart in this book.

You don't need an ideology or a technology, you need what French women have: a balanced and time-tested relation to food and life. ~Mireille Guiliano<br /><br />Mireille Guiliano's writing style is pleasantly playful, entertaining and at times deliciously decadent. French Women Don't Get Fat is a celebration of the French way of life. While Americans tend to lean towards \\"unsustainable extremism\\" in diets, French women incorporate slimming secrets into their daily lives. Can they eat pastries all day and stay slim? Should you skip your morning orange juice and drink water instead? Do French women workout at a gym?<br /><br />Mireille Guiliano explains her own discoveries and shows how you can implement changes in your own life as you journey through four stages. First, you analyze your current lifestyle and then you start to make tiny changes that yield amazing results. The main goal seems to be to maintain a personal equilibrium. She encourages us all to \\"start avoiding foods whose ingredients sound like chemical weapons.\\"<br /><br />By page 86, I was almost in tears and by 87 I was in tears. This book made me very homesick for my childhood days and as Mireille reminisced about her childhood and told stories about her grandmother, I started to miss my grandmother's apple tree and picking mulberries as a child. I missed the open-air markets in Seattle and picking fresh peaches off a tree in the backyard of our home in Africa.<br /><br />Is this a diet book, a memoir or a cookbook? When is the last time you found a diet book with a recipe for croissants? When have you ever read a diet book that made you long for your childhood or dream of chocolate you purchased in Belgium? While this contains many delicious recipes, it is an unabashed romance with cuisine. You will start to consider having fruit shipped to you seasonally and will have many moments of nostalgia.

This anthology is a collection of poems from four centuries of literary creation.<br /><br />Many of the poems are classic in themes of longing and loss. There are poems of great sorrow and poems of great passion. Most of the poems either reflect on the nature of love or seem to be written from the perspective of a lover.<br /><br />I have recently discovered the effects of mood on the reading of poetry. These poems may seem overly dreary on an evening when you are missing the person you love or they can be seen more creatively in the light of day.<br /><br />As you read poetry, the beauty is often in recognizing the reflection of your own emotions in the mirror of the poet's world. While reading Edmund Spenser's One Day I Wrote Her Name upon the Strand, we can look back at love lost and see how our attempts at permanence are washed away by the waves of time itself.<br /><br />To die in dust, but you shall live by fame:<br />My verse your virtues rare shall eternize,<br />And in the heavens write your glorious name,<br /><br />You may recognize many famous poems throughout this work, although many were new to me. When we studied Andrew Marvell's \\"The Definition of Love\\" in school, how could the poem have meant as much in such an innocent state. Now, years later we understand impossibility, fate's jealous eye, the parallel lines that never meet. So, it is worth reading many of these poems again with new eyes and a more experienced heart.<br /><br />Does Thomas Campbell's poem speak too much truth about love or is he simply focusing on infatuation and the fires of love?<br /><br />Love's a fire that needs renewal<br />Of fresh beauty for its fuel:<br />Love's wing moults when caged and captured,<br />Only free, he soars enraptured.<br /><br />In this tiny book, you will find Edgar Allan Poe's \\"To One in Paradise\\" and Robert Browning's beautiful \\"Meeting at Night\\" with images of a gray sea and a moon large and low. I love the images of miles of warm sea-scented beach and fields the lover must cross to hear the voice of his true love. D. H. Lawrence's Gloire de Dijon was a definite find. I also found quite a few poems with water images, which I love.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewradise\\" and Robert Browning's beautiful \\"Meeting at Night\\" with images of a gray sea and a moon large and low.

I finally reached the point of giving up. How much longer did I want to make myself suffer? ~Barbara Wright Abernathy<br /><br />Barbara Wright Abernathy is a true survivor of love. Her dreams of marriage and love were destroyed three times and in her new book, she speaks from a life of experience. She was born to lead and yet she still enjoys men opening doors and makes excellent points about the increased demands on a working woman.<br /><br />Venus On Top is a book for women who have grown weary in the unsatisfying presence of mediocre men. The type of men who are still floundering about trying to discover purpose or who have not yet come to the realization of love as a gift to humanity itself. These types of men can at times take you to hell and leave you there. They destroy you financially, physically and emotionally and then leave you to burn out or use up your resources and walk away, leaving you barren and vulnerable. Barbara finally found a man who could show love instead of destroying love.<br /><br />Barbara writes beautifully about her relationship with her husband and he seems more than willing to allow her soul's beauty to shine like the star she was born to become. She believes women are either star women or earth mothers. You can also enhance the good qualities of each female archetype. The shadow elements are enlightening.<br /><br />As she weaves stories from mythology and explains ancient goddess civilizations, she explores the possibilities of the modern goddess lifestyle. This goes beyond the basics of feminism and gives you ideas on how to allow men to pleasure you in ways you may not have imagined they could. I have to agree with the author about the erotic nature of a man helping with the housework. There is something exciting about a man participating in a relationship and caring for you and showing a desire to be a true partner.<br /><br />I have noticed that my husband loves to go the store to purchase food he thinks I will enjoy. So, while this book promotes the idea of a man cleaning the house, this might not be your husband's style. You may have more success hiring a housecleaner. Your husband may want to show his love in other ways.<br /><br />This book is mostly for Star Women who are in a relationship with a Comet Man (Was this pun intended?). This becomes more apparent as you read the book in depth. Comet Men are men who experience great pleasure from pleasing a woman and from loving a woman. They are the poets of the world, the men who make you breakfast in bed...and sigh... it is a thing of beauty.<br /><br />I do have to make a few comments about why a goddess should stop worrying about toilet seats and laundry and consider giving her sex slave his own bathroom. I mean common, all this power and money and the man can't have his own space? If a man hates doing the laundry, why force him to learn how to sort the laundry so he doesn't color your panties pink with red socks? I mean, at some point you have to realize that some men will resent having to do all the housework.<br /><br />Barbara does provide quite a few realistic guidelines like \\"8 Steps to Power\\" and even shares many \\"top secret\\" male fantasies. If you are thinking this book is all about pleasing a woman, then you might be surprised to find information on how to unleash your sex goddess so you can please your um \\"sex slave\\" and drive him crazy with your womanly powers.<br /><br />With all this said, I don't understand her comment about the idea of \\"learning how to please a man\\" being an idea lurking in our minds. To me, this is a good idea, not something to be tossed out into the cold. Do men really give love to get sex or are they getting love by having sex? Barbara also cautions against withholding affection and explains how this damages your relationship.<br /><br />The thoughts in this enlightening manual for \\"Star Women\\" will show you how to take charge of your happiness. If you have tried living the life of the submissive housewife and you are tired of being powerless and controllable, then this book could encourage a more peaceful life and you may discover your hidden female power. All relationships are unique and if your man enjoys being more submissive, then this book could encourage more romance and less stress in your relationship. If you are a working woman, this book may give you ideas about the type of relationship you have always desired.<br /><br />To me, the ideal man is the man who does the laundry without you having to ask. He knows when you need his assistance and takes pride in the power he has in regards to your happiness.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewbook could encourage a more peaceful life and you may discover your hidden female power.

A Book of Love Poetry is filled with poems you may have met before in your studies at school or while reading books of poetry. Who could forget \\"My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun\\" or \\"How Do I Love thee? Let me count the ways.\\"<br /><br />There is comfort in the familiarity of Christopher Marlowe's The Passionate Shepherd To His Love where he shows an intuitive understanding of love's fantasy. However, I was not prepared for Sir Walter Ralegh's \\"Her Reply,\\" an almost sarcastic retort, and yet a beautiful poem. I prefer the fantasy Christopher Marlowe paints with his poetic description of love and the two poems do explore the contrast between fantasy and reality. Cecil Day Lewis copies the first two lines from Christopher Marlowe's poem, as if we wouldn't notice.<br /><br />Wit and humor make their appearance in Sally In Our Alley and the last few lines are cute. Many of the poems may make you question the entire idea of love being blind. Is love blind or does love open our eyes to the beauty of existence? Are we not truly blind before we fully love?<br /><br />If you read a book of poetry and find one poem you love, then I think it is worth purchasing the book. The rare discovery is worth the effort and Edwin Morgan's \\"Strawberries\\" was such a discovery. I especially loved the ending of the poem filled with summer lightning and rain.<br /><br />the strawberries glistening<br />in the hot sunlight<br />we dipped them in sugar<br /><br />Jacques Pr&eacute;vert's Alicante is a sweet portrait of love in six lines and leaves a lasting impression. Octavio Paz also explores touch in a memorable six lines. Both poems prove their point. A short poem can be more profound than unending lines of complicated phrases. A quick, stunning recollection of love seems to leave a more lasting impression. Bhartrhari also presents a poem of four lines to describe love's initial binding power and time's power to separate lovers.<br /><br />Pablo Neruda's poetry presents a vivid contrast to many of the poems in this book. His poems are an enthralling blend of sensuality and rhythm.<br /><br />Over the sky's hot rim,<br />The day's last breath in our sails.<br />Pinned by the sun between solstice<br />and equinox, drowsy and tangled together<br /><br />The Introduction presents ideas about the relationship between creative and sexual energy. Do poets have more intense emotional moments throughout their lives or are they just better at assembling words into evocative phrases as they gaze with an inward eye and are compelled to create? The poems are organized in eight main sections:<br /><br />Intimations - Intimate portraits of women by the men who adore their beauty.<br /><br />Declarations -  \\"She walks in beauty, like the night...\\"<br /><br />Persuasions - Convincing women to love while they are young and other romantic notions...<br /><br />Celebrations - Temptations, songs and kisses.<br /><br />Aberrations - Deviations from the expected course of love, rejections and indifference.<br /><br />Separations - Poems of loss, farewell, future considerations and longing when lovers are apart.<br /><br />Desolations - Heartbreaking poems of loss and remembrance with splashes of beauty and moments of unending hope. Yehuda Amichai's Quick and Bitter has a beautiful conclusion.<br /><br />Reverberations - Memories of eating strawberries before a storm and kisses remembered.<br /><br />While reading A Book of Love Poems, I found many new poems to enjoy and the copy I purchased was already dog-eared and well loved. While my copy is a paperback version, I would much prefer a hardcover edition. The Index of Poets and the Index of Titles and First Lines is especially helpful if you are studying a particular poet or you are looking for a favorite poem.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book of poems to inspire romance and you enjoy selections with a more traditional appeal, Jon Stallworthy's book has much to offer.  If you are looking for erotic poems,there are a few selections, although I'd recommend [[ASIN:1570622345 The Erotic Spirit]].

The minute you enter the pages of this stunning anthology, you will find you have entered a sacred sanctuary of desire. You may find yourself startled by the mirroring of emotions.

What is desire?<br />The impulse to make someone else complete?<br /><br />When I purchased the Everyman Love Poems book I was excited about purchasing additional selections. I must say this book was not exactly what I expected and even the author makes a note about these poems being sensuous and passionate but not erotic as we would imagine erotic to be today. This could make you happy or cause you disappointment. I found many of the poems to be more exotic than erotic.  While many are striking and interesting, there are not many that inspire immediate desire. The poems seem to be more of a study of poetry than a presentation for pleasure. The poems are more romantic and interesting with short moments of sensuality.<br /><br />Many of the poems seem to focus more on environments than erotic experience, although there are many references to the body and emotions. They seem to be more of an afterthought than the main theme in many of the poems. Poems like The Imperfect Enjoyment by Lord Rochester and Twin Hills by Vidyapati are the exception.<br /><br />In my body you search the mountain<br />for the sun buried in its forest.<br />In your body I search for the boat<br />adrift in the middle of the night.<br />~Octavio Paz<br /><br />Erotic Poems is also a collection of poems written mostly by men (and many are translated by men) and therefore seems to lack the diversity I was seeking in an erotic poem collection. While I love reading poems by men, I missed the female perspective. I could also not understand why they included Aurelius by Catullus or Hello There by Philodemus.<br /><br />While Peter Washington organized the poems in a chain of thematic association, it would seem better to have poems with more variety and to include more poems by female poets. Sylvia Plath (1932-1963) makes her appearance with Zoo Keeper's Wife and I rather liked the lines about how she pretended to be the Tree of Knowledge. Himalayan Balsam is also a beautiful poem by Anne Stevenson.<br /><br />You will find numerous poems by Robert Graves and Charles Baudelaire. You will also find poems by D.H. Lawrence, Walt Whitman, Thom Gunn, Li Ch'ung, Anon, Pablo Neruda and William Blake.<br /><br />There are poems for a variety of tastes, however most of the poems seem to be classic selections that focus on descriptions of nature or emotions instead of erotic encounters. While there are quite a few moments of sexual beauty, I seem to prefer the poems in Passionate Hearts by Wendy Maltz. It seems this collection of Erotic Poems is a classic representation of what Erotic Poems used to be. If you are looking for modern erotic poems, you may be disappointed. What is interesting is that with some patience, this book reveals a commonality of desire. It is more a study of longing and desire veiled in metaphors with an occasional \\"enters warm yes\\" moment. This book seems to inspire a lust for language and a need to locate your dictionary.<br /><br />I think if you read this book, you will definitely want to look for The Erotic Spirit edited by Sam Hamill and A Book of Love Poetry edited by Jon Stallworthy. You may also enjoy Perfectly Said by Brian Douthit or A Night Without Armor by Jewel.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewms by Robert Graves and Charles Baudelaire. You will also find poems by D.H.

With an enviable panoramic view of the Olympic Mountains and Puget Sound, this has become a comforting location to enjoy a meal, watch boats sail by and enjoy entertaining conversations with friends and family.<br /><br />My mother loves Coconut Prawns and I think that is why she purchased this cookbook. She has been so kind as to lend it to me for a few weeks. If you love seafood you will find recipes for everything from Black Pepper Dungeness Crab to Ray's Crab and Corn Chowder.

You might also want to visit Larry's Market to find a few of the produce items. Well, actually, if you are in Seattle, why not just visit this restaurant. We love Rays and I'm happy my mother bought this cookbook. She might not be seeing it for a few more months although she might be seeing me because I found a $10 off coupon for a lunch or dinner at Ray's Boathouse.<br /><br />While many of the recipes look very gourmet in the pictures, they are not difficult to make and your only real concern will be where to find the freshest seafood possible in your local area. Amazon also has a gourmet food section so you can look for Scharffen Berger bittersweet chocolate for the chocolate indulgence recipe. You need at least three 9.7-ounce bars and the recipe serves 12.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2005-02-18

It seems that recently I've been reading that 44-54% of American women are single.<br /><br />With such a high percentage, it is no wonder I'm seeing so many books on the life of the single woman. I find it all rather fascinating since I was single until I was 27 and I have been wondering how other women dealt with this stage in their lives. Many are now single until way past 35 and for many this situation is a conscious choice.<br /><br />So, what does a sexologist have to say about this subject? Well, he does focus on sex all while promoting positive changes. He basically gives single woman a much needed reality check. Is sex that satisfying for single women or would they enjoy sex more in a much more stable and secure environment, like marriage. Ian Kerner has talked to woman about their sex lives and he seems to have written this book to make women more aware of the connection between sexuality and the emotions. We women know they are connected, so this is not completely new information. However, there was much to learn from his book in regards to how hormones affect mood and why a woman feels closer to a man after sex, even to the point of feeling he is the one she should marry. This gets complex if he is not the right man for you and Ian advises women to seriously consider the detrimental effects of casual sex.<br /><br />While Ian Kerner does not delve into any religious or personal moral considerations, he does base his beliefs on biological, intellectual, hormonal, emotional and evolutionary considerations. He compares rats and voles, delves into dopamine and explains why Viagra doesn't work so well for women. He explains why men seek out more than one woman and presents a fascinating view of men as equally emotional. One of his thoughts brought me to a much deeper understanding of male sexuality. Ian explains the difference between a man making love to a woman he loves and a man having sex with a woman he is not \\"that into.\\" There are men who will avoid sex because they are not \\"in love\\" or want to wait until they are sure the woman is \\"the one.\\"<br /><br />I think Ian Kerner should not assume only single women are reading his book. As a married woman, I am still fascinated by the subject of male sexuality and current trends. This is also a very intellectual read and I do so love finding words like \\"vitriolic.\\" Can I say, Ian Kerner is a tad bit vitriolic about a book he dislikes and I honestly think he should appreciate that book more since it gave him an idea for his own book. Honestly, I bought both books thinking they were a set of books and didn't even originally notice they were not by the same author.<br /><br />I can see why he would dismiss a more frivolous look at the single life, but I found both books to be an enjoyable read. There are times when you need humor and times when you want to immerse your mind in an intellectual read. While the cover would say otherwise, this book is highly intellectual and seems to be written for the thinking woman who is making choices based on logic versus emotional response.<br /><br />One of Ian Kerner's comments disturbed me in a unique way. When he said Adam and Eve were having casual sex, my mind could not comprehend how anyone would ever believe such a statement. To me, Adam and Eve are the ultimate soul mates, created by God and an example of the ideal relationship we should strive for in a troubled world. I also think Ian Kerner should pick a side. On the one hand he is telling woman how damaging casual sex can be and on the other hand he says things like \\"you go girl.\\" That can be confusing and I think he is trying so hard not to offend people that he is trying to present both sides of the situation. He also seems to go a little overboard trying to convince women he is on their side. It is a classic attempt to gain trust and while I appreciated his advice, I did not feel he was \\"always\\" leading single women in the right direction.

By the time I finished reading her book, I was pretty sure I knew why she was not married. She has chosen this life, whether she is fully aware of it or not. It seems she does realize she has dedicated her life to God and yet she still seems to remain open to the possibility of marriage.<br /><br />Like many women in her situation she came very close to being married, only to find her Prince changed his mind at the last minute. As a woman who went through the same situation many years ago, I can fully understand her pain and her sense of loss. At that point, she had to force herself to continue living, to continue to strive for a higher goal, a more spiritual aim, destiny itself.<br /><br />Kathleen is a spiritual woman who desires God's blessing on her life and her book will encourage women who want to follow a similar path. After reading numerous books about the single woman, written by men, it was refreshing to read about a woman who was willing to sacrifice her sexuality in order to love God and follow biblical teachings.<br /><br />I think Kathleen has made a very difficult choice and I hope she is rewarded and eventually finds the man of her dreams. There are men out there who will respect her choices, although they may be few and far between. I think there is a way to be sensual and spiritual and it is definitely a balancing act. Most of us don't have enough self-control to remain single and celibate and if you are struggling with these issues, this book will give you spiritual guidance and advice on how to remain pure until you marry.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2005-02-18

Get rid of him if he doesn't live up to your full expectations.<br /><br />This is easier said than done. In the first place, men are complex creatures who enjoy a challenge. We enjoy a challenge too and this seems to be the impasse. For this entire love game to work out someone needs to eventually submit to the torture of love and be caught and then they need to become a challenge again.<br /><br />While Greg Behrendt has a great sense of humor about the entire matter, Liz Tuccillo almost seems to wish she had the power not to fall in love with the wrong men although she finds them very exciting. This book is filled with letters written by willing women who are seeking commitment or at least a sense of consideration from their men. Greg leads the discussion and Liz presents the female perspective.<br /><br />So, the questions are:<br /><br />Should you ever call a guy?<br />Should you skip the whole \\"I need a man to love me\\" situation and go buy a kitten?<br />Is self-esteem the first issue on the table?<br />How much self-control does a woman need to have anyway?<br /><br />This book left me with even more questions than it answers. Yes, I love the letters and Greg's responses, but I am still wondering why the women in this book are not able to work a magic spell of attraction to seduce their men into committing to a satisfying relationship.<br /><br />Greg says that if a man is not trying to undress you, he is not that into you. What about men who have religious reasons for not seducing you or who actually want to honor you and respect you as a woman who needs commitment before sex?<br /><br />Humans want companionship, life can be lonely and we all want to be loved. So, what is the real reason \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" and does this book really help you understand men?<br /><br />If you are in an unsatisfying relationship, Greg and Liz will give you the nudge you need to pack your bags and move onto a man who can please you. There are lists of \\"standard suggestions\\" to help you raise your standards. If you are looking for a new boyfriend, this book will give you an idea of who you should be looking for and it isn't the man who leaves you at home waiting by the phone.<br /><br />Personally, I think if you want a loyal, loving, cuddly creature who gives you unconditional love day in and day out...yep, adopt a cat from the local shelter.<br /><br />If you want a man, you might have to become more like a cat and play a more subtle game all while developing the qualities the man you love desires the most. There is nothing wrong with adapting areas of your life to attract the man of your dreams as long as it works for you and you love adventure.<br /><br />My husband is an eternal challenge and I wouldn't want him any other way. Sure it can be difficult to find a man to marry and it took me 8 years, but let me tell you, it is even more difficult to keep a man happy in the long-term. Look at the divorce rate. You have to be a challenge from hello until death us do part, read a lot of books and understand relationship games.<br /><br />It seems our mothers were right even if we don't like to admit it. Chasing a man at the start might not be such a good idea. I love the story about the woman who made a man hunt down her phone number. What a woman! I personally think a lot of women give men sex way too soon and that is why men lose interest. This entire book is saying exactly that in so many ways.<br /><br />Do you have a red crayon? You are going to need one. I loved the sarcastic humor in this book and the letters from Nikki are very entertaining. The \\"What You Should Have Learned in This Chapter\\" sections also help to summarize the main points and you might enjoy posting some of the points on a bulletin board or on your refrigerator. This book is not just for single women, I think it could also help a married woman's self-esteem.<br /><br />I'm going to agree with Liz here and say that I have also never had an overly satisfying relationship with a man I chased at the start. I like the idea of being a little more mysterious. The truth is - if women didn't put up with being treated badly, men wouldn't treat us badly. They want and need sex. Common, women have all the power. They just need to learn how to use the power they have.<br /><br />In that regard, this book is helpful and liberating. Greg is really trying to boost your self-esteem and I think he does an excellent job. I liked his line: \\"Don't waste the pretty.\\" Life is really too short to waste on a man who doesn't even \\"try\\" to satisfy you. Men are as confused about us as we are about them. So, it is a learning process that takes an entire lifetime. Are you up for the challenge? I think you are. ;) Kindness counts.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewth Liz here and say that I have also never had an overly satisfying relationship with a man I chased at the start.

He shows how water moves through the water cycle and instead of just presenting facts, this is in the form of a pleasant story. Hydro has conversations with rivers, talks to Nibbler the Salmon and takes a break at the \\"Liquid Lunch Deli.\\" It is all rather amusing even to me and I think children will learn a great deal from this story that takes you from snowflakes to groundwater.<br /><br />The imaginative art gives a greater understanding to the process. Water molecules take the \\"Vapor Express\\" from the top of a wave and rise into the air. They all look like they are hopping aboard a train.<br /><br />The animals in the book discuss environmental issues and explain erosion and how chemicals pollute streams. It is all very easy to understand and makes complete sense.<br /><br />\\"We need trees and shrubs growing along the banks of our streams and rivers to provide shade and to prevent erosion (e-RO-shun).\\" ~Nibbler<br /><br />A glossary explains terms like \\"Crystallization\\" and \\"Hexagonal.\\"  I like the way the water cycle is presented in a playful story.

The Cat's Eye and Eagle Nebula are beautiful, while the egg nebula looks rather mysterious.<br /><br />It is also so wonderful to know about asteroids wandering about in space always willing to hurtle themselves towards earth. There are pictures of places in Arizona were an asteroid hit the earth.<br /><br />A space timeline is included (1926-2014). Which spacecrafts are scheduled for launch in 2012? This timeline explains future plans for space travel.

This book also answers questions like:<br /><br />How did parents care for the young dinosaurs?<br />Was the Tyrannosaurus a hunter or scavenger?<br />Did Dinosaurs travel in herds?<br />How are Dinosaur bones collected in the field?<br />What does a Jurassic shark look like?<br /><br />The Elasmosaurus is a fascinating sea giant and looks rather playful except for the sharp teeth. A few pages are given to creatures of the air and sea, but most of the book focuses on dinosaurs that peacefully roamed the earth nibbling on a shrub here or there. Then you have the Giganotosaurus that hunted by ambush.<br /><br />The variety in this book will fascinate children and you can learn about everything from the size of a dinosaur's brain to the way a computer can manipulate an image to show what a fossil looked like before it became deformed and preserved.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2005-02-10

This might be too frightening for children under the age of 9 or 10 but may be of interest to teenagers and adults.<br /><br />Death is not the only focus of this book. The information about Pyramids being built to align with star constellations, archaeological discoveries and artic expeditions fill out the book nicely and give students an idea of how people lived. I found the items buried with the mummies to be even more interesting than the mummies themselves although the blue body from the bog was a little startling.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2005-02-10

I remember holding one of those jumping beans in my hand and wondering if I should take one home, because you never could tell what might escape. This book explains how Mexican jumping beans jump and gives you information on bug zoos and butterfly houses. I prefer the butterfly idea, but there are many fascinating insects. After living in Africa, I think I have seen enough bugs to last a lifetime, but I am still curious about insects like butterflies because they seem friendly and if a butterfly lands on you, you tend to feel rather fortunate to be visited by such a beautiful creature. You can have the beetles, they kept me up at night knocking around the room until I could release them out into the night.<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Go Buggy - This section takes up over half of the book and is a guide to insect zoos and butterfly houses organized according to states. In Washington you can visit the Tropical Butterfly House and Insect Village at the Pacific Science Center or go to the Bug World and Butterflies & Blooms at Woodland Park Zoo.<br /><br />Admission prices, hours and detailed information is given for each location.<br /><br />At the Butterflies in Flight section you enter a kaleidoscope of blooms bursting in 3,900 square feet of an indoor landscape framed by two greenhouse structures. Fluttering around the vibrant plant blossoms are about 1,000 flying flowers representing at least 15 North American butterfly and moth species. ~ info on Woodland Park Zoo<br /><br />Bugged out - A swarm of bug festivals organized by the months of the year. In November it would be fun to be in San Jose, CA where they release hundreds of Monarch butterflies.<br /><br />Bug Bytes - A web of bug cams and insect sites where you can watch ants at work in ant farms or research the latest buggy recipes or send a buggy e-mail card. You can order silk worms and those are fun to watch. I had a box of them as a child and used to feed them mulberry leaves from a tree down the street. I seem to remember leaving them there, on the tree. I don't think the owners appreciated it, but as a child, I had no idea what would happen. I laugh now at my innocence. It was fun to watch the silkworms munch away at the leaves and then spin their cocoons. Some of the stores provide seeds for growing plants butterflies love.

Hey, that is my current situation. The designers put the bookshelves between the desk and the bed. That sounds like a great solution and the shelves were high enough that they actually look like a room divider.<br /><br />As you are in bed, you can see items on the shelves (in cute boxes) on the back side of the bookshelves and on the office side it is filled with books. So this book gave me some design ideas for my current situation.<br /><br />There are some basic blueprint designs and lots of fun full-color pictures showing what can be done with small spaces. The retreat idea with a swimming pool looks like a great writing location for a writer or could work as a studio for an artist. You would never know the trailer park home is a trailer. That is probably the most interesting house to study. If you have an interest in community gardens, there is section with a number of cottages all placed around a gardening area. The shelving in these cottages helped to save space and made the rooms look so cozy.<br /><br />While this is not a detailed guide for building your own home, it will give you lots of ideas and some pictures to show an architect.<br /><br />OK, I have to go reorganize my bedroom/office.

Or is love, by its nature, a reciprocity, like oceans and clouds, an evaporating of seawater and a replenishing by rain? ~Alan Lightman<br /><br />Einstein's Dreams is a delicate taste of the banquet of intimacy in Reunion. I am never sure if Alan Lightman's books are novels or the deepest expressions of his romantic nature. After reading Einstein's Dreams I knew there was more to discover and here it is in all its intimate beauty.<br /><br />The first few pages left me in a high state of amusement. How I understand that love of words as he wishes to be reading a book while lost in the world of a woman. Yet, what would the world be without romantic seduction and the seduction of words? In Reunion, the two dance together, intertwined in poetry and longing.<br /><br />Detailed accounts of action and reaction fill the pages as Alan Lightman's mind breathes every nuance of life, every consideration. Amidst the contemplations, humor mingles with memories and astute observations. I kept thinking: \\"I feel all my life past was a beautiful prison from which I unwillingly escaped.\\"<br /><br />Alan Lightman revels in the sense of adventure he creates through imaginative descriptions of all that occurred or could have occurred. Are memories how we imagine life could have been or how life actually occurred?<br /><br />Does it matter? Alan's recollections are worth reading twice. He creates ambience and nostalgia in one sentence. Nostalgia for rain drenched sidewalks I have never walked on and musty libraries I wish to visit or return to hours later in memory. His powers of observation flow into a complete unveiling of appearances and private passions.<br /><br />Reunion is an escape into a world of imaginative observation. Even Alan Lightman's recollections of college and college roommates become an introduction to his main character's inclinations. We follow hearts through secret pains and pleasures.  As Charles, a middle-aged professor, decides to attend his thirtieth college reunion, he remembers his senior year. He wanders with his twenty-two-year-old self in 1960 and the entire book become a journey to a past he so desperately wants to relive in memory.<br /><br />I am so in love with the writing in this book, I hardly mind that a person named Charles wanders in the pages and is in love with a beautiful dancer. I want to know more about how Alan Lightman views the world. His characters seem to me a backdrop for his heart's revelations. This is an obsession with love and life itself and I love the way the writing style changes and keeps your full attention. At times you are reading a novel, at times a memory and at times you have become so seduced by sentence structure, you are lost in a world of words and you are in love.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review, decides to attend his thirtieth college reunion, he remembers his senior year.

I am so in love with the writing in this book, I hardly mind that a person named Charles wanders in the pages and is in love with a beautiful dancer. I want to know more about how Alan Lightman views the world. His characters seem to me a backdrop for his heart's revelations. This is an obsession with love and life itself and I love the way the writing style changes and keeps your full attention. At times you are reading a novel, at times a memory and at times you have become so seduced by sentence structure, you are lost in a world of words and you are in love.      ~The Rebecca Review	2005-02-06

Through the Rocky Road and into the Rainbow Sherbet is one of my favorite Laura Jensen Walker books. I found so much I could relate to and this particular book has some amazingly collectable quotes.<br /><br />I did have to laugh when Laura explains how a scoop of French vanilla ice cream and chocolate cake helps to put a new perspective on situations. I admire her willingness to analyze her life and make the right decisions. She also keeps a lovely sense of humor in her marriage, although I think she defiantly married her soul mate.<br /><br />With chapter titles like \\"It's my Parfait and I'll cry if I want to,\\" we learn about Laura's life, her trials and her loves. There are little \\"scoops for thought\\" that present some collectible advice for future consideration.<br /><br />This book is filled with quotes (I found 7 new ones I loved), stories of travel in Europe, childhood memories, insight, personal life experience and humor. The contents of Through the Rocky Road and into the Rainbow Sherbet melts together into a delicious read.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2005-02-05

As someone who could not survive without my life coach, I think everyone needs to find someone who can analyze their life and present motivating ideas that actually work.<br /><br />I have a theory that you only need one person to believe in you in order to reach some level of success in your life. That person could also just be you! I have had to learn to believe in myself, but it helps if you do have some positive reinforcement.<br /><br />Books like Motivation that Works are especially helpful because the author presents action plans, goals to generate the needed energy and lots of inspirational quotes.<br /><br />Zev Saftlas teaches you how to be patient, learn from other people's mistakes and how to visualize your journey. He also explains why negative self-talk is very destructive and explains how successful people are not born in the top, they work very hard to overcome countless setbacks and obstacles to reach a place where others would consider them to be a success.<br /><br />I have to agree with Eddie Cantor, sometimes success takes twenty years of hard work! We all just have to keep taking steps towards the dream life we have imagined and I think this book will encourage you to look at your life with a fresh perspective.<br /><br />There are many ideas you can apply to your life today and some you can consider for the future. You will also find perfectly logical explanations and a deep understanding of what it takes to succeed.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2005-02-05

Jewel Kilcher is not only a singer and songwriter, she is a truly gifted poet. Her love for the poems of Shakespeare, Dylan Thomas, Rumi, Yeats and Pablo Neruda flows through her poems in a mingling of mysterious longings and vision.<br /><br />I spent an entire afternoon reading \\"a night without armor\\" and Jewel's intuitive understanding of life and descriptions of loneliness in the midst of popularity left me in a state of extended contemplation about beautiful moments and the cravings of the soul.<br /><br />Jewel paints unforgettable scenes in vivid imagery. In \\"Communion\\" she shows a deep understanding of intimacy and her artistic descriptions capture environments in sensual words that slip over the pages in beautiful streams of inspired imaginings.<br /><br />I have cast my heart<br />like a purpled fruit<br />toward the violent earth,<br />far from the Heaven<br />of your arms<br /><br />Her words will at times take you by surprise and I found myself retracing my steps to understand the unique poetic forms and deeper meanings woven within complexity. I found myself reading \\"Wild Horse\\" three times before I could turn the page. \\"Still Life\\" and \\"Lost\\" are also equally interesting in form.<br /><br />\\"Gold Fish\\" was a sweet innocent and playful surprise and her witty interpretation of life in Spivey Leaks made me laugh. \\"You Are Not\\" is a revealing look at belief that sharply contrasts with action.<br /><br />Many of Jewel's poems are saturated in deep heart longing and many are resting in delicate moments of peaceful childhood memories from Alaska. There is a profound poem about her brother Shane and many poems about her childhood and family life in Alaska. \\"The Slow Migration of Glaciers\\" is a love poem to Alaska and explores Jewel's longings for home.<br /><br />Struggling to hold back<br />the dawn<br />open-hearted lovers<br />cling to the sweet fruits<br />of last-minute kisses<br />so eager<br />to lose themselves<br />in the honey-thick gravity<br />of love so new<br /><br />Jewel's love poems are unique and she delves into dreams, experience, loss, passion, trust, betrayal, fear, disappointment, uncertainty, longing, infatuation and kisses.<br /><br />These poems are alive with emotion; they capture the beauty of Jewel's soul and make the world feel a little less lonely.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviews   of last-minute kisses   so eager   to lose themselves   in the honey-thick gravity   of love so new     Jewel's love poems are unique and she delves into dreams, experience, loss, passion, trust, betrayal, fear, disappointment, uncertainty, longing, infatuation and kisses.

His message of love and hope causes me to peacefully consider his words, laugh with amusement or find myself in tears. He has a rare appreciation for beauty, lives his life with a sense of awe and sees synchronicity at work in his life.<br /><br />Through dreams, humor, personal experiences and vital lessons, he leads the reader through fifty-two chapters of inspiring thoughts. You might want to read a chapter each week to keep yourself inspired and progressing towards a positive pathway. There are questions for reflection at the end of each chapter. A few of the creative chapter titles:<br /><br />Stronger than Hope<br />Signs When You Need Them<br />Passion and Prayer<br />Date with Destiny<br />Relationship 101<br />How to Make a Fortune<br />Pray Outside the Box<br /><br />Whether Alan is exploring ancient Egyptian tombs, hiking trails on Maui or telling stories of French resort towns, you journey with Alan into the land of possibility and humor.<br /><br />Sometimes it appears that you are at the end of your trail, when you are really at the beginning. ~Alan Cohen<br /><br />He has one of the most healing views of life I've ever encountered. Since reading his books I see life in a much more positive way and often have to laugh at my own tendency towards drama.<br /><br />Alan's books bring me back to the roots of love before I uproot my life. He is a natural storyteller and has introduced me to a number of movies and creative ideas about life. This book is a journey into healing, wisdom and awakening.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2005-02-05

She does state that all the reviews are based solely on her own opinion and the information given by the schools. This makes the book highly personal and enjoyable to read.<br /><br />Right from the start, Fiona Whitney asks all the right questions. She discusses everything from how much money you want to spend on a private education to how much homework your child can expect to have at various schools.

When you learn other styles of T'ai Chi, you have to be so concerned about each movement and you can almost feel your inner perfectionist becoming frustrated.<br /><br />With New Forest T'ai Chi, you are freed from perfectionism and finally you can express your creativity and personalize the flowing sequence of healing motion. To me, learning New Forest T'ai Chi was like learning how to paint imaginary calligraphy with my hands.<br /><br />Not only is this form of T'ai Chi easy to remember, it heats the body, gives you an excellent workout and calms the nervous system. You also don't have to buy any special equipment. Some of the benefits I noticed almost immediately was more flexibility.<br /><br />Grandmaster John Bright-Fey takes you through a series of exercises on the CD and all the exercises are featured in whimsical drawings with additional instruction and notes. He also covers topics like breathing, traditional Chinese medicine and has even translated four chapters from The Tao Te Ching. After reading the book, your workout will have a new depth of creativity.<br /><br />I'd like to say this was \\"one, two, three\\" T'ai Chi. However, I think it is much more like calligraphy in motion. You paint numbers with your hands and this makes the movements super easy to remember.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all ages. This gets you moving and it is truly a fun routine that you will never forget. The spiritual elements come from your own experience while doing the exercises and your peace of mind will last long after the routine has been completed. I felt happier, as if I had let my creative child out to play. I'm looking forward to reading all of John A. Bright-Fey's creative and healing books.<br /><br />Also look for John A. Bright-Fey's video or DVD. I think this book is a beautiful companion to the DVD or Video.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewo the DVD or Video.     ~The Rebecca Review	2005-01-23

Men also enjoy romance, yet many books I've read focus on what the man can plan for the woman. In this book for couples, you can plan adventures for each other.<br /><br />Romantic Antics is divided into seven main sections that range from getting to know your new love interest to serious dating, courtship and marriage. The last three sections provide ideas for romance after you become parents, celebrating special occasions and cooking up romantic recipes. I loved the idea of cutting Rice Krispie Treats into hearts.<br /><br />Romantic Ideas I tried and Loved:<br /><br />12 Days of Christmas - you could package up 12 presents or smaller gifts<br />Lots of Ways to Say I Love You - try another language<br />Message in a Bottle - a fun way to send romantic letters or poems<br /><br />One of the most enjoyable aspects of this book is the playful and personal writing style. Joy and Kevin seem to live for romance and are also the creators of a successful website dedicated to romantic ideas. I also loved their list of romantic movies and flower meanings. The idea for glow in the dark messages, moonlight picnics and romantic train adventures sounds exciting. As someone who lives for romance, I can highly recommend Romantic Antics.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2005-01-20

As Hadassah Kesselman prepares for her wedding day, she finds the experience steeped in mystery. Her story is set aside as Tommy Tenney and Mark Andrew Olsen delve into what is perhaps one of the most ancient fantasies. As women dream of marrying powerful men, men dream of the beautiful woman who worships them in body, mind and spirit. This fantasy is brilliantly woven into the story of Esther and makes for a compelling read.<br /><br />Hadassah Kesselman is required to read the story of Esther before her wedding day and soon learns of Esther's horrifying childhood experiences and mysterious awakenings into womanhood. Tommy Tenney's comforting writing style seems to mask the horror in a way that allows the reader to comprehend each situation without becoming overwhelmed by tragedy itself. He has a talent for capturing moments in time with exquisite attention to detail. The scent of myrrh lingers on the pages as an exciting drama unfolds in moments of sexual tension, suspense and intrigue.<br /><br />Esther's story is truly brought to life in this retelling filled with political conspiracies, wars, longings of the heart and brutal action. In her search for G-d, she also finds her place in the world and begins to understand her true destiny. Must she sacrifice herself to the King of Persia and fall prey to Haman's evil intentions?<br /><br />Even if you remember the biblical details, an entire new world of captivating adventure and romance awaits in Hadassah's journey to One Night With the King.

While log homes are the feature, artistic expression is the focus. Each home is carefully accessorized in order to maximize the beauty of the living space. This is Cindy Thiede's fifth book and she presents quite a few beautiful ideas like the cabin wrapped in soft green summertime trees with transparent walls and massive pine posts that reach from the floor to the ceiling. It is like living in comfort outdoors.<br /><br />I had never noticed how the colors of the furniture could match the wood for stunning results. Most of the homes have expansive windows that invite the outdoors inside. Other ideas include a chef-style kitchen and vaulted ceilings. The house on the lake glows with warmth as lights reflect in the water.<br /><br />The pictures in this particular book are the best I've ever seen because the variety and artistic elements and the variety of wood on display. There is everything from dark-stained rough-hewn fir floors to light almond-stained walls gracing the walls. There are even some pictures of famous lodges and ranch houses. Whether you are looking for rustic or refined, there are ideas for a wide variety of styles. The cook in me loved the wood-burning cook stove and the spa girl in me loved the deep tubs. Looking for deck ideas? A few pages are dedicated to decorating for the summer. I liked the idea of the permanent campfire setting in the backyard.<br /><br />You don't even have to own a log cabin to enjoy this book. Now I'm dreaming about red couches and Persian carpets. The kitchens and bookshelves were also an inspiration.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2005-01-20

Will the surgery be a success and will she be able to live a fulfilling existence and find hope in a seemingly hopeless situation?<br /><br />Stephanie S. Sawyer's story is fascinating because she reveals many aspects about epilepsy that are essential for understanding the fear, struggles and discouragement this invasive challenge presents. Stephanie's writing is vivid, inspiring and informative.<br /><br />Since 181,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed each year and ten percent of the American population will experience a seizure in their lifetime, this book is essential reading.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2005-01-19

Birgit loves to travel and owns a spice store with over 1,800 culinary flavorings called The Spice Shop. Eric is a favorite author who started cooking in his uncle's boulangerie in France. Together they have created a feast for the eyes and a sense of nostalgia for cooking outdoors.<br /><br />After going through a number of gas grills, I think I'm going back to charcoal for a while because cooking over charcoal seems to be much more of an art form. The authors give instructions for making a fire and checking the temperature of the coals.<br /><br />An entire section is dedicated to spices and you might want to look for some smoked paprika or Pomegranate molasses. While most of the recipes use ingredients you may already have in your kitchen, there are some more exotic ideas. Annatto seeds are used in the achiote seasoning and this in turn is used in the Recado Rojo - a honey marinade for pork chops, shrimp or chicken. You are truly creating recipes from scratch and you can make up seasoning mixtures from the spices you already own.<br /><br />Sample Recipes:<br /><br />Chargrilled Sirloin Steak with Garlic Parsley Butter<br />Cilantro Beef Satays with Honey Tamarind Glaze<br />Lamb Tikka Masala<br />Spicy Masala Shrimp<br />Sweet Chili Chicken<br />Lemon Ginger Chicken Drumsticks with Mango and Mustard Seed Glaze<br />Chargrilled Corn on the Cob with Cilantro Chili Butter<br />Chargrilled Pineapple with Sweet Rum Glaze<br />Lemon Tahini Sauce<br />Avocado Mango Salsa<br />Honey Miso Sauce<br />Black Olive Butter<br /><br />\\"Grilling\\" even has a recipe for Mayonnaise, Focaccia and Spicy Pita Chips.

In her new \\"Secrets of French Design,\\" she shows you how to furnish a chateau, a manor or an apartment. Each picture has a feeling of indescribable comfort and luxury. As the secrets are revealed, Betty Lou Phillips discusses the power of color, texture, window treatments, art, fine dining, bed culture and personal touches.<br /><br />I have rarely seen such a beautiful array of sumptuous sentences as in Betty Lou Phillips' books. She has an artist's eye and is an artist with words. She reveals the secret of color and how it can elevate ceilings or cause a room to shrink in size.<br /><br />There is more writing in this book and more ideas to jot down for future decorating. There are some unique ideas for kitchen design and some beautiful ideas for displaying photographs.<br /><br />Since I'm always interested in redecorating my bedroom, the chapters on La Chambre were of great interest and there is even information on why beds are a symbol of wealth. Please don't ever make me live without a down comforter or two. The picture of a bedroom with a fireplace looks ideal.<br /><br />If you enjoy this book, also look for Emily Goes Wild, her award-winning children's book.

Would you spend the rest of your life reading poetry, making love and taking vacations to exotic locations? Would you work furiously until the last second, when the earth dissolves into raindrops or melts from the heat of the sun? So many questions, so many ideas to turn into dreams of what time could be, what it actually is and what it might be in your future.<br /><br />As we find ourselves falling into time over the years, time seems to be racing by faster. Imagine a world where time is different for everyone, or is this already true?<br /><br />Almost every chapter in this book is a dream or a thoughtful consideration. There are moments of sublime beauty and unexpected humor. Visual paradise jumps out from the pages as you read vivid descriptions of worlds where time changes as constantly as the hands on a clock.<br /><br />Alan Lightman presents a journey into worlds where your life could either repeat in endless cycles or you could live your entire life in a day. The concept of being able to live three lives or more at once sounds wonderful because imagine the goals you could accomplish.<br /><br />The moment of stunning clarity came to me on page seventy. \\"There is a place where times stands still. Raindrops hang motionless in air. Pendulums of clocks float mid-swing.\\"<br /><br />Alan Lightman is an artist with words and paints breathlessly beautiful images. Time could be a flock of birds or a movie rewinding endlessly into eternity past.<br /><br />After reading Einstein's Dreams you may feel you have lived in a dream. I recognized a number of my own philosophies of life and was amazed by the way Alan Lightman weaves dream-like contemplations into revelations of the philosophy of life itself. The time you spend reading Einstein's Dreams will seem far too short.<br /><br />This book is 4 ½ x 6 ½ and I recommend the hardcover edition. The cover is beautiful with golden chocolate brown and black backgrounds. The clock is printed in a shiny black ink and is much more impressive than the picture online.<br /><br />I must say this book impressed me and is much more an imprinting of impressions than a story with a specific plot and developed characters.

They simply don't engage someone who doesn't give it to them. ~Sherry Argov<br /><br />Why Men Love Bitches is a wickedly humorous read! Sherry Argov unveils the male mind and explores the possibilities of a more irreverent attitude to life itself. What is this book really about? Respecting yourself and developing the coveted &#34;Je Ne Sais Quoi.&#34;<br /><br />Sherry Argov's sassy wit and astute observations will be best received by women who have been too nice and are unwilling to continue on this disastrous and unfulfilling path towards overcompensating and chasing down love. You will learn:<br /><br />How to go from Doormat to Dreamgirl<br />Why Men Prefer the Thrill of the Chase<br />How to make the most of your Feminine and Sexual Powers<br />The Ways of the Mysterious Fox<br />Why Neediness is always Negative<br />The 10 Ways men show they are In Love<br /><br />This book will generally be more useful to the single woman who wants to form a permanent bond with the man of her desire. Married women could skip the first third of this book, which mostly deals with avoiding a man's sexual advances until he has shown you the respect you deserve. Married women will find the second half of the book more useful than the first, although the entire book is well worth reading for the sheer comic pleasure.<br /><br />There are 10 chapters with 100 attraction principles. Sherry's Attraction Principles are also listed in the appendix for easy access.<br /><br />The most shocking part of this book might be page 97, where Sherry Argov explains that when a man tells you he is interested in a long-term relationship he may just want sex with no strings attached. Throughout this book you will find a number of tables with things men say and what they truly think. You may find yourself getting angry and losing respect for men in general, but take a few deep breaths. Maybe a little anger is a good thing in this case. It will show you the path to enlightenment.<br /><br />The only aspect this book doesn't really address is the concept of men who have a higher level of female energy. If you took some of the advice in this book and applied it to various relationships, you may end up with no relationship at all. I mean, men are human too and they are as unique as women will ever be. There are some men who want you to say you love them all the time. There are men who are in fear of the word love and will refuse to say they love you even under extreme duress.<br /><br />To be honest, I disagree with her about men being willing to just eat anything although those sections of the book are perhaps the most hilarious and wicked. I've yet to meet a man who did not have specific and often gourmet preferences, favorite foods and a desire for a meal seasoned with love. I've seen men fall for women who know how to cook and who go out of their way to prepare a man's favorite food.<br /><br />This book is very much about playing by your own rules so many of the ideas can be adapted to suit your present relationship. If you are not in a relationship, you can test out these ideas and see if your new sexy, strong attitude attracts the man of your dreams.<br /><br />Sherry Argov will show you all the ways to keep your best card for last. She explains why some women appear to be stalkers and why you should help a man pack his bags if he says he wants to leave. She gives excellent advice on why you should avoid communication with a man when you are extremely emotional and why your sexual desirability has everything to do with your independent attitude. This book is not encouraging you to be an angry bitchy person. Sherry Argov is encouraging women to create an irresistible force of attraction no man would ever want to resist.  Definitely hide this book in a safe place. ;)<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewess is the concept of men who have a higher level of female energy.

When I told my husband he likes me better when I'm bitchy his response included: \\"Oh, you make me so mad.\\" Then, he literally (yet somewhat gently) threw me down on the bed in a most passionate way and wow, this book works.     ~The Rebecca Review	2005-01-03

As one who learned how to make chicken soup from a Jewish friend in Seattle, I can say Jewish food has always been a favorite. I even make my own Matzo balls for soup and have mastered the making of Challah. As a child, some of my most comforting memories included eating meals at Jewish parties.

Hardly any cat is without an eccentric side. ~Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson<br /><br />While reading Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson's journey into the feline heart, I became convinced that cat's personalities are as unique as human personalities. Not only will you disagree with some of the conclusions in this book, you will appreciate the uniqueness of your own cat's emotional complexity. My theory is that cats will often respond to their owners in the way the owner responds to them. When you respect an animal and treat them in a loving way, you gain their respect. So, with this said, this book is a journey into the life of cats which may or may not be similar to your own cats. For a start, these cats are allowed out of doors and they have hunting instincts that come into play outdoors. They also seem to be a little wilder than many \\"apartment\\" cats.<br /><br />Most books on cats do lack information on the emotional complexity of cats in general. While they tell you how to care for your cats, they do not always delve into emotional complexity. Sure, we know cats are naturally curious, but do they ever ask for forgiveness? Do they experience regret and guilt? I have seen a cat ask for forgiveness in a way that said: \\"Can I be invited back into the pride?\\" So, I think cats do at times feel more emotions than this book discusses.<br /><br />You can train cats to come when called and teach them to fetch things. The author also talks about cats licking away your tears and this happened to me once. This book enlightened me on the entire \\"save face\\" idea. When cats make mistakes or embarrass themselves, they will often lick one of their paws and pretend like nothing happened.<br /><br />The author adores cats and writes beautifully about his feline friends. He tells stories of walking along the beach his cats, why cats fear cars like they fear the end of their ninth life and why if you punish a cat you will always be feared. Cats will confuse punishment with pure aggression.<br /><br />The Nine Emotional Lives of Cats is a thought provoking story about Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson's experience with his feline companions in New Zealand. The only thing I wished he had included was beautiful pictures of his cats in the middle of the book. There are pictures on the back cover.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewnt with pure aggression.

A Claddagh (klada) ring can be given to friends and is the world's cherished symbol of friendship, love and loyalty.<br /><br />The happiest day in my life is definitely the day I received a Claddagh Ring. Not only are these rings eternal symbols of friendship, it is a poetic and beautiful representation of love that is steeped in mysterious legends and lore.<br /><br />The ring is named after a fishing village and Malachy McCourt does a fine job of explaining all the stories surrounding this mysterious ring. This book is filled with stories of Vikings, Algerian Pirates, Legendary Fishermen, Superstitions, Traditions and stories of Mary of the Bridges.<br /><br />This book is really as much a history of Claddagh as it is about the ring named after the village. It also sheds light on the inventor and how he created the ring while in captivity. Malachy McCourt weaves a fascinating tapestry of stories with humor and a deep interest the history and culture of Ireland.<br /><br />What amazed me most was the story of 9/11 and how so many Claddagh rings were found on that day. Not only does this ring make its appearance in romantic tales, it has more recently made its appearance in great tragedy. Perhaps it is also now the symbol of the joining of hands to heal hearts.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-12-28

She has a personal relationship with God and feels his presence in her life. She has also experienced a miraculous healing after an auto accident.<br /><br />After attending an International Book Convention, she decided to write a book filled with original spiritual interpretations and quotes from the King James Version.<br /><br />Not only does it seem rare to find books that quote the King James Version, it is even more rare to find books focusing on the words of Christ. I have looked in bookstores and online and they do seem more difficult to find in the King James Version, a personal favorite.<br /><br />What does it mean not to live by bread alone? This famous quote by Jesus has a much deeper meaning. Gail shows how Jesus was on earth to teach mankind about the invisible, unchanging inner being. This being has to be fed spiritual truths just as our bodies need food.<br /><br />Each day has one verse and a unique explanation. At times Gail comes up with answers that make complete sense. Her After Dinner Mint: \\"...I am the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me\\" John 14:6. She then goes on to write a \\"Note From the Author\\" in which she explores this in more depth. She also discusses Free Will, Crime, her definition of Evil, Kingdom of heaven and Wine.

While she lived a troubled life she is a fascinating study. While in France she became friends with Earnest Hemingway and soon thereafter published her first book of poetry, \\"Enough Rope.\\" She writes about her friendship with Earnest in the Uncollected Articles section.<br /><br />Of all her writing, her poems strike me as her true self. She reveals so much in her poetry and many times her feelings reach new levels of desperation. She doesn't seem to find as many beautiful moments as Anais Nin, but then again she manages to continue the struggle of life without taking her life in a river like Virginia Woolf.<br /><br />The true irony of her life is that she dies of natural causes after spending a life embraced in a dream of death. When she wishes people were dead, it might be because she sees death as some beautiful way to escape reality.<br /><br />The memorable short stories make extended points about human nature and page 48 is an especially good example of a page dripping heavily with sardonic wit. Where did all this angst come from? She is a woman living in a time where she cannot always speak her mind and she is deeply frustrated in many of her \\"internal dialogue\\" confessions.<br /><br />When given the choice between creating and curing, she seems to create from a place of deep emotional pain. She seems to fall into similar patterns and actually seems to revel the idea of: \\"I wore my heart like a wet, red stain on the breast of a velvet gown.\\"<br /><br />Dorothy Parker's poems seem to be more of her desire to break free from the brutal revelation of life. She has a typical love-hate relationship with men and is an astute observer of cultural trends. I have a feeling she wrote many of her poems while she was in a manic state of some sort because she reveals so many of her feelings and comments so deeply on her life experience. The first few lines of \\"Wisdom,\\" show her frustration.<br /><br />This I say, and this I know:<br />Love has seen the last of me.<br />Love's a trodden lane to woe,<br />Love's a path to misery.<br /><br />She seems to be having a bipolar diatribe during the story of the Telephone Call. Her mean streak can be a bit shocking at times, but she does love rain and has other sensitive qualities which seem to balance this more sarcastic and vindictive side of her personality.<br /><br />Dorothy Parker wrote reviews under the title \\"The Constant Reader.\\" There are quite a few reviews from The New Yorker. She reviews The Journal of Katherine Mansfield and We Have Always Lived in a Castle by Shirley Jackson. I enjoyed her conversational style and the way she thinks through her writing while she writes. It is as if you are observing the entire thought process. You can read her thoughts about Oscar Wilde's An Ideal Husband from Vanity Fair.<br /><br />One of my friends reads me Hemingway and I read him Dorothy Parker poems. It is a friendship made in heaven. He also knows all about Dorothy Parker and the Algonquin Round Table and has lists of books for me to read. This book is my first Dorothy Parker experience and I found many poems that I loved and quotes that are definitely collectable.

You don't have to do anything more than put the ingredients in the Crockpot and then you are free to catch up on reading or maybe even do some decorating or anything else you want to do besides cook.<br /><br />Penny E. Stone created this book for Entertaining and there are 101 recipes. Each serving costs only seventy-five cents, so it is much cheaper than going out to eat and your home will be filled with delicious home-cooked aromas.<br /><br />Many of the recipes can be started 7 or more hours before guests even arrive. So you don't have to be in a state of stress when people arrive. There is nothing to worry about. You open the Crockpot and a meal is served. There are a few recipes where you add vegetables after four hours or stir after a certain number of hours. Just set your timer and you won't have to worry about the time.<br /><br />Delicious Recipes Include:<br /><br />Lasagna Rolls with Cheese Filling<br />Spiced Corned Beef Glazed in Cranberry-Wine Sauce<br />Chicken Tetrazzini (made with chicken and mushroom soup)<br />Spicy Cheese Dip<br />Baked Rhubarb Pudding<br />Hot Cider<br />Mistletoe Punch<br /><br />This is a sweet and simple book filled with ideas for busy or new cooks. The recipes are all very easy to make. The recipes are designed to serve 6-8 people. If you are planning for more guests, just buy another crockpot. You might want two because then you can make dinner and dessert in crockpots.<br /><br />Even if you don't own a crockpot, there are many recipes you could adapt for the stovetop or oven. The ingredient lists give me lots of ideas for seasoning meats and making quick deserts. Like the creamy fudge sauce just includes melting all the ingredients together and that could even be made in a regular saucepan.<br /><br />Just think of a slow cooked meal, the aroma drifting through the house and Christmas Music. What could be more comforting? Best of all, you can relax when company arrives.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-12-07

Porter, M.D. (Professor of Clinical Surgery in Arizona)<br /><br />John M. Porter has been studying the Tao and believes following the Tao is like \\"walking a living path.\\" I loved how he takes The Star Wars series and explains how it is connected to the basic tenets of Taoism. He shows how Taoist roots touch every aspect of life from feng shui to qu gong or I Ching.<br /><br />If you are new to The Tao Te Ching, it will be interesting to read the translated portions from Stephen Mitchell's translation. If you are a Star Wars fan, then you will enjoy a wealth of quotes. The author's comments are interspaced between quotes from the movie and The Tao Te Ching. You may also find the Chinese characters to be interesting. There are drawings throughout.<br /><br />The Chapters Include:<br /><br />Taoism - an overview and an explanation as to why the Tao is highly personal. There is a brief summary of the concepts to follow in each additional chapter.<br /><br />The Force as the Tao - Quotes from George Lucas and the connection between his movies and Joseph Campbell's teachings.<br /><br />Each additional chapter takes one quality and explores how it shows up in the movies:<br /><br />Acceptance<br /><br />Patience - This chapter was of special interest to me since I once prayed for patience and since then have been thrown into the patience journey. (You sometimes get what you pray for...) In this chapter he shows how Luke needs patience. He then quotes \\"Patient with both friends and enemies, you accord with the way things are\\" from chapter 67 of The Tao Te Ching. Then he gives these quotes:<br /><br />Yoda: (signing) Will he finish what he begins?<br /><br />Then the author shows how patience and perseverance work together to yield good results. Thinking of \\"patience in action\\" was a new concept for me.<br /><br />Uncarved Block<br />Wu Wei<br />Simplicity<br />Humility<br />Life Experience<br />Present Moment Living<br /><br />Yoda the Sage Master - I loved the \\"Traits of a Master\\" in the Yoda chapter. These can be wonderful goals for anyone seeking to live a more spiritual existence.<br /><br />John M. Porter is a natural teacher who knows how to take examples and fill them out into life teachings. This book made me want to go rent the entire Star Wars series and it is a must-have for Star War fans. I found this book to be a peaceful, healing read and I can highly recommend it to you.<br /><br />~The Rebecca ReviewThese can be wonderful goals for anyone seeking to live a more spiritual existence.

Everything is energy- violins, animals, people, potato chips, thoughts, feelings, and events. ~Deena Zalkind Spear<br /><br />I have rarely enjoyed a book as much as \\"Ears of the Angels.\\" From the start you can tell Deena Zalkind Spear is one of those writers who could write about anything and make the journey absolutely enjoyable. While she has a degree in neurobiology, her true love is making violins. In fact, she has been making violins for 30 plus years.<br /><br />Deena Zalkind Spear has a super natural ability to make dull instruments come alive and her imaginative writing takes you into the esoteric intricacies of violin making. Although I knew very little about violin making, this entire book was enlightening from the spiritual perspective. She takes healing to new creative levels and her thoughts helped me understand why when you talk to certain friends your vibrational energy can be enhanced. Why do you feel so good around certain people and feel like you have to run from people who seem to be killing your spirit? This book explained it in ways I never thought any author could.<br /><br />The author recounts her initial years of marriage with an undeniable sense of humor. Her wry wit and casual acceptance of fate explains the background to her craft. This book is for readers who know there is more to life than what meets the eyes. While many people experience unexplainable phenomena, they never explore them in depth. Deena Zalkind Pear takes her talents to new levels and invites us to take this fascinating journey into the unexplained.<br /><br />A highly entertaining read even if you don't play the violin or make violins. Will be especially useful for students of the violin. If you love violin music, this book will show you how violins are made and repaired.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-12-06

This tiny, easy-to-read cookbook has recipes for everything from Red Raspberry Dream Cake to Peaches and Cream Pudding Bars.<br /><br />There are a few helpful hints on page 9 that teach you a few tricks about baking cakes, making chewier cookies and keeping fruit fresh. I've never used glass or stoneware baking dishes for cakes, so that is a new idea for me. I've been buying my cake pans from \\"Jane's Cakes & Chocolates.\\" The results were rather stunning when I used the pans she sells.<br /><br />What amazed me about this cookbook is the sheer simplicity of the recipes and the absolute beauty of the results.<br /><br />Some of the recipes you might enjoy:<br /><br />Orange Rolls<br />Sweet Banana Bread - only 4 ingredients<br />Butterscotch Chip Oatmeal Cookies<br />Blueberry Swirl Cake<br />Chewy Peanut Bars<br />Pumpkin Cheesecake<br /><br />If you love this cookbook, try the first 101 Things to Do With a Cake Mix. I can highly recommend the recipe for Pistachio Pound Cake. It turned out to be \\"Moist, chocolaty, pistachio, dream cake.\\" My relatives were impressed. It is not every day that I try a new recipe and then bravely take the cake to a party, but these books are winners. The ingredients are little more than a cake mix and a few ingredients you probably already have in your kitchen.<br /><br />All I have left to say is, you will get requests for the cakes in this book. I look forward to trying more of the recipes as soon as I can get to the store to buy more cake mixes and instant puddings.<br /><br />LOVE the binding on these cookbooks. Great to cook from and everyone loves the recipes. I just made the Pistachio Cake again this November.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />P.S. Also look for the 101 Things To Do with a Slow Cooker books. Wonderful recipes for home cooking in the winter.	2004-12-06

She has studied personal growth concepts and has incorporated her knowledge into a variety of meditations.<br /><br />She helps you develop a skill that will allow you to relax. I listened to this CD at night, although I was surprised to read it should be listened to at the same time very morning for 30 days. It seems Track 2 could be used for the morning if you enjoy going back to sleep after the alarm goes off. Track 3 and 4 could be used when you want to fall asleep and stay asleep for a longer time.<br /><br />Track 1: Introduction - An explanation of how to use this CD.<br /><br />Track 2: Restorative Sleep - Music plays in the background as Victoria provides thoughts to lead you into a calm state so you can rest peacefully. Use this track when you want to wake up after the session.<br /><br />Track 3: Go To Sleep - As I'm trying to type here, I'm feeling very, very sleepy. It is almost impossible to listen to this without wanting to climb into bed. This is the track that helped me sink into my warm bed and drift into a happy sleep. Victoria encourages you to breathe deeply and relax completely. Slowly you sink into a wonderful \\"trance\\" which just seems to mean sinking into relaxation.<br /><br />Track 4: Deep Sleep - Deep breathing exercises. I was asleep before this track began, but if you need more time to relax, this track focuses on your heart beating calmly and your cells healing as energy flows through your body in this new restful state.<br /><br />The first few times I tried to review this CD, I fell into a blissful sleep. Apparently the results can be seen in as little as one day if you listen to this at night. I'd highly recommend this CD for the evening, especially if you have been having trouble sleeping or find you are not sleeping as deeply as you could be and feel tired during the day.<br /><br />I'm also listening to The Stress Management Workshop.

While I had considered a hand-lettered book to be more difficult to read, I could not have been more wrong.<br /><br />The hand lettering brought a sense of comfort and the contents reminded me of my childhood in Africa. If you lived in a rural area during the 60s and 70s, many of the items in this book will be very familiar. If you love handwritten letters from friends, then this book will quickly find a place in your heart.<br /><br />So, there I was stirring a 5-grain oatmeal mixture for breakfast and I looked down and caught a glimpse of my painted toes reflecting in the glass oven door. Suddenly I was transported to the years of my childhood where we build our own tree houses, watched carrots grow, milked cows, raised chickens, learned how to sew, experienced tick bite fever and snacked on friendship cake while walking barefoot on the warm earth.<br /><br />Living on the Earth is an enchanting read filled with lyricism and whimsy. It is written in a spontaneous style and the topics range from soap making to building rocking cradles out of barrels. Alicia Bay Laurel has illustrated the entire book and it is a completely personal experience.<br /><br />Some of the highlights include backpacking tips, making hammocks with macram&eacute;, making your own soaps, sewing peasant blouses, making your own moccasins, and building a kiln for making pottery.<br /><br />There is also information on how to make candles, bamboo flutes, bean bags, clothing, rose petal jam, organic diet soda, vanilla extract, dried fruits, nut butters, ice cream, sunflower milk, miso, roasted soy beans, smoked fish, bread, beef jerky, sour dough starter, steamed acorns, plum pudding and herbal tinctures.<br /><br />As I sit here with my lovely cozy heated blanket and fluffy slippers I can dream about living out in the wild as my washing machine swishes about with the Seventh Generation laundry soap I recently found at a health food store. This book has many ideas you can incorporate into your normal home life. You don't have to live in a commune to enjoy the information about essential oils, nature-inspired products or environmental issues. The author recommends things like hemp paper and explores the many uses of apple cider vinegar and pumpkin seeds.<br /><br />To say the least, I was intrigued. This is definitely a must-read book for everyone interested in natural remedies. There are recipes for making herbal tinctures and you may find yourself looking for \\"myrrh.\\" If you love to cook you may be intrigued by the recipe for Plum Pudding.<br /><br />Alicia Bay Laurel is writing a modern sequel for the global family. \\"Still Living on the Earth\\" will be published in 2005. This book was updated in 1999 and is filled with useful addresses and websites. I loved the list of \\"more books that are still valuable 30 years later!\\" A helpful index completes this fun guide to living on the earth.<br /><br />I loved reading this book!

These are toys you can cut out and make yourself in a few very easy steps. There are many ways you could use this book and it would be perfect for parties or rainy days. It would also be perfect for birthday presents and Christmas. A few of the boxes could hold delicious miniature cookies. You could make tiny sugar cookies, decorate them, and then give them away in the beautiful boxes.<br /><br />Here is a list of the items you can make in this book:<br /><br />A Sun Box - A variety of sun pictures are on each side of the box. Then, there is a little piece with a bear holding hearts and flowers that can be placed inside the box.<br /><br />Spinners - 6 different \\"Thaumatropes or Turning Wonders\\" that can be made with a piece of heavy thread and some glue. A picture magically appears when you spin the paper.<br /><br />Marble Mice - You will need a marble and glue for this item. The mouse can then slide around like a computer mouse.<br /><br />Tooth Fairy Gazebo - A much better place to leave teeth, for sure.<br /><br />Happy Bus - Bears are featured on this bus and they are on the way to the beach.<br /><br />Box - A box in which to keep seashells and wishes.<br /><br />Bear Wagon - Similar to the bus, but it has two polar bears.<br /><br />Florimel The Magnificent - A puppet theatre with a detailed backdrop, ships and water.<br /><br />Butterfly Basket - One of the beautiful Victorian-style projects that requires very little glue and is very easy to cut out. This basket could hold items while sitting on a desk.<br /><br />Window to Fairyland - My favorite project because the colors are sage, maroon and dark green.<br /><br />Penny Aeroplane/Airplane - A more sophisticated version of the \\"aeroplanes\\" we tried to make as children. What they needed was a penny.<br /><br />Toy Shop - This looks like a little cottage. You will need to cut around the door so it can open and you can see the items inside.<br /><br />Dream Theater - The theatre is in four pieces and is very easy to cut out and glue.<br /><br />Penny Butterfly - After making these butterflies you can balance them on your fingers.<br /><br />Catcher - The catcher reminds me of items we used to make as children, but we used to write little sentences on the inside so when you opened them up, you had secret messages that were revealed.<br /><br />Each playful project in this book is perfect for children of all ages and many of the little boxes can be used for hiding objects and have a \\"mysterious\\" element children will enjoy. The pages are made from high-quality paper and the entire book is quite magical. Marilyn Scott-Walters has created an entire world of imaginative toys that can be made in a matter of minutes and will last for years. I would have loved to have had a book like this as a child and finally it has appeared.<br /><br />~The Rebecca ReviewDream Theater - The theatre is in four pieces and is very easy to cut out and glue.

There I am sitting next to the big windows with a huge red ribbon in my hair and a red, white and blue dessert topped with chocolate, which looks most delicious and magical.<br /><br />It was a day I never forgot because the restaurant rotates and I'd never seen anything like that in my life. Since then we have made many trips back to the Space Needle and I took my nieces up to the restaurant for a special treat when we visited a few years ago.<br /><br />I had to laugh while reading this tiny book because it seems I remember something about a Santa ornament or Christmas ornament being stuck out side the window and we kept seeing it as we spun slowly around in the restaurant. In this story, Santa gets stuck on the top of the Space Needle.<br /><br />\\"The last thing he remembered,<br />he'd flown by a Seagull<br />And now here he was,<br />Stuck atop the Space Needle!\\"<br /><br />There are references to shopping in Pioneer Square, working at Boeing, watching the Christmas Parade of the Ships and visits to Pike Place Market. The restaurant at the top of the Space Needle spins out of control and a cry for help is sent out from Lake Washington to the Puget Sound. Can Boeing help or will it take the Seahawks and the Mariners to get Santa down off the Space Needle?<br /><br />An enjoyable treat that will be loved by anyone who loves Seattle, Washington.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-12-03

It usually leads to extraordinary insights, immediate calls to action, and deeply empowering inner and outer changes. ~Terah Kathryn Collins<br /><br />Feng Shui (fung shway) is a 3,000-year-old Chinese design philosophy that encourages you to analyze and change your environment for personal growth and relaxation. As your mind starts to change, this change is reflected in your environment. You can also change your environment and adjust your viewpoint or even bring more success and peace into your life.<br /><br />Terah Kathryn Collins is an internationally recognized consultant, speaker and teacher. Her writing style is highly creative and filled with positive energy. Her ideas are enlightening and comforting and they changed how I viewed my environment. Through the application of her ideas you can improve your creativity, change your health, bring positive energy into your home and create a home that reflects who you are becoming. This is a practical approach with personal flair. You can personalize the ideas to suit your goals. There are 125 black-and-white and color photographs to give you ideas and to explain the text.<br /><br />After a quick introduction to this art, Terah Kathryn Collins introduces \\"The Bagua Map.\\" This was great fun to draw (This just looks like a tic-tac-toe board drawn over a footprint drawing of your home.) and by the time you have your house mapped out, you can start to map your office and bedrooms. Then, you can make notes around the drawings. Additional chapters include:<br /><br />Yin and Yang and the Five Elements<br />Romancing the Home - art, color, crystals, lighting, living things, mirrors, nature objects, sound makers, water features and wind dancers.<br />The Front Entry and Foyer<br />The Living Room<br />The Dining Room - Nurturing Body, Heart, and Soul<br />The Kitchen - Nourishment's Birthplace<br />The Family Room<br />The Home Office<br />Bedrooms<br />The Sancturary<br />Bathrooms<br />Laundry Rooms and Garages<br />Attics, Basements and Other Storage Areas<br />Hallways and Stairways<br />Windows and Doors<br />Cleansings and Blessings - Creative ideas for making a home yours, especially if you are not the first owner.<br /><br />This book also explains why you can buy dried flowers, but presents the idea as a long-term arrangement instead of a permanent arrangement. There are also cautions against placing crystals in windows with direct sunlight and other cautions that can keep your home safe.<br /><br />I realized the power of Feng Shui personally when I moved my desk so I could see the door and the window. The gift of a wonderful Zen fountain and the placement of a lamp on the desk also brought more serenity to my writing experience. It is amazing how much more relaxed my relationship with my husband has become just because I moved my desk. Now I can see him entering our home and even when I'm deep in a writing trance, I can acknowledge his presence and Princess Sasha cat now enjoys looking out of the window while I'm typing. Air can flow more freely into the room and the scent of flowers from the planter drifts over the desk as I type. Just one simple example of how Feng Shui changed my immediate existence. The desk on page 167 was my guide for arranging a more effective writing space.<br /><br />This book would make a wonderful house warming present! Especially with a Zen fountain, plants or candles.<br /><br />Personally, I'd recommend making changes over time. Moving furniture could be the first step and then you could purchase items over a few months or years. Even the author explained how she made small changes at first and planned for changes in the future when she could afford to buy a new couch, etc.<br /><br />Half the fun is making changes over time and seeing wonderful energy start to flow into your life. The author promotes inner and outer work.She explains how \\"you\\" breathe \\"the magic\\" into the changes you make. When your environment is more positive and nurturing, you will feel more creative and this can lead to lasting changes.<br /><br />If you love to decorate you are going to love this book! This is my favorite Feng Shui book because it has ideas that have changed my life.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review, you will feel more creative and this can lead to lasting changes.

Once I started reading it was a true journey through time and I could hardly wait to find out what \\"Science First\\" had occurred next. Robert Adler highlights the sudden brilliance of a select number of scientists, which actually seems to be a result of serious study and contemplation.<br /><br />You can literally see how ideas evolved through time and how each scientist discovered inner genius despite immense discouragement and conflict, not to mention religious persecution and their own human foibles. You can see how humans started to observe the exterior surroundings and then started to delve into the areas of cell structure and the invisible atom.<br /><br />This book presents scientists in all their human glory and the honesty gives each scientist a true personality. Many struggled to overcome physical and psychological adversities or were led to their death by their own natural curiosity. It was not uncommon for these individuals to be a living part of their own experiments. However, not even plagues could hinder scientific research and the work went on through time despite a seemingly eternal and chaotic war of life itself that seemed determined to thwart their efforts.<br /><br />Thales, Anaximander, Pythagoras, Aristotle, Aristarchus, Archimedes, Ibn al-Haitham, Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Van Leeuwenhoek, Newton, Joseph Priestley, Humphry Davy, Darwin, Gregor Mendel, Dmitri Mendeleev, Marie Curie, Guglielmo Marconi, Max Planck, Ernest  Rutherford, Albert Einstein, Alfred Wegener, Edwin Hubble, Raymond Dart,  Barbara McClintock, Claude Shannon, James Watson, Francis Crick, Rosalind Franklin, Karl Jansky, Lynn Margulis, Michel Mayor, Didier Queloz, Ian Wilmut and Keith Campbell all make their appearances.<br /><br />Robert Adler shows how Charles Babbage (1792-1871) and Ada Byron Lovelace were at the cutting edge of technology and how Babbage designed a machine that functioned like a modern computer. If you become especially interested in any of the scientists or chapters, there is a reference section for further reading. The index is perfect for your own research or for locating a subject of interest. I thought each chapter was perfect in content and it definitely made me more interested in reading about additional scientific discoveries.<br /><br />Quotes are found throughout the chapters and I was especially impressed by the letter Einstein wrote to Marie Curie who had to overcome great personal trials to achieve her goals. I liked how Robert Adler refutes the myth of Einstein being a slow learner and he makes his points most eloquently. Pictures throughout the text gives this book an additional dose of personality and the biographical information is especially interesting.<br /><br />Robert Adler presents a scientific journey through time that is filled with insight and a depth of clarity that is stunning. This is one of the most highly crafted books I've ever read. Not only does Robert Adler delve into complex ideas about physics, biology and astronomy, he makes the ideas accessible to readers who may faintly remember these subjects from high school, college or the news. I can't wait to read his book about medical discoveries.<br /><br />Science Firsts is truly a book about how scientific discovery changed the world.

Not only did she make painful mistakes, she learned a great deal in the process. Through her own journey to adulthood, she learned how to recognize opportunities and avoid dangers.<br /><br />All the topics are divided into small chapters so this book is very easy to read and many of the chapters are two to three pages. She discusses how each of us has challenges and gifts and how we can plug into our intuition and trust our instincts. She also covers topics like:<br /><br />Defining Boundaries<br />Gaining a New Perspective<br />Expecting the Unexpected<br />Choices that Change Your Life<br />Dealing with Failure and Regret<br />Pain and Suffering as Part of Living<br />Alcohol and Drug Abuse<br />Preventing Abuse<br />Life and Death<br />You and the World<br />Relationships<br />Family and Friends<br />Forgiveness<br />Live Your Dreams<br /><br />Aunt Laya Saul has a true love for quotes and this book is filled with inspirational moments, stories and wisdom gained from experience and reading. She has a talent for taking difficult issues and making the solutions seem very logical and desirable. Aunt Laya is on your side and she quickly summarizes each issue and then presents the negative and positive results of each choice you could make. The index is well organized and you can quickly locate issues like peace, compassion, anxiety, frustration, love, jealousy and many others.<br /><br />Through reading this book you can avoid dangerous situations and learn how to nurture healthy relationships. I liked her ideas about replacing fear with excitement and how to approach change one breath at a time. \\"You Don't Have to Learn Everything the Hard Way\\" is a encouraging book that can be enjoyed by teenagers and adults of any age. These are issues that follow us throughout our lives. There are also notes about additional reading materials and resources, which would be of interest to anyone working with teens.

Then I steamed some spinach in a warm filtered-water mist, read a book, and went to sleep. Then at four o'clock the next morning, I woke up in a cold sweat. I had gone from being an independent single woman to being the sole provider of Christmas for three innocent children. What had I been thinking? ~Sharon Glassman<br /><br />Sharon Glassman instantly captured my attention with her modern journal about her adventures that lead up to the first entry on December 22nd at 2 A.M. Not the time of day one expects to find anyone at a post office. However, the all-night main Manhattan post office on Thirty-third Street and Eighty Avenue is where we find the author waiting in line, observing her surroundings and taking the opportunity to chat with a hockey player with a French accent and irresistible smile.<br /><br />Sharon Glassman's writing style is witty, modern and deliciously entertaining. Santiago Cohen's art really captured my attention and helped to give the story an additional dimension of merriment.<br /><br />Sharon Glassman may well be the Bridget Jones of Christmas although the focus is much more on shopping and the story focuses on buying gifts for children. The \\"wish lists\\" to Santa are letters sent to the post office from families in need. Sharon finds herself interested in three letters and then wonders what she was thinking. She only has a few days to find the presents and get them shipped in time for Christmas.<br /><br />As she recounts her own Christmas history, you can see why her desire to transform herself into a \\"Lace-Clad Girlfriend of Christmas\\" overtakes her and leads her to her dream Christmas party. She also takes us along for her Christmas shopping trip that may inspire your own Operation Santa Claus dreams.<br /><br />In her search for the perfect presents, she realized how specific the children's wishes are and that a castle, a football and a down jacket will take her on some interesting shopping trips. I loved her description of New York and how her pro-Noel family camped out on a red-and-green plaid living room couch to watch holiday television specials.<br /><br />If you are wondering how you could give the gift of Christmas to children or adults across America, Sharon's heart-defrosting story will give you ideas about how you can find similar volunteer efforts.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewher on some interesting shopping trips.

I saw it and instantly fell in love with the red library binding and gold embossing on the fabric cover. This is one of those books you want to carry around with you in your pocket to read on a sunny day while sitting on a park bench.<br /><br />While most of the poems were new to me, I did find lines to make any poet drown in the pure beauty of words. \\"In My Sky at Twilight\\" is a paraphrase of the 30th poem in Raindranath Tagore's The Gardener. The images are lush and mingle emotion with nature. \\"In Former Days\\" by Bhartrhari (5th Century) is witty and beautiful in its simplicity. Two lovers are so in love they forget their separateness and then drift back to being \\"you\\" and \\"me.\\" The poem is a mere four lines and yet it provides a intimate look at how lovers feel when in love and when they drift apart. I loved a few lines in \\"The Palanquin\\" where a butterfly lands on delicate skin and transfers colors onto the lover's skin.<br /><br />The poems are divided into 7 sections:<br /><br />Definitions and Persuasions<br />Love and Poetry<br />Praising the Loved One<br />Pleasures and Pains<br />Fidelity and Inconstancy<br />Absence, Estrangement and Parting<br />Love Past<br /><br />You may recognize poems by Lord Byron, Edgar Allan Poe, William Shakespeare, Walt Whitman and Dorothy Parker. I was pleasantly surprised by poems by Leconte De Lisle, Pablo Neruda and Dioskorides.<br /><br />You will find a wide range of love poems. This book contains selections from ancient China to modern America. These poems present the universal experience of the human heart.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-11-05

The quotes in this slim journal caught my attention because I had read very few of them or was actually trying to find out the author for numerous quotes.<br /><br />There are over 100 journal pages, tips on beginning and maintaining a journal, inspirational quotes, recommended travel guides and websites, tourist office locations, blank address pages, conversion and clothing size charts, money and currency exchange information, U.S. embassies and consulates, packing tips and checklists, record keeping lists, journal contents page, natural remedies, Cybercafe locations, European holidays and even information on how to make an easy return to the U.S.<br /><br />Each journal page had a line for Date and Place and the<br />lines are delicate so you don't have to keep within the lines.<br /><br />When I last traveled to Europe, I didn't think of having a journal with me. Why? I was just so excited about the trip itself, I didn't think of writing about the experience while I was traveling. Now I wish I'd had this journal with me so I could remember more of my trip in detail.<br /><br />I'd also recommend this book to quote collectors because of the unique travel quotes and short biographies of American and European authors, artists and thinkers.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-11-02

D. is a fitness consultant and Lorie Schleck, M.A., P.T., is a fitness consultant. Together, they have developed a total fitness program to encourage a healthier life. There are six main chapters/steps:<br /><br />1. Making the Decision - Deciding to \\"fitness walk.\\"<br /><br />2. Getting Started with Fitness Walking - Target Zone information and Creating a Custom Program.<br /><br />3. Fitness Walking Plus - Incorporating toning into your walking<br /><br />4. Strength Training - A 15 and 30-minute strength training program.<br /><br />5. Target Toning - Toning exercises that will enhance your walking.<br /><br />6. A Week in the Life of a ShapeWalker - Liz, Tom and Jodi share their secrets and you can see charts of walking activities. Throughout this book, you will find pictures of toning exercises and walking techniques.<br /><br />At the end of the book, you can find a Fitness Walking Record. I also found I could keep track of my walking in a fitness journal. This section of the book is essential to keep you focused and motivated. Before keeping a fitness journal I could not see where I was going or where I had been. When you keep track of your progress, it is highly motivational. At that point, you keep increasing your knowledge and you find out what works.<br /><br />If you are continuously working on your New Year's resolutions, this book can give you new goals for the coming year. I tend to want to start new projects in the summer, although walking is a year-round activity you can enjoy in any season. I started becoming more serious about my walking over 51 weeks ago and it was the breakthrough I needed. When you only stretch and do Pilates and Yoga, you can see good results in muscle tone, but it is the walking or other aerobic exercises that take you to a new level in your fitness. I found that just doing one or the other is definitely not as effective as doing aerobics and toning. That made my walking easier and made my toning sessions much more enjoyable because I had more endurance and a new level of confidence.<br /><br />Not only does walking oxygenate the body, it helps you to feel less stiff, can reduce bodily pain and will definitely help you lose inches. Since I started my walking program I've lost about 11 ½ inches. I did notice that when you gain muscle, your weight takes a while to regulate and then drops week by week. This was also mentioned on some of the makeover shows on TV, but is rarely mentioned in health books.<br /><br />Whether you are just starting a walking program or have decided to incorporate target toning, this book has a lot to offer. This is the new edition and not only does this book help you develop a walking program, the authors give special attention to the abs, butt, thighs and arms.<br /><br />What will you need? Walking shoes, an exercise band and free weights.<br /><br />Some of the helpful items in this book include:<br /><br />Advice for various weather conditions.<br />Advice about heart-rate monitoring.<br />How to get rid of cellulite - no creams needed.<br />Ideas about keeping a Food Journal<br />Developing a Plan for a Lifetime of Fitness<br />Working out in your Target Zone<br /><br />ShapeWalking may encourage you to take a 10-minute walk before lunch or you may find yourself looking forward to walking on your treadmill while watching a new movie. When I started my walking program, I didn't push myself too much and this seems to be why I was able to keep up with the program. If you burn out at the start by overdoing it, the result will be a rejection of healing. Healing should be a fun process and when you keep track of your inches lost, you will love walking. You might also enjoy wearing a pedometer at first to see how many steps you are talking. When I saw how little I was walking at first; that made me very aware of how much I needed to move.<br /><br />Winter Tips: Layer your clothes, look for waterproof walking shoes, plan your route before youleave the house. Use Walk Away the Pounds workouts if it is icy outside.<br /><br />The most important thing is to just keep moving. When you realize how good it feels when you do exercise, you can never go back to not exercising. A few hidden benefits of walking include:<br /><br />Aleviates Depression<br />Releases Endorphins<br />Reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease<br />Helps to Clear the Mind and gives you a sense of well-being<br />Boosts Your Self-Esteem<br />Prevents the loss of bone density<br />Helps to Maintain Good Posture<br />Controls your Weight<br />Increases Muscle Definition<br />Reduces Stress<br />Lessens Stiffness (especially if you are also stretching)<br />Encourages deeper breathing<br />Gives you the energy you need to maintain a healthy existence<br /><br />Also:<br /><br />Encourages healthy eating habits (this really seems to happen because once you are committed to exercise, healthy eating will naturally follow.)<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewoving.

One of my best gal friends from college is always dreaming of having her brother build her a log cabin. I'm dreaming of visiting her and sipping hot chocolate by a fireplace and catching up on her travels to Russia. The wish to live in a log cabin may be inspired by a romantic weekend or a trip to a friend's house in the woods.<br /><br />In \\"Log Cabin Classics\\" old-world cabins are inspired by nostalgic moments, a desire to be in harmony with nature and local materials.<br /><br />You will find information on Cabin Fever, Building Small Cabins, Second Homes, Planning Strategies, Risks and Problems, Budgeting and Construction Contracts, Reclaiming Wood and Building with Nature.<br /><br />The author, Robbin Obomsawin is the construction manager and general contractor for Beaver Creek Log Homes. She has an in-depth knowledge of conventional construction and lives in Westdale, New York.<br /><br />Robbin displays not only a intricate knowledge of log cabin construction, she is a deft writer who displays a true love of natural surroundings and nature escapes.<br /><br />If you are looking for decorating ideas, there are quite a few and full-color pictures display various settings. There are house plans complete with ideas for wraparound kitchens and bedroom lofts.  I love the cozy bedrooms and rocking chairs placed near fireplaces.<br /><br />Bonus: You can also order blueprints from Beaver Creek Log Homes. There is also a list of resources to help you plan your building project.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-10-31

He travels throughout the country for readings, lectures and is well loved by his audiences.<br /><br />Listening to Billy Collins read his poems gave me a new appreciation for his genius. His poetry increases my capacity for viewing the world on a new artistic level. While listening, I had moments of nostalgia as images danced across my mind.<br /><br />In this CD, you will find many of your favorite poems from many of his published works. They include:<br /><br />1. Another reason I don't keep a gun in the house - A story of a dog barking. He humorously mixes images of a barking dog solo and Beethoven.<br />2. Shoveling snow with the Buddha - Winter work ends with warm drinks.<br />3. Marginalia - An especially enjoyable poem for anyone who loves to find scribblings in books.<br />4. Afternoon with Irish Cows - Completely vibrant images. You can truly see the images poem.<br /><br />5. Walking across the Atlantic - An imaginative journey while walking on the water. He imagines what the fish must think about the bottoms of his feet appearing, disappearing.<br />6. Intro - An introduction that explains the title of this CD.<br />7. Consolation - Written to consol himself after canceling a trip to Europe.<br />8. Forgetfulness - If you are over 30, this makes complete sense. An intensely comical poem that will be appreciated by anyone trying to remember the name of a book or name of the author.<br /><br />9. Workshop - Newbies enjoy entertaining Billy Collins with their artistic expression.<br />10. Morning - Feet on a cold floor and espresso while the typewriter awaits.<br />11. Driving myself to a poetry reading - An analysis of his feelings as represented<br />in how he places himself at various points - the car hood and the backseat.<br />12. Wolf - A wolf reads a book of fairy tales. This is perhaps one of my favorite Billy Collins poems. I love the description of the fur bristling and how he turns each page with his nose.<br /><br />13. Purity - Explains how he loves to write and drink tea. His explanation of<br />how he writes romantic poetry is almost an interesting insight into male sexuality.<br />14. The Art of Drowning - Will you really see your life flash before your eyes?<br />15. Nostalgia - \\"Remember the 1340s?\\" I love this poem because it is a humorous visual journey back in time.<br />16. Candle Hat - A poem about a Goya painting.<br /><br />17.

The darkest hours may bring the brightest blessings.&#34; ~Mom, April 4, 1968<br /><br />While reading my mother's diary from the first year of my life, I noticed that she was not only writing notes about me, she was writing notes about God. She would describe her joys, her experiences and her love for God. Between all these notes, my first year appears. What a beautiful gift!<br /><br />When you stop to think about it, how many individuals experience God in exactly the same way? Finally, I've realized that God is not limited to our ideas of who he is and at times he can surprise us by appearing while we are exercising or making us feel loved as we are falling asleep. In fact, I think God is mostly found outside of Church because he wants us to worship him in mind, body and soul.<br /><br />This might mean that you worship God while exercising, while studying or even while reviewing. Where are you the happiest? God can meet you there. You can find God while laughing with your best friends, while reading a book, while listening to music. The experience of God can be similar to being in love. I feel it as radiant energy (like the sun) glowing in my body. As if I'm being warmed by the sun or by love.<br /><br />You feel nurtured, protected and renewed. It gives you a sense that you are in fact in control of your destiny and that God wants the best for your life.<br /><br />In this fascinating journey through the minds of 40 Well-Known Seekers, we find 10 main questions. The answers range from casual observations to deeply poetic descriptions.<br /><br />The Main Chapters include:<br /><br />How I Encounter God<br />What God Feels Like<br />Diving into the Divine<br />How I Pray or Meditate<br />What Cuts Me Off From God?<br />Helpful Beliefs I Have<br />What Does God Want?<br />Finding God in Daily Life<br />In Search of the Miraculous<br />My Spiritual Advice Is<br />Paths to God<br /><br />Contributors: Lynn Andrews, Marilyn Atteberry, Pat Boone, Joan Borysenko, LeVar Burton, Mantak Chia, Deepak Chopra, Alan Cohen, Stan Dale, Ram Dass, Bruce Davis, Wayne Dyer, Warren Farrell, Willis Harman, Richard Hatch, Louise L.

Young Sowers, Jim Nissley, Robert Fulghum, John White, Doreen Virtue and Jonathan Robinson.<br /><br />Through this book you can learn about why negative emotions separate you from your experience with God, why it is good to understand and eradicate fear, how living in a state of appreciation for life itself allows you to love God.<br /><br />While reading Pam Oslie's description of how she cleans the house and talks to God, I had a moment where I enjoyed a good laugh. Finally even Jesus is there to help with the housework. I mean, you could even talk to God while you are cleaning the tub.<br /><br />With a minimum of spiritual terminology, God becomes very accessible. Jonathan Robinson has created a beautiful gift about how wonderful the experience of God can be. I think when you truly start to see God as a God of Love, life becomes less of a conflict and much more of a comforting journey. Why should we only have peace in the next life, when this life awaits?<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review, Bruce Davis, Wayne Dyer, Warren Farrell, Willis Harman, Richard Hatch, Louise L.

I truly feel that I knew very little about yoga before reading this book, even though I've practiced yoga for many years.<br /><br />Indra Devi introduced me to Bhakti Yoga: achieving union with God through devotion and selfless love so you can become a channel of God's grace. I'm sure you could incorporate various principles into your life without having to leave society altogether. In fact, I think yoga helps you to live more peacefully with other people.<br /><br />I also enjoy Jnana Yoga - Knowledge and study. Who knew that there were 10 Rules for a Yoga Code of Morality or that there were so many branches of yoga.<br /><br />I also learned that Dharana is mind control and that Samadhi is the ultimate state of bliss. Asana or \\"postures\\" are just the beginning. While most workout videos do not introduce you to a spiritual dimension of yoga, I found that Indra Devi's way of exploring this aspect of yoga is not at all threatening to anyone practicing any religion. You don't have to change your religion to increase your flexibility, develop clear thinking or live a more healthy life.<br /><br />What I'm finding lately is that to live a more fulfilling life, you almost have to look at various cultures and traditions and start to incorporate beautiful knowledge into your life. Life is a huge smorgasbord of experience and I hate to limit myself to living in one little box. I want to find out what secrets are hiding in many beautiful presents.<br /><br />Yoga is one of those presents. Not only does it help you become more \\"present,\\" it presents an experience that leads to a place of total relaxation you cannot get by doing almost anything else. I have never experienced places of peace like I have with yoga.<br /><br />Indra Devi explains why you should not keep plants in your bedroom, how you can get rid of a toxic headache and why you should not rush out of bed in the morning. She explains various cleansing diets and helps you understand the core causes of illness. She explains why you should eat natural honey and why water is best at room temperature.<br /><br />While it is interesting to read about the various poses, I must say it is almost easier to learn yoga through a video/DVD. You may want to try the exercises in the Yoga Journal's Yoga Step By Step DVDs as you are reading this book. You will find instruction for:<br /><br />Cleansing Breaths<br />Walking Breathing Exercises<br />Postures - Cobra, Lotus, Swan, Churning, Angular Balance, Mountain, Bending Forward, Reverse and many more...<br />Understanding the Chakras<br />A Healthy Diet<br />A Reducing Diet<br />Making Healthy Meals - recipes included<br /><br />This is one of the Yoga Classics. If you are interested in yoga and want to move towards \\"Samadhi,\\" then this book will show you how to balance your mind, body and spirit. Until you can control your breathing, take control of your mind and move your body into a state of relaxation, nirvana might seem impossible. After doing yoga for years, you will start to realize that it is possible, if only for moments at a time. Those moments are quite beautiful and healing. I look forward to \\"corpse\\" pose when you just relax as the earth holds you.<br /><br />Back to gazing at my new Zen fountain...<br /><br />If you enjoy this book, you might also enjoy:<br /><br />The Experience of God: How 40 Well-Known Seekers Encounter the Sacred.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review, how you can get rid of a toxic headache and why you should not rush out of bed in the morning.

Once they get to the sites they can watch videos, listen to sounds through sound buttons, take virtual tours, read real-time reports, access databases and take interactive quizzes.<br /><br />There are 8 core sections to explain and explore over 220 science topics.<br /><br />Matter and Materials<br />Forces and Energy<br />Electricity and Magnetism<br />Space<br />Earth<br />Plants<br />Animals<br />Human Body<br /><br />This has to be one of the most beautiful books DK has ever created. The colors are vibrant and the section on Space is bursting with spiral galaxies and pictures of space exploration. If you are interested in Volcanoes, you can turn to the Earth section. You can read about the eruption on Mount St. Helens and see pictures before and after volcanic eruptions.<br /><br />In the Health Section, children can learn about exercise, hygiene and diet. I found the information on the futuristic nanorobots in the bloodstream fascinating.<br /><br />Every section has a bold heading and interesting definition. Then, there are pages and pages of full-color pictures that can keep your attention for hours at a time.

While most books seem to put an emphasis on exercise routines and eating plans, the authors have added a new level of spirituality. The authors shed new light on Proverbs 31 and yes, there are many references to Christianity throughout the text.<br /><br />\\"Both Charity and I want to become beautiful, healthy, balanced women of God, both in body and soul.\\" ~Cynthia<br /><br />The authors both struggled with various illnesses and spiritual temptations and show how an overemphasis on spirituality and an imbalanced attitude in regards to food can be detrimental. The authors make the point that you can go to church and yet totally neglect your body. Is your body not the temple of God? Cynthia and Charity describe how they struggled with their own illnesses to the point where they knew a change was needed.<br /><br />Both authors seem to have read many health books and while their focus is on health, they also are concerned with the cancer of the soul and why we should all be concerned with our spiritual health. They also discuss things like gossip, forgiveness and commitment to spiritual principles. In the midst of all this, they also discuss aromatherapy, journaling, exercise routines, herbal teas and supplements for health.<br /><br />To say this book is overflowing with ideas is an understatement. The authors also talk about future books they are planning or writing.<br /><br />I think this book will be most appreciated by women who love God and who want to live a holy life dedicated to improving body, soul and spirit. Not only are the authors trying to live a life in accordance to Biblical principles, they are trying to encourage more women to also live a similar lifestyle.<br /><br />If you are not interested in the spiritual part of this book, there is still much to learn and I found I was even more motivated to buy a Vita-Mix than ever before. I know I feel better when I eat a lot of salads and my energy level soars when I avoid certain foods, but I was not aware of why this was the case.<br /><br />Throughout this book I found many helpful solutions. If you are interested in a low-salt diet, then there are ideas for a variety of salt substitutes. If you have yet to discover the benefits of Grapefruit Seed Extract, Green Tea or a number of antioxidants, then this book will show you why these items are essential to your health.<br /><br />Are you struggling with depression, low energy levels, complete fatigue, weight problems or illnesses you know you have but doctors don't seem to understand? Then this book can be helpful in many regards. If you love to cook, you will find a few recipes. Although, I must say I hope the authors write a detailed cookbook for all of us who enjoy step-by-step instructions.<br /><br />While the authors do at times border on spiritual exuberance (upbeat x 10) in their writing, this book could give many women hope. At times it is good to indulge in a little positive thought even if you are feeling slightly grouchy at the time. It can at least awaken our hearts to the possibility of joy.<br /><br />For any woman struggling with PMS, bladder infections, abdominal pain or intense sugar cravings, this book can provide some insight into how you can wage a battle against candidiasis. The authors provide lists of medications and show you how simple lifestyle changes can improve your health.<br /><br />I was actually surprised the author recommended artificial anything, including sweeteners. I find Stevia to be much more tasty than anything artificial. Even after reading this book, I'm not convinced that fat is the enemy, I still think it is carbohydrates in too high a quantity. I've also read that fructose is more damaging thansucrose. You might want to read The Metabolic Plan for more information.<br /><br />Here are some ideas for your shopping list for health.

Not only can you adapt the recipe to your own cooking method, you can prepare the recipe ahead of time before a party. The zucchini slices are tossed in seasonings, garlic, basil and olive oil. I love frying the zucchini in a large frying pan in the winter, even if the recipe does call for grilling.

He wants all of us to enjoy His very best. I'm perfectly imperfect and often \\"mess up,\\" but God loves me anyway, in spite of myself. Above all, He knows my heart. ~Pat Brannon<br /><br />\\"You're Steppin' On My Heart\\" is a collection of poetry that shows the power of God's love and how we can draw on that power through our own decisions.<br /><br />Pat Brannon explores a variety of topics through lyrical meditations. Her poems are at times stories, prayers or even letters. She also wrote poems during difficult times when she struggled with her own human frailty and at times she celebrates the gift of life itself.<br /><br />Along life's rough and bumpy road, we sometimes crash and burn<br />Experiencing unexpected twists, there are lessons to be learned<br />Hindsight gives us knowledge that we didn't have before<br />Wisdom adds awareness to accumulate and store<br />~Pat Brannon<br /><br />Throughout her poems, Pat Brannon maintains a similar style and focus and these poems are a reflection of Pat's inner journey and her love for God. Like all of us, her life is a daily struggle and she expresses feelings of love, contentment, trust, elation, anger, devastation, helplessness and confusion.<br /><br />In \\"Letting Go,\\" Pat writes a story of how a woman draws on her inner strength to carry on in life when she loses her baby. She takes a very sensitive issue and explores God's unconditional love in our lives. Then, in \\"A Heart's Tug Away,\\" she tells a beautiful story of an aged man who is walking in the snow and feeling dejected and lonely. I thought this was her most beautiful poem and it shows how we can all make a difference in the life of a stranger who can then become a friend. \\"Imperfect World\\" reveals a world of broken vows and ruined lives.<br /><br />Pat Brannon deals with so many daily issues that appear in our lives during times of stress and healing. She writes poems about Apathy, Making a Difference, Divine Intervention and Inspiration. Her poem \\"Cart Before the Horse\\" is a profound statement. It shows how we have to love first and provide basic care to those in need before they will accept a message of love. In this poem, Pat describes homelessness, hunger, financial issues and how God can love others through actions of heart-felt dedication.

If so, this book will outline the steps you need to take to gain control over your bills, avoid triggering an avalanche of debt, and even have a surplus each month. ~Larry Burkett<br /><br />While bills continue to arrive on schedule, Larry Burkett says there are many bills which may be unnecessary. What is necessary and what is not? In this guide you can take an honest look at your present spending habits and develop a plan of action to not only get out of debt, but to start saving for vacations or other purchases.<br /><br />Larry makes some great points about credit and how buying items on credit can increase their cost substantially. Suddenly, that couch on sale may not seem like such a bargain when you realize you will be paying double the price.<br /><br />So, how do you get control of your money? Larry Burkett gives practical tips for recording expenses and once you have recorded the necessary items like rent, food and utilities, you can start to find out how much you are spending on entertainment and decide what is really essential.<br /><br />It may take you a year or more to get out of debt, but once you have less bills, you can increase your savings. This book is an invaluable tool for anyone who is leaving home and starting their journey into the independent life. The last thing you want to do is become chained to debt. This book encourages an understanding of basic expenses and shows you how to save money by clipping coupons. I find that those preferred savings cards at grocery stores and rewards cards can save me twenty dollars at a time. You could literally leave a store with your weekly groceries and have saved forty dollars if you can find the right coupons and maximize savings with membership cards.

For instance, if you are trying to be healthy, not only will you want to eat nutritious food, but you will recognize how your physical surroundings affect your health. ~Kartar Diamond<br /><br />When my husband worked as a real estate agent, he encountered Feng Shui at full force. Not only would clients shy away from certain styles of homes, they loved the number 8 in a price.<br /><br />Can a house truly affect your wealth and health? Well, in my case it seems that the last location was detrimental to my financial health and the new location has encouraged not only a more healthy financial situation (even though it costs more to live here), it has in fact improved my marriage and has increased my creativity. How does this work? Is there a reason Feng Shui (pronounced fung shway) works and why does this 3,000-year-old Chinese design philosophy change lives?<br /><br />Not only will a simple change in the placement of a desk improve your mood, it could also make you more productive, increase your income and encourage a healthier work environment. By changing the position of my desk in my work area, I not only created a calmer environment (no more startling experiences with someone walking in my room from behind), I also can now open a window (therefore increasing the shen-chi/good energy) and Princess Sasha (living Ch'i enhancement) enjoys the view and she also seems to be enjoying my new interest in this topic. So, not only can a study of Feng Shui improve your life, it can improve the life of everyone living in your home, pets included.<br /><br />In fact, Kartar Diamond even goes as far as to show how certain types of homes can promote infertility or increase the likelihood of crime. Why do some houses attract ghosts and should you take down that wind chime? How can you separate the superstition from the life-changing principles?<br /><br />Kartar Diamond addresses Western Skepticism with her own skepticism. First, she explains scams, shows how incorrect information can be harmful and even includes a touch of humor where you would never expect it to appear. She is just as skeptical when it comes to companies that are not teaching the correct principles (there are apparently more than 100 different schools) and exposes a variety of scams where Feng Shui experts took advantage of people who were truly seeking good in their lives. So, even if you hire a Feng Shui expert, I'd highly recommend reading this book.<br /><br />Before reading this book I wondered why you could have wood furniture (see page 13) and not dead plants in the form of potpourri (you can still have dried flowers - page 118). You might also be wondering if you have to use all of the five elements in each room. Kartar Diamond says you don't have to include all the elements in each room and explains how you should not try to decorate each room with equal does of the five elements of water, wood, fire, earth and metal. I didn't actually realize I even had significant metal items until I realized how many tables and bookshelves I have that are made of metal. So, after reading this book, I now understand which element to increase. I have enough wood, but need to increase the \\"water\\" and \\"fire\\" elements.<br /><br />Should you paint a front door red?<br />Should you place a mirror behind a kitchen stove?<br />Is it harmful to store things under your bed?<br />Can books in your bedroom cause insomnia?<br /><br />This book will be especially helpful for designers, interior decorators or anyone considering the purchase of a new home. There is a detailed chapter on using a compass. You may want to hire a professional if you are serious about an extremely accurate reading. The \\"Actual Case Study House Types\\" shows how specific house types can contribute to romance or even divorce.<br /><br />If you enjoy this book and are looking for pictures of Feng Shui furniture placement , I think you will also enjoy The Western Guide to Feng Shui: Room By Room. I have arranged my desk like the picture on page 167 and found the book to be especially helpful in setting up my desk space and living room. After reading a few books on this subject, I've started to realize that you may even be currently practicing a form of intuitive Feng Shui without even reading a book on the subject. Many decisions about furniture placement, just feel right.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewtern Guide to Feng Shui: Room By Room.

There is a purpose for your life. When you become clear about your mission, a deep feeling of inner contentment begins to develop within you. You truly know that every experience in your life is propelling you forward in alignment with your mission. ~Denise Linn<br /><br />Through a series of journal-style letters to the reader, affirmations and life-enhancing suggestions, Denise Linn leads you through 28 days of soul cleansing.<br /><br />Through this process you can discover your authentic self. I read this book in a few hours because I'm one of those people who is already constantly organizing things and taking car loads to the local charity. So, blissfully, while reading this book, I could skip many of the organizing sections because I've been working on that all year and had just finished the \\"putting things in the bathroom in baskets\\" project! Some of the suggestions will take my organizing/discovery to the next level. Many have nothing to do with organizing, but have more to do with connections to family, love, loyalty, security, courage, wisdom or even removing the clutter on your computer.<br /><br />Now I want to enhance my bedroom environment with different art that reflects my inner world, buy clothes that are much more feminine and write recipes in pretty journal style books so I can find them more easily when making spontaneous meals. Denise also gave me ideas for buying candles (lately I'm looking into soy candles), decorating my living room (might move the couch to a more Feng Shui position) and I suddenly thought I should start to collect affirmations in a big box for inspiration.<br /><br />One of her affirmations was: \\"I honor my commitments to myself and to others.\\" She also encourages you to follow one of the levels in the book. There are three levels and you can commit to going full out or just making one empowering change each day. There are ideas that will jump out at you and others you will have already completed.<br /><br />A few days after I finished reading this book I felt like I was starting to see my real life mission and I felt energized and renewed. I shall now unleash myself on the world. Or at least try to finish some projects.<br /><br />I planted some mums out on the deck (to renew my planter) and will now finally refinish a trunk I've had since I was a child. This book helped me make a long list of projects to complete and I think when you finally do complete things that matter to you, you get a sense of fulfillment and you can also be healed by making household item donations to your local charity. I cleaned out half my kitchen!<br /><br />By the end of this book, you will have written a life purpose or mission statement and know all about your shadow self. My shadow self is rather disorganized at the moment, but mostly because I'm in the middle of all these projects!<br /><br />Denise is a real survivor and has survived more than you can imagine. I thought her resiliency was astounding. She has taught seminars in 19 countries and has written 12 books. She also went through a house remodel and is now planning a small vineyard.<br /><br />I liked the way she organized her book into four sections and in the weeks after buying this book you can walk through four chapters:<br /><br />Air Week - Clearing Your Mental Self<br />Water Week - Clearing Your Emotional Self<br />Fire Week - Clearing Your Spiritual Self<br />Earth Week - Clearing Your Physical Self<br /><br />Through this book you will explore your relationships, examine turning points in your life and clean up the clutter in your inner and outer worlds. Are you ready to face your shadow? Are you ready to create a future filled with love, harmony and peace? This book can put you on a road to spiritual health in a very interesting way. By embracing some of the ideas in this book I feel I have been healed in a spiritual way. A journal or at least a pen and paper is highly recommended.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-10-04

It is the driving force that pushes us out of our comfortable nest and forces us to learn to fly on our own. We can really welcome adversity as a gift. Without it our growth is very slow. With it, we are transformed from fledglings into masters. Every great person has a history of adversity. No one has ever made a contribution to humanity without first undergoing a certain amount of trials. ~Alan Cohen<br /><br />Through Alan Cohen's books I've learned a lot about myself and quite a bit about life itself in all its highs and lows. Alan seems to encourage me to look at life as more of a challenge. He sees humor and lessons in situations that would cause others to sink into a deep depression. He has a secret way of looking at life that he reveals in his caring way and wise contemplations.<br /><br />At the start of this book he lists dynamic ideas to open your heart and mind and then he delves into an almost autobiographical essay. If you are interested in how Alan started his journey, then this particular book will reveal his initial interests, his yearning for a connection with the Divine and how he sought out various books and teachers to guide him in his spiritual quest.<br /><br />This book is divided into two sections: The Journey and The Homecoming. Alan talks about how he visited a Zen monastery, became interested in Ram Dass and Jesus' teachings and worked in a Seven-Eleven type store. He finally meets a spiritual teacher named Hilda who has a profound effect on his life.<br /><br />Through stories, meditations and inspired insight he weaves a book to heal your soul and comfort you in times when you need a shoulder to cry on. You can draw strength from this book or make it a place of comfort and support. Some of the essay chapters include:<br /><br />Enough is Enough<br />If Not Now, When?<br />Health, Wholeness, and Holiness<br />Seasons<br />The Key to the Future<br />Transforming Relationships<br />The Power of Appreciation<br />Courage<br />Golden Opportunities<br />Undoing Unworthiness<br />The Law of Attraction<br /><br />There is an intimacy in Alan's books that mingles with humor and spiritual healing. It seems that when I'm feeling sad, Alan's books either make me laugh or help me to release my negative emotions in tears. So, either way, the reading of The Dragon Doesn't Live Here Anymore helped me fight off a few angry invisible dragons. There are nice dragons too, I think. Those are the dragons that love to fly across the October moon and enjoy seeing their shadow floating across lakes.<br /><br />After reading this book, you may want to watch the Dare to be Yourself video or look for additional books. When I read Alan's books, I seem to wake up the next day high on life itself. There is an energy in his books that makes me want to write!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewof Attraction    There is an intimacy in Alan's books that mingles with humor and spiritual healing.

The buzz in my head gives way over time to the cold creaking of branches, the soft slumping of snow melting off the roof, the chickadee's song. A silver pail as it hits the water in the well with a metallic splash. The rope on its rusty pulley as I pull it back up. The crunching of snow under my boots as I haul it back to the cabin. ~Jane Dobisz<br /><br />The thought of escaping to a cabin in the woods has a great deal of appeal, especially if there is a well-stocked refrigerator, plenty of chocolate cupcakes, hot chocolate and of course a hot lover and a hot tub. Let us not even mention the bliss of skiing.<br /><br />Now, when Jane Dobisz decides to escape to a Zen retreat, chocolate, love and skiing are the last things on her mind. In fact, the only eye contact she makes during this trip is with a mouse, which is quite humorous. Not only does Jane Dobisz decide to leave society for 100 Days, she also decides to follow a traditional monastic schedule of sitting, walking, chanting, bowing and cutting wood. She decides to practice Zen for 18 hours a day.<br /><br />In the first few pages I laughed more times than I can count. Jane Dobisz alternates between a conversational style, vibrant descriptions, lyrical prose and splashes of humor that catch you unawares. The first few lines of the first chapter captured my interest. Why would a woman want to strand herself in a cabin in New England? Here she has no electricity, phone or car. She must learn to tame the tigers in her mind and deal with her fears (there is no lock on the door), and learn basic survival skills. She throws herself into her own experiment like a true mystery seeker.<br /><br />Through isolation, the author learns to not only deal with her loneliness, she finds her inner Henry David Thoreau. The part of herself that longs for simplicity and a clarity obtained from wandering in nature. She shows courage in trying again when things don't work out the first time, she finds beauty in the smallest of pleasures and indulges in rituals like bathing and meditation. This is really a book about experience and is not so much a book of \\"how-to instructions for a retreat\\" as it is an explanation and poetic description of Jane Dobisz's experiences.<br /><br />At times the author struggles with the dicipline of mantras as her mind drifts off to visions of pumpkin pie. She at times desires nothing else than to escape back to her home and familiar environment.<br /><br />Questions not answered by this book include:<br /><br />How did her family cope with her 100 Day retreat?<br />How did she find time to cook on such a rigorous schedule?<br />The exact way to \\"bow\\" and \\"sit.\\" Details are not given for the monastic schedule and<br />I think a class in meditation and yoga is probably in order if you are considering your own retreat.<br /><br />Jane Dobisz is the guiding teacher of the Cambridge Zen Center in Massachusetts and is also the editor of The Whole World is a Single Flower by Seung Sahn.<br /><br />For some reason, I thought this while reading this book: One of the greatest ways to love a person may be to encourage their highest good. Jane Dobisz's friends and family seem to encourage her higher good by encouraging her to develop her spiritual side and they give her the gift of an adventure by dropping her off in the woods and then returning to find out if she is still alive. She does not communicate with anyone during this time, although she could have walked to a nearby phone.<br /><br />I read this book early in the morning and felt a deep connection with the author when suddenly, my husband opened the front door when I was reading: \\"As I open the door to the porch, my heart stops.\\" A fresh burst of cold morning air rushed down the hallways and I suddenly understood why she said: \\"Why not let that kind of joy into all the little things, like smelling the air...washing the dishes....Isn't that what our whole life is?  Joy comes from appreciation.\\"<br /><br />You may find yourself writing poems while reading this book, planning for a winter vacation or simply have the desire to read a number of the books mentioned throughout this heart-warming read. Perfect for reading in the morning, especially in the Fall with a window open.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewg this book, planning for a winter vacation or simply have the desire to read a number of the books mentioned throughout this heart-warming read.

As long as we equate joy with perfection in even a small way, we will never know contentment. ~Taro Gold<br /><br />In our drive towards perfection, we often seek for impossible dreams that lead to unending conflict of the soul. Taro Gold's \\"Living Wabi Sabi\\" is filled with ways we can escape this cycle of disappointment. Quotes are interspersed with personal recollections of his grandmother's teachings. Art mingles with quotes and the pages are of a high quality and shaded with natural earth tones. Not only will this book last a long time, it is perfect to give as a gift.<br /><br />Taro's thoughts are beautiful gifts filled with wisdom and the secrets of Wabi Sabi living. While life is filled with uncertainties, at least we can ponder how we will deal with uncertainty itself.<br /><br />Through humorous recollections about cooking or Taro's experience with electricity we learn deep spiritual truths. He discusses the birth of stars, how joy is the ultimate goal in life and how his grandmother taught him to develop inner character so he could contribute goodness to the world. He also discusses interesting facts about Walt Disney and how he was fired from his first job for \\"lack of imagination.\\" There are a few other humorous examples of how life seemed to take a wrong turn, all while leading the participants right to the height of their success.<br /><br />There are seven main chapters:<br /><br />Living Wabi Sabi<br />Like Sugar from the Sun<br />The Wisdom of Imperfection<br />Growing Up, Growing Down<br />Awakening to the Universe Within<br />A Field of Possibilities<br />The True Beauty of Your Life<br /><br />If you have been reading all the books by Taro Gold, you may be interested in reading more about Taro Gold and in this book, you can enjoy reading a bit about Taro's family history. This is a very personal book and I found it to be the most healing and comforting of all the books by Taro Gold. There are life-changing principles in Taro's book that can be incorporated into any spiritual tradition or lifestyle.<br /><br />Also highly recommended:<br /><br />What Is Love?

His writing is stunningly succinct and his snappy writing style infuses this book with an impressive energy. His astute observations are deliciously poetic and he seems to have a photographic memory. His descriptions either infuse your mind with vivid pictures of complete chaos or shock you with laughter. He claims slavery still exists in America and at times this book does border on a study of human debauchery. John Galloway has a finely tuned sense of justice and not only has the ability to analyze his past work environments; he is at times almost expressing a calculated view of modern life.<br /><br />In the first section we read about John Galloway's induction into culinary hell and then he delves into the topics of tipping, memorable waiters, celebrities and his views on patrons galore. Nothing escapes his shrewd observations skills or his critical review.<br /><br />Everything from his sage advice to restaurant owners, to his views on the environment and veal leads me to believe that his reasons for writing this book are at the heart, healing. I was amazed at how many of the unspoken rules members of my own family have broken while dining out. I now understand why waiters are not especially interested in worrying about large parties and why they hate it when people fight over checks or despise the \\"can we have separate checks\\" question.<br /><br />The hilarious, yet wicked revenge tactics and kitchen adventures might make you wonder how any cooking is ever accomplished. It did occur to me that the world John Galloway so despised was also one he actively helped to create. There are moments when a call for solidarity and the complete lack of regard for patrons clashes sharply with the obvious undercurrent of concern John Galloway wants to show to the world. His writing may dissuade a few innocents from entering the food service industry and then again it might even encourage the adventurous to take up a new challenge.<br /><br />This book is filled with tales of inebriation as a survival mechanism, not so tantalizing descriptions of food preparation, drunken crazed chefs enduring overwhelming stress levels, descriptions of waiters, extreme chemical addictions, insensitive patrons and all the true thoughts waiters never reveal in glowing detail (swearing included).<br /><br />I loved the idea of just putting a pepper mill on every table! Salad lovers unite. I also love the fact that throughout this book the reader is scathingly admonished to the extent that even I may never eat bread again before ordering my meal. Although, normally the bread is served after we order. I'm definitely not drinking the water anymore unless it is in bottled form.<br /><br />John Galloway sheds light on various levels of society who seem to lack all consideration for human dignity. Although, I have to say I've heard of chefs who were voted husband of the year (I've also sampled their cuisine at the restaurant), waiters and waitresses who actually enjoy their job (some relatives and friends) and take pride in their appearance and have a definite work ethic.<br /><br />I think John Galloway focuses on a extreme environment in which \\"the love of money\\" truly does become the root of all evil.<br /><br />On the other side of the world, over here in the other Washington, chefs enjoy cooking with organic ingredients, support recycling efforts and contribute recipes to cookbooks that help to feed the hungry. There is another side of the story and this book presents the extreme comedic view of \\"dining out\\" as it dishes up all the dirt about the negative side of human nature.<br /><br />\\"I would like\\" to say that if you enjoy reality shows or all the negative reviews for movies you disliked, then this might be your book. The writing in this book is impressive for a first-time author. I hope he will take on American culture in general and bring to light many of the issues that need to be addressed in a refreshingly honest and yet somewhat brutally candid way. He does address the issues of animal cruelty, gluttony, food waste and pertinent issues of homeless situations.<br /><br />I can almost guarantee you that some parts of this book will cause the warrior in you to rise from the dust, but overall it is a humorous read. If you have a good sense of humor, you will be able to overlook the obvious arrows hurtled in all directions.<br /><br />Since we all eat out, know someone who has worked in the food industry, or may have worked in the food industry at some point in our lives, this book contains information that will be of interest to almost everyone. As long as you have a strong stomach and a willingness to wade through a few moments of extreme revelation you can gain an entirely new perspective on culinary culture.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewddress the issues of animal cruelty, gluttony, food waste and pertinent issues of homeless situations.

They know that no other food can nourish and delight so easily, while asking for so small and effort on the part of the cook. Simple, yet sustaining, a dish of pasta satisfies our hunger yet invites the eye and pleases the palate with its countless shapes, colors, and flavors. ~Anna Del Conte & Eric Treuille<br /><br />Eric Treuille has been in love with cooking since he worked in his uncle's boulangerie in France. He has worked as a chef in Paris, London and New York. Here he presents the ten commandments for pasta making, tools of the trade, pasta varieties, cooking secrets, classic sauces such as pesto and essential pantry items for busy cooks.<br /><br />Recipes:<br /><br />Pasta with Tomatoes - Red Pesto, Tomato and Mozzarella Al Forno<br />Pasta with Butter and Cheese - Butter and Parmesan, Lemon, Basil, and Mascarpone<br />Pasta with Mushrooms- Mushroom, White Wine and Cream<br />Pasta with Seafood- Shrimp with Lemon and Basil, Smoked Salmon with White Wine, Cream, and Chives<br />Pasta with Meat - Crispy Pancetta and Scallions, Classic Bolognese, Classic Lasagne<br />Pasta with Olives and Olive Oil- Spicy Lemon Olive, Chili Olive Pesto<br />Pasta with Greens and Herbs - Basil Pesto with Variations, Sizzling Sage Butter, Spinach Lasagne<br />Pasta with Beans and Lentils - Braised Umbrian Lentils<br />Pasta with Garlic- Golden Garlic and Onion, Roasted Garlic and Cherry Tomatoes<br />Pasta with Peppers and Eggplant- Roasted Pepper Pasta, Red Pepper Pesto<br />Fresh and Filled Pasta - Fresh Egg Pasta, Porcini Mushroom Filling<br /><br />After reading this book you will know why it is important to buy the highest quality pasta you can find, why a heavy-bottomed deep pot is best for slow cooked sauces, and how you can serve pasta in an authentic fashion.<br /><br />At the start of Pasta, you will find page after page of pictures and pasta descriptions. Fettuccine, Tagliolini, Bucatini, Chifferi, and many others make their appearance. At the end of the book, there are sections for what to keep in the refrigerator, freezer and cupboard. The Pasta Planner section lists pasta according to Make Ahead, No Cook, Quick Cook, Slow Cook, and Al Forno.<br /><br />The Pasta on the Menu section gives ideas for Pasta Parties, Pasta to Impress, Summer Weekend Pasta and more. There are notes about using Tipo 00 flour and there are four mail order sources at the end of the book. May I also suggest Zingermans online for pasta and cheese. King Arthur Flour might also be a great source for supplies and bowls.<br /><br />The end of the book shows all the top skills in brilliant color. Learn to peel tomatoes, soak dried mushrooms, peel garlic cloves, chop onions, peel peppers and finely chop garlic.<br /><br />The recipes all have short lists of ingredients which makes this book perfect for new cooks. A few recipes require you to make a separate sauce ingredient, but most of the recipes include the sauce ingredients along with the instructions for how to cook the pasta.<br /><br />The Crispy Pancetta and Scallions Recipe has the following ingredients:<br /><br />8 pancetta or bacon slices<br />2 tbsp butter<br />2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil<br />4 scallions, sliced<br />1 lb dried pasta<br />¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan<br />salt, black pepper<br />additional freshly grated Parmesan to serve<br /><br />The recipe instructions are very simple and there are additional notes about which pasta you could use. You might want to use penne, rigatoni, gnocchi, or conchiglie. A \\"Cook's Note\\" concludes each recipe and at times will include a tip or a note about the ingredients.<br /><br />If you know anyone who loves pasta and you want to buy them an amazing gift, this is the book. However, if you only buy one and send it to yourself, I can almost guarantee you will keep this book because it is that interesting. So, you might want to purchase two!<br /><br />We just visited a magical Italian restaurant and suddenly I wanted to make pasta again.

He may have in fact perfected the art of Wabi Sabi living as described in a book by Taro Gold of the same name. I have never ceased to be amazed at how Alan Cohen can see good in even the most devastating emotional situations. He is truly a survivor and life can rarely throw him a challenge he can't handle.<br /><br />If you are going through a divorce, considering a divorce (especially if you have children), are in the middle of a breakup or even just ending a relationship with your significant other, then this book may be a helpful guide leading you towards greater happiness instead of unending self-defeating patterns.<br /><br />I love finding quotes in Alan's books and the quote that stood out was: \\"Every problem comes to you with a gift in its hands.\\" ~Richard Bach<br /><br />While it is almost impossible to see the good in a breakup if you want to stay in a relationship, there is something to be said for a gain in the area of self-esteem if you find yourself free to look for someone who will treat you with more respect.<br /><br />The list of common ways we distract ourselves from emotional pain made sense to me. They are probably the same ways a person could escape from depression or dealing with life's everyday problems. Denial, blaming, guilt and addictions are discussed briefly and there are real-life examples throughout this amazing book.<br /><br />First, you realize you do have the power to love, even if you don't have the power to maintain the relationship that is dissolving. To love a person who has rejected the very core of yourself is probably the most difficult thing you will ever have to do besides deal with the death of a person you love. Staying friends with your ex? How? Apparently it is possible and can be accomplished by allowing yourself to move through the various stages as you move out of a deeply involved lover relationship and turn a lover into a friend.<br /><br />Imagine an author who is able to find the opportunities gained in a situation where your heart has been broken. In this discussion of \\"staying friends with your ex,\\" Alan Cohen also gives lists of the wrong reasons couples get together in the first place. This could be helpful as you seek a different partner. He delves into post-breakup scenarios, meaningful breakup rituals, communication issues, transitional relationships and how to communicate through a brick wall.<br /><br />I do have to make one comment in regards to knowing when it is time to not maintain a friendship. When the person is abusive, it might just be time to end the relationship and find the love and support you crave in a more nurturing environment. Often, God will send angels to lead you from a bad situation to a place of healing. By being patient in the cycles of resting and renewal, we can then grow in spiritual ways we never imagined to be possible. Chapter 9, Good-Bye for Good is a chapter that could bring healing instead of discord.<br /><br />I think this is possibly the most helpful relationship book Alan Cohen has ever written, although I still have a few more books to read. The section on the Power of Thought is an excellent way to send love to those who are far away. I found page 159 to be especially healing and that one page is worth the price of the book.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewis able to find the opportunities gained in a situation where your heart has been broken.

Stevens<br /><br />Sheryl J. Stevens understands how difficult it can be to find support when you are depressed or you have family members who have a mental illness that leads to addictive behaviors. She struggled with her own depression and also realized the lack of support when her daughter went through a very troubled time in her life.<br /><br />Since the use of anti-depressants has reached shocking levels, you do have to wonder why the current system of care is not working. Sheryl J. Stevens presents a unique idea which places all the care a person might need in one location. She calls this sanctuary: \\"A Manor of Eden.\\"<br /><br />If you have been watching a variety of movies lately, you may have noticed how the vicious sub-culture in schools is almost celebrated and while there is humor to be had, there are also people who never recover from the emotional abuse they receive in school or just in life itself. You could be a very loving person and be rejected at every turn simply because other people have been hurt and have closed their heart to love itself.<br /><br />In a world where depression might be the unfulfilled desires of the soul, it can be quite trying to maintain some semblance of hope in a hopeless environment. Women have shelters, there are camps for teens, but for the most part these places are quite different from the environment Sheryl has envisioned.<br /><br />While reading the condensed narrative of personal experiences section, I realized why it can be depressing to move from a smaller town where you feel you have many connections to a larger town with few, if any connections to the people you love.<br /><br />With that said, I was not sure anyone would want to go away for 90 days, but the programs in this book are divided into three 28 day sections. Stage 1, 2 and 3 are described in detail. Many of the items in this book could still be done while you were at home and seeing a psychologist or counselor. Although, at times it is probably best to leave an unhealthy environment.<br /><br />Not only do many people not know where to turn, many don't have medical insurance and during times of great stress, Sheryl's idea would sound like heaven to a distressed and depressed soul in need of care.<br /><br />I think she is right, something has to be done and while you might not agree with all the items like wearing uniforms, some type of customization for each soul might encourage participation. We have emergency rooms for hospital care, but how many of us would know where to go in a time of emotional crisis? I know you can pick up the phone book and find information, but A Manor of Eden seems to be a much more highly organized way of mending broken spirits and caring for hurting souls. I hope this book gets into the hands of someone very influential because it will take organization, planning and more than volunteers to get this idea off the ground.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewd still be done while you were at home and seeing a psychologist or counselor.

Wallace finely crafts stories of tragedy, emotional complexity or unleashes innocence where we would expect to find darkness. There is bravery in surprising feelings where sheer honesty awakens our awareness of survival skills or essential human desires.<br /><br />Simplicity becomes profound as he discovers eggs in a nest. The playful banter of cats in \\"Earthly Pleasure\\" is described with such wit and left me laughing as I remembered each time we have adopted a new kitten.<br /><br />Ronald Wallace's recollections of his daughter usually leave me highly amused and \\"The Failures of Pacifism\\" was no exception. What stunned me was my reaction to \\"Canzone: Egrets.\\" It was as if this poem was a key to a dark room inside my heart filled with unspoken thoughts and buried contemplations. It was as if the poem allowed me to unburden my mind and I felt free of thoughts that had been swirling in my subconscious mind for years. They raced out of me in tears.<br /><br />When Ronald Wallace describes his father's toolbox, I could not help thinking how his toolbox only differs in material form. He carefully crafts poetry as only a wordsmith could, perfecting a vivid statement or softly sanding a sentence into perfect persuasion.<br /><br />Could we somehow become the world's great key<br />unlocking the past like a fortress of snow<br />and find inside what we need to help us believe<br />in this sonorous weather, this improbably heat,<br />this uplifting salt of the sea.<br />~Canzone: Siesta Key<br /><br />Time's Fancy is brimming with poems you can revisit time and time again. These are poems to heal, surprise and nurture. They radiate with a rare clarity and sensitive warmth I've rarely seen in daily observance. The delicious descriptions in \\"Sweet Corn,\\" the sensual beauty in \\"Dragonflies,\\" and the memories of Ronald's father make this book of poems a journey of the heart.<br /><br />If you love poems with \\"orange\\" themes, you might also want to look for Long For This World by Ronald Wallace. After reading his poems about oranges, I had to go buy some essential oil of orange and eating an orange is now an entirely different experience.

Bruce Smith and Yoshiko Yamamoto have created a book filled with bathing experiences to cleanse the soul. This is about the philosophy of the bathing experience and how to recreate this experience in your own home. You will find information on the setting of the bath, what the entry should look like, how to create scenery and how to create lighting with lanterns.<br /><br />If you are looking for an immediate bathing experience, try the ZIA Sea Mineral Soak. The authors do not recommend use of bath salts in the wooden baths, but I don't see why you could not use them in other materials. If you are thinking of building your own Japanese bath, there is a section on resources, mainly companies in California and New Mexico. There are also a number of websites for further research. The list of Public Baths may inspire a visit to a Hot Spring style spa. The Glossary is a quick reference for the Japanese names like lanterns and plum tea.<br /><br />After reading this book, I'm even more determined to find a vacation spot complete with a private Japanese bath. I found the text to be soul warming, the pictures inspirational and a part of my heart understands the need for soaking in solitude, preferably in a beautiful garden by the light of the moon, with the reflection of a mountain dancing in the ripples.<br /><br />What we have given up with morning showers! After reading this beautiful work of art, you may find yourself longing for the luxury of bathing in deep water. I loved the picture of the Japanese bath in the winter snow. If only there was a view from my garden tub. At least there are many ideas you can incorporate into your bathing experience, even if it is indoors.<br /><br />This book would make a perfect gift inside a small cedar bucket along with bath salts, lotions, essential oils, body brush and a fluffy towel or robe/yukata. This is a book you can read in the tub or curl up with in bed after a warm bath.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewthe ripples.     What we have given up with morning showers!

Reside within my breast,<br />and each is eager for a separation:<br />in throes of coarse desire, one grips<br />the earth with all its senses;<br />the other struggles from the dust<br />to rise to high ancestral spheres<br />~Faust<br /><br />Astrida Orle Tantillo has taken the four main principles of Nature's creative powers and discusses them in four sections that include Polarity, Steigerung and the Drive towards Complexity, Compensation and Competition.<br /><br />This study is filled with extensive analysis of various translated works. I found the discussion of polarity to be of high interest and throughout the work I found moments of enlightened thought. I enjoyed trying out one of the color experiments on my own and had always wondered why when you stare at one color and then look at a white wall, you see a different color. So, this answered many of my questions. After reading this book you may not look at cloud formations in the same way or even look at plants as anything less than willful little beings reaching for the warmth of the sun.<br /><br />After working your way through the introduction, you happen upon the Faust character and then we read about striving for completion and craving an opposite. This reminded me of David Deida's work with polarity and relationships although instead of struggling to separate spirituality and sexuality, he combines the two in a soul union while we still live on earth. There is a mention of sexuality being about a longing for a former wholeness.<br /><br />I liked the idea of Lucifer being a polar opposite and the creation myth was interesting although I'm willing to accept the biblical view. This simply took the ideas one step further and explained why God would create Lucifer. I also liked the idea of love serving as a unifying force between opposites.<br /><br />There is a great deal of discussion as to how Goethe's views differ from Newton and Descartes and many others. Goethe's Theory of Colors also takes prominence in this work. It is interesting to wonder why yellow is a happy color or why colors affect us pathologically. For example, green is calming and red seems to inspire poetic creations.<br /><br />The section about why Goethe praised Shakespeare suddenly brought me to a realization of why most of my favorite movies do contain themes of opposing worlds and the reconciliation of opposing elements. By incorporating conflicting elements, a movie or play becomes a much richer work of art.<br /><br />There are also discussions about an individuals drive towards internal development and how we can break free from old patterns and find a balance between the rational and passionate.<br /><br />Because love, our holiest blessing<br />Looks for consummate fruit, marriage of minds, in the end,<br />One perception of things, that together, concerted in seeing,<br />Both to the higher world, truly conjoined, find their way.<br />~from Goethe's The Metamorphosis of Plants<br /><br />This is a very readable work that gives a good overview of Goethe's Philosophy of Nature and there are many areas in this book to awaken your own inquisitive nature and a few thoughts connected with other books I've been reading and suddenly puzzle pieces of thought started to join together to form a coherent understanding.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewonder why yellow is a happy color or why colors affect us pathologically.

Micki McWade is a clinical social work who consults with divorce recovery groups in New York State. She is also the author of Getting Up, Getting Over, Getting On: A Twelve Step Guide to Divorce Recovery. She also went through a divorce in 1993 after 23 years of marriage and a three-year separation.<br /><br />When the world crumbles, it is comforting to find an author who understands your conflicted emotions, the suffering you are enduring and can also help you see that even in the worst situation, there is room for personal growth.<br /><br />The goal of this book is to hasten recovery and one of the first items in this book is the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous. It is then followed by the Twelve Steps of Divorce Recovery.<br /><br />I would have liked this to be set up more as Day 1 on your road to recovery, Day 2, etc. However, perhaps this is a magical book where what you need most will be on the day of the year you need it. So, start this book on the date you are reading it and perhaps that message will be specifically for your healing at that particular moment. You may also want to read the entire book and make notes, although many of these lessons are probably best read and absorbed over time.<br /><br />Life is complex enough without having to deal with all the tragedies of existence itself. Micki McWade is a friend who carefully guides you through the initial emotional storms and then helps you awaken from the deep waters of despair. She leads you to water where you can stand and technically, helps you \\"wade\\" through the internal conflicts that seem inevitable.<br /><br />Each daily reading contains a quote and wise comments about how to live a more fulfilling life. I especially liked the quote by Katherine Paterson: What a gift of grace to be able to take the chaos from within and from it create some semblance of order.<br /><br />On of the main themes of this book is to look to the future and imagine your future happiness as opposed to dwelling on the past sorrows. I also learned an important principle from March 21, where she talks about living in a state of fear or a state of love. It is interesting to note that when a person attacks you, a loving response is almost sure to dissuade further attacks. When we see how many people need our love, we can then respond in a more loving fashion instead of recoiling into a state of fear and preparing our own attack. Easier said than done.<br /><br />Each meditation ends with an affirmation.<br /><br />Affirmation: Today I will remember that my experience on earth includes the intellectual, physical, emotional and spiritual levels , and I will try to incorporate all levels into my daily existence.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewling life.

Johnson, M.D.<br /><br />Kelly E. Johnson, M.D. is a nationally recognized psychologist and is also the author of A Relationship for a Lifetime. His goal in writing this book is to provide information that will quickly and effectively solve disagreements and problems. This book covers the topics of sex, money, misunderstandings, household chores, career, time management, friends, leisure, divorce, dating, children, family, infidelity, jealously and even annoying habits.<br /><br />Through reading this book, you may be able to prevent small fights or as the author says: \\"virtual life-destroyers.\\"<br /><br />Are you asking?<br /><br />Will we stay together?<br />Why are we fighting?<br />Are we even right for each other?<br />Do we want the same things out of life?<br />Is there a way to put some passion back into our relationship?<br /><br />When you are in love, the last thing you think you need is a relationship course, but it is probably when it is most needed. The author has a unique \\"Relationship Pyramid\\" in which he shows how most of us spend our time in the bottom level, otherwise known as relationship conflict. What we really want is to feel good about ourselves and we probably got married because the person we chose made us feel that we were appreciated and loved.<br /><br />The author also gives two formulas. One for success and one for failure. A proactive, positive and objective response, like reading this book is going to bring more success than denial or wishing the problems would magically go away.<br /><br />The author discusses ways you can tolerate and even embrace your partner's differences. Of course it helps if they agree not to yell at you so you can actually like them as a person. After presenting a \\"stop the fighting\\" agreement, he delves into the real reasons people don't get along.<br /><br />If you don't want to be in a relationship in the first place, this book isn't going to make you feel the desire to stay, but it might make the staying seem more comfortable. This book is really about respecting other humans and trying to communicate with them effectively. That may even include compromise and an understanding of human sexuality and human desires.<br /><br />There are solutions for anger, emotional abuse and sex-drive discrepancies. There are ideas about why people withhold sex and how you can spice up your love life. If you have started to feel like you are \\"Sleeping with the Enemy\\" like Julia Roberts, there is also a section dealing with a controlling partner. When they start asking you where you were when you left the house for five minutes to take out the trash, you might have a problem on your hands.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review't going to make you feel the desire to stay, but it might make the staying seem more comfortable.

They offer practical suggestions for getting through the tumult and minimizing long-term damage to you and your family. ~Micki McWade<br /><br />Micki McWade was thrown into an extremely precarious and vulnerable position when she and her husband separated in the fall of 1990. Through overwhelming grief, she struggled through a breakup that was more trying than she had ever anticipated.<br /><br />At that time she was a member of Al-Anon (a support group for families of alcoholics) and was practicing the Twelve Steps. This helped her to clarify what she was going through, reduced her inner turmoil and helped to create some semblance of peace. After experiencing divorce first-hand, she decided to create a support group for separated and divorced individuals who needed advice, friendship and hope.<br /><br />In the first chapter, Micki presents a basic understanding of the divorce situation. For women, this can often mean a loss of income, immense grief and the loss of major support systems present when you marry into another family. She explains how she felt, how others feel and what you might be experiencing. This chapter also briefly delves into the are of spirituality (a higher power) and then  concludes with the serenity prayer.<br /><br />Chapter two explains the Twelve Step Recovery Program and lists the steps. Chapter Three takes each step and explains it in depth.<br /><br />Throughout this book, you will find prayers, inspirational quotes, a deep understanding of the issues at hand and an immense helping of encouragement. Women are especially vulnerable in divorce situations and Micki's story is all too typical of what happens to many women when they have stayed home to take care of their children and been a support to their husbands. If she could survive her divorce, I think anyone could as long as they were patient with themselves. So, this book can give women hope.<br /><br />In the second section there are tools for recovery that include information on how to create a support group. Chapter five gives four main slogans and explanations for how these can be used in the support group setting for discussion. Chapter seven is filled with personal stories of women who experienced divorce and Susan had an interesting idea about \\"the person who emotionally leaves the relationship is the initiator.\\"<br /><br />If you are looking for support during a very difficult time in your life, this book can help you free yourself from your past and encourage spiritual growth. I can also recommend \\"Daily Meditations: For Surviving a Breakup, Separation or Divorce.\\"<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewcovery that include information on how to create a support group.

Right... ~Laura Jensen Walker<br /><br />If people stayed the same, we would become bored with life itself. The fact that someone changes over time and grows as a soul, should not be a surprise. The surprise is more in the disappointment of unfulfilled longings for the ideal soul mate.<br /><br />Laura Jensen Walker has experienced life's knocks and bruises as well as the sheer joy of discovering all life has to offer. In this humorous revelation, she wonders about why Prince Charming can at times turn back in a frog. No spells needed.<br /><br />Some of the Contents Includes:<br /><br />Who is this Masked Person I Married?<br />Sleeping Habits of a Highly Defective Couple<br />In Sickness and In Health<br />Directionally Impaired<br />Where's my (fill in the blank)?<br />Calgon vs. Soap on a Rope<br />Shut the Door<br />She's Felix, He's Oscar<br />The Night He Saw Red<br />Hold Me, Touch Me, Listen to Me!<br /><br />Laura Jensen Walker is probably married to one of the most understanding and loving husbands on the planet, and to be honest, she says she is \\"Hyde.\\" So, this is not a put-down book about men, nor is it really discouraging. This lighthearted look at relationships in reality may help you live happily ever after with a sense of humor.<br /><br />After reading this book, we understand why couples of the past had separate bedrooms, why men enjoy showers and women enjoy baths, why women are genetically programmed to nag (Isn't nagging just telling someone what you need, a reminder, call to action, or a cry for attention?), why men have an incurable brain disorder that is only discovered after the honeymoon and why we are probably all on the earth to learn patience. If you are married, this book will make complete sense.<br /><br />If I had written this book, there would be a chapter on \\"Turn off the Lights.\\" Which is my husband's most annoying habit.

The time you take to read this book will probably save you time in the long-run.<br /><br />Attorney Nihara K. Choudhri explains the divorce laws in all fifty states, gives helpful checklists and sample settlement agreements. The glossary of divorce law terminology is extensive. If you think marriage itself is complex, divorce is extremely complex. The index helps you find information fast.<br /><br />Through this book you will understand what you have to lose, what you have to gain and how you can settle out of court.<br /><br />After reading this book, I can see why some people remain married, no matter what. Divorce is an extremely stressful process and if you have decided against marital counseling and are determined to get out of a relationship, I can definitely say you should read this book, if at all possible.<br /><br />There are descriptions of the main reasons why people seek a divorce and these include emotional abuse, abandonment and mental illness. Apparently, a partner that leaves a house to avoid physical abuse is not considered guilty of abandonment. If you withhold sex from a partner, this can also be abandonment. So, there are lots of complex reasons why people want out of a relationship and they are well organized into five main areas. There are also discussions about property division, dissipation, dividing debts, dividing pensions, alimony, child custody, visitation, child support, mediation and many other difficult subjects.<br /><br />I really had no idea divorce was this complex and I am wondering if this should be required reading before getting married. In that way, you know what you are getting yourself into from the legal perspective.<br /><br />A portion of the profits from this book are being donated to The Center for Battered Women's Legal Services.<br /><br />Also recommended: Getting Up Getting Over Getting On: A Twelve Step Guide to Divorce Recovery and Daily Meditation by Micki McWade.<br /><br />If you still think there might be hope, no matter what, try reading: The Relationship Problem Solver by Kelly E.

This society requires women to have men in their lives, almost like a romantic accessory, a sign of stability and normalcy. ~L.J. McMillan<br /><br />Are you tired of men failing to meet your romantic expectations? Did you leave a relationship or have you decided to remain single? If you are married or in a relationship, is your entire day ruined when your significant other forgets to celebrate occasions you feel are essential and important to your emotional health? Can you break free from this cycle of expectation and disappointment? Basically, can you be happy without a man? While this book is mainly written for women who are single, I think there are some great lessons for us married gals or women in dating relationships.<br /><br />Some of the lessons for women in relationships:<br /><br />Take time out for yourself and throw away your \\"to do\\" list for an entire weekend.<br />Stop caring so much about the mundane and start to live the dream.<br />Turn off the computer and jump back into life.<br />Develop your own interests and cultivate independent friendships.<br />Create a room that is your own space, even if you have to sleep alone on occasion.<br /><br />L.J. McMillan believes you can be happy without a man in your life and at the rate at which men are becoming unromantic, she might just be right. L.J. McMillan is a successful power attorney who has raised children and has many of her own interests and hobbies. How does she find complete happiness without a male companion? This book reveals the secrets of her happiness and is not about dealing with men, making men happy, putting up with male quirks and fears, or even about getting over a man. Simply, this book is about the joys of being independent and fulfilled without a man.<br /><br />Do you want to run your own life?<br />Could you take a vacation by yourself and enjoy the solitude?<br />Are you really complete if you don't feel complete without a mate?<br />How do you prevent the destabilizing effects of negative energy?<br />How do you deal with a married optimist and why falling into this type of relationship can be hugely abusing to your self-esteem. (Although, after she discusses this, she goes on to discuss sex with single men or men from your past relationships, yikes. Why would this be any less damaging to your self-esteem?)<br /><br />The last section of the book has a summary of each chapter for quick reference.<br /><br />Whether you are married, in a relationship or single, this book can help you rediscover your identity.

She believes you can change the way you feel by exploring hard-to-break habits, emotional wounds and pitfalls.<br /><br />Why are women accused of being emotional, rather than rational?<br />How do you meet the challenges of day-to-day concerns?<br />How did you get to the numbness of despair?<br />How do you reign in emotions that are out of control?<br />Why do even spiritual people experience depression?<br /><br />Even Jesus asked Peter: \\"Do you love me?\\" He asked it three times. So why does it hurt so much to ask someone if you are loved and get no response? Are we being emotionally abused or are we just asking the wrong people?<br /><br />Miriam Neff became frustrated by books about women's emotions written by men and decided to write her own. As she states: \\"But that's not how it is!\\" She found herself questioning how well men understand women's emotions and believes women's life experiences are \\"incredibly\\" different from men's experiences.<br /><br />While she explains how emotions are good and God-given, she also explains how emotions can be very intense for a woman and explores the possibility of becoming a victim of emotional tangles.<br /><br />Through examples of women experiencing various emotions, Miriam leads you to a place of understanding. An analysis of your feelings can often lead to new discoveries. You might find you can take a feeling and turn it into a hobby. You could take anger and turn it into a walking routine. Through adapting, accepting and creating you can find more peace.<br /><br />Miriam deals with Anger, Bitterness, Fear, Contentment, Loneliness, Love, Anxiety, Discouragement, Depression, Grief and Guilt. She takes a few love myths and shows you why love can be tainted by a belief in these myths. She also contrasts human love with higher love and shows why setting boundaries is approved by God himself.<br /><br />\\"One of my toughest life-lessons in love is realizing that boundaries must exist.\\" ~Miriam Neff<br /><br />Some Highlights of this book include:<br /><br />Tools for Healing Depression - a list of healing ways to move beyond depression.<br />Dealing with Loss and Death<br />Breaking Emotional Habits<br /><br />Does God have a bottle of your tears in heaven?

She says you have to lose your emotional pain before the weight will drop off. She could be right because food can be a comfort and if you are really in pain, there is nothing you can eat that will take away emotional distress. Well, maybe a lot of chocolate, which contains chemicals (PEA) to make you feel \\"in love.\\"  Page 191 can be enlightening for anyone who uses chocolate as a love fix.<br /><br />This book is a result of Doreen's work in an all-female psychiatric hospital. Here, she met women struggling with deep emotional pain, stress, grief, depression, rage and dissatisfaction with their work, marriage and life in general. When she started to specialize in eating disorders, she did not realize the devastating effects of emotional neglect, verbal assaults and other abuses. Frankly, before reading this book, I didn't think about \\"emotional neglect\\" as being a cause of eating disorders. Now it makes sense to me.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure most women could tell you why they are in pain and Doreen says that pain should not be blindly accepted. She says: \\"it is a signal that something is wrong and needs to be changed or healed.\\" She even goes as far to say that \\"every extra pound you carry on your body equals a pound of emotional pain you're carrying in your heart.\\"<br /><br />Doreen also explains how serotonin has to be created every night and explains how this occurs and why melatonin is needed. If your REM sleep is interrupted, there can be groggy consequences. Apparently alcohol can interfere with REM sleep.<br /><br />This entire book seems to be dealing with the issues of self-esteem and listening to Self-Esteem: Your Fundamental Power by Carolyn Myss and reading Fed Up by Wendy Oliver-Pyatt might also be helpful.<br /><br />The author discusses dream analysis, exercise, meditation and discusses a variety of abusive situations that may need to be dealt with in order for your body to finally shed the pounds along with the pain.<br /><br />Personally, I've found that working out on a regular basis has helped my self-esteem and yoga has been especially healing. Yoga seems to encourage you to eat healthy foods and by cutting out soda (replace with a packet of \\"lite\\" Emer'gen C, fruit juice concentrate and aloe juice for body healing) and sugary foods (look for chocolate by Hershey's with only 1 gram Carbs)your appetite will not be as aggressive.<br /><br />By increasing protein and taking supplements your body is craving, you can work your way into a more balanced lifestyle. Give yourself time, this entire area of self-esteem can take years to heal and you might have to make some drastic lifestyle changes in order to see your life turn around. Finding one person who believes in you and supports you in your efforts, even if it is an author, will be immensely helpful. Doreen Virtue makes you aware of the link between abuse, stress and overeating. Then, she shows you how to heal your body and how to reclaim your self-esteem.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewysis, exercise, meditation and discusses a variety of abusive situations that may need to be dealt with in order for your body to finally shed the pounds along with the pain.

Hay<br /><br />Louise L. Hay has a comforting voice which tends to take you away from any stressful environment. She provides a space where you can feel relaxed, safe and peaceful. She is a metaphysical lecturer and teacher and her books have been translated into 29 different language.<br /><br />In \\"Overcoming Fears,\\" Louise invites us all to explore our inner worlds and asks us to imagine ourselves in various life stages where we felt safe and happy and loved without fear. Through this meditation, you visualize the way your world could be and the way you want it to be. Self-esteem, safety, security and the power of thought are all discussed in a meditative way.<br /><br />The focus of \\"Overcoming Fear\\" is visualization and by changing the way you think about your life, you can actually start to become a more powerful force in your own life. Even after listening to this CD once, I found myself awakening the next day with much more positive thoughts.<br /><br />While this meditation does not draw on any particular religion, there are a few items people of various faiths will need to consider on their own. By imagining the world as a more peaceful place, you can in fact start to make the world more peaceful through your own positive actions.<br /><br />If you find this CD to be inspirational and healing, you may also want to find the givingloveaway.com CD which is a beautiful spoken-word gift to the world. This CD might also inspire you to give a donation to World Vision or to reach out to your own community.<br /><br />I listened to this CD twice last night and woke up feeling healed, refreshed and much more rested than I had in weeks. My first thoughts were quickly replaced by more positive ones and I started my day with a much more positive attitude.<br /><br />I think Louise's voice has a mesmerizing quality which can be especially healing when you are feeling stressed. You may want to make yourself a comforting place to listen to this meditation. Candles, your favorite essential oil and a quiet setting will enhance your acceptance of the ideas Louise presents. Music plays in the background as Louise speaks from her heart. You can hear flute, water (a waterfall or river) and birds chirping. There are two sections. The second section is filled with more affirmations and the focus is on changing thoughts of fear to thoughts of safety. For anyone experiencing panic attacks, distrust of their environment or general anxiety, this section can help you let go of fear and accept the nurturing environment of safety and trust. Forgiveness of others and yourself is discussed.<br /><br />\\"Overcoming Fears\\" is a healing, beautiful spoken-word CD that will empower you and help you to find an inner world that is safe and caring. As you move into the world in a more peaceful state, you may notice your environment changing and others reacting to you in a more loving way.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewng place to listen to this meditation.

Conversely, one only has one chance to make a last impression, and where better to make that impression than the cemetery, where your statement has the best chance for longevity? ~ Douglas Keister<br /><br />Since I was very young, graveyards have always fascinated me. I love the look of graveyards at night, although I've yet to venture into them in the middle of the night. I live vicariously through the Buffy show as I watch the DVDs. While watching the Buffy show I became rather interested in the symbolism of various statues and objects.<br /><br />Now, with all the seriousness of death in our society, you would not expect to find humor in a book about gravestones and iconography, but it is definitely present in the most witty fashion. I have rarely found a book that made me laugh out loud as many times and at such surprising times. Douglas Keister has a wicked sense of wit and in the midst of decoding a certain symbol or discussing history he will bring in an ironic twist that is shockingly amusing. He also explains the real meaning of \\"skeleton in the closet\\" and explained the uses of exploding torpedo coffins. Who knew. He has taken high-quality photographs which not only set the mood for this book, they help to emphasize the details being discussed.<br /><br />On a more serious note, Stories in Stone is essential for gravestone scholars and cemetery sleuths. Suddenly you will view graveyards with a new appreciation.<br /><br />Douglas Keister discusses Classic, Egyptian, Islamic, Byzantine, Romanesque, Gothic, Italian Renaissance, Baroque and Neoclassical architecture. Through pictures and in depth research, he explains the oldest burial monuments and why a tumulus is mostly found in Western Europe.<br /><br />Some of the Contents includes: Funerary Architecture: Designed for Eternity, Mausoleums, Chapels, Offices, Tombs, Sculptures, Memorials, the Sarcophagus, Stone Sentinels: Designed for Remembrance. Symbols: Plants and Flowers, Fruits, Grains, and Vines, Trees and Bushes, Animals, Fowls and Insects, Fishes and Mollusks, Reptiles and Amphibians, Mythical Creatures, Tradesmen's Tools, Religious Icons, Emblems, Insignias, Tokens, Death Seals and Angels.<br /><br />You will also find informative and highly entertaining sections about:<br /><br />Mortality Symbols<br />Christian Symbolism<br />Hebrew Symbolism<br />Chinese and Japanese Symbolism<br />Secret Societies<br /><br />I now understand the relationship between Persephone and pomegranates, between the weeping willow and immortality and why my father objected to me dating a boy who gave me an anthurium-style flower.<br /><br />While I don't intend to die anytime soon, I've already designed my own monument/gravestone which will be a girl peacefully sleeping with a cat on a bed and a butterfly perched precariously on the edge of the book resting in her sleeping hand. The girl will have angel wings and there will be at least three candles and of course, 5 stars placed somewhere in a row above a favorite quote. I also liked the idea of the tear vial and a key, not to mention a favorite flower. Perhaps someone could plant lavender around the grave or they could work lavender into the carving on the stone. I don't actually want to be buried, maybe they could just sprinkle my ashes around the stone and I could be reborn into the lavender plants.<br /><br />Not only does this book inspire, make you laugh in places and bring enlightenment to anyone who loves to study gravestones, this book also has romance! Yes, there is a story of the Blocher Mausoleum in buffalo, New York. It is a story of love, loss and reminds us all that we only get one chance to live and love. So while this book gave me ideas for how to design my own sarcophagus, this book also reminded me of how much life I still want to live.<br /><br />Oh, the cover is especially wonderful and the size of the book makes it perfect to stash awayin your long black coat as you wander aimlessly through graveyards in the middle of the night.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review~The Rebecca Review	2004-08-19

I love reading poetry by men who have been keen observers of their own lives and the lives of others. In observing and revealing, Peter shows a side of men that is rare and beautiful and intoxicatingly mature.<br /><br />In Perhaps It's As You Say, he explores stars, dry grasses gathering a honey light and houses across fields that disappear into cottonwoods by dry creeks. And then, quite profoundly he suddenly says: \\"Meet me there.\\" Instinctively, we seem to know exactly what he is talking about because the poem not only comforts, but it gives hope.<br /><br />The Marsh, New Year's Day exposes hidden fears as age steals away the lovers in men's lives and Peter sees himself following in the footsteps of what these men around him are becoming. Yet, I feel he could never become the men dying like rainbows because of his inner light and ability to observe while others walk blind.<br /><br />Peter Everwine's painting of his solitude in, How to Handle It, made me almost nostalgic.<br /><br />Speech is one thing;<br />this solitude, another:<br />books on the table,<br />my lamp at night throwing<br />a small sooty glare<br />into the wind's teeth<br /><br />Although I have to say that the poem: \\"I Dreamt\\" is perhaps the most meaningful to me in this collection of wisdom mingled with remembrance of experience's learned and moments observed. In this poem he enters a room filled with pens and the entire poem seems to speak of loving the sorrow or at times pain of life that leads to creation/writing. I will be thinking about this poem for some time because I think it has hidden truths.<br /><br />Peter Everwine's translation of The Condition has a stunning line about pomegranates. It is such a beautiful image and if you have ever seen the countless seeds inside a pomegranate you can't help but realize the stunning statement nine words can make.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewgranate you can't help but realize the stunning statement nine words can make.     ~The Rebecca Review	2004-08-18

Long for This World by Ronald Wallace allowed me to slow down, access a wide range of subjects and enjoy some stunning moments that are reflections of his appreciation for beauty. I found his memories of women to be especially stunning.<br /><br />Not only does Ronald Wallace display a keen sense of observation, he weaves a subtle thread of memory through some poems and then presents a surprise ending. I loved \\"Oranges\\" because in this story he tells of how he eats an orange, how it tastes, what he thinks about in regards to how the world appears and then ends the poem with an exotic image of sensory bliss. I was so delighted with this poem I had to read it to a friend, who appreciates poetry. I think I've peeled the zest from so many oranges, that the poem was filled with the scent of orange oil in my own memory. While I thought this might be the most interesting poem in the book, I was to be surprised again and again.<br /><br />The Nude Gardener will be an absolutely amusing poem to anyone with a good sense of humor and a bit of insight into the world of men's minds. The ending is again almost an abandonment of all the former observations. Some of the last few lines of his poems change the entire tone and awaken a deep appreciation for life itself. They are almost a submission to the inevitability of feelings.<br /><br />I was not prepared for Fresh Oysters & Beer and it struck me as being especially humorous. There is a line in this poem that is silly, but quite amusing. Ronald Wallace breaks free from melancholy mediocrity during a situation that might be trying to some parents and sees the humor and there is so much love in this poem for his daughter who is at this time still trying to find herself in a world of conflict about survival.<br /><br />While I will never rummage through an attic, because I've moved too many times, I thourally enjoy reading about people who have attics filled with memories. Here, Ronald Wallace finds notes his father wrote in college and has his own contemplations about imagination.<br /><br />Maybe imagination is just<br />a form of memory after all, locked<br />deep in the double helix of eternity.<br /><br />Ronald Wallace once said that he wanted to make something beautiful that didn't exist before and in this book, he creates worlds I didn't know men experienced. I will never think of oranges in the same way again.<br /><br />This book is a collection of poems from a career spanning two decades and it took three years to complete the selection process. Wallace is the Felix Pollak Professor of Poetry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and codirects the creative writing program. He also spends time at his forty-acre farm in Bear Valley, Wisconsin.

His party-design firm has been featured in Bon Appetit and House Beautiful. He has designed more than 2,500 events. Elaine Louie is known for her \\"Currents\\" column in the New York Times and Edward Addeo is a New York photographer whose work appears in Vogue, New York Times Magazine and in the book Cherished Objects.<br /><br />Together, they have created a luxurious feast for the eyes. Not only are there ideas one could only imagine in your most exotic culinary setting dreams, there are a few ideas for intimate parties you could actually reproduce in your own home or outdoors in your favorite setting. Whether you are seeking ideas for an extraordinarily expensive fundraiser or a meeting that speaks of a casual elegance, you will find ideas that will inspire you and encourage you to create a very memorable setting.<br /><br />Some fabulous party ideas include:<br /><br />A Night in the Stars - A canopy of lights was created with white Christmas tree lights. The entire scene looks like it is floating out in some magical galaxy. You could probably recreate this on a smaller scale with tiny lights. I adored this idea. Imagine actually attending such a function. A must-see picture!<br /><br />Down-Home Dinner - Firelight and candles in an eighteenth-century stone house. The idea is comforting and if you have a fireplace, you could recreate this at home.<br /><br />Beauty and the Beast - ideas for decorating your home for romance.<br /><br />Summer Poolside Lunch - now this anyone can achieve. Simply pack a picnic lunch and bring vases of flowers and colorful napkins.<br /><br />The highlight of many of these parties seems to be the candlelight. At least, that was what I noticed the most. Candles around bowls filled with peach flowers, candles in wine glasses or hundreds of votive candles surrounding pools, candles flickering in glass bowls swaying overhead in a tent. I mean, if you love candles, you are going to find unique ideas in this book.<br /><br />The more expensive ideas include dinners for hundreds of guests. The settings are places like the Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan, Lincoln Center, the Grand Ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City and the Four Seasons, Manhattan. One of the most beautiful pictures was taken in the New York Public Library. There is a vast dome over the tables that is glowing in a soft lavender light. The chairs are gold, the tablecloths have a golden/pink sheen to them and towering vases of flowers are overflowing with lavender delphinium, white dendrobium orchids, pink lilies, purple lilacs and spiky golden eremuirus. Apparently the entire area was highly scented with lilac branches and the goal was to make everyone feel like they were actually outside in nature.<br /><br />Whether you are planning a wedding, intimate brunch, a dinner party or an indoor beach party, you will find ideas that your guests will never forget.

Throughout this guide, you will find lush photographs of opaque and transparent lacquered chests, their hand-forged iron handles and the tools of the trade. I especially enjoyed the hand-colored photos of family life, rice fields and the textile sellers. Not only do you get to glimpse this magical world of Zen temples and street merchants selling sweet rice drinks, you will be able to view page after page of stunning merchant chests, bedding chests, clothing chests and mizuya-dansu (kitchen cupboards).<br /><br />I've always been intrigued by chests filled with magical little drawers in which anything could be stored. This book has made me aware of the wide variety of chests that can be purchased and most of the pages are filled with pictures and descriptions so you can know what to look for online. Before finding this particular book, I was at a loss for what to look for. Now I have the names of items like the sea chest (funa-dansu) and realize the difference in the woods used. I think the cho-dansu made of keyaki with the distinctive iron fittings on page 111 is just stunning. The cho-bako funa-dansu (ship chest) is also very interesting as it features tortoise, a symbol of prosperity and longevity.<br /><br />The detailed descriptions of the lockplates are presented with photographs. If you are a student of this craft (or looking for pictures of things like a cherry blossom motif), the pages on the components of a tansu will encourage you to explore all the essential details in your own selections. They also explain how all the L braces and iron-edge strapping are not only decorative, but highly functional.<br /><br />As a person who has refinished a desk upon which I am typing, my appreciation for furniture went through an entire renewal process while reading \\"Japanese Cabinetry.\\"<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />The Realm of Tansu: An Introduction<br />Tansu and Allied Trades<br />The Craft of Tansu<br />Tansu for Mercantile Use<br />Tansu for Household Use<br />Tansu for Personal Use<br />Living with Tansu<br />Collecting and Restoring Tansu<br /><br />Not only does this book present early mercantile tansu designs, there are pictures of contemporary desks and even a section about books, magazines and catalogues for further research. The index, glossary of terms and chronological list of exhibitions make this book very easy to read and understand. There are also ideas for how to set up your tansu collection in your bedrooms, bathrooms, living rooms and kitchen. You might even want to put a kitchen chest (mizuya) in your living room. This book also features entry tables, entertainment centers, coffee tables and bookcases and so much more.<br /><br />Back to dreaming of owning the cho-dansu from the late Edo period (1615-1868). Not only can you view items from this period, you can read about the history and lifestyle of the people living in this era. This book would make a perfect gift for anyone who has lived in Japan or is interested in Japanese history. It would also be an amazing gift for anyone interested in Japanese movies. I have often wondered about various items and this book has provided more information than I could have ever dreamed about finding.<br /><br />A note about the authors: David Jackson has been collecting tansu since 1990 and has studied sculpture and woodworking. He developed his passion for Japanese woodwork and then was involved with one of the first exhibitions of tansu in the United States. Dane Owen founded a gallery of Japanese antique furnishings and is also a frequent visitor to Japan. He can be found searching for objects for his customers and his own private collections. Together they have written the ultimate book on the Japanese craft of tansu. If you love tansu, your heart is going to beat a little faster while reading Japanese Cabinetry. I am beyond appreciative of David and Dane's knowledge of this subject. If you own one book on tansu, this would be an excellent choice.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewinetry.

Shoes can make you lose weight, I love it.<br /><br />Anyway, it was time to read this adorable book about shoes. I don't have as many shoes as I did in college although I tend to remember my life in some autobiographical way through the shoes I was wearing at the time. I remember the boots I wore in Paris and the sexy shoes with sparkly diamonds I wore for a special occasion.<br /><br />Jane Eldershaw seems to see life in a similar fashion. Heart and Sole is a lighthearted memoir that explores Jane's life through her shoe selections. She gives tips on how to judge a man by his choice of shoes and why there are only two types of women in the world.<br /><br />Jane Eldershaw is a writer and magazine illustrator who was born in Australia. Her writing style is original, playful and has a love for descriptive words to tease your mind. She has worked for New Woman and Vogue Australia. The book jacket hides a beautiful high-quality ruby covered and exquisitely bound book. Women who love well-made shoes will appreciate the style and quality of this tiny book. The book was also illustrated by Jane and I was especially amused by \\"toe decolletage.\\" She has drawn pictures of her shoes, everything from her boots to her Italian Interlude when she wore shoes from Rome. She explores life choices after she wore her new cherry-red-spike-heeled ankle-straps with silver buckles.<br /><br />Jane also reveals interesting facts about Marilyn Monroe, Barbie dolls and how to find a shoe-inn for storage. Where do your shoes live? What is the heel called. I had no idea there was a \\"kitten\\" heel, but it is very common.<br /><br />I could easily become obsessed with shoes again and have been in the past, but lately I'm all about comfort and the shoes that are fancy are sure to only be worn for special occasions. This book reminded me of how fun it is to shop for shoes and I'm of course always on the look for pretty slippers for wearing while writing reviews. I did try on clear plastic shoe the other day and had to feel a bit sorry for Cinderella. Glass could not be overly comfortable although a girl can dream. I've stepped on broken glass and ruined a heel while almost tripping down steps, so that might be a sign.<br /><br />This delicious book made me fondly remember the Nordstrom of the past where men dressed in suits played Prince Charming and slipped slippers of all colors onto your feet.

Through this journey, Lars Clausen helped to earn money for an Endowment Fund to help a struggling tribe of Eskimos.<br /><br />The unicycle route starts on April 22, 2002 and ends on November 12, 2002. Riding across the country on a regular bike sounds pretty incredible, but to ride on a unicycle seems almost unbelievable. Yet this journey is recorded by Lars Clausen in glowing detail. He records his experiences in each state, conversations, special events he happens upon and explains how difficult it is to ride a bike in some states.<br /><br />Lars Clausen has a love for the writings of Mark Twain and many of them were familiar quotes that have probably inspired us all in various moments of our lives. I like the one about how disappointed we will be by the things we didn't do than by the ones we did do. In the process of traveling across America, Clausen also establishes the longest distance traveled by unicycle in a 24-hour period.<br /><br />He tells stories of caterpillars crossing roads, conversations with people he meets at convenience stores, traveling with his family, and the generosity of people he meets along the way. While on the road he also takes pictures of shampooing the Husky dogs after the skunk, pictures by state signs and his kids riding mini unicycles. He journeys through a Mojave Desert storm, cycles past snow-capped mountains and rides close to a raging hurricane in Louisiana. He also encounters Times Square Traffic!<br /><br />Clausen and his family are now volunteering at Holden Village, a retreat center in the heart of Washington's Cascade Mountains. His life is the perfect example of how you can set good into motion through loving decisions.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-08-01

During our conversations, I often learn about a special trick that saves time or makes life on the road more relaxing for them. ~Bernice Beard<br /><br />RV travel can be a cozy way to travel and you can take along the comforts of home that you normally have to leave behind when you travel by plane. You can take along your pets, you get to experience the beauty of traveling through America and you can sit outside at night next to your RV and enjoy the beauty of the night sky.<br /><br />I've camped out in an RV a few times in my life and all of them have been very memorable. My first experience was in Africa near Cape Town and it rained the entire time. The second time was in Washington State and we went camping with friends. I remember those trips more vividly than trips where we drove in the car and stayed in hotels.<br /><br />301 Ways to Make RV Travel Safer, Easier, and More Fun is perfect for anyone who is looking into RVing or anyone who wants to enjoy a more carefree trip. Bernice Beard is an experience traveler who loves to share all her RV secrets and thinks of an RV as a playhouse. In this book, she has compiled all her best tricks and techniques. She also includes travel checklists and a glossary with definitions of RVing terms.<br /><br />Bernice Beard starts her book with a checklist for getting on the road. You might want to pick up a few extra feet of heater hose, a hydraulic jack and some flares. Wrenches, quality jumper cables and a flashlight are recommended. In chapter two she goes on to explain how you can prevent mechanical problems with regular maintenance.<br /><br />Other Features:<br /><br />Lists of Recommended Campgrounds<br />Recipes - try an earthquake cake<br />Restaurants<br />Tips for transporting food<br />Stories about various trips are sprinkled throughout the book.<br />Travel Courtesy Tips<br />Travel Comfort<br />Things to do before you leave home<br />Lists of supplies you might not think you need, but probably will!<br />Kitchen Supplies<br />Tips for Traveling with Pets<br /><br />I loved Bernice's writing style and she displays a real love for life.

In a similar way to the poems in Written with a Spoon (about food), these poems are about the thoughts we feed our minds in order to gain a new perspective on our present condition. Since the world is in turmoil and change is inevitable, poetry can provide moments of peaceful contemplation. One line of poetry could affect you profoundly. It could bring back memories from your childhood, or even give you hope for the future.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the poem: Feeling My Way Through The Dark which describes awakening to a nest of stars and how Christine Hemp is convinced the world is not where she will always stay. She feels the pull of the stars and for a moment, she is lost in gazing beyond shadows that change shape. While her poem seems to speak of eternal life or a life beyond this current existence, Penny Harter's poem: The Serengeti Plains focuses on the cycle of life and brought an entirely new perspective to death itself.<br /><br />When blood runs into the grass<br />it is not death that seeps<br />into this soil, but starlight<br />on its journey through the dark.<br /><br />While reading D.A. Feinfeld's poem about the Blood of a Poet, the last six lines struck me as rather profound and this was the third poem that impressed me and created a new awareness of life itself. Hans Jorg Stahlschmidt's poem about the Writer shows the power of our words and dreams.<br /><br />I think the poem that was the most meaningful to me was: At The Kitchen Table.<br /><br />All your poet wife<br />can think of<br />is that you've got to see the<br />early autumn sunset<br />a nearly perfect shade of<br />violet<br />slipping into gold-tinged apricot<br /><br />What a beautiful book filled with poems about the appreciation for life itself that can lead to a more peaceful existence. Some of the poets are observing, some are awakening your awareness, many are wishing the world would see life from the perspective of a poet.<br /><br />The cover (not yet shown) is a navy blue with a swirl of cream paint that appears to resemble the moon appearing from dark clouds or a circle of life. It could also be O for ONE peaceful world.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewwishing the world would see life from the perspective of a poet.

You almost think you could feel the fur on the donkey or feel the texture in Fiona's embroidered royal dress. Even the green fabric looks velvety. I was quite impressed with this aspect alone. There is also a good helping of humor throughout, like when talking about the gingerbread man who is actually one tough cookie.<br /><br /> He's wholesome and true - just what you'd expect from a cookie made from organic flour. ~pg. 19<br /><br /> Or when speaking of the castle:<br /><br /> This stylishly dilapidated, sinister castle is conveniently located on a crumbling pinnacle of rock in a sea of molten lava, just three day's quest from the nearest shopping mall.<br /><br /> Each section also conveys a certain mood. The page about The Poison Apple is somber, dark and has white text, while the pages covered with \\"the front page\\" of the Daily Duloc stands out and is also filled with fairy-tale humor and advertisements for magic beans.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-08-01

The Bracelet is adapted from a story by Elizabeth Ballard and is now illustrated by Miriam de Rosier who is a native of Washington State. She now works as a freelance illustrator and her work has appeared in The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.<br /><br />This is a story about how we often fail to see a person's heart because we are so consumed with how they are living their life. Miss Thompson's student Teddy was a boy who was not well liked and had a poor home situation. Even when Jean Thompson tells her entire class that she loves them all the same, she definitely has favorites.<br /><br />When Christmas arrives, all the children give Miss Thompson presents. Teddy's present is all wrapped in crumpled brown paper and held together with tape. In the package, she finds a rhinestone bracelet and a bottle of cheap perfume. The story continues and soon we find out what a profound effect Miss Thomson has on Teddy's life when she makes the choice to show love instead of disappointment for the gift.<br /><br />This story reminds me of a student I once knew who was an absolute terror in class, but would stand waiting for his ride home and talk to me as if he was an angel in disguise. I realized that the children who acted up the most, needed the most love. This tiny book has a profound message and I can't imagine anyone hearing this story and not remembering it for the rest of their life.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-08-01

In every country and culture, children say prayers in order to express their innermost thoughts and to comfort themselves with beautiful words. The last few pages of this book have notes about the prayers. You can read about the Zuni prayer and how it is taken from the ancient Night Chant of the Zuni or read about the reasons for certain prayers, like how they acknowledge the interdependence of human beings.<br /><br />The prayers help children to connect with something greater than themselves. The prayers can be read like poetry and you might remember a few from your own childhood. This would be a perfect book to read before bed as it presents prayers that would bring comfort to a child.<br /><br />The author, Tessa Strickland, was born in England and graduated from Cambridge University.

When I lived with my grandmother, she cooked salmon on a weekly basis and we always ate tuna fish sandwiches on a regular basis. Then, I got married and my husband insisted that I stop cooking fish because he disliked it. That was when my skin changed. For years, I've wondered about the effects of diet on our skin and The Acne Prescription reveals the need for advanced care and a healthy dose of antioxidants and Omega 3 supplements. He explains how skin disorders are caused by a systemic inflammatory disease and explains the details of sebaceous glands and how corneum cells block pores. I learned about oxidative stress, foods to avoid, foods to get into my diet fast and why I should look for creams containing DMAE.<br /><br />After reading this book, I went to the grocery store and found some Wild Alaskan Salmon which was on sale for 97 cents a pound. I baked the entire fish and tried to follow the three day diet in which you eat mostly salmon. The diet in this book is filled with tasty choices from the sea. If you enjoy scallops, salmon, crab, tuna and shrimp, you will love this diet. I also purchased the pomegranate juice as recommended and you can normally find it in the produce section of your local grocery store.<br /><br />Other moments of enlightenment occurred while reading about how chocolate can cause your skin to break out, but it is more the sugar than the actual cocoa butter. So, I did not notice any changes in my skin after eating a Hershey's Low Carb bar and then this book even made more sense. It is the sugar, not the cocoa. Another great product he recommends is Pycnogenol which can be rather expensive, but seems to work very well.<br /><br />Overall, this book emphasizes the need for antioxidants, essential fatty acids and a healthy lifestyle. Avoiding stress is essential and a series of yoga postures are recommended.<br /><br />At least a third of this book is filled with tasty skin-clearing recipes like:<br /><br />Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon, Seared Tomatoes, Asparagus and Lemon Olive Oil Hollandaise<br /><br />Spiced Diver Scallops with Ecuadorian Tabouleh and Lemon Myrtle Oil<br /><br />Pomegranate Citrus-Glazed Apricot and Garlic Roasted Chicken with Apple-Spinach Stuffing and Garden Vegetables<br /><br />So, this all sounds very gourmet, but the ingredients are relatively easy to find and the directions are uncomplicated. The recipes were all created by executive chef Bernard Guillas.<br /><br />The glossary is excellent and if you read one book on how to care for your skin from the inside out, this should be it.<br /><br />This book is more about lifestyle change than a quick solution. I have only read one other book that is on this level and that is The Metabolic Plan. With those two books in hand, you will have a wealth of information and also understand why lifestyle changes will improve your health. Nicholas Perricone, M.D. has included so many solutions to the problem of Acne that I can only say I'll be reading this book over and over again. Even if you just suffer from occasional breakouts this book will give you the information you need to encourage a clear, glowing complexion. Many of the ideas in this book will also help you live a more healthy life. I definitely want to read all of Dr. Perricone's books.

Her work appears on the Health Network and she enjoys developing gluten-free products for manufacturers. She also counsels patients who are allergic to gluten. Carol's journey began with a case of chronic sinusitis. When she stayed away from wheat, she finally found relief.<br /><br />Celiac disease now afflicts 1:133 Americans and is now the nation's most common inherited autoimmune disorder. Celiacs have to avoid gluten because it prevents the absorption of nutrients in food. This causes a cascading problem and can lead to anemia, osteoporosis and other health problems like rashes, stomach aches and general fatigue.<br /><br />When I went to the store to find a Gluten-Free Flour Blend, I found the GF Garbanzo and Fava Flour blend by Bob's Red Mill. Apparently, Carol developed a gluten-free line for Bob's Red Mill. She also gives the recipe for her Sorghum Flour blend in this book.<br /><br />Today I made the most delicious Banana Muffins using Carol's recipe from page 73. It is a quick bread recipe and you can make a Banana Bread variation. I did use ¾ cup milk instead of the recommended ¼-1/3. So, if you choose to buy a premixed flour blend, you might need to slightly adapt the liquid quantities. Overall, I was very impressed with the recipe and made 24 delicious and healthy banana muffins for breakfast. I'll freeze the leftover muffins for future banana muffin cravings.<br /><br />Last week, I decided to try the Basic Bread recipe in my bread machine and then sliced the bread thinly and dried it out in the oven for 20 minutes to make crackers. They are the best crackers I've ever tasted. So far, I've only found rice-based crackers at the store, so this was a wonderful solution. You will need to look for items like potato starch, Xanthan gum, guar gum, soy lecithin and cider vinegar. I used rice wine vinegar and another flour in place of the potato starch. So, these recipes can also be adapted to taste. Most of the ingredients are now readily available at your grocery store on the natural foods isle. If you can't locate these in your town, Carol gives plenty of online sources.<br /><br />This book is simply fascinating because the author is so knowledgeable and even suggests that you stay away from some flours you would never suspect. Her alternative list of flours for Gluten-Free baking will also be useful when you are shopping and reading labels. If you normally use wheat as a thickener, you might want to try Agar, Arrowroot, Cornstarch or Guar Gum. There is a handy substitute list on page 23.<br /><br />If you decide you are serious about the gluten-free lifestyle, you might want to go through this book and make a list of the special ingredients. Once you have rounded up about 5 main ingredients, you can easily put together a number of healthy recipes. Xanthan gum, gelatin powder, tapioca flour, potato starch, soy lecithin, guar gum, sorgum flour, tapioca flour and a choice of corn flour, almond flour or bean flour are needed for this cookbook. It is nice to know that if you are allergic to nuts, you can also use bean flour or corn flour.<br /><br />Recipes I'm dreaming about trying:<br /><br />Breakfast Pizza<br />Granola with Rice Flakes<br />Peanut Butter Cookies - I'll use Soy Butter<br />Chicken Fried Steak<br />Cinnamon Coffee Cake<br /><br />Personally, I have a ton more energy when I stay away from wheat products, so this recipe book is helping me to adapt my lifestyle. I'm also excited about trying the Bob's Red Mill flours in my own recipes.<br /><br />You may also enjoy:<br /><br />Living Without - A magazine, Carol is the food editor<br />Wheat-Free Recipes and Menus<br />Special Diet Solutions<br />Food Allergy Field Guide<br />Gluten-Free Celebrations<br/><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-07-29

I had never really thought about meditating with colors, but have visualized colors during a Chakra segment in a Yoga workout and it really does help you relax.<br /><br />There are a few highly creative ways to relax and many of them focus on your inner world and how you can create a peaceful retreat inside your own mind, anyplace, anytime.

The title also makes you want to find out why the banana \\"split.\\" So, I started to read Rick Walton's word-play adventure. He has created over thirty books for kids and he loves to travel with his family. Whenever they get the chance, they love to visit Yellowstone or Disneyland. They also love to eat bananas.<br /><br /> Jimmy Holder has created a unique form of art from a comical standpoint. His art has a motion all of its own and you can feel the emotions of the characters as they scream, run, skedaddle and exit the vicinity of the voracious dinosaur's presence. As he looms above the streets with his tiny green suitcase, you can't help but laugh at the absurdity of the situation.<br /><br /> First, you see a town of people absolutely motionless with fingers pointing up into the air, then you see everyone start to run. \\"Rex\\" just grins and seems to be enjoying the mayhem. Then, they all scream: \\"Run Away! Run Away.\\"<br /><br /> Next thing you know, the jump ropes have eyes and eyelashes and are skipping town. Bananas peel out of town and frogs hop a train. The frogs are especially adorable as they almost seem to be quivering in fear and leaping into a yellow train. The page about trees and water reminded me of something from Lord of the Rings. Next, all the boots take a hike on their own and knives cut up vegetables as they run.<br /><br /> \\"Why are you all running away?\\" asked Rex.<br /><br /> \\"We don't want you to eat us.\\"<br /><br /> \\"But I only eat fruit!\\" said Rex<br /><br /> So, everyone returns and then you turn the page:<br /><br /> \\"All except for the bananas.\\"<br /><br />Who are all running around on the freeway in a state of utmost despair. It is quite witty, very funny and will even make parents grin.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-07-21

This is Carol's sixth book and I've been a fan of her books since her first book called: The Book of Answers, published in 1999.<br /><br />The cover on the Mom's Book of Answers makes me feel nostalgic for home-cooked meals and family gatherings. It is a fabric cover and perhaps the most interesting cover so far. I am always amused when asking Carol's books questions, so here goes:<br /><br />Question: Would my mother approve of the advice in this book? Answer: You need a hug.<br /><br />Question: Where will I find my next hug? Answer: Sorry, we weren't paying attention; would you say that again?<br /><br />Question: MOM? (Complete with confused look.) Answer: If you're not careful you could get stuck that way.<br /><br />Freaky, I tell you. I remember this happening as a child while trying to get my mom's attention as she was talking to friends.<br />Let's try this again with deeper contemplations:<br /><br />Q: What is the most important advice you could give me for the rest of my life? A: If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.<br /><br />Q: Did I ask the wrong question? A: Be careful what you ask for, you just might get it.<br /><br />Now, this book is just getting playful with me. lol<br /><br />The picture here at Amazon does not do this book justice. The book feels good in your hands. If you saw it on a coffee table you would be immediately inquisitive about the contents.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-07-21

Her father paints pictures of the flowers while family members cut roses or plant new flowers.<br /><br /> \\"What I really need, thought Holly, is a green thumb.\\"<br /><br /> So, Holly puts green paint on her thumb. This book has a real sense of humor. Well, when that doesn't work, Holly tries using fertilizer and then a variety of tools. Finally she soaks the flowers with too much water. (Why does this sound like my gardening at times?)<br /><br /> Finally, Holly goes to bed and when everyone thinks she is asleep, she sneaks into her dad's art studio and makes all sorts of paper flowers that fill up the entire room.<br /><br /> Children will enjoy the surprise of Holly finding a way to \\"grow\\" her own flowers.

When printed and painted beautiful cottons appeared from India in the seventeenth century, a French embargo was placed on the import, manufacture, and sale of foreign fabrics.<br /><br />Jouy is an area of France that is very famous for making Toile fabrics. Jouy-en-Josas is a little town near Versailles, southwest of Paris. The Manufacture Royale de Jouy was founded in Joy-en-Josas along the Bi&egrave;vre river. This factory once employed 1,300 workers who printed miles of fabric. The fabric was printed using copper sheets, which allow precise drawings that are much more detailed than those carved on wood.<br /><br />Jean-Baptiste Huet (1745-1811) was the artist who's drawings for the copper sheets were later called toiles de Jouy (Jouy fabrics). Soon, a carved copper roll printed 5,000 meters of fabric in one day. Hippolyte le Bas, Jean-Louis Demarne, Horace Vernet were some of the famous painters who loved designing for those interested in Egypt and mythology.  While the factory closed, some new prints are still made by using old drawings from the Textile Museum in Mulhouse.<br /><br />I've recently given away some of these beautiful Gibbs Smith cards to friends who love to write, but this is a box I'm keeping. These \\"Toiles De Jouy\\" cards are beautiful and are printed with reproductions of 18th-century French fabric and wallpaper designs. The box itself is very collectable and I'm thinking of filling it with letters from a friend.<br /><br />The box has a hinged lid and contains 20 note cards and 20 envelopes. There are four designs and five cards printed with each design.<br /><br />The first card is bursting with pink flowers, tiny scenes from far-away lands and an elephant, bird and interesting deer creature. Each picture is framed in a pink circle and the flowers meander around the frames.<br /><br />The second card is highly decorative and you can see the fabric texture and delicate, almost antique quality of the monochromatic slate blue designs set against the vanilla fabric.<br /><br />My favorite and third card in this collection is a scene of flowers and leaves with animal heads. It is like the flowers and leaves have their own personalities or animals are being born from mysterious and unnamed species of plants. A green and pink flower burst with stars while mythical beast hides behind a sharply edged leaf. I especially noticed the seven-pointed star flowers and the intricate and imaginative flower designs in purple, fuschia and dark green.<br /><br />The last card has pastoral scenes and contains pictures of angels, roosters, children dancing in circles to music and outdoor retreats all in a gray print.<br /><br />You may also enjoy: Toiles de Jouy by Betty Lou Phillips or look for the complete history of these textiles in Toile de Joy by Melanie Riffel.<br /><br />If you love these cards, you can also still purchase fabrics online and some of the \\"ancient\\" prints are stunningly beautiful.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewdesigns set against the vanilla fabric.

The first time I opened this book of poetry, I knew she had created a world of beautiful poems that would inspire me and I instantly felt a connection with her writing style. I loved her poem about the Monarch Butterfly and the memories in \\"Home.\\"<br /><br />Reading poetry can set the stage for your own creations. Not only does poetry create a relaxing environment for your entire being, it encourages you to focus on a life we sometimes miss when we hurry through our day. Dakota Williams captures a wide variety of emotions and experiences through a number of poetic forms.<br /><br />Don't Love Me was a poem that is so beautiful, it might make you cry. It is a desperate plea to be left alone because the poet fears the loss once she falls in love with a mysterious man who's love has the power to consume her like a raging river. This book of poems is overflowing with romantic dreams, creative expressions of love and a depth of love I enjoy reading about in poetry.<br /><br />Dakota sees the world as one divided by fantasy and reality, by loves devotion and forbidden desire and peace and war. I especially enjoyed her poems when they included water images. These are poems you can read and read again and I enjoyed the elements of a life lived in a state of awareness. Through this collection you can see Dakota moving through life's challenges and rising above the mundane experiences or turbulent waters of life. She seems to attain a balance and many of these poems are about experiences in life we have gone through or will experience in the near future.<br /><br />It's just a matter of time<br />before shadowed memories<br />darken into images of time<br />and wash away like the sea<br />Buried forever in my mind.<br /><br />This book does not only contain poems, there are also some passages about Dakota's life. In \\"Grandma's Lemon Tree\\" she tells of a sad story and then of how her grandmother made lemon tea by picking \\"just the right leaves\\" from her lemon tree. It reminded me of my Grandmother and her apple tree, which was recently and sadly cut down to make room for a new generation and more rooms on her home. Grandma's Lemon Tree speaks of life and death and how we try to comfort each other in this journey.<br /><br />Dakota also writes about how she wishes her baby was still a baby or how she appreciates a friends welcoming acceptance of her poet heart. She also remembers history in her poems and not only writes about her own experiences, but encapsulates moments in time in her words.<br /><br />At times Dakota's poems are filled with passionate memories or sorrowful recollections. Her poems span the distance between ecstasy and death. Some poems make you feel very alive and others remind you of the shortness of life.<br /><br />Silent as a moonlit crossing,<br />Calm as a storm weakened<br />Death escapes to heaven...<br /><br />After reading this book, I was inspired to write a poem and it turned out to be an acrostic poem. You may enjoy reading these poems while listening to River to River Trail: The Hike by Zola Van or any music that inspires you.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewook does not only contain poems, there are also some passages about Dakota's life.

584854:US	50199793	R135RYU47RHIT2	0972767266	357273007	If These Walls Could Talk: A Therapist Reveals  Stories of Change and How They will Work for You	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Resiliency of the Human Spirit	In life, many of us talk to friends about our daily challenges, but occasionally it is healing to talk to a therapist about problems, which seem to be overwhelming our worlds and threatening to change our lives in significant ways.<br /><br />In this book, a therapist reveals 25 stories without breaking any doctor-patient confidentiality agreements. The patients in his stories have given their explicit permission and names and circumstances have been altered to protect the individuals whose lives were influenced by Thomas A. Habib's care and concern.<br /><br />There are three main sections:<br /><br />Your Life<br />Love and Marriage<br />Parenting and Families<br /><br />Many of the stories are filled with the disclosure of intimate feelings, struggles with parenting issues, life lessons and marital issues that have some rather creative solutions. The issues in this book cover everything from choosing a life partner to dealing with life when passion inevitably cools and the fantasy of marriage dissolves into reality. He discusses the dynamics of relationships and how expectations can be more damaging than reality. Through reading this book you can learn how to:<br /><br />Solve differences in sexual desire<br />Determine if your perfectionism is ruining your life<br />Understand critical parenting skills<br />Avoid conflict with your adult children<br /><br />The area of \\"living in the purgatory of hope\\" was rather enlightening to me and I had never quite looked at some situations in quite that way. Hope can at times be a damaging influence in a relationship, while at other times it can help you make it through a time of conflict or betrayal.<br /><br />At times Thomas A. Habib encourages his patients by exploring the idea of how we rarely marry the wrong person and then at times he uses creative methods to allow reality to seep into his patients lives (filing for a divorce) in order to encourage them to delve more deeply into their own psyche and realize they want to save their marriage.<br /><br />Throughout this book, he uncovers cherished, but unrealistic expectations, exposes sociological variables and discusses how relationships do require an advanced level of participation and emotional awareness to survive the constant change of life itself. Through adapting and adjusting to life, we can be more open to possibility.<br /><br />His comments about the willingness to be open to sexuality are interesting and I was only left thinking that it is not about women not enjoying sex, it is more about women wanting to experience a deep loving relationship that allows them to feel more erotic and experience more desire. I believe these types of women do exist, in fact, I think every woman has an inner goddess who only needs to be awakened by a loving man who may need to display a level of patience that allows a woman's heart to open fully. Reading David Deida's work on how to love a woman and then recently reading a book by Steven Andrew Guerrero showed me how men really can inspire a woman if they are willing to read a few \\"instruction manuals\\" for women. We are not quite as mysterious as it appears. There are definite keys that will start our engines. I personally think \\"romance\\" in itself is one of the most important keys to desire. Our hearts are definitely connected to our sexuality and to feel loved and appreciated we need more than a subtle nudge in the direction of the bedroom. If a woman is giving \\"duty sex\\" as explained in this book, her heart must be in complete pain and her inner goddess might be in hiding.<br /><br />As to the author's comments about age and cosmetic surgery. I'd like to add that a lot can be done without surgery. Simply by adding a variety of supplements to your diet, or by reading a book like: The Metabolic Plan, you can start on your way to a much healthier you and see your body literally grow younger. When you look after your body, you not only feel better, you feel sexier too. So, exercise can be a way to encourage a more loving relationship.<br /><br />This is a great book to read if you are considering marriage or you are looking for a comforting and nurturing read. It is comforting in regards to our universal needs and experiences. Thomas A. Habib presents a variety of accepted norms and discusses our deepest disappointments and failures by presenting real-life examples from souls he has met and counseled through the years. There are a few moments of humor and a wealth of interesting sage advice that I will start to apply to my life.<br /><br />As I tend to currently believe: Someone has probably written the solution to your problems in a book. This is one of those books that will find you if you need to read it! The author discusses everything from road rage to the twelve things you should avoid in a future marriage partner.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewe considering marriage or you are looking for a comforting and nurturing read.

Coloring and Drawing helped them to stay focused as they listened. ~Zola Van<br /><br />Zola Van has not only created a stunning CD of music inspired by the Shawnee National Forest in Southern Illinois, she has also created a coloring book for children.<br /><br />Through this book, your children can express themselves artistically while enjoying the inspiration of Zola Van's collection of Piano Solos. The CD is called: River to River Trail: The Hike and will be well loved by the entire family.<br /><br />A picture of \\"headphones\\" appears on various pages with instructions on how to listen along with the music solo that inspired the drawings and puzzles. Children will also learn interesting facts, enjoy finding words in a crossword puzzle and learn about Southern Illinois. Zola has also included liner notes from her CD, A Hiking Safety Guide and more information about the River to River Trail.<br /><br />The art in this book was created with the help of the talented Jordan Timmermann from Herrin High School in Herrrin Illinois. He plans to major in engineering in the near future.<br /><br />When I heard piano solos as a child, it inspired me to take piano lessons and also to save up my money to buy my own piano. Zola Van's music is calming and lifts the heart. You may also enjoy her playing on \\"The HeartAid Project\\" which is a 9/11 benefit piano collection.<br /><br />A perfect gift would be this coloring book, a River to River Trail CD and the book of sheet music for future playing.

Therefore, anything with a hint of romance begins to look palatable to her. ~Steven A. Guerrero<br /><br />Let's face it, some men know how to get a ladies engine running and as women we know exactly how we want to be \\"maintained, serviced and upgraded.\\" It just doesn't feel the same when we have to explain what we want.<br /><br />Finally, Steven Andrew Guerrero (the new guru of romance) has written a book for guys that just makes sense. Even my husband wanted to read this book! It definitely appeals to the male mind and I could sum up my feelings about this book in about two words by saying: Yes! Finally!<br /><br />Not only is Steven Andrew Guerrero romantic beyond a romantic dream, he is darn funny too. Pages 31-33 had me rolling in bed with laughter. Can I say that if men take his advice and start to put his ideas into practice, planets are going to start to collide in the best of ways. The main chapters in this book include information about:<br /><br />Choosing to Win the Relationship Race<br />Steering with Your Ears<br />Prepare to Race<br />Don't Crash and Burn<br />The Right Fuel<br />The Diesel Engine Woman<br />The Economy Engine Woman<br />The High-Performance Woman<br /><br />If you want to keep your woman's heart in top shape and avoid the main reasons women file for divorce, Steven has the answers. Any woman who reads this book is going to say: \\"Wow, Wow! Where are the men who do this?\\" So, if you are a guy, you might want to hide this book in a place she will never look. Especially since this book has places for you to write down your own ideas or her favorite things. The element of surprise is most necessary when planning for romance. The \\"Workbook\\" section includes:<br /><br />Locating Her Engine Style<br />The Romantic History List<br />The Old You List<br />Her Favorite List<br />Not Her Favorite List<br />Her Pet Peeves and Hurtful Habit List<br />Her Wish List<br />Fuel Sources<br /><br />As a guy friend of mine just said: \\"Chivalry is not dead.

He is a Seattle author who earned his Master's in Social Work at the University of Washington. Through his life he has experienced the beauty of friendship and observed patterns that feed our genetically encoded desires to find relationships. He has also seen the damage of isolation and explains how we can use the \\"Principal of Seven\\" to fill our world with friends.<br /><br />While we continue to be enamored with technology, we have become more and more isolated and yet the desire for friendship is still a force that drives us to seek companionship in our environments. While Marvin Thomas agrees that computers amplify the mind, he believes we cannot thrive when isolated. He also explains:<br /><br />The basic universal needs<br />The essential ingredients of a healthy community<br />Why relationships need to be tended to on a regular basis<br />How you can find friends with similar interests<br />What to ask someone new when you first meet<br />How to keep a friendship for life<br /><br />Most of us seem to keep connected with friends and family through e-mails. Marvin explores this idea and explains how e-mail can be like a journal that talks back to you. While e-mail may encourage deeper contemplation because you have time to consider what you want to say, Marvin Thomas encourages real-life relationships where you can nourish your soul through face-to-face intimate relationships.<br /><br />Throughout \\"Personal Village\\" I had quite a few good laughs and many moments of enlightenment. The reading resources and movie suggestions looked tantalizing. Each chapter ends with a summary and a resource section. I loved the mention of the \\"Mostly Martha\\" movie, one of my all-time favorite chef movies.<br /><br />Since I have just moved to a new community, this book was a comfort to me in a time when I felt everything was new and I didn't know a soul. After reading this book, I found myself venturing out more into my community and unlike other times in the past, I actually ventured out early and with a sense of determination. The girls at Pier 1 were discussing Josh Groban (so we talked about the concert I reviewed), the lady at the post office gave me directions on how to get back home and everyone seemed most helpful. I met a neighbor after going out for a walk and the community I'm living in seems to be much more geared towards common areas where people can meet or walk.<br /><br />The advice in this book works and will encourage you to participate more fully in your community. I learned so much about basic human interaction that I'd never considered before. Marvin Thomas has filled \\"Personal Village\\" with a lifetime of wisdom and a collection of interesting and inspirational ideas to enable you to live a fuller, more enjoyable life no matter where you live.

Our society has suppressed the spirit of African Americans, yet when I look around me and in the media, everybody is walking, talking and singing like black people. ~Wanda Coleman<br /><br />Wanda Coleman's poems are wildly complex in form and I will admit to only understanding about a third of the hidden meanings. As I read her poems I am walking down dark streets when suddenly I turn a page and I am suddenly at home with a series of words. Then, I am thrown into a word maze again where words like odalisque, pandemic and narcoleptic pull my eyes hungrily across the pages of hurricane thoughts.<br /><br />Wanda is known as an Urban Poet who has a love for unvarnished truth. She comments on everything from politics to hot love. Her poems dance with their own rhythm and are especially beautiful when she lets her goddess out to play. She is known for being one of the nation's best poet-performers.<br /><br />While the complexity is inspiring and Wanda's use of words, stunning...I was so happy to find my way to the humor in \\"The History of My Body.\\" Deep emotions dance between her words and sometimes she blatantly expresses inner torments like when she writes: \\"I have wrung my heart/in secret silence.\\" At times her words seem to roll in hot lust or spring from the page in a mind jolting punch.<br /><br />Wanda's poems inspire me to write and write. I write my own poems after reading her poems and I am amazed at how such complexity inspires my own awakening to myself. I understand her musings on some primal level where poets sometimes live but at times her language flies above me and I can't grasp at the meaning no matter how much I try. Sometimes I am so pleased to understand an entire poem and then I can wander through pages before enlightenment strikes again.<br /><br />By the time I arrived at \\"Soul Traveler\\" I was writing my own poems. That is how much this book inspired me.<br /><br />The poems are challenging and interesting and the vocabulary and visual images are just stunning:<br /><br />...in rainbow-colored moss. There she thrived in volcanic<br />radiance & iridescent splendor yet she pined for<br />another world made steel by her false imaginings & in<br />the pitch of her moonless golden-apple grove she danced<br />her dissatisfactions amongst ghosts...<br /><br />To write this way!

She contemplated her future at a young age and decided she would become a writer. She became a voracious reader and fed her curiosity about the world through books. After living in Wanxian City, east of Sichuan Province, she moved to New York City. Here she was thrown into a new life and found solace in writing about her surroundings. She earned her master's degree in creative writing. She now teaches English composition. This is her first poetry collection in English.<br /><br />Shao Wei's poetry is at times beyond imaginative, infused with magic and often feels musical. Musical in the way her words entice you to read an entire poem, not stopping until the last word. In the beauty of her writing, a subtle dissatisfaction sometimes appears that seems to represent a intense desire for a place that is anywhere but here. Her words can at times be the meanderings of a discontented mind that is seeking to find contentment in a river of words.<br /><br />In \\"Manhattan\\" she turns the overwhelming into a dreamy place of wild animals and ancient mysteries. Many of her poems speak of an unspeakable loneliness and a desire to belong to a demanding planet, demanding its own space, not to know her dreams.<br /><br />The moon is always big when I feel lonely<br />I measure the distance between us<br />everyone is busy earning a living<br />no time to care about a girl and her dreams<br /><br />I loved \\"The Absent Goodbye,\\" because it reminded me of my grandmother's room that was like the nest in her house. She also left in her sleep and this poem has a certain warmth I could relate to, although it was written about Shao Wei's grandfather.<br /><br />In the next poem, \\"Dear Death\\" there is an almost sorrowful, yet blatant sarcasm. It is hopelessness drenched in longing and reluctant resolution. Wei expresses her desire to be taken with all those she has lost. She says: \\"If you take them away from me, why don't you take us all?\\" Her writing often speaks to the reader with the voice of an inner child who remembers the past in vivid images.<br /><br />\\"A Fairy Tale\\" begins with images of a lonely girl tasting sugar and quickly evolves into a story of lonely ecstasy and eternal contemplation. She seems to fear living a life without purpose.<br /><br />The amusing story about rice, fond memories of planting a peach tree and the almost symbolic tasting of her first apple all make this book of poetry a satisfying and comforting read.<br /><br />~The Rebecca ReviewShe says: \\"If you take them away from me, why don't you take us all?\\" Her writing often speaks to the reader with the voice of an inner child who remembers the past in vivid images.     \\"A Fairy Tale\\" begins with images of a lonely girl tasting sugar and quickly evolves into a story of lonely ecstasy and eternal contemplation.

Then, suddenly she writes about a part of a life I have lived and I can somehow relate to both situations.<br /><br />I started to read this book months ago, and then finally decided to read three poetry books all in a row. I am impressed with Kathleen's poems because they take many forms and express a wide range of emotions. She is the ever-observant poet who can remember the exact details of her experiences, right down to the exact wording of various conversations.<br /><br />\\"Excerpts from the Angel Handbook\\" threw me into an instant state of amusement. In this poem angels are instructed in such important principles as hiding their wings or listening and never telling a lie.<br /><br />You will never tell a lie,<br />but you will have many secrets.<br /><br />In fact, the poem amused me so much... I am going to send it to a friend who claims he is an angel. I'm amused.<br /><br />Then, onward to the erotic musings in \\"The Dancers.\\" In this poem, a preacher's daughter reveals her thoughts about a farmer boy.<br /><br />Through reading Kathleen's poetry, you enter her inner world and peer out through her words, observing the sheer magnificence of a world in which a poet dances.<br /><br />The first few poems( 1969-1973) seem to have a coolness in their observation. By the time you reach \\"Inheritance\\" on page 31, you can feel Kathleen starting to really delve into her deeper emotions.<br /><br />The poems from 1982-1986 are filled with surprises. Anyone who loves to cook will enjoy the exuberant \\"Pommes de Terre.\\" If you are looking for something a little more innocently erotic, you might enjoy \\"Young Lovers with Pizza.\\"<br /><br />By the time you reach the poems from 1987-1999, you have seen Kathleen explore so many emotions and worlds. She seems to be returning to deeply rooted traditions. She says goodbye to those she loves, she seems to be searching for meaning and then finally seems to find a place for God in her life.<br /><br />I also loved the last poem and especially the last six lines about the bumblebee.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewmany emotions and worlds.

With over 3000 recommended plants and guides for plants for containers, this book was rather handy when planting a new container garden.<br /><br />On page 674 and 675 you can find a Plant Heat-Zone Map which gives 12 heat zones. Most plants are featured with a picture and short description. Then, you can find symbols for the preferred soil type, sun/shade preferences and hardiness zone ranges. The plants without pictures are listed in The Planting Guide and feature trees, shrubs, climbers, perennials and bulbs suitable for specific site or garden situations.<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />Advice on how to buy plants through the mail<br />How to choose healthy bulbs<br />Understanding Plant Names<br />Plants to attract Birds<br />Plants to attract Butterflies<br />Plants for Cold or Warm Walls<br />Flower for drying or cutting<br />Architectural plants<br />Cottage-garden-style plants<br />Trees for Small gardens<br />Flowering hedges<br /><br />You can look up a flower in the index. Like, say \\"Petunia.\\" This gives you a few names and then you can search for advice on how/where to plant your favorites.<br /><br />Since I just moved further away from my dear mother, we have both planted Petunias. So now when we look out of our window to our planters, we will think of each other. It was my mother's idea and she loves gardening. My grandmother used to grow roses and it seems everyone in my family has a green thumb. Our family loves going to gardens and learning flower names. This book is perfect for travel and is very useful when shopping for plants that have not yet bloomed. You can quickly look up names of plants alphabetically.<br /><br />For more detailed information on Container Gardening, look up the book by the same name by Paul Williams. His book taught me the best way to create an inspiring masterpiece.<br /><br />Now onto dreaming about planting a new lavender garden in the near future. I am also intrigued by some of the vines in this book. The blue trumpet vine looks interesting and in the zone I'm living in, I could quite possibly grow a passionflower vine. Seattle and Issaquah were a bit too cold and rainy. There are some stunning flower selections interspersed with familiar flower faces.<br /><br />If it was my choice, I'd spend all my time writing, cooking and planting flowers while listening to inspiring music. What a life! This book is sure to inspire some of your own gardening dreams.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewe of the vines in this book.

Finally, I tossed all the soil and read this book. After realizing the draining system was not in place, not to mention I was using the wrong soil and the root system was in a tangle, I finally was able to create a fushia and violet themed flower garden complete with Daddy Blue Petunias, Easter Bonnet Violet Alyssum and pink Bearded tongue. The Columbine flowers are mixed in someplace and I think I have to rescue them from the petunias that are now taking over the planter.<br /><br />Page 135 shows how to drill holes in the base of the planter, which was very needed. Then, while at the store, I accidentally dropped a clay pot, which was just perfect because you use the broken pot pieces to ensure free passage of water through the potting mix. The Miracle Grow potting mix now also has some water-retaining crystals mentioned on page 151.<br /><br />By reading this one book you can learn everything you need to know to set up your own container garden in short order.<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />- Paul Williams original arrangements with close-up shots of every plant featured.<br />- An A-Z plant directory<br />- Detailed sections on how to water, choose pots, move heavy pots and design arrangements.<br />- Information on \\"when to repot\\" plants<br />- Interesting arrangements with \\"ingredients, planting details and container details.\\"<br />- How to Clean Containers<br />- Choosing the right potting mix<br />- Interesting \\"capillary\\" watering method. Might work<br />if you travel a lot.<br /><br />The arrangements all have themes. You might want a low-maintenance pink arrangement filled with Osteospermum jucundum (delicate pink daisy-style flowers) or create a lively arrangement bursting with golden stars (Bidens ferufolia). Many of the arrangements also help to set dreamy moods, like the Purple Haze with the fuzzy lotus hirsutus meandering with blue trailing petunias.<br /><br />Paul Williams was trained at one of the UK's top horticultural colleges and is a regular contributor to horticultural magazines. His ideas are practical and inspiring.<br /><br />I was so happy to read this book!

I also seem to remember my parents telling me that they had heard of girls in India having babies as young as 7 or 9.<br /><br />However, they didn't tell me how a girl could get pregnant, nor do I remember being told that I should expect my body to change. I read it all in books that I either found at the library or ordered with my pocket money. If I was mature enough to look up the information on my own, then I'd assume that most of today's young girls are mature enough to understand the importance of learning about menstruation.<br /><br />Would this book have been helpful to me at age 10-12?<br /><br />I think this book is an excellent choice for parents, but is definitely too mature for an 8 to-9 year old to read. The author recommends that you talk to your daughter at age 8 and explains that by age 9 some girls are already starting their menstrual cycle. The average age is 12. I think some 12-year olds might find this book interesting if you select a few stories. Some of the stories would not be appropriate to read to young children and even when reading these to an older 10-12- year old, you have the option of leaving out any details that are not age appropriate.<br /><br />The Glossary is filled with detailed information that actually might interest girls who are 11-12 if they are interested in educating themselves in the finer details of being female. You might want to read everything first to see what is appropriate for your daughter.<br /><br />So, I'd recommend this book to parents who are interested in reading a book about menstruation in order to explain the details to their daughters. There are three sections:<br /><br />Start Preparing: How culture shapes the experience, stories of various experiences, ages, etc.<br /><br />Brush up on Basic Facts: What to tell and when. What your daughter should know about mood swings and PMS.<br /><br />Face to Face: How to talk to your daughter and how to talk to men about menstruation. There is also an interesting section called: \\"Menarche is a time to celebrate.\\"<br /><br />Jessica B.

This is a book for teens and about teens.<br /><br />Some of the main topics include such issues as:<br /><br />Decisions that will Derail your Life - pregnancy, dropping out of school, drugs and gangs.<br />Volunteering<br />Gangs<br />Drugs<br />Peer Pressure<br />Education<br />Values to Carry with you Through Life<br />Dealing with Verbal Abuse<br />Dating<br />Career Options<br />Money 101<br /><br />I like the \\"reality check\\" section where Sumant Pendharkar lists what it costs to live by yourself. I'd like to say that $100 for food seems to be a very low estimate, especially if you want to eat healthy or buy organic foods.<br /><br />In the Peers section, Sumant Pendharkar explains the good, bad and the ugly aspects. His section on how to choose friends is excellent. Then, he exposes the real reason tobacco companies try to get teens to smoke. In the Mental and Physical development section, Sumant encourages teens to take reading seriously and encourages a life filled with learning, hobbies, exercise and good financial decisions.<br /><br />I wish someone had given me a book like this when I was a teenager and I've even learned some valuable tips from reading it about 20 years late. This book would make an excellent textbook. I'm pretty sure this book would open up communication between parents and teenagers if read by both and then discussed.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-06-03

He also lectures internationally and is considered to be a master communicator. In \\"The Language of Parenting,\\" he presents solutions for the highly complex issues that can develop in a parent/child relationship.<br /><br />His book is divided into four main sections:<br /><br />1. Building a Foundation: Quantum Learning and Enhanced Communication.<br /><br />2. The Strategies of Great Communicators: Desired Results, The Beauty of Silence, Listening, Limits of Language and Building Rapport.<br /><br />3. Tactics, Tools and Skills of Effective Communication: Avoiding Negation, Models of Creativity, Embedded Suggestions and the Power of Humor.<br /><br />4. Frequently Asked Questions & Parent Resources: Questions about school age children, teenagers, adult children and teenagers. There is also a section for expectant and new parents.<br /><br />I immediately appreciated the larger font size and the text was especially easy to read. This book is really a summary of all the lessons David Frees has learned throughout his life. He includes scientific research, action plans, wise and funny quotes and bold text to emphasize important points. Many chapters contain a Reminder and Action section so you can put the ideas to work almost immediately. You might find one or two of the ideas helpful and then you can write them in your journal.<br /><br />While this book is a somewhat serious study of communication, there are some moments of interest when you will enjoy David's humor. I especially like when he puts text all in CAPS to really get your attention. Especially as he says: \\"you should consider the following belief\\" and then he really makes his point.<br /><br />The section on how we process words in different ways was interesting. Do you see words as pictures, as the words themselves or do they produce feelings? He also gives reasons to why e-mail should not be used for complex emotional issues.<br /><br />David also answers these questions:<br /><br />How do you eliminate fights and foster positive communication?<br /><br />What is the best way to approach my child about premarital sex, drinking, and drugs?<br /><br />Is there really a list of proven communication techniques that encourage children to live happier, healthier and more confident lives?<br /><br />The Language of Parenting is a highly organized collection of parenting wisdom and communications techniques.

Phelan is an expert on child discipline and Attention Deficit Disorder. He is a registered Ph.D. clinical psychologist and is also the author of many helpful parenting books. In this amazing book, he presents three steps to change the negative behavior and reinforce positive behavior in the future. The Index provides you with a way to quickly find the most pertinent subject you are dealing with right now.<br /><br />The Contents include:<br /><br />Straight Thinking - A section about how to stop negative behavior and start good behavior. He also presents the two biggest discipline mistakes.<br /><br />Controlling Obnoxious Behavior - What to do when negative behavior occurs in public. How to handle tantrums and pouting.<br /><br />No Child Will Thank You - Deals with serious offenses and the six kinds of testing and manipulation.<br /><br />Encouraging Good Behavior - 7 Start Behavior Tactics, Cleaning Rooms, Mealtimes, Homework, The Family Meeting.<br /><br />Strengthening Your Relationship - Your Child's Self-Esteem, Overparenting, Affection and Praise, Active listening.<br /><br />I was amused by the information on \\"parental temper tantrums.\\" I've seen parents yell at their kids and seen children reel from the verbal abuse. Then I've seen parents lovingly talk to a child about their behavior. Guess which works? How would you want to be treated? If frustration has reached the level where parents are yelling and kids are crying their eyes out daily, something must not be working. This book provides excellent advice and a three-step solution to every problem. Phelan has an interesting take on spankings and he makes an excellent point or two on page 53. He suggests that parents avoid the Talk-Persuade-Argue-Yell-Hit routine.<br /><br />There is a \\"how to use this book\\" section and there are times when psychological evaluation and counseling may be in order.<br /><br />The 1-2-3 techniques to end arguing are just brilliant. Although, I've seen a parent count 1, 2, 3, and a child is just ignoring the routine. It seems there has to be a negative result that is consistently imposed, like a time out. Some children might enjoy a time out, so that is also a factor to consider. I loved spending time in my room. Hey, there were books there! I also remember sitting in the bathroom and screaming: \\"You will not spank me, I did nothing wrong.\\" I was actually telling the truth and I remember all the times I was punished when I didn't do anything wrong but was accused by the actual perpetrator.<br /><br />Parents have to be pretty aware of their children's character to sort out these types of problems. I grew up in the \\"you did something wrong, you get spanked\\" no other choices world. Often I would have liked to have been given a second chance or had a conversation about the event. I remember my absolute horror when a child was spanked in my presence when I was a child. I feel that spanking can be abuse when it is used incorrectly. Often it does seem to be a result of frustration and I do have to say that I've seen parents use different \\"calm\\" methods and they seem to have better results. And what is the whole \\"Here, hug me because I love you, no matter that I just spanked the heck out of you routine?\\" I was only happy my brother got spanked once. When he violently poked me with a large pin. LOL I haven't let him forget that I remember that.<br /><br />So, what if?<br /><br />Your child won't stay in the time-out room...<br />Your kids go nuts when you are on the phone...<br />A child wrecks the time-out room...<br />Your child doesn't want to apologize...<br /><br />Ahh, and then onto the lovely topic of \\"sibling rivalry, tantrums and pouting.\\" Then onto badgering, tempers and threats. What do you do if your child says they are running away from home? What if a child attacks a parent?<br /><br />This book also gives parents information about Oppositional Defiance and Conduct Disorder. There is also a list of major, medium and minor consequences. Just because a child is on the phone after a time they shouldn't be doesn't mean you should ground them for a month. Maybe a fine or chores would work. The problem can then be solved in a day and the child can start to practice more positive behavior.<br /><br />I think these techniques also work on adults when having an argument or when one person is being unreasonable. One of my friends just told me that you deserve what you put up with. So, I think that moving in a positive direction is always in order. There are ways to stand up for yourself without violence. This book teaches you all the techniques that have worked for parents and I can recommend this book to teachers, all parents, grandparents, babysitters and anyone who is looking after children or knows a child. So, this book is for everyone!<br /><br />I'd almost go as far as to say this would make a wonderful baby shower gift!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewround them for a month.

Letters are a great way to show your child you appreciate them and also to pass along lessons for a happier life. I think parents can teach really important lessons in how to love people in general. Take my dad for example, he would make up a fantastic lunch and add little treats to amuse me so I would feel loved as I ate my boxed lunch at school. The little things count and I've heard how parents can use \\"little notes/letters\\" placed in a child's lunch box to make a child feel loved and appreciated.<br /><br />This book takes this idea a step further. It presents letters to heal hurts, to show that parents are human, to share a parents childhood memories, to educate a child about life's little lessons and to give children a sense of security in a turbulent world.<br /><br />Some of the letters include:<br /><br />Life's Top 10 List - The most important values you hope your child lives by<br />Wipe Away the Tears - comfort and love your child when they're hurting<br />You're the Greatest!<br />Let's Talk - Create an atmosphere for open dialogue<br />Calling All Slobs - A humorous attempt to cure sloppy habits.<br /><br />There is a place to sign each letter and the letters tear out easily. Envelopes are not provided, but these will fit nicely into any envelope depending how you fold them. I'd imagine you could also leave some in fun places, like a favorite coat pocket, etc.<br /><br />Now this is parenting! Highly recommended for every parent, especially those with teenagers who might respond better to a letter than a lecture.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-05-27

When her oldest child was in junior high, she met with six other Acton, MA women and together they created a discussion/learning group to encourage support and to examine issues they were facing with their teens.<br /><br />Please Stop the Rollercoaster is an excellent choice for parents who want to minimize their stress and gain insight from experts and real-life parents. If parenting is the most important job a parent can ever have and life is a school, then this is a textbook for \\"how to survive the teenage years.\\"<br /><br />The contents include:<br /><br />Why You Need a Parenting Program<br />How To Use This Guide<br />Adolescent Development<br />Parenting: Our Changing Roles and Relationships<br />Improving Communication<br />Friends, Culture, and Risk Behavior<br />Personality Type and Brain Development<br />Personality Type and Brain Development<br />School, Parental Support, and Self-Esteem<br />The Myth of Perfection<br />Reflections<br /><br />Each section has quotes, exercises, issues to examine and discuss, take-aways (identify what you have learned and what was relevant to you), and a \\"window\\" into the adolescent world (quotes from teenagers.) There is also additional support through a website listed in the book.<br /><br />In the first chapter, Adolescent Development, we find a brief discussion about how a teenager is changing dramatically. This is followed by a question and then there is room for you to note changes you are observing. After turning the page you will find an \\"overview and objectives\\" section. This tells you what you will be learning in the chapter and this is followed by a page of instructions like: \\"Complete the letter/vision exercise on page 12.\\" This is then followed by an informative section on \\"a view of adolescence.\\" Finally, here is a section called: \\"A Glimpse into Their World.\\" There are quotes from teenagers and lots of quotes from various books you might also want to read if you have time.<br /><br />\\"Don't worry so much if you don't have the answer to a question I may have. Just keep helping me find the answers.\\" ~Charlene, 17<br /><br />The first chapter deals with physical and cognitive development, self-discovery and identity, development and gender, mood swings, spirituality, ethnicity, conscience and fears.<br /><br />Then, last but not least... there is a section called: Issues to Examine and Discuss and the Take-Aways section.<br /><br />So, this is pretty comprehensive and the author takes this subject very seriously all while presenting the topics in an enjoyable fashion. You will also find humorous comic strips sprinkled throughout the book.<br /><br />If you are trying to talk to your kids about various issues, like alcohol and drugs, there are informative sections that give the facts. This book does not judge or give \\"rules\\" for parenting. It presents the facts and then asks you to fill in your ideas. For example, \\"What is your stand on teen drinking?\\" There is some pretty interesting information on what teenagers think about sexual activity. You probably did hear some of this in the news. Wouldn't you rather warn your teenagers about date rape drugs and other situations before they occur? This book makes perfect sense.<br /><br />Chapter 5 was quite a fun read for me with my interest in psychology. It deals with personality type and brain development. There are tests you can take online, but this book gives a good section that will allow you to quickly analyze yourself or a teens personality. It is interesting how my best friends are actually the same personality type as I am. This was all very enlightening. It might also help you figure out eveyone's personality and it just fascinating. I had a good laugh when reading about my own personality. Imagine the fun you can have with this chapter.<br /><br />Since School is such the important topic, an entire chapter is devoted to School, Parental Support and Self-Esteem. You will find info on the Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences (musical intelligence vs. linguistic intelligence, etc.), how your teen can improve their grades, self-esteem and many more pertinent issues.<br /><br />Wow, this is one interesting book. I'm very impressed. You will not only understand your teen, you will start to even understand yourself in a deeper way.

There is also information from mental health professionals and empowering information to allow parents to understand a diagnosis.<br />I have personally come to believe that many people feel suicidal because they do not feel loved or they feel lost in a complex world that does not recognize their many unique gifts. There are also mental disorders which a person can't control and a child who has violent tantrums or severe mood swings can make life rather difficult for any parent. When a child starts to talk about killing themselves at the age of six, there is definitely a problem.<br /><br />Through this wonderful book, you can learn about the causes of this disorder and get the support and information you need to make your child's life a more pleasant experience. Not to mention give you some needed peace of mind.<br /><br />There are six main sections:<br /><br />Figuring Out What You're Dealing With<br />Adjusting to the Bipolar Diagnosis<br />Helping Your Child Get Treatment<br />Having a Bipolar Child in the Family<br />Taking Care of Yourself<br />Helping our Child Live with Bipolar Disorder<br /><br />This book will be especially helpful for parents who are trying to figure out why their child reacts very negatively to even the best parenting skills. Bipolar children have problems with extreme anger, frustration and seem to be highly intelligent. There are stories of children who cry all day or show extremely inappropriate and sometimes harmful behavior. There are quotes from parents throughout the book to give an idea of the wide variety of symptoms. I had no idea children were going through some of these extreme symptoms and this was highly enlightening.<br /><br />I was especially interested in the ODD symptoms because I've personally been around a child with ODD and the \\"actively defies or refuses to comply with adults' requests\\" is so true. The authors also discuss Conduct Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Sensory Integration Dysfunction and ADHD. Often a child is misdiagnosed or a child is given the wrong medication because a professional does not realize there are other symptoms involved.<br /><br />I'm not overly enthusiastic about medicating children, but after you read some of the more extreme symptoms, something has to be done to give these children a chance to attend school. I've seen medications calm a child and I've also seen overdosing. If you need to get more than one doctor's opinion, do it. Schools also play a role in medicating children (in the nurses office), so it is important to stay involved and find out what is going on at school.<br /><br />A glossary at the end of this book provides terms and definitions to terms used in this book. I found this book to be extremely informative, helpful and written in a down-to-earth manner.<br /><br />Highly recommended for parents with difficult children, psychologists, counselors and anyone dealing with family psychology.

That is undisputed. But trust me when I say that none of the participants in this program were \\"majorly\\" overweight. If you are 30 or more lbs overweight, you might want to give yourself more than 30 sessions. In fact, I myself have been doing Pilates \\"seriously\\" for over 30 weeks now and I can say that I do Pilates about 3 or more times a week. Most of the participants in this book had relatively flat stomachs, minor posture problems, lacked muscle definition and look like they are basically at their target weight or close to it.<br /><br />Measurements of one participant:<br /><br />Waist before, 30 inches, after 28 inches.<br />Hips before 42 inches, after 39 ½ inches<br />Upper thighs before 26 inches, after 23 ½ inches<br /><br />Another participant saw an increase of 1 inch in her bustline while another saw an increase of ½ inches in her biceps and deltoids.<br /><br />The participants all give their \\"view\\" of Pilates and are given an assessment. There are a few before/after shots that do not show dramatic changes in weight loss, but show other features like improved posture and thinner thighs.<br /><br />If you are close to your target weight and want to firm up your entire body, then I'd highly recommend this book. If you are just starting Pilates, I'd also recommend this book, but take the challenge less seriously if you are moderately overweight. As you do walking, you do start to see the results of Pilates showing through. Honestly, Pilates helps you walk more efficiently because it improves your posture. You also gain an added level of confidence and your stomach will start to disappear and your butt will lift. Basically, everything firms up from the inside out.<br /><br />If you are just starting to do Pilates, you might also want to look for a variety of video/DVD workouts to compliment this workout book. Karen Voight, Jennifer Kries, and Winsor Pilates are names to look for here at Amazon. Alycea Ungaro also has a book/CD set called Portable Pilates.<br /><br />There are over 350 Photographs and clear instructions for each exercise. Alycea Ungaro is a Pilates instructor who has created matwork exercises that produce real results. She has trained dozens of celebrities including Uma Thurman and Christy Turlington.<br /><br />The Contents of this book are too complex to list. There is an Introduction, Basic Program, Upper Body Program, Lower Body Program, Flexibility and Posture Program.<br /><br />You will be doing exercises called, The Hundred, Spine Stretch Forward, Push Ups, Double Leg Kick, Arm Series, Magic Circle Series, One-Legged Teaser, Can-Can, The Seal, The Saw, Neck Pull, Swimming, Mermaid, Rowing.<br /><br />If you have experienced these while watching a DVD then you will be familiar with the types of exercises. Many are done standing or laying flat on your back. There are no complicated bouncy exercises that hurt your knees, there are no fancy steps to memorize.<br /><br />This is exercise at its finest. I recommend this book to anyone who is willing to make Pilates more than a challenge and who want to seriously consider this form of exercise for long-term results.<br /><br />Things to buy with this book: An inflatable 16-inch ball or a \\"magic circle.\\" Karen Voight sells one that works very well and it is padded. A yoga mat or padded exercise mat. 2-3lb weights, pole, ankle weights and exercise bands. There are some sources for supplies in the back of the book.<br /><br />It sounds like a lot, but all these items can be used with lots of exercise videos. You might even get excited enough to start collecting exercise videos. Imagine, something that you can collect that is going to change your entire body!<br /><br />Also look for:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0446677345 Jennifer Kries' Pilates Plus Method: The Unique Combination ofYoga, Dance, and Pilates]]<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-05-25

These books combine Baby Genius' philosophy with DK's amazing photographs and designs. Baby Genius is a leading producer/publisher of classical, instrumental and vocal CDs and videos for young children.<br /><br />In this book, children are introduced to the world of wild and exotic animals. Fun words and full-color photographs will delight babies and hold their interest.<br /><br />Zoo Animals is a sturdy 16-page book that can be enjoyed for years. The photography is so good you can almost imagine reaching out and touching the page and actually feeling the leopard's fur or the petting the tiny tiger cub's fur. The photography is simply stunning.<br /><br />This book contains pictures of leopards catnapping, giraffes sticking their tongue out (really funny), baby elephants drinking at a water hole, Zebras smiling, turtles swimming under water, baby tigers hanging out together all in a row and a group of lemurs with stunning amber eyes.<br /><br />On the left side you find one animal with the name in large print. Then, on the adjacent page, you see three photographs of the animals in their natural habitat.<br /><br />Highly recommended for the amusement value alone. Some of my earliest childhood memories included seeing a giraffe and elephant at a zoo. This is a book babies and toddlers will enjoy and a trip to the zoo will enhance the reading experience.<br /><br />Also look for:<br /><br />Baby Animals: Colors, Numbers, Shapes<br /><br />Four Seasons<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-05-23

This book began as a course he was teaching at Georgetown University. His work was first published in 1996. Since then, his firm, Edelman Financial Services Inc., has created and implemented financial plans for over 6,500 clients. This review is for the 3rd Edition.<br /><br />Are you buying your first home, just starting to invest, sending the kids to college, considering retirement or making decisions about long-term care? There is a section for every major issue and tons of great tips and advice. I also love the comic strips throughout the book. Who knew you could laugh your way through a finance book?<br /><br />The Truth about Money is divided into 14 main sections:<br /><br />The Rules of Money Have Changed. Again.<br />Introduction to Financial Planning<br />Understanding the Capital Markets<br />Fixed Income Investments<br />Equities<br />Packaged Products<br />The Best Investment Strategies<br />The Best Financial Strategies<br />The Best Strategies for Buying, Selling and Owning Homes<br />Taxes, Taxes, Taxes<br />Retirement Planning<br />Insurance<br />Estate Planning<br />How to Choose a Financial Adviser<br /><br />Ric often gets frank about life choices and I enjoyed reading his comments about how we make choices that lead us to our present lifestyle. The information on \\"Where American's Spend their Money\\" is enlightening. Housing is at 32%. In the past few years I was able to decrease our housing costs in order to increase funds in other areas and page 307 makes perfect sense to me. I've also watched friends struggle with this issue because they want to keep their lifestyle at such a high level, their income won't cover the luxury of living by themselves.  Issues like Liquidating your assets, closing bank accounts, paying off high interest credit cards and borrowing money at a lower interest rate than your credit card interest makes complete sense. Cutting up all but one credit card also works wonders.<br /><br />While reading the information about credit cards on page 309 I was laughing out loud. Ric is a real comedian. Hey, wait, but he is actually getting my attention in the perfect way. There are also quotes from famous people all through the book and here is a good example:<br /><br />\\"If you can see yourself in possession of your goal, it's half yours.\\" ~Tom Hopkins<br /><br />I loved the: \\"How to Use This Book\\" section. There is a list of \\"If You Are\\" situations and \\"Then Read\\" these page numbers.

These books combine Baby Genius' philosophy with DK's amazing photographs and designs. Baby Genius is a leading producer/publisher of classical, instrumental and vocal CDs and videos for young children.<br />In this book, children are introduced to pictures of:<br /><br />Spring: Daffodils, lambs, splashing raindrops.<br /><br />Summer: The beach, a pool, butterflies, a wet dog.<br /><br />Fall: Leaves, tasty apples, walking in a forest.<br /><br />Winter: Warm gloves, frosty leaves, a chilly snowman.<br /><br />Then, there is a page of children dressed for each season. I like how they photographed the same tree in all seasons. The last scenes shows the animals you can expect to see in each season.<br /><br />Four Seasons is a sturdy book that can be enjoyed for years. The photography is so good you can almost imagine reaching out and touching the page and actually feeling the cold, crisp snow or imagine you are inhaling the scent of autumn leaves. The photography is simply stunning.<br /><br />Highly recommended as a teaching guide for babies and toddlers who are already curious about their world.

The patients at a hospital used materials of all shapes and sizes to craft angels. These angels represent the patient's hopes, dreams and passions.<br /><br />Adrienne Rudolph, an artist in residence at the University Hospital in Ann Arbor, Michigan asked chronically and terminally ill children to \\"create an angel that represented a personal interest.\\" For 6 months these children created angels and then all 104 angels were displayed on the holiday tree in the hospital lobby.<br /><br />Adrienne wanted to create a lasting memory and keep these angels all together in a book. Her wish has been brought to life on page after page of amazing art. Maureen McKinney created sing-song verse to accompany color photographs of 75 of the original 104 angels.<br /><br />Sadly many of the children did not live to see some of their creations pictured in this book, however their spirit and talent now live on the pages of Angels are Everywhere. When you realize that some of the angels were created by children fighting for their very lives, it creates a powerful impression. All the angels are pictured on pages with cloud backgrounds. Each background is a different color from green to blue and even peach.<br /><br />Some of the angel names:<br /><br />The Angel of Buttons by Ethan Stodbeck (This angel helps you get dressed)<br />The Angel of Spring by Christina Bigelow (helps flowers grow)<br />The Angel of Faith by Nicole Williams (helps fill your heart with hope and love)<br />The Angel who Cooks by Ingrid Neiters (makes food so yummy she fills up your heart as she fills up your tummy)<br /><br />Each angel is amazingly unique and created with a variety of interesting materials from various patterned materials, craft supplies and even unusual items like gloves or birthday candles.<br /><br />A portion of the proceeds from the sale of Angels are Everywhere will be donated to the C.S.

Simon's Hook is an excellent way to teach children to be more resilient.<br />The cover (not yet shown today) has a red background and Simon is sitting on a hook under water as if it was a swing. Fish swim about and all the characters are fanciful and smiling.<br /><br />The basic story includes a \\"bad hair day.\\" When Simon's sister can't find her gum, she finds that it is in Simon's hair. Unfortunately she has to cut off a lot of his hair to get the gum out. This story will be very familiar to children. I remember this happening to me when I fell asleep while chewing gum.<br /><br />Simon is doing quite well while wearing a hat, but when he falls and his hat falls off, all the children start to call him lawn mower head. As he runs home he accidentally runs into Grandma Rose. Simon tells her what happened and tells her about the teasing.<br /><br />\\"But why do you bite? \\"<br />\\"Bite?\\" cried Simon.<br />\\"I didn't bite anyone!\\"<br /><br />After going into her garage, Grandma Rose returns with a fishing line. A piece of paper is attached to the end of the hook and a cat is trying to bat at the paper. By waving the paper around for the cat, Grandma Rose shows how the cat bats at the paper. Then, she dangles the paper in front of Simon. Then Simon catches the paper too.<br /><br />\\"You're not a free fish anymore.\\"<br />\\"But what else can I do?\\"<br /><br />Then over a glass of lemonade and a few cookies, Grandma Rose tells Simon a fish story. The next two pages are filled with fish thinking, saying things or biting at pieces of paper with put downs and teases written on them.<br /><br />I had to laugh because some of the fish are quite adorable (the \\"peace\\" fish named Harmony Hippy Fish is a hoot) and the entire story is rather cute. At the end of the book all the fish are drawn in one picture and their names are listed next to them. The shark is of course called: \\"tiny.\\" They also have some witty comments that one could consider to be a snappy retort. At the bottom of the ocean we see an Instead of Biting do this sign. It lists five ways to avoid getting caught by teasing.<br /><br />There are pages and pages of fishes saying various things that are quite amusing. Even I was laughing out loud at a few of the fish stories.<br /><br />When Simon returns to the park he has a new attitude and his friends enjoy his new witty remarks. He no longer takes them seriously and can enjoy the attention.<br /><br />Karen Gredig Burnett writes highly creative books and Laurie Barrows knows how to draw the characters Karen is talking about. So, together they create a magic all of their own.<br /><br />If your child is struggling with teasing, this book will empower them and show them that they can laugh at difficulty and embrace change. I might even start using a few of the witty comments in this book when my husband teases me. This book is definitely not just for younger kids. It can also empower adults and teenagers.<br /><br />Also look for:<br /><br />Katie's Rose<br />If the World were Blind<br />The Magical, Marvelous Megan G.

She loves chasing butterflies and would rather take time to play than to learn. Grandma Rose knows that play can lead to learning and tells Katie to look at something special in her garden.<br /><br />Katie and her parents look at the roses and Grandma Rose explains why children are at times like roses. Then she gives Katie a rose bush to take home with her and of course she plays all the way home.<br /><br />The next few pages have pictures of trees, roses, babies walking and children reading. Each section explains how growth happens in a unique way for each flower, tree, child, etc.<br /><br />A special section at the end of the book gives a list of people who bloomed at their own time including, Albert Einstein, Grandma Moses, Michael Jordan and even Karen Gedig Burnett.<br /><br />A note to parents, grandparents, teachers and all who love and care for children gives advice on how to support and respect children who are late bloomers.<br /><br />As a late bloomer myself, I can say I understood Katie's need to enjoy the world and live in the moment. I've always thought we all grow up way too fast and children do learn through play and through creative stories.<br /><br />Karen and Laurie create loving gifts for the world. The stories are positive and the art is just a delight. I love all the creatures roaming about in their books. This one has snakes, baby birds, ants, hiking mice, singing frogs, bees, blue birds, dogs and cats and tiny yellow chicks. This book could also be used for counting how many of each type of animal you find on each page.<br /><br />Karen Gedig Burnett worked as an elementary school counselor for over twenty years and her wisdom is very apparent.

Why do others treat us with respect or disrespect? In \\"If the World Were Blind,\\" Karen Gedig Burnett addresses the issues of how we judge people based on their skin color, nationality, clothes, body shape and looks. This is a book about judgment and prejudice.<br /><br />This book is made up of pages with black backgrounds that fold out into full color scenes of people saying various negative and positive sentences. The point is well made because if you were blind you would not be able to see the scenes filled with people of different ethnicity, action and dress. White words are printed on the black background and a sentence in a white box at the base of the closed page states what a person would not see if they were blind, for example:<br /><br />\\"If the world were blind it wouldn't matter what color skin a person had: black, tan, white, red, yellow...<br /><br />Next page: \\"...it would matter only that their voice is kind and their touch is gentle.\\"<br /><br />In the black section of the page you might see:<br /><br />\\"Go back where you came from,\\" \\"It's so good to see you,\\" \\"Stay away from people like that. They're no good.\\"<br /><br />When you open the pages you can then see who is saying which phrase.<br /><br />An interesting way to explain that we should treat people with respect and to care more about their internal motivations all while learning to reach out to one another with kindness.<br /><br />Even if this book is teaching children not to judge by appearance, I still think it is good to teach children to respect themselves and by improving our own appearance through exercise or by dressing in a way that shows others they respect themselves. Often people do show how they feel about themselves by the way they dress or by the way they take care of themselves. So, the issue of self-esteem is not really addressed fully in this book and is definitely an issue to consider. The author does give advice on choosing friends who are good for you.<br /><br />I guess the main point of the book is that no matter what, we can treat people with respect and in order to make the world a more nurturing place, we have to be the catalyst for change. We can diffuse anger and hate with love and be part of the solution.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewe way they dress or by the way they take care of themselves.

She is an adorable goldfish with a bow on the top of her head. While the art is definitely the highlight of this book, the story can at times make you laugh out loud (especially the part with the shark). Not only does it rhyme, it is quite cute.<br /><br />Chelsea has a dream and she decides to take a journey out into the world. She has been living in a small artificial pond in the window of a flower shop and loves to tell her friends about her dreams as white moonbeams shine down onto the pond.<br /><br />Her friends don't want to leave their pond, but Chelsea bravely jumps out of the pond and makes her way to a natural setting where her dream comes true. Along the way she encounters dangers (a dog) and even takes a ride on top of a taxi.<br /><br />The story of Chelsea will encourage children to follow their dreams and will delight your inner child. While we don't normally think of fish walking along pathways in a city or park setting, somehow this story works its magic and will encourage the idea that \\"anything is possible.\\"<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-05-21

A dog and cat follow them around as they discover one egg, two fish, three apples, four squirrels, five acorns, six smooth rocks, seven roses in bloom, eight butterflies dancing in the air, nine worms and 10 chocolate-chip cookies.<br /><br />I don't know about anyone else reading this book, but I was rather please to see Billy and Abigail eating cookies and drinking juice. Their arms and legs are so skinny. While this stick arms/legs look gives them a whimsical look, I hope the illustrator will consider the message this might send to kids. The cat and dog looked rather well fed and are adorable.<br /><br />Otherwise, I loved the colors and art in this book and each time you look at the pages you see something new. There are scenes of brightly colored butterflies, red tablecloths and gardens with bird houses and white picket fences. Personally, I think the cat in this story really steals the show.<br /><br />Nice durable carboard-style pages with a wipe-clean coating.<br /><br />Also look for: Good Morning, Good Night Billy & Abigail<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-05-21

Even the pictures in the story were modeled on her own family. Natalie wanted to write the book for kids everywhere who are living in a multi-cultural family. One of the main ideas in this book is that a loving family comes in all cultures and colors.<br /><br />The story begins in a contemporary setting and as Tommy is feeding his pet lizard, he hears a loud crashing sound outside. After looking out the window he sees his Filipino-born grandparents arriving and they are carrying boxes of toys, dishes and books.<br /><br />Tommy's father is Irish-American and his mother is Filipino-American. Tommy is just starting to learn about his cultural heritage and during dinner he learns about the sumptuous meals made by Filipino and Irish peoples.<br /><br />Tommy's grandmother brings a game called \\"Sungka\\" but no one has time to play the game because they are all getting ready for dinner. By the end of the evening Tommy finally gets to play more games of Sungka and also learns about Irish festivals and folklore. Some of the items discussed are illustrated above the characters.<br /><br />There are pictures of the family eating dinner and communicating with each other throughout the house. This book will more than likely cause children to become very curious about their own cultural heritage.<br /><br />I've found very few books about multicultural families and when I've given this type of book away to a family the response is always: \\"We can never find these types of stories.\\" So, Natalie is on the right path here and I hope she creates an entire series of books for children in multiracial families.<br /><br />Natalie Gonzales-Sullaway, MS, is executive director of Vocational Skills Services, a non-profit organization that provides job training.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-05-21

You start to connect with the deepest levels of your inner self and as you continue practicing yoga, you start to feel very good about the poses you have mastered. In this way, you also start to boost your self-esteem, all while being very aware of how you affect everyone in your world.<br /><br />Cyndi Lee has a unique and very effective method of introducing you to yoga. She has a fun almost playful approach. She is the director of the OM yoga center where she teaches hatha yoga. She has been teaching yoga for over 20 years, but her pictures look like she is ageless. Yogi Mitchell Wolf joins her in this workout.<br /><br />Her beauty represents the deeply calming benefits of yoga. Her work has been featured in Shape, New York Magazine, Yoga Journal, Elle, Forbes, Newsweek and Self. She writes a regular column and lives in New York City. She travels to lead workshops and retreats in places like London, France, Italy and the Virgin Islands.<br /><br />I wish I had found these boxed sets a long time ago. Each box contains everything you need for yoga practice besides a blanket and a yoga mat. I'd also like to recommend a soft blanket or comforter, a pillow and yoga blocks if you are just starting your practice.<br /><br />This box contains 2 Compact Discs, flash cards, a yoga belt (nice feature!), a candle, incense and an incense holder. The 2 Discs are in a durable little book with additional information.<br /><br />The first CD is an instructional CD that guides you through yoga poses meant for two people.<br /><br />When you open the box it is like an exotic experience. The Bodhi Sattva incense has permeated the entire box and everything has the scent of \\"celestial sandalwood.\\"<br /><br />Once you start the CD you soon realize that there is a method here. You have enough time to quickly place the cards out in order so you can see all the poses.

Not only do you learn all the basic techniques, there are detailed instructions and full-color pictures to show you every major step in the entire process.<br /><br />This book also has a section on the history of sushi, information on the utensils, ingredients and fish used to make sushi. You will learn to make scattered, stuffed, pressed, rolled and hand-formed sushi.<br /><br />A special section also describes etiquette, problems and solutions and information on the sushi bar experience. A directory of sushi bars and a great index complete the package.<br /><br />Look for bonito fish flakes and kombu to order with this book. Amazon sells both and you need those basic ingredients to make the stock and rice. If you can't find them at your local market this book also has a list of Japanese retailers and fish suppliers. Also look for Dried Seaweed in sheets and a bamboo rolling mat.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-05-17

One of the best ways to refocus your entire being is to start to exercise on a regular basis. This might mean you walk or take a Tai Chi class. I have found that by exercising on a regular basis I make healthier choices and sugary foods are less appealing than a crunchy salad with a delicious dressing. Exercise also takes time which keeps me out of the mall. It hasn't kept me away from Amazon, so no luck there. ;)<br /><br />Nikki Winston has a pleasant writing style and inspired me to start T'ai Chi. Her book helped me to understand why I should repattern my body in order to repattern my mind, emotions and spirit. It does seem to work. With the stress level I endured last week I should be an absolute wreck, but here I sit calmly typing away. When you exercise on a consistent basis, it does encourage clear thinking. Instead of getting into a panic about the way life changes in an instant, you just whip out one of your exercise tapes and spend time moving your body. Then, you will find you can deal with just about anything with a calm attitude.<br /><br />This book is divided into three sections:<br /><br />Change the way you move and change your life<br />BodyMind exercises to transform your life<br />Moving to address the issues in your life<br /><br />You can use the BodyMind connection to handle fear, anxiety and stress. You can even use the exercises to learn new body language to find new relationships that are healthy and fulfilling. Do you want to live a more authentic life or follow your life's passion? Nikki believes in this system and I can say that exercise in general will give you a renewed sense of confidence.<br /><br />Look for Nikki's \\"Tai Ji video, The Golden Door's Response to Stress.\\"<br /><br />This book is the perfect companion to any exercise program because it explains why exercise works and why various exercises can heal specific areas of your life. There are numerous real-life examples that explore the connection between the way we move and the condition of our inner world.<br /><br />Chapter 14 has a lol moment of enlightenment. The Appendix has a list of suggested Affirmations like: \\"I am at peace,\\" or \\"I see the beauty in life.\\" These would be worth writing on cards to encourage a more positive mindset.<br /><br />Also Recommended: Discover TAI CHI for beginners with Scott Cole.<br /><br />Need to feel good fast? Try Crunch Candlelight Yoga and YOGA ZONE<br />Flexibility and Stress Release.<br /><br />My personal remedy for emotional ills is to get into bed with a good book. Every Move You Make is a book that will calm your mind and give you something unique to think about. Once you start reading you are going to be excited about trying the exercises and also trying other healing exercises like Tai Chi.<br />The exercises in this book are similar to Tai Chi, but are much easier to learn. Step-by-Step pictures are helpful, but I'd recommend a video and this book.<br /><br />~The Rebecca ReviewThis book is the perfect companion to any exercise program because it explains why exercise works and why various exercises can heal specific areas of your life.

Are there people you would never travel with or dread traveling with on vacations? Then this book might present a few creative solutions.<br /><br />Nadine Nardi Davidson has spent 27 years as a travel consultant and in this time she has assisted many travelers from age 9 to 90. In this book she finally shares all her travel insights and secret tips for staying sane while traveling.<br /><br />In this entertaining book you will discover:<br /><br />The Nine Travel Types (You might find you are a little of each, but one will be dominant and it does seem that \\"shopper\\" and \\"culturist\\" seemed familiar.) Nadine mentions that you might be a combination of travel types.<br /><br />Travel Etiquette when Traveling with your Employer or Business Colleagues<br /><br />How to Survive Traveling with Your Friends, Spouse, Pet, Relatives, In-Laws and Kids<br /><br />The Honeymoon (If there is a hurricane on the way in, leave no matter what your husband says. Ha, ha. )<br /><br />What to do when your teenager falls in love while you are on vacation<br /><br />What to do when you take your child's friend along on your vacation<br /><br />Nadine's writing style is comforting, often humorous and always a pleasure to read. This is one of the most interesting books on travel I've read to date. There are concepts in this book I would never have even considered. On my last trip I used her idea about limiting my wardrobe to one or two basic colors. That would be black clothes as a basic and therefore all shoes could be black too, etc. Nadine is right about packing toiletries. They can truly take longer to pack than your clothes.<br /><br />Throughout the book you will find real-life stories that are often humorous and always entertaining. This is an insiders view of travel and this book is filled with practical advice.<br /><br />You will also find travel checklists, information on special airline meals, making a traveler's medical kit and packing tips for trips of 7-21 days. May I also suggest: Smart Packing by Susan Foster.<br /><br />Whether you are traveling to visit family for the holidays or traveling overseas, this book is an essential guide to enjoying your next vacation or business trip.<br /><br />~The Rebecca ReviewFoster.

Not only did this book assist in my own amusement, I also had some conversations in which a few words were quite useful.<br /><br />The humorous cartoons throughout the book really do help you remember the words. Then, each word has been used in a sentence. The word is in bold and is followed by a description.<br /><br />For Example:<br /><br />10) DIPTEROUS (dip ter es) - having two wings<br /><br />....claimed that their dipterous contraption would actually become airborne.<br /><br />Picture: Dragon flying across opposite page with a smile on his face and the word \\"DIPTEROUS\\" beneath the picture.<br /><br />Now if someone is going on and on about something, you could always tell them that they are only presenting a psittacism to you and then you should absquatulate before they find a dictionary. There are all sorts of ways to amuse yourself with this book. I'm going to try to remember one word a week and in that way increase my vocabulary. Whether you impress people or confuse them silly might depend on how much they love words.<br /><br />If you are like me, you will be reading the back cover of this book and want to look up a few words. Of course the index makes no sense \\"at first\\" because the listings don't correspond to the page numbers. Well, I guess this is a chronological index (When looking up DIPTERIOUS you will be sent to listing 10, not page 10) and you might not read the sentence at the start of the Index if you are looking up \\"Stultiloquence\\" instead of \\"Aquiline.\\"  If the author wants to make the index more usable, he might want to put that \\"warning sentence\\" on every index page.<br /><br />After figuring out how to use the index, I did go through a bit of a tergiversation myself and realized that the book is easy to use when you can look up the words in chronological order. Still, I would like to see page numbers too. Maybe the author could put two headings, \\"Chronological Listing and Page Number\\" and make everyone happy.<br /><br />If you love words, this will be highly entertained and personally (not to be a philodox or anything), I loved the picture of the Bandersnatch and Dragon the best and all the pictures add a does of humor to a list of seriously difficult words. I hope this will not be the last book because I could see an entire series of these books for word hungry readers.<br /><br />This book is dedicated to all the Word of the Day subscribers.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewgical Listing and Page Number\\" and make everyone happy.

I packed for a three-week trip to France (one week in Paris, the balance in Provence) in a 22\\" roll-aboard bag plus a small tote. Using all my best tips from Smart Packing, I had everything I needed or wanted and easily traveled by plane, train and very small car. It works! ~ Susan Foster<br />When I was getting ready for a trip to Seattle a few weeks ago, we were told that the dress would be business casual. Well, since I am working from home, I needed to figure out what would be acceptable. I tend to overdress for all occasions and this time I decided to do research. After reading through the wardrobe sections, I decided to go a step below business casual and it felt right.<br />So, are you planning for a cruise? Part III: Customize Your Wardrobe is going to save you so much time and you will have more fun shopping for the clothes you will actually want to wear. The words: \\"less is best\\" is pretty foreign to me. I pack enough for three weeks at least. Just taking a backpack would be horrifying to me. Yet, this is what some people learn to do while traveling. Whether you are traveling light or taking it all, this book has something to offer. I went with the \\"One Week Trip, Casual Business Wardrobe\\" idea.<br />Susan has divided her book into four main sections:<br />1. Plan Your Perfect Trip - Planning for weather, travel fabrics, packing perfectly, etc.<br />2. Pack Smart - Airport Security, choosing the right luggage, checking or carrying bags?<br />3. Customize Your Wardrobe - Business, Cruise, Adventure, Resort, Sports, selecting clothes for your kids.<br />4. Travel Safely in Comfort and Good Health - Things to do before you leave home, worthwhile travel gadgets, money matters and travel insurance.<br />Some of the helpful tips included:<br />How to use a paper shopping bag to make unpacking easier. Great idea.<br />How to layer clothes so they don't get wrinkled.<br />Tips for not getting your luggage stolen when going through security.<br />Saline Nasal Spray - Helps you not to get sick from being on a plane.<br />Tips for traveling with infants and younger children<br />Take-Along Medicine Cabinet<br />Resource Guide - Lists of online sources for travel clothes, accessories/luggage, publications, organizations.<br />Smart Packing is more than a packing guide, Susan will show you how to travel in comfort and style. Without this book, I would have felt so lost. This book gave me the confidence I needed to go shopping for the right clothes and taught me a thing or two about packing for a business trip. I still pack too much, but hey I have wheels on my luggage. On the way home, they made me move some items to another bag because I went over the 50 lb limit. Um, oops. Yeah, I went shopping.<br />~The Rebecca Reviewe stolen when going through security. <BR>Saline Nasal Spray - Helps you not to get sick from being on a plane. <BR>Tips for traveling with infants and younger children<BR>Take-Along Medicine Cabinet<BR>Resource Guide - Lists of online sources for travel clothes, accessories/luggage, publications, organizations.<br />Smart Packing is more than a packing guide, Susan will show you how to travel in comfort and style.

705593:US	50199793	R1BMJWHDETFRNP	140190159X	771403226	Shape Your Life	Books	5	14	14	N	N	Mastering the Seven Elements of Fitness	With the popularity of makeover shows, it is no surprise to find books promoting the idea of \\"getting in shape fast.\\" It only took my husband asking me if I wanted to go on one of those makeover shows to get me thinking I could probably do this myself  without surgery and a \\"lot\\" of patience. What I worry about is how discouraged some people might become when four weeks pass and they look at themselves in the mirror and see minimal results.<br /><br />For me, it has taken over 24 weeks of serious working out for about 45 minutes a day, not to mention all the salads I've had to eat to get to a point where I feel that I should have started. I've found that diets don't work, but diet counts. If that makes any sense.<br /><br />But with that aside, I think this book is for people who are between 10-20 lbs overweight. Then, you will probably see dramatic results. For anyone who is trying to lose 50 or more pounds, it is going to take much longer than 4 weeks.<br /><br />So, I would say that this book is more helpful for anyone looking for lifestyle changes on a permanent basis. Toss out the \\"4-week\\" idea and think \\"life plan for getting fit and staying that way.\\" Then, you will enjoy this book and it becomes a starting point for major changes down the road. I would just hate to see anyone toss out the wonderful ideas when they don't see dramatic changes in four weeks.<br /><br />The concepts are amazingly well organized. The Seven Elements each have their own chapters. You explore: your workout, diet, spirituality, rest, emotions, body image, work and finally the last chapter analyzes your results. Throughout the pages you will find \\"quick tips\\" and \\"what you'll learn\\" pointers. The fitness test is helpful to determine your present strength level. The \\"walk-run\\" idea is probably not new to you if you have a treadmill, but might interest you if you have only been walking. The walking program is highly detailed and gives you a schedule for all four weeks, day by day.<br /><br />If you don't have a lot of time to workout, you can try the 20-minute workout. There is a helpful chart for major muscle groups. If you enjoy learning exercises from a book, there are quite a few exercises. I still recommend getting exercise videos to learn how to do Pilates, yoga or any other exercise you want to try. You can refer back to the book to see the pictures, but nothing compares to a one-on-one session with a professional instructor on video/DVD. A video will help you keep the intensity going and an instructor will show you what you might be doing wrong.<br /><br />Chapter two delves into the area of diet. I'm going to say that I agree with Shape's approach to eating right. The shape food pyramid puts vegetables and fruits on the bottom of the pyramid and whole grains on the third level. Water is on the second level. This makes sense and I've lost weight following these ideas. I'm less hungry when I drink enough water and my moods are more constant when I drink enough fluids and exercise almost daily. If you are a vegetarian, there is information for your diet which includes suggestions for meat substitutes, etc.<br /><br />I must say that the weekly menus are rather impressive. They have easy-to-prepare recipes for every single meal, every single day for four weeks. You start to eat 5 times a day which you really need to do once you start working out more. Some of the delicious recipes include:<br /><br />Quinoa Salad with Red Peppers and Pine Nuts<br />Frozen Cinnamon Cappuccino<br />Tarragon Mashed Potatoes<br />Grilled Tuna Salad<br />Thai Pudding<br />Banana-Soy Shake<br />Chicken Pot Stickers<br /><br />The amazing thing about the recipes is the lack of complicated preparation steps and the speed at which the meals can be prepared. There is an intriguing section that shows you how to navigate your grocery store. The Mango and Ginger Cream recipe reminded me of how we mix low-fat sour cream with honey or stevia and a dash of vanilla. Suddenlypieces of fruit becomes an exotic treat when dipped in creamy vanilla bliss. I can eat an orange, banana and apple in one sitting while watching a TV show. That is one of the ways I get in my fruit for the day.<br /><br />The chapter on spirituality encourages you to explore new areas of your life. The \\"are you starving your soul? questionnaire could be enlightening in itself. The list of \\"7 people we all need\\" shows you that you can't just rely on one friend to satisfy all your friendship needs. Whether you try journaling or meditation, there are plenty of ways to feel more nourished. Try yoga! The next chapter should be called: Your sleep number. ;)  Although, it also deals with vacations and visualization. Then, you explore body image and finally analyze your results.<br /><br />Helpful Tools that make this book a keeper:<br /><br />How to calculate your daily calories<br />How to calculate your Body Mass Index<br />Fitness Test<br />Menu Plans<br /><br />When you start buying smaller clothes, reading this book is going to be so worth it! Just remember, when you are first working out, you might gain weight. Once you get over that hurdle, the pounds start to drop. It took me years of working out, panicking because I'd gain a few pounds and starting over again to realize that you just have to live through the first 24 weeks and deal with it. Once you get to week 25 things are looking pretty darn good and by then you have been able to apply many of the principles in this book. It is more about lifestyle changes than \\"I have to be fit in 4 weeks.\\" This book could change your life around, just be patient with yourself and forgive yourself on those days when you break all the rules. The principles are working for me and I'm pretty sure they will work for you. Exercise is key!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Revieworange, banana and apple in one sitting while watching a TV show.

The city is fascinating, troubling and exhausting all at the same time.\\" ~postcard with a picture of the Taj Mahal from a friend who seems to travel a lot lately and was very sweet to send me a postcard<br /><br />I was just about to review \\"Eyewitness Travel Guides: India\\" when a postcard arrived. In a few minutes I had located \\"New Delhi\\" on a map on page 71. I've been fascinated with India since I was very young. My father used to travel to India and bring us back little trinkets and fans and tell us fascinating stories about rickshaws, exotic breads and curry. Later we moved to Africa and learned to make curry and other fascinating foods. My Indian friends taught me how to make Chai tea and even Biryani/Bryani.<br /><br />This book doesn't have any recipes, but it will give you an overview of the foods you could expect to find while traveling. I highly recommend \\"Tandoori\\" anything. Naan and mint chutney are also a favorite.  I also found this book useful while watching the Apu Trilogy. You can look up information about various cities and see where they are located.<br /><br />Features in this Travel Guide:<br /><br />Over 2,400 color photographs<br />Information on mythology, religion, regional food and Mughal palaces<br />Where to find the Tiger Reserves<br />Advice on Local Etiquette<br />Visiting Temples and Going by Rickshaw<br />Cutaways and Major Sights<br />Easy-to-Use Maps and Plans<br />Information on more than 3,000 sights, stores, restaurants, hotels and entertainment venues<br /><br />There are all sorts of intriguing facts. Who knew the popular paisley motif was derived from the shape of the manogo fruit. Calcutta is now Kolkata and you will even find pictures of women picking tea around Darjeeling. Ever wondered what a saffron flower looks like? See page 62. The Buddhist architecture and Hindu Temples have always fascinated me and you can find diagrams and pictures on page 23. Page 24-25 explores the areas of Hindu Mythology and The Great Epic Poems that have had a lasting impact on Indian culture and philosophy. Want to brush up on the History of India? This book is an amazing overview and is so much more than just a travel guide.<br /><br />I am often amazed at how one book leads to another or how you will find common threads within a number of books you just happen to be reading at the same time.

They take an active role as guardians and inner allies, awakening you when you're in danger of falling into destructive behavior.\\" ~Caroline Myss<br /><br />Caroline Myss has created an 80-card deck with an instruction booklet. The informative booklet is essential for understanding the Archetype Cards, however choosing the cards was quite an easy process. Within a few minutes you find all the cards you need to understand which Archetypes are most active in your psyche. This can encourage a greater understanding of who you are and your purpose in life.<br /><br />Everyone has the \\"Child, Victim, Saboteur and Prostitute (not for sale).\\" There are few different \\"child\\" elements to choose from.<br /><br />The booklet explores the meaning of each card, but I really think the cards will jump out at you when you see your inner world unfolding in pictures. When I went through the entire pack for the first time, I ended up with two extra cards. Once I thought about it a bit more, I took out the two extra cards and finally had the correct cards.<br /><br />My cards turned out this way:<br /><br />1. Child - Magical/Innocent Child - Sees the potential for sacred beauty in all things. The belief that everything is possible.<br /><br />2. Victim - This Archetype reveals areas where you might allow yourself to be victimized. Also deals with forming personal boundaries.<br /><br />3. The Saboteur - Fears related to self-esteem that might cause you to block your own empowerment and success.<br /><br />4. Prostitute - Not what you think, but rather it means that you are \\"not for sale.\\" This shows your need to birth your self-esteem.<br /><br />5. Teacher - Love to communicate richness of experience.<br /><br />6. Poet - Finds beauty in life and tries to express soul insights in symbolic language.<br /><br />7. Lover - Passion and devotion to someone or something. (Um, Amazon? lol)<br /><br />8. Goddess - Nature, life force, etc. This can also manifest itself in extreme self-indulgence. Caroline also shows the \\"shadow\\" versions of each Archetype.<br /><br />9. Healer - Transforming pain into healing.<br /><br />10. Damsel - Explores the possibility of succeeding without a knight and looking at romance in a healthy way.<br /><br />11. Angel - A desire to help those in need.<br /><br />12. Artist - Seeing life symbolically. Expressing a dimension of life that is beyond the five senses.<br /><br />After using this card deck to understand my light/dark qualities I can now try to avoid the negative aspects by emphasizing the positive traits. This all makes sense even if you didn't make a sacred contract before arriving on the planet.<br /><br />If you study these cards, you will find yourself analyzing people. Yep, Virgo, that is what we do. I recently told someone not to be such an energy vampire. Although, maybe that is my own inner Vampire making me aware that someone is draining my life force. That was one of the cards I took out of the pack at the start.<br /><br />If you are looking for a companion to the cards: Caroline Myss' Journal of Inner Dialogue will impress you.<br /><br />Caroline has been a part of my \\"birthing of the self\\" in a big way and I think she has some interesting items that are healing and entertaining.<br /><br />Once you find your Archetypes, you can make notes in your journal and really start to understand who you are and why you are walking this earth.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewn also manifest itself in extreme self-indulgence.

Just when she had given up on filling her mystical cup, life took a few turns and found out that the outer world was reflecting her inner world.<br /><br />Carol explores the topics of Family, Death and Beyond, God, Angels, Heaven, Hell, Peace on Earth, Do Not Judge, Giving and Receiving, A Friend on the other side, Little Lessons and From Darkness into Light.<br /><br />Carol has the benefit of being able to do research in her diaries and she has forty-six years of her life recorded in diaries sitting on a huge shelf. All her handwritten books allow her to look at life and analyze her \\"messages from the Universe.\\"<br /><br />While writing this review, I saw and heard the word: \\"Discover.\\" This happens to me all the time and sometimes the words make sentences that are quite meaningful. I had just glanced down to page sixteen when I saw the word and heard it on the radio.<br /><br />Carol explains how you should write down your experiences with synchronicity and even keep a journal. My words are written on scraps of paper and I only have one friend so far who has been able to tell me what some of the sentences mean.<br /><br />While I agree that beauty can grow out of great tragedy, I think each person's experience is going to determine how we view tragedy. Her idea of death and resurrection seemed appropriate even though I'm sure it will be difficult for some to see the beauty in this type of tragedy.<br /><br />A poem by Rumi completes this book and there are quotes by Emily Dickinson and even a story about Emily Dickinson and how she influenced Carol's life.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />P.S.

I was fascinated by the colorful glazes and simplicity of the design. Prinscilla takes clay to new levels of creativity. I love her \\"Earth Dancers, 1998 Mural\\" that shows horses dancing like spirit horses across clay backgrounds. She finds horses visually exciting and loves the image of horses silhouetted against the sky.<br /><br />Prinscilla Hoback started to make bowl forms, pitchers and plates and platters. She fell in love with clay and while working at her mother's restaurant, The Pink Adobe, she learned to make pots. Soon, she was selling sugar bowls, cream pitchers and coffee mugs. As she states, it was a \\"earn as you learn\\" situation.<br /><br />Now she spends her time quarrying her own clay, developing glazes and building high-fire kilns. Her murals depict herds of horses, antelope, buffalo, white deer and migratory wild birds. Her work is a passionate expression of all she loves. Her new passion is writing and she loves gardening and cooking.<br /><br />What I mostly remember about New Mexico is how warm the earth felt on my feet and then there are those hail storms! It seemed very much like Africa to me. There are people who love the scent of the earth where they live and I recognize this love of the earth in Prinscilla. I was amused at how she mixed dirt from her driveway with commercially prepared clay and then started to use native clays.<br /><br />This is truly a fascinating book with creative writing and pictures of the artist's life and loves. There are pictures of her home in Galisteo and she takes the reader on a small tour of the Galisteo basin. If you love pottery, the creative story of the kiln will fascinate you and you might be amused by Prinscilla's humor.<br /><br />The cover is quite beautiful with a burnt orange background of clay and horses dancing playfully on a mural.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewkground of clay and horses dancing playfully on a mural.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-03-03

It happened to me when he was giving a lecture on Public Television and his books have continued to inspire me over the years.

If you are interested in Frank Sepe's life, the introduction gives you an idea of how he became interested in bodybuilding. This book also explores the driving internal forces that lifted Frank to a place of personal power. It does seem that he was able to keep a sense of humor and then set realistic goals. After he started to see his thoughts and goals turning to muscle, he became unstoppable.<br /><br />There are three main sections:<br /><br />Part 1: Getting Ready For The Truth<br />Part 2: The Strength-Training Levels<br />Part 3: Nutrition and The Truth<br /><br />Fans will definitely appreciate the pictures throughout this book, especially the one on page 386. I personally think Frank Sepe's best quality is definitely his eyes, but I was quite willing to also find out all his nutrition tips and detailed exercise instructions. I've read a few fitness books in my life, but this one is a very personal experience. It is truly like having your own trainer.<br /><br />In order to motivate you and get you even more interested, Frank explores the frightening facts. What will happen if you don't get into shape? I'll say that about 6 months ago, I had my own \\"fear factor\\" experience. I realized that walking alone was not going to get me the body I wanted and weights had to be included in my routines on some level. Even adding smaller weights during walking will change the shape of your arms in just a few weeks.<br /><br />The section on fitness myths was amusing and the tips in \\"unleashing your mental power\\" were practical. A fitness journal seems in order. I liked the section on stretching and didn't realize I should be monitoring my heart at all times when doing cardiovascular exercise.<br /><br />There are five levels and Frank describes each one so you can easily figure out if you are at level 1 or 5. The workouts for the various levels give you an idea of where you are at. If you are already walking for 40 minutes about three times a week, then you might be at level 2. After you figure out the level, you can then look up information for cardio and weight work. They are in separate areas of the book, so you can work your way into the weight lifting. Frank gives tips about how many exercises you should be doing and how long you should rest between sets.<br /><br />I found the various levels rather fascinating. My husband already goes to the gym about 4x a week, so he also found this book interesting. Each section has a Program Description, which includes Program Duration, Workout Frequency, Workout Type, Exercises Per Day, Sets of Each Exercise, Repetition Scheme, Rest Between Sets, Daily Warm-Up and Stretching. This is all highly organized and \\"The Actual Exercises\\" are all shown at the back of the book with complete explanations and additional details.<br /><br />The chapter on Nutrition explores various ways to \\"turbo-charge\\" your metabolism. There are tips about eating within an hour of waking up in order to kick start your metabolism for the day and more tips for when to eat after exercise. There are lists of healthy snacks and supplements.<br /><br />Frank Sepe maintains private personal-training clients, writes for leading magazines and is a spokesperson for MET-Rx. This book is a true accomplishment and is a brilliant example of how our minds create our future, one day at a time or shall I say, one fitness level at a time.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewure out if you are at level 1 or 5.

He taught for over 40 years just so he could have summers off to paint while earning enough money to support his family.\\"<br /><br />While many artists moved to New York or Paris, Samuel Rosenberg (1896-1972) stayed in Pittsburgh where he traced the transitions of his neighborhood through his life.<br /><br />Some of Samuel Rosenberg's paintings seem to be more of an expression of the inner world. In \\"Becoming\\" I see the creative dance of a soul and is definitely my favorite painting in this book.<br /><br />This book features eighty-two color reproductions and fifty black-and-white illustrations. \\"Fleeting Substance\\" is also rather stunning. When viewing art from 1941 and 1942, you can hardly believe all the art is created by the same artist. Although, it would be true to say that Rosenberg believed that paintings could reveal both a physical and spiritual reality. So, it seems that as he aged, he became very aware of the spiritual side of life.<br /><br />His work is divided into four periods although the common thread is Rosenberg's emphasis on light. Which I think is especially interesting in \\"Becoming.\\" The more you look at the painting, the more souls appear to be twirling and radiating light. He used sequential layers of translucent color and transparent glazes in order to achieve a shimmering effect. They do remind me of light filtering through stained glass windows.<br /><br />Barbara L. Jones is the curator of the Westmoreland Museum of American Art in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. In this book, she explores Rosenberg's art, his philosophy and dedication to teachings. She also includes quotes from critics of his day in order to give a sense of Rosenberg's critical reception.<br /><br />Jones provides a complete catalog of paintings and preparatory sketches. She also explains how Rosenberg's paintings became increasingly abstract in the last twenty years of his life. This book is really a fascinating study and I'm sure you will find a few paintings that will inspire you.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewpaintings that will inspire you.     ~The Rebecca Review	2004-03-01

We live in a world where our aims and goals, our \\"best-laid plans,\\" and, indeed, our very lives are at the mercy of fortuitous chance and inscrutable contingency.\\"<br /><br />Nicholas Rescher has written a book on luck that makes me feel lucky to have a dictionary close at hand. Conceptual analysis takes this topic to an entirely new level as we discover a \\"philosophy of luck.\\"<br /><br />I almost imagined this book would have seven chapters, but there are definitely nine:<br /><br />Enigmas of Chance<br /><br />Failures and Foresight<br />The Different Faces of Luck<br />An Infinity of Accidents<br />Visions of Sugarplums<br />The Philosophers of Gambling<br />The Musings of Moralists<br />Can the Tiger Be Tamed?<br />Life in a Halfway House.<br /><br />I have always been taught that there is no such thing as luck all while finding that there are many people who do seem \\"luckier\\" than others. Is this due to the correct choices they made or are they really just \\"lucky?\\"<br /><br />Nicholas Rescher has an interest in the human condition and begins his book with a rather startling story, which we would not necessarily consider to have anything to do with luck, although a city is saved by \\"clouds.\\"<br /><br />Why is life so unfair for some and so nurturing for others?<br /><br />How is luck expressed in other languages and why is it that no European language has a single-word expression for \\"a piece of good luck.\\"<br /><br />What is the difference between being unfortunate and unlucky?<br /><br />Is bad luck ever lucky and can luck thrive on vulnerability?<br /><br />After delving into the meaning of words, Nicholas Rescher delves into mythology, Epicurean philosophy, physics, historical predictability, superstition and iconography. Occasionally he throws in casual, yet humorous comments, like one about how we are probably \\"lucky\\" just to be alive, considering the hazards of life itself. After my favorite cat suddenly got sick and died on the last Friday the 13th, I have started to wonder about the luck of cats on Friday the 13th. Although, our vet said that he had an underlying condition, which suddenly emerged and life can definitely feel \\"unlucky.\\" Needless to say, feeling unlucky can make one rather angry or you can try to flow with life's challenges.<br /><br />Is it really \\"luck\\" that causes us to meet someone or read a book or watch a movie? Or, are we sending out thoughts into the universe and creating our own realities. Does \\"luck\\" have more to do with our own decisions or with a random ubiquitous force? I did like the idea on page 22 where the author explores the possibilities of putting yourself in luck's way. As he says, you will never win the lottery if you fail to obtain a ticket. Even though I think most would be luckier if they chose to invest the money they were spending on the lottery tickets. His ideas about how relying on luck courts disaster seemed very logical.<br /><br />All I am left thinking is \\"You've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya punk?\\" My husband knows exactly how to say this and makes me laugh every time he remembers how Clint Eastwood says this line! I'll admit, sometimes I feel pretty lucky to be married to someone who makes me laugh.<br /><br />Nicholas Rescher has an interesting and highly intellectual writing style, which at times spins your mind off into unexplored territory. You might feel lucky to have this book with you when you are in the mood to immerse yourself in philosophical musing.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewng condition, which suddenly emerged and life can definitely feel \\"unlucky.\\" Needless to say, feeling unlucky can make one rather angry or you can try to flow with life's challenges.

To make your workout more comfortable, try putting a folded towel in the center of your mat and keep a blanket or comforter nearby for the final relaxation stage.<br /><br />The poses are featured on one side of the cards, while the sketches and explanations give more detailed information on the other. When I first saw \\"yoga flashcards\\" I can't say I was overly enthusiastic about the idea, but now I love this method.

In \\"Rising in Love\\" Love itself becomes our home, it is who we are, it is what we are climbing towards. In fact, Love does make you feel that you are living on a higher plane of existence, so instead of saying you are \\"falling into love,\\" Alan presents the idea that you are \\"Rising in Love.\\"<br /><br />Alan Cohen's books are peaceful, calming journeys and I feel comforted by the style in which he writes and his observations about life are always amusing. There is a very intimate feeling while reading this particular book. Alan's books also tend to be signposts to awaken me to various aspects I should be paying attention to in my own life. I find it interesting that Alan was talking about a movie that I had literally just found and was about to watch. Of course, I will be paying very close attention to what that movie has to teach me.<br /><br />I'm not sure why I think Alan Cohen's humor is so hilarious, I just imagine him in the situations he describes and I get lost in laughter. There is a deep richness to his experiences and his books present a setting of intellectual intimacy in which his thoughts intertwine with the reader's own inner knowledge. I have at times found myself writing poetry after reading chapters in this book.<br /><br />Rising in Love is divided into five main sections:<br /><br />The Awakening - Alan remembers when he first fell in love and how he learned to love life itself. At times I wasn't sure if Alan was writing a moment of comedy on page 5 or was truly describing how he felt. Either way, I was amused. If you wanted to know some of the details of Alan's life, this is the book to start with and Alan freely explores his life experiences in order to encourage understanding and an awareness of your own experience with synchronicity.<br /><br />Who We Are - Alan draws on ideas from movies to explore the ideas of how we are spiritual beings experiencing a material existence. He explores the idea of being born in innocence. If we are born into innocence why do we need to be rescued from the abyss? Alan only touches on a few spiritual principles here and it will probably make readers want to find out more on the subject of the original state of mankind. Are we naturally good or naturally prone to selfish desires?  This section of the book is interspersed with quotes and interesting principles in a bold type.<br /><br />Growing Into Greatness - The story of the \\"Butterfly\\" is a powerful statement about how you can expect greatness from others and how they will rise to the occasion and meet the challenge. I actually like how Alan uses the word \\"God\\" instead of \\"Universal Consciousness\\" because it makes this book more personal. This section of the book explores how you can go through a period of \\"emptiness\\" in order to reach a stage where your life becomes richer. I loved Alan's ideas about how we throw rocks into the water and then wonder why we can't escape the waves and this is an interesting way of explaining karma.  He explains \\"tough love\\" as \\"what is required to break a habit that is working against our highest interest.\\" The Mustang GT story is rather amusing. It is quite amazing how Alan can draw spiritual wisdom out of the most negative or hopeless situations.<br /><br />Living in Light - Alan explores the idea of getting what you want by knowing what you want and declaring your intention. Then, you accept opportunities and work with responsibility and confidence. Instead of just saying we should declare our intention, he does recognize human effort and in this way we as humans are not completely helpless in the Divine plan. There is a picture of how our thoughts create our experience and the contrast of negatives vs. positive thinking is rather stark.Does negative thinking block blessings?<br /><br />Coming Home - This section starts with a quote by Albert Einstein that leads into a discussion about the sacredness of the words: \\"I love you.\\" Alan shows how he found greater freedom in being more open in love and changed from loving only those who loved him to loving even those who were not lovable.<br /><br />Rising in Love is a boost to your self-confidence all while making you feel humble and more willing to try to love unconditionally. All I can say is \\"falling in love\\" seems much easier than \\"Rising in Love.\\" Although after reading this book, I'm starting to think that the difficulties in our life stem from blocking the flow of love. Perhaps living \\"as\\" love is really the goal. When you start listening to the signs and moving in various loving directions, there are invisible forces that start to work together for the good of those you help or encourage.<br /><br />~The Rebecca ReviewThis section starts with a quote by Albert Einstein that leads into a discussion about the sacredness of the words: \\"I love you.\\" Alan shows how he found greater freedom in being more open in love and changed from loving only those who loved him to loving even those who were not lovable.

A critical part of social intelligence is what psychologists Peter Salovey and John Mayer term emotional intelligence - the ability to perceive, express, understand, and manage emotions. Emotionally intelligent people are self-aware. ~David Myers<br /><br />Intuition is often defined as \\"knowing something without rational thought.\\" It can be your danger radar (an apprehensive feeling), help you create a new recipe or even help you play the piano. Creative types often tap into and trust intuition. Since women tend to use the right side of their brain more than men, this might explain why women tend to be especially intuitive.<br /><br />Apparently Intuition also has a risky side. David Myers draws on classic and contemporary cognitive science to show us why intuition can provide us with creative insights or can be dangerously misleading. Apparently we fall prey to memory construction and we can misjudge our future feelings and behavior.<br /><br />David delves into three main areas:<br /><br />The Powers of Intuition<br />The Perils of Intuition<br />Practical Intuition<br /><br />I love David Myer's intelligent writing style and how he makes the complex completely understandable. I was fascinated by his explanation of left vs. right brain and was amused by the C.S. Lewis quote about cats.<br /><br />If you have any interest in experiments, you will be in science heaven in this book. I also enjoyed the little experiment you can try with words on page 58. I didn't agree with the experiment on page 70 because I truly believe women's moods do follow cycles although I'm quite willing to agree that passions can infiltrate our intuitions and that in general \\"we see things as we are.\\" I also questioned the findings after the subliminal self-help experiment because I have found that they work for me.<br /><br />David Myers presents practical examples from the real world all while appealing to your analytical self. He explains how we have two kinds of memory and two levels of attitudes. It seems to me that one is leading us in a moment-by-moment dance with life while the other is almost like music that subconsciously leads the dance steps. Parts of this memory explanation helped me to understand why I sometimes read a book, go to sleep and then awaken and my mind is already writing the review. Since the mind keeps working while we sleep it is helpful to remember dreams.<br /><br />If you have any interest in healing, you might find chapter nine to be quite enlightening. This chapter includes information on EMDR, SAD and Therapeutic touch. I think it might work in some cases purely because it is calming and nurturing and we do heal faster when we feel that someone is concerned about our health. Experiments are interesting, but personal experience might convince us otherwise.<br /><br />David also delves into psychic intuition, although he shows a lot of skepticism because he is working from a scientific premise. He discusses the issue of \\"evidence for the divine within us\\" but states that we are not exactly omniscient, omnipresent or omnipotent. I am not sure that the \\"god in me\\" is exactly \\"that type\\" of god. I think it means that I am able to create my world and have god-like powers in various areas of my existence.<br /><br />There have been times when I've guessed cash register receipts before the cashier told me the bill. How did that happen? I've had friends who completed my sentences and I've thought words that were then said by a friend just before I was going to say them. There is definitely another level of awareness that reaches beyond scientific explanation. Or is this explained by intuition itself? Was my mind secretly calculating all the prices while<br />I was shopping? This has intrigued me because you can't make those types of things happen. Why do they happen?<br /><br />Recently a friend was looking at a number while on the phone and I said the number. So, we had a good laugh. I also hear/see words at the same time andsometimes they make up sentences and this particular friend has the ability to analyze and make sense of things I don't yet understand. They are living on a higher level and I'm acting more like a receiver, while they are able to comprehend the meanings. It is fascinating to me. It is always intriguing to watch invisible forces at work.<br /><br />It is interesting that in this particular book you will find some images from The Art of Optical Illusions. When I reviewed the book back in October, 2000 I had a feeling that David Myers and Al Seckel might have some similar interests and did a bit of networking. Al Seckel is one of the world's leading authorities on illusions and designs interactive illusion and perception galleries for science museums. I had a feeling that a drawing from Al Seckel's book was going to appear in this book on intuition. How is that for being intuitive? ;)<br /><br />You may also be interested in reading: The Intuitive Way: A guide to Living from Inner Wisdom by Penney Peirce. Deepak Chopra also has some interesting ideas on this subject in his book: The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success because he encourages you to pay attention to how your body is processing information when making decisions.<br /><br />I love the part of intuition that gives you shivers. It seems you can almost figure out who is going to win on American Idol by who gives you the most shivers. LaToya's voice really gave me quite a few shivers so I'll keep paying attention. Maybe that is intuition or maybe it is just an appreciation for beauty. Still there does seem to be some correlation.<br /><br />Ironically, the more intuitive you are, the more you might disagree with some of the scientific data in this book. Overall it is an excellent read, but not much is left to chance and the unexplained is after all, mostly unexplainable.<br /><br />Why do all the books I'm reading one after the other mention \\"Luke Skywalker?\\"<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewake sense of things I don't yet understand.

It is always encouraging when I start laughing while reading the preface and introduction. It is also quite rare to find a complete explanation for exactly why an author has written a book.<br /><br />I was especially interested in the \\"Deepak Chopra\\" topic in small print and the \\"ENLIGHTENED PERSPECTIVE\\" in caps although I didn't quite understand some of the unnecessary comments on page 15 until I had reached the end of the page and figured that maybe this was an oversight. Chip also discusses elements of popular culture and throws in a bit of humor here and there to amuse the reader. Overall, this does seem to be a creative exploration of life itself.<br /><br />Philosophy of a Dashboard Saint is a rare find and exactly the type of book I love finding. Chip Fraser not only encourages you to develop your own philosophy, he encourages you to develop a deeper level of contemplation in order to navigate your life into a more positive future. You won't agree with everything, but isn't that half the fun of reading? There is a definite play between the creative thoughts of the authors and your own philosophy.<br /><br />Philosophy of a Dashboard Saint is not only entertaining; it will encourage you to improve your life.

Each card shows art that was chosen purely for its archetypal quality and classical style. The interpretation of the images are meant to encourage your own intuitive wisdom.<br /><br />The 50-card deck and small booklet are all you need to get started. The cards are divided into five key life areas: Fertility & Creativity, Partnership, Nurturance/Self-Care, Self-Expression, Enlightened Heart & Mind. These areas are clearly marked at the top of each card and the cards are color coded into pastel green, pink, yellow, blue and violet.<br /><br />Each life area is divided into developmental steps which are represented on the ten different cards.<br /><br />To use the cards you look at the image and then refer to the booklet for additional information as needed.<br /><br />Of course I was a little freaked out when the first card I picked was the  \\"Risk vs. Safety\\" card which might have something to do with all the messages floating my way in books and here we find someone jumping out into the unknown. I set out the \\"How to use your creativity optimally\\" reading. The first card is supposed to tell me what I've learned about myself so far. I picked Fertility & Creativity VI Risk vs. Safety. Then, the second card is about what you are learning now and I found Nurturance/Self-Care V. Perfection vs. Imperfection. Then Card three is about your next step and that said: \\"Channel clearly.\\" Then, onward to card 4 where it speaks of how I can create value for myself and others: \\"Prepare.\\" The last card is supposed to show my Highest purpose and it says: \\"Complete and Move On.\\"<br /><br />Then, you can look in the booklet to see the deeper meanings of the images on the cards. All the artwork is rather beautiful and the cards are in themselves works of art. I was very pleased to find the \\"Art Credits\\" because otherwise I would have been eternally wondering who painted each picture, etc.<br /><br />From the cards I picked out I started to understand more about birthing new projects and seeing if creations will fly on their own. Am I being told that I am supposed to jump out into the unknown in some way? The third card was quite meaningful in that it explored the possibility of creating something of value for others that uplifts and assists them in their daily life. The fourth card seems to be saying I should make more time for exercise. The last card shows a woman sitting and reading beautiful books and is a painting by Bernardino Pinturicchio.<br /><br />The entire process of being inspired by the cards is a highly personal one and all the cards really seem to do is bring elements to the surface of your mind. I found that it was very easy to figure out what the cards were saying because the booklet was helpful and the pictures made complete sense. Basically you are using the cards as mirrors to reflect unconscious patterns to your conscious mind. I was very impressed with the first results of using this card set, although they were a bit too accurate. ;)<br /><br />You also get an education in art while you are being playful and intuitive.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewry pleased to find the \\"Art Credits\\" because otherwise I would have been eternally wondering who painted each picture, etc.     From the cards I picked out I started to understand more about birthing new projects and seeing if creations will fly on their own.

By mixing the 10 main ingredients of success into your life, you will see your dreams jump off the pages of your journal and come to life. Not only are you encouraged to start a journal, the authors offer questions that will inspire answers that will then lead you to your dreams.<br /><br />Cook and Sholander have been studying the lives of successful dreamers for years and through their research they identified ten key characteristics for success. They interviewed hundreds of people to find the elements of \\"Dream CPR.\\"<br /><br />Not only is this book very well organized, the main points are examined and present a powerful roadmap for success. With a journal, the inspiration in this book and your own dreams, you will be equipped with the knowledge to fulfill your dreams. If you have forgotten the dreams that once inspired you, this book may awaken the sleeping dreams and buried longings.<br /><br />While reading \\"Dream It Do It,\\" all I could think was: \\"If these individuals could see their dreams come true, I can also make my dreams a reality.\\" I enjoyed reading the true-life example of Barbara Walters' persistence and was amazed by the resilience Maya Angelou has shown in her life.<br /><br />What sustained the dreamers in this book?<br />Who were their mentors?<br />How can you put effective strategies into practice?<br /><br />These questions are all answered in \\"Dream It Do It.\\" It is not enough to say that you should just do something. Where do you start? The authors present some of the main principles of success by giving examples of effective strategies. They show where the dreamers found their inspiration and at times, this information will surprise you. I was amazed at how Maya Angelou created beauty out of pain.<br /><br />While many may say that success is a result of luck, this book proves otherwise. There are definite steps you need to take to see your dreams become a reality. Success does take effort. However, if you love what you do, you just flow with life and create your desired existence.<br /><br />A dream does not need to be just a cloud that floats around in the world of desire.

I gave them my most winning \\"Please take me home\\" look, right before licking their outstretched hands. ~Vanity<br /><br />Diary of a Santa Fe Cat defies categorization. Is this a diary or an engaging celebration of the life of a contented kitten? Peggy Van Hulsteyn and Jacquelyn Quintana have created an unforgettable treat for all cat lovers, pun aficionados and anyone who has visited Santa Fe.<br /><br />Vanity the cat is a delight from the first page. We find her being whisked away in a car to the animal shelter. Vanity is not amewsed by this car ride and from the first page she shows her delicate breeding and sybaritic tendencies. Not only does this cat know she is the cutest cat around; she is determined to show her intellect, all while curbing her instinctive tendencies to pounce upon mice the moment they appear.<br /><br />Can I just say that by page six I was already laughing and the story had just begun on page five. By page seven I was nearing a point of no return and could not stop laughing. I think the comment about the \\"petting zoo\\" really got me. You will see why.<br /><br />The art is rather whimsical and evokes definite emotional responses. You can really see Vanity's personality in all the artwork.<br /><br />Vanity reads Vanity \\"Fur\\" and dines on such delights as \\"Salmon enchiladas with Chanterelles and sorrel sauce.\\" What is not to love? This cat is a lover of gourmet food and she knows how to dress for dinner.<br /><br />My favorite diary entries included, Abandoned, Rescued and In the New Adobe Abode. The Adventures to the Cat Spa were also quite creative. I loved the observation about writers and the picture of Vanity prancing across the keyboard all while wearing glasses.<br /><br />As Vanity discusses various occasions you can't help thinking that she reminds you of a cat you know. In fact, she rather reminded me of my own Princess Sasha who definitely considers us to be \\"her\\" pets and not the other way around.<br /><br />When reading this book, you may find yourself suspended between hilarity and more hilarity. Fortunately Peggy gives the reader some time to breathe before she catapults you into more laughter.<br /><br />Either Peggy Van Hulsteyn was a cat in her past life or this was defiantly written<br />by Vanity the Cat herself.

Some are as fragile and as thin as leaves maturing in autumn. Some are white with the scent of ink still traceable waiting to be read and turned, unfolding a new passage. ~Tascha Dresser<br /><br />Tascha Dresser wrote her first poem at the early age of 12 and continues to write poems about all the experiences in her life. These beautiful poems have evolved from a deep place within her soul where she has fought to overcome life's obstacles.<br /><br />To read her poems is to understand the frustration of a highly intelligent woman who has fought overwhelming odds to climb from the closet of her past just to feel the sun on her face and to finally recognize that people who struggle to learn at an early age have rights that are protected by law. They deserve to be loved and they deserve to succeed.<br /><br />Tascha's poems show a depth of emotional intelligence I've rarely seen in poetry. This is the cry of her soul for equal treatment in an unfair world. Yet, even in the darkness of her disappointment over how the world treats her in her childhood, she shows a beautiful appreciation for what is right about her life. There are poems about love, dreams, friendship and being human.<br /><br />Tascha begins with a poem about a star emerging inside her. She knows that she has value and gifts to give the world. Yet, this star waits for the right time to shine. She knows she has the power to change attitudes by showing her experiences, the depths of her despair, her longings and especially her desires for a better future for all the children who are trapped in the closet of disbelief. We all have the same basic needs and should never be denied the pleasure of a dream. I found the images of \\"stars\\" throughout the book to be quite interesting.<br /><br />The visual images of a star rising from Tascha's soul in \\"Emerging\\" are only a small taste of the metaphors Tascha paints across the canvas of your mind. In one poem, \\"Hate\\" becomes a wild horse with icy breath and blood red eyes. She takes this image and in \\"The Horse, Part II\\" she expands on the idea and beautiful paints images of hearts disappearing in the distance. Then in \\"The Horse - A Warning,\\" we learn the final result of the ride on the horse called \\"Hate.\\" The images will remain in your mind long after your heart has comprehended the meaning and understood the implications of allowing hate into your life.<br /><br />As images of pain turn into power, many of the poems will be understood by anyone who has been through a terrible night of the soul and survived to see the first light of day. There is power in survival and Tascha Dresser's poems speak of a woman who has passionately struggled through a situation where she was denied basic human rights.<br /><br />The impressions of her struggle are quite vivid when woven into the poems of the closet. I will never forget the powerful images in \\"Who's in the Closet?\\"<br /><br />For me, this poem explains the true purpose of \\"Coming Out of the Closet and Breaking the Chains.\\" People are starving for love, understanding, attention and affection. But we lock people away by not listening to them, by verbally abusing them, not believing in them or by not seeing them for who they truly are and all while people are starving for kindness.<br /><br />This book of poems is not only about life's challenges; it is also an expression of all the emotions everyone feels during the cycle of life. Who were we when we were born, who have we become and what will we become, even after we die. Tascha's emotions range from deep sorrow over the state of the world to a high level of frustration because she can see the solutions so clearly, yet others seem blind to her pain.<br /><br />Very few poems contain blatant anger (Like in \\"Not At This Time\\"), but when they do, she uses this emotion to awaken you to a new level of awareness. An awareness where you hope that these poems will encourage us all to react more diplomatically and be more sensitive to the needs of people who need our support and love.<br /><br />In \\"What Words Can't Explain\\" I understood the lines about wishing people could read between the lines because at times even words cannot express your true feelings. In \\"I'm A Diamond,\\" we meet an individual who always throws \\"diamonds in the dirt\\" and recognize how the inability to see beauty traps people in their own game.<br /><br />\\"Coming Out of the Closet and Breaking the Chains\\" is a collection of poems I really needed to read because I needed to let Tascha's words mingle with my own thoughts about the state of the world and about the need for all of us to show more love. By reading her poems, I will now see the world with new eyes because if Tascha could survive her past, then all of us can survive the daily challenges we face.<br /><br />Tascha's life was not a life any child deserved and I hope that her poems will inspire a deeper awareness of how children who struggle to learn, truly view their lives. I cried three times while reading this book. I am so proud of Tascha for writing these poems and for sharing her experiences so we can all become kinder, more beautiful human beings.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewsupport and love.

Unfortunately, in traditional compilations, finding just the right phrase to illustrate such themes can be very difficult.\\" ~Leslie Ann Gibson<br /><br />As a casual quote collector, I take an interest in any and all books of quotations. I found over 22 quotes I wanted to collect. Leslie has organized the quotes in a rather comprehensive manner. These quotes are written by, for, or about women.<br /><br />If you are reading through this book, you will find some repeated quotes under a variety of headings. This becomes useful if you are adding quotes to your writing or to lecture notes. I only noticed because I read quote books from cover to cover in one sitting.<br /><br />This book is divided into three main sections:<br /><br />Finding Fulfillment<br />Developing Positive Habits<br />Achieving Your Goals<br /><br />You will then find quotes organized into themed sections which are again organized into groups. Yes, this is a very organized book.<br /><br />The content pages are helpful for finding just the quote you are looking for and the Index is helpful for looking up quotes by your favorite authors, philosophers, artists, leaders, actors and other famous personalities.<br /><br />I enjoyed finding quotes by Katharine Hepburn, Rose Franken, Elizabeth Bowen, Julia Child, Ingrid Bergman, Agnes Repplier, Lucy Stone and Eleanor Roosevelt.<br /><br />\\"You must do the thing you cannot do.\\" ~Eleanor Roosevelt<br /><br />I also loved the quote by Louise Driscall: \\"Within your heart, keep one still, secret spot where dreams may go.\\"<br /><br />Under \\"Finding Fulfillment\\" you will find quotes for welcoming joy into your life or discovering your strengths.

This book is filled with ideas on how you can immediately transform your relationship from a cold grave to a peaceful island resort. Perhaps you want to change your life into an amazing adventure or you want to calm the storms.<br /><br />Gary Chapman presents five love languages. One of these languages may be your primary love language, but he takes it further and explores the dialects of love. I think that many of us want all five languages, but there are various ways each can be expressed.<br /><br />Gary explains the five languages in detail and finally you will understand why some people don't respond to your gifts and others go wild with happy kitten joy. When you meet someone who shares your primary language it can feel like you have entered a magical country where everyone is speaking your language.<br /><br />For some individuals, \\"words of encouragement\\" will be much higher on their list than \\"the show of love through gifts\\" or \\"acts of service.\\"<br /><br />I had trouble deciding which language was my favorite, but I know I get a bit happy when I receive gifts. However, I noticed that I never complain about not receiving gifts. Gary actually made it easier to figure out when he started to talk about what you complain about most. I normally say: \\"You are not listening to me.\\"<br /><br />While I enjoy gifts, I'm never demanding in this area. So then I considered \\"Quality Time.\\" Bingo, I was very concerned about \\"Quality Conversation.\\" There is definitely \\"bliss\\" in \\"sympathetic dialogue.\\" This is actually a rare thing indeed. When you talk to people, most of the time they are more worried about what they are going to say next and when you find someone who actually listens to what you are saying and responds in a way that makes you feel understood, that is bliss.<br /><br />So, I was very happy to have discovered my primary love language and I also figured out why people in my life don't always respond to gifts in the way I think they would. Some do and they will be getting more boxes of homemade cookies, for sure. ;)<br /><br />Gary does bring out various aspects of love that make you realize that love is not just a happy feeling of infatuation. It was interesting to read about how long the initial bliss stage lasts in most relationships and then to read about the decline and divorce rates for first, second and third marriages.<br /><br />There are examples in this book that present great hope for marriages that have grown cold or are on the rocks. Even one partner can read this book and change their relationship.<br /><br />There is a study guide at the end of the book and the questions can be used at home or in a class setting.<br /><br />\\"The Five Love Languages\\" is an essential book for marriage counselors, couples and anyone who wants to figure out how their partner responds to various forms of love.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviews bliss.

That is when you may notice a sense of soul-starvation, illness, a lack of energy, depression and a list of other negative factors appearing in your life. At about this time, you start to feel that your life \\"sucks.\\"<br /><br />Self-help guru Alan H. Cohen has written a comforting book to show you the 10 reasons why your life might suck and to present a roadmap to leave your past hell and enter a future life filled with triumph instead of tragedy. Through Alan Cohen's message I realized that everything I needed was inside me and lately I've learned how to listen to my heart and not just my head.<br /><br />I really had a good time laughing out loud throughout this inspiring book. Not only does Alan Cohen speak to you as a friend, he adds a witty touch to reality checks. You can't help laughing along and enjoying this entire reading experience.<br /><br />The book is divided into 10 main sections, which include such topics as: \\"You Give Your Power Away,\\" \\"You Say Yes When You Mean No,\\" and \\"You Forgot to Enjoy the Ride.\\"<br /><br />I enjoy Alan's love of quotes and his thoughts have been inspiring me for years when I heard them on the \\"Dave 'til Dawn\\" show on the radio. After going through a few months of deep soul searching I knew it was time to read all of Alan's books. I needed a reality check, but in a manner that was comforting and healing.<br /><br />There is an amazing rescue story in this book and an interesting perspective on how you can lose weight. Now I realize why yoga can be great for weight loss. Alan really answered a lot of my questions in \\"Why Your Life Sucks.\\" He also captures profound ideas in one sentence.<br /><br />\\"Wherever you go, you will find yourself.\\" ~Alan H. Cohen<br /><br />Although I agreed with 99% of the advice in this book, I am not so willing to eternally responsible for agreeing that there is no heaven or hell. I found it interesting that Alan was quoting a few scriptures but had rejected those two ideas. Then he got me interested in looking up additional books. There are quotes from many religions and also from a variety of sources throughout this book. It is not a religious book, but will definitely help you along in your spiritual path. Alan is against guilt trips and in favor of a feeling of freedom and acceptance.<br /><br />Alan goes beyond commonsense and shows you how to live in an enlightened reality. He encourages the reader to take care of the body and soul.<br /><br />I also loved his descriptions of his life in Hawaii. I will continue to dream about night-blooming jasmine and clouds that turn pink at sunset.<br /><br />You might also enjoy reading:<br /><br />The Wisdom of the Heart<br />The Dragon Doesn't Live Here Anymore<br />The Peace That You Seek<br />A Deep Breath of Life<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewwilling to eternally responsible for agreeing that there is no heaven or hell.

I love the ideas especially writing \\"secret codes\\" only your lover could crack or delivering items to your lover that he/she has to wear to dinner.<br /><br />Seductive Starters: Getting Warmed Up - Diane shows you how to create a mood for love and her idea about the tablecloth and rose petals could help you discover the pleasures of finger foods. There are recipes for Artichokes with Warm Vinaigrette, Chile Lime Shrimp, Lover's Purses and the delicious Endive, Orange and Fennel Salad.<br /><br />The Main Event: Seduction Dinners - Imagine dining on Baked Cod with Shitake Mashed Potatoes and Shitake Sauce or Cornish Game Hens with Orange, Ginger and Soy Sauce. Baked Salmon with Raspberry Cabernet Sauce is one of the most interesting recipes I've tried in this cookbook. Shallots, raspberry preserves and Cabernet Sauvignon make a syrupy sauce to coat the salmon.<br /><br />Seduction on the Side - Looking for zesty and provocative side dishes? Try the Broccoli in Orange Chile Oil that has a sauce you pour over steamed broccoli. The Green Basmati Rice is actually one of my favorite seduction secrets. I think it is the garlic. This recipe alone proved this book works.<br /><br />Sweet Seduction: Desserts for Debauchery - If you love marscarpone cheese, the recipe for stuffed strawberries takes this creamy, dreamy cheese to new levels. Poached pears are drenched in a cardamom ginger sauce. Broiled Plums with Lemon Sorbet could not be easier and you have to try the honeydew recipe.<br /><br />If you are looking for one sexy recipe for honeydew, it is in this cookbook. I made it twice in two days and plan to make it once a week. At first I was skeptical about the combination of rosemary and honeydew melon, but now I'm a believer. The syrupy sauce coating the melon is quite interesting and almost tingles on your tongue. I used vermouth but you can use a sweet white wine of your choice. Honeydew does soak up the syrup rather well, but I also love the syrup with other melons like cantaloupe. Imagine feeding your lover little slices or balls of melon dripping with an intoxicating syrup.<br /><br />Late Night Seduction Snacks - Orange slices and Strawberries dipped in chocolate syrup or Toasted Cinnamon Raisin Bread with Cream Cheese are two of the ideas.<br /><br />The Morning After: Breakfasts to Rekindle the Passion - Want to impress your lover with your \\"omelet\\" making skills? There are some delicious fillings too. Do Banana Pancakes with Caramelized Walnuts sound worth waking up for and how about serving breakfast with a seduction smoothie made from mangoes, strawberries and lemon yogurt. Diane even shows you how to make your own Chai Tea. There are also some \\"quickie\\" breakfast ideas like warm croissants with preserves.<br /><br />Seduction Scenarios: Menus to Make the Mood - You will find Menus for: Valentine's Day, Romance of Italy, Indian Spice, Late Night Fireside Supper, Bewitching Bedroom Brunch and Decadent Dessert Orgy.<br /><br />Seduction Staples - Diane shows you how to toast spices, purchase the freshest shellfish and roast peppers. Oh, and the all important... how to whip cream with vanilla and powdered sugar.<br /><br />Grow an Erotic Herb Garden - Imagine your garden bursting with fresh herbs, especially rosemary, lavender and basil.<br /><br />If you want to end up under the table, somewhere near the table or drifting towards the bedroom after dinner, this is your book. You might even want to eat dinner in bed or while reclining on velvet pillows in a room filled with candles.<br /><br />This is one sexy cookbook!

Sometimes you literally do feel \\"stuck in a continuing pattern of negativity.\\" Now, I'm a naturally positive person at heart and I tend to agree with Dr. Joy Browne when she says that there are ways to solve any problem. I also agree that you make your worst decisions when you are not feeling good about yourself. Once you learn how to boost your self-esteem, you can gain more control over all aspects of your life.<br /><br />That might mean that you give up unrealistic fantasies about how you imagine your life to be. While you can create the life of your dreams, there is room for a reality check. You can literally become your own worst enemy.<br /><br />Dr. Joy Browne presents an 8-step program to encourage a change in perspective, show you how to overcome negative life patters and show you that your failures may be blessings in disguise. It took me about 6 years to understand the \\"failure is a blessing\\" tip, but hey, I finally got it and decided to stop being a victim of a universal conspiracy that was definitely trying to destroy my life.<br /><br />Through this book you will learn to analyze your life. Through analysis you can determine what is not working. Once you admit that something is not working, you have a base from which to work. Dr. Joy Browne believes that solutions do exist, but they must be found and applied to be useful. Solutions should also be feasible.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading her 13 ways to remain stuck in negative thinking. While humorous, they are very true. I now believe that may of us enjoy being in pain because otherwise we would find faster solutions to our problems. Playing the role of victim allows us to release responsibility for our lives.<br /><br />\\"Without this ability to see alternatives, you're left seeing yourself as either victim or victimizer, which leaves you stuck in a miserable place.\\" ~Dr. Joy Browne<br /><br />Throughout this book, problems are presented and analyzed. You won't believe the situations people have gotten themselves into. Page 153 is just a nightmare situation that I can't believe even happened. However, even in the worst situation, there are solutions. Walking away from a problem is sometimes the best solution. You can't solve everything in life because often the people in your life won't agree with your solution. There is a limit to how much a human should have to endure.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading about the breathing techniques to alleviate stress and was pleased to read that Dr. Joy Browne is taking yoga classes. Yes, with all the problems she deals with, she needs yoga. Yoga also gives you a new perspective on your life and if you haven't tried it yet, it could be a solution to a hundred problems you can't solve. By doing yoga, you connect with your deeper self and can deal with problems in a more rational manner. Instead of panicking over situations, you view them from a distance without as much attachment. I love how she advises you to just turn off the TV, Phone, Radio, etc. This is what I have to do at times. I need my yoga time!<br /><br />\\"Getting Unstuck\\" presents solutions for impossible situations. I enjoyed Dr. Joy Browne's wit and realistic solutions. She is a licensed clinical psychologist who hosts her own internationally syndicated daily radio show.<br /><br />One of the best lines in this book: \\"If what you're doing isn't working for you, stop doing it.\\"  Persistence definitely does not always lead to pleasure.<br /><br />I still believe that self-centeredness is the cause of all the problems in the world and self-sacrifice is the solution to many problems. Living that way does seem impossible, but if you can try to be less selfish, you start to see more beauty in your life. There is definitely beauty in sacrifice of the self, within reason. Selfishness has rarely brought me happiness and normally leaves me stuck in a bog of despair.<br /><br />Dr. Joy Browne helps you to avoid the bogs. She encourages you to take the higher path, think about your life in a realistic way and set realistic goals. I'm always interested in people's names and how they relate to their vocations. Dr. \\"JOY\\" speaks volumes. If you want more joy in your life, this book will show you how to chase down joy through making better choices.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewlfishness has rarely brought me happiness and normally leaves me stuck in a bog of despair.

One sentence can inspire a new direction and a phrase can transform your existence. When we are struggling with decisions it is often the wise words of a friend that saves us from making the wrong choice.<br /><br />Dr. Wayne W. Dyer's thoughts have always been an inspiration to me and I see them as meaningful messages for a hurting planet. There is so much pain in life, but there is also the possibility of living in pure joy.<br /><br />I still love thinking about this quote: \\"You are not a human being having a spiritual experience. You are a spiritual being having a human experience.\\"<br /><br />What an empowering thought.<br /><br />This book is filled with inspiring ideas that refocus your attention on how things actually are instead of how you thought they originally should be. On the surface we may feel that we are drowning in life's challenges, but when you think of yourself as an eternal soul, problems melt away and you view your life from an eternal perspective. This doesn't mean that you don't deal with anguish and sorrow, but you deal with it from a new perspective. Life becomes a blink of the eye in the light of an eternal existence.<br /><br />I love how Dr. Dyer explains forgiveness as an act of self-love because when you forgive you simply don't have to carry the problem around with you.<br /><br />Dr. Dyer is really stating what our souls already know to be true. He just says everything so brilliantly. Lately, I've been contemplating his advice about loving those who are difficult to love. I am thinking about his statement about loving and his statement about \\"the more you give away, the more you get back.\\"<br /><br />A few of the quotes in this book made me laugh out loud. Dr. Dyer is not always serious and can actually be rather playful in his use of words.<br /><br />Words can be used as powerful weapons to destroy or they can bring great beauty to our lives. I see beauty in Dr. Wayne Dyer's revelation of inner wisdom. I seem to think about his words at least once a day, especially when I start to think negatively. I am just a soul trying to live in this body that ties me to the earth. One day I won't live here anymore and it is empowering to think of myself as an eternal being temporarily in this school of life.<br /><br />\\"You create your thoughts, your thoughts create your intentions, and your intentions create your reality.\\" ~Dr. Wayne W. Dyer<br /><br />I'm working on this one! However lately I've noticed that my \\"invisible and silent\\" thoughts are being heard loud and clear. Although I still think our lives benefit from the power of the positive choice. Some thoughts magically transform your life without the addition of action, and some thoughts grow inside you and propel you forward into action.<br /><br />If you think about it, spiritual teachers have been giving us the secret keys to inner wisdom throughout time. I think of quotes as keys. I can use them to open up new and unexplored territory in the areas of thought and spirituality.<br /><br />Dr. Dyer has a lot of keys to free you from the prison of negativity.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewto our lives.

You have the right to heal, no matter what your life experience has been.<br /><br />2. You can create a healing team.<br /><br />3. You can learn to become the master of your life's time.<br /><br />This book is divided into three main sections:<br /><br />Part I: A Patient's Survival Guide - This section explains how you can form a healing team, protect yourself in a variety of ways (including making sure the people caring for you wash their hands) and speaking up about anything you feel might be a mistake. Chapter 3 explains what you need to know to prepare for a hospital stay. I liked the list of healing objects you can take into the hospital to make you feel less stressed. This could range from a favorite quilt to favorite music, photos, healthy snacks and your laptop computer. This section addresses issues like having a private room or sharing a room, dealing with aromas and intrusions.<br /><br />Part II: Healing Strategies for Family, Friends, and Caregivers - This is a section for those who are looking after someone who is healing.<br /><br />Part III: Healing Ways - An interesting section on bedside yoga, breathing exercises, stretching and massage. Instructions are given for helping the healing process with the healing power of touch.<br /><br />There is an extensive resource section with ideas like \\"bedscapes\\" that can be put up on a wall to help patients feel less closed into a room.<br /><br />Bernie Siegel and Yosaif August have created a beautiful gift for patients and caregivers. I also hope doctors and nurses will read this book so they can observe care from the patient's perspective.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-01-29

Sounds a bit like the story of modern American life, doesn't it? Extremely busy, sometimes broke, but always resilient and resourceful.\\" ~Deborah Taylor-Hough<br /><br />Have you ever thought of making cookies with a cake mix? Well, lately, I even made biscotti from a cake mix. It seems there is no limit to what you can do with a cake mix when it comes to cakes, cookies and all things dessert.<br /><br />Deborah shows you how to \\"mix and match\\" various items from your pantry so you don't have to run out to the store every time you want to make something different. Of course you will want to have a certain number of ingredients on hand. There is a nice list on page 21 that gives you a list of pantry items. You probably already have many of these items lurking about on your refrigerator shelves or in the pantry.<br /><br />Sometimes I like to challenge myself and see how long I can go without buying anything at the grocery store. This book is helpful in that regard. Sometimes all you need is a bit of inspiration and you can turn a few ingredients into an appetizing meal.<br /><br />In Deborah's Mix and Match Soup, you have so many choices. You are sure to have one of the ingredients for each section of the recipe. If you don't have rice, you can use corn or pasta. If you don't have tomato soup, you can use chicken. It is that easy.<br /><br />Some of the recipes you will enjoy include:<br /><br />Create a Casserole<br />Mix and Match Quiche<br />Super Smoothies - lots of ways to make delicious fresh fruit smoothies<br />Mix and Match Quick Bread<br />More Creative Cookies - one recipe with three variations<br />Warm and Wonderful Drink Mixes - Fireside Coffee Mix and Caf&eacute; Vienna Coffee Mix. Remember \\"Russian Tea with Tang?\\" This book has the recipe.<br />Plenty of Pies - Pies you make with ice cream and ready-made crusts<br /><br />The last section of the book starts with a \\"master\\" mix recipe. You make the mix, store it and then use as many cups as needed to make recipes like Biscuits, Snack Cake and Shortcake.<br /><br />Now, this book is not just about edible recipes, you can also make a spa milk bath, facial mask or fizzing bath bombs. So, there is fun to be had. Kids will enjoy making sidewalk chalk, soap crayons, homemade stickers and edible finger paints.<br /><br />Mix and Match is a tiny treasure of a cookbook that will get you in and out of the kitchen in a hurry.

Yoga can actually change your life. Yoga is so much more than a duplication of poses. While other exercise routines can make you feel a bit like a robot, yoga opens your inner world and as you complete the poses, you actually grow and change and become a person who is more aware of the world and yet the world influences you less. You start to connect with the deepest levels of your inner self and as you continue practicing yoga, you start to feel very good about the poses you have mastered. In this way, you also start to boost your self-esteem, all while being very aware of how you affect everyone in your world.<br />Cyndi Lee has a unique and very effective method of introducing you to yoga. She has a fun almost playful approach and I laughed out loud a number of times because of her witty humor. She is the director of the OM yoga center where she teaches hatha yoga. She has been teaching yoga for over 20 years, but her pictures look like she is ageless. Her beauty represents the deeply calming benefits of yoga. Her work has been featured in Shape, New York Magazine, Yoga Journal, Elle, Forbes, Newsweek and Self. She writes a regular column and lives in New York City. She travels to lead workshops and retreats in places like London, France, Italy and the Virgin Islands.<br />I wish I had found these boxed sets a long time ago. Each box contains everything you need for yoga practice besides a blanket and a yoga mat. I'd also like to recommend a soft blanket or comforter, a pillow and yoga blocks if you are just starting your practice. You can use the yoga blocks for some of the poses like triangle pose.<br />This box contains 2 Compact Discs, flash cards, a yoga belt (nice feature!), a candle, incense and an incense holder. The 2 Discs are in a durable little book with additional information.<br />The first CD is a 70 minute instructional CD that guides you through:<br />Warm Up<br />Sun Salutations<br />Standing Poses<br />Seated Poses<br />Backbending<br />Finishing Poses<br />Relaxation<br />When you open the box it is like an exotic experience. The Bodhi Sattva incense has permeated the entire box and everything has the scent of &quot;celestial sandalwood.&quot;<br />Once you start the CD you soon realize that there is a method here. I had enough time to quickly place the cards out in order so I could see all the poses. This is very effective and unlike most yoga workouts on video, you can actually see the poses while you are doing them. A lot of yoga poses have you looking straight down at the ground, so it is great if you have cards placed out where you can see them.<br />Each flash card has information on both sides. When viewing all the cards from the top, it is easy to see the different colors of cards and separate the cards into sections. What I loved most about the cards is the names of the poses and the additional information on each card.<br />During the workout, you will learn the basic poses first and then put them into practice in the Sun Salutation section. On a &quot;standing poses - sun salute card&quot; you will find information on the &quot;swan dive forward&quot; with drawings and information on how this pose stretches the hamstrings and strengthens the legs and back. On the other side of the card, you will see Cyndi Lee illustrating the pose and see the words: Surya Namaskar. I found that these cards added a new depth to the yoga positions and loved learning all the added information most yoga workout videos don't ever discuss. This is a very authentic yoga workout.<br />The second CD is an amazing musical experience. This is music for when you want to experience the benefits of Yoga on your own without instruction.<br />OM Yoga is a well-organized system that provides a quiet sanctuary where you can regain physical strength and mental clarity. There is a emphasis on the breath and you can create your own practice sessions with the cards and CD.<br />There are 5 Suggested Practice Sessions:<br />OM Yoga Basic Level<br />Short Practice 1-3 (Three variations for added variety.

Iyanla Vanzant is a best-selling author who has created these cards to encourage you to address critical life issues in a creative manner.<br /><br />Each cards a question that lads you to a variety of answers within and a few answers on the back of the cards.<br /><br />Front: \\"When are you going to stop doing the things that bring you pain?\\"<br />Back: \\"Are you willing to live pain-free today? There's no need to endure pain. Simply do what feels naturally right and good for you.\\"<br /><br />Front: \\"Where in your life can you show more compassion?\\"<br />Back: \\"Are you willing to demonstrate compassion today? Allowing yourself to see things from the other side of the table opens the door to understanding more.\\"<br /><br />You will encounter questions about living with passion, areas of your life that need attention, fears you have to address, what brings you happiness, appreciating yourself, listening to others, speaking the truth, forgiveness, anger, simplifying your life and letting go of the past. There are so many topics that we deal with on a daily basis.<br /><br />Through these 50 cards, you can learn to follow the wisdom of your heart. I've found that mostly I just need a reminder of what I'm supposed to be focusing on this busy planet. Often we focus so much on one issue that we forget to weave all the elements of our existence into a beautiful tapestry. These cards help you to find those threads you lost someplace along the way and while reading these cards your life can become more complete and fulfilling.<br /><br />Cards to help you become a more beautiful soul! I love the artwork on these cards. This set of cards works well with your journal. You can write the answers in your journal and that way you will be able to reflect on the questions and answers. That is a good way to see where you have been and where you are heading on your spiritual path.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-01-18

They can be left on a coffee table and will definitely get the conversation going at parties. This cover has a blue suede feel and a swirl of navy blue that reminds me of a ribbon. The picture here at Amazon does not do this book justice. This book feels good in your hands and would capture any bibliomaniacs interest.<br /><br />The first time I saw one of Carol's books I was instantly intrigued. I was one of the last people to a book signing party. They were just putting the books away, when I walked over and found the last Autographed copy... as if it was waiting for me.<br /><br />When I picked up the book I had no idea how to use it. Of course, I'm not known for reading instructions. However, once you realize you are playing a game, it becomes an enjoyable treat.<br /><br />As soon as I figured out what this book was all about, I was laughing out loud. Carol explained that it has the intrigue of a magic eight ball, but unlike the magic ball, this book has so many more answers. The instructions are on the back cover on a removable sticker and are also in the front of the book.<br /><br />First you ask an open-ended question while holding the book and concentrating on your question for a few seconds. Concentrate on our question or say the question out loud.<br /><br />Then, riffle the pages from back to front with your thumb. When you feel the time is right, stop and open the book. The page you see will contain your answer.<br /><br />I tend to ask very specific questions and get quite a few good answers. You have to be serious about what you are doing. When you really concentrate, it seems to have conversations with you. Which can, by the way, produce some chills up your spine!<br /><br />\\"The Soul's Book of Answers\\" contains a collection of wisdom from many spiritual traditions, so I knew this would be an enlightening experience.<br /><br />So, I ask the book: \\"What will the year 2004 bring in regards to my spiritual growth?\\" Answer: \\"The only limitations you have are the ones that you accept.\\"<br /><br />Since I was a bit curious about this mysterious quote, I asked: \\"How will I free myself from limitations?\\"<br />Answer: \\"Many things which cannot be overcome when they are together, yield themselves when taken little by little.\\"<br /><br />Again, I ask: \\"How will I know what I need to overcome?\\" Answer: \\"Wait for what your soul shall see in sleep.\\"<br /><br />I love Carol's books because they really work for me. She produced the original Book of Answers in 1998 and the book was then published commercially later that same year. It went on to become a bestseller.<br /><br />Other answers include:<br /><br />\\"When you seek to know it, you cannot see it. When you are silent, it speaks.\\"<br /><br />\\"Out of clutter, find simplicity; from discord, find harmony; in the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.\\"<br /><br />\\"A wise soul hears one word and understands two.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Soul's Book of Answers\\" is a mysterious little book to intrigue the mind and is the most spiritual of the \\"Book of Answers\\" series.

She has a wonderful mix of clients who have become long-term friends. Lori Rubin is not only a talented makeup artist, she is also a passionate poet who started writing poetry at the early age of 10. The poems in this collection were written from age 14 to the present.<br /><br />What is especially interesting about this artistic collaboration, is that Lori's daughter, Shylee, has illustrated the first eight chapters. Chapters nine and ten contain tasteful photographs of Lori expressing her sexy-workout-girl side. I'd like to have her personal coach teach me a thing or two about weight lifting!<br /><br />Lori's poetry is a mingling of deep feelings and imaginative writing. The topics often include searching for a soul mate or desires for companionship and love.<br />Shylee's art adds depth and beauty to this unique mother/daughter collaboration.<br /><br />The Chapters Include:<br /><br />Hope - Here Lori's poems embrace a feeling of sweet longing. Waiting for phone calls, dates, thinking in the darkness of your own being. I especially loved \\"Know Me\\" which explores the topic of the \\"real me.\\" That person who hides, waiting to reveal herself to the right love, the one soul mate who will understand.<br /><br />Love - Immediately you are pulled into these poems and overwhelmed by a sense of nostalgia. Morning kisses float through poems about waking up together and then thoughts drift into meandering thoughts about missing your true love or just being happy to be in the same world with someone who understands your thoughts.<br /><br />Break-ups - I really loved Shylee's art in this chapter. She has painted a scene which represents loneliness and leaving. A ship leaves the safety of the island. Lori shows a great deal of insight in this chapter. She reveals what may not be casually seen and explores the emotional drama of a relationship that is ending. Lori also paints, but she paints imagines like: \\"A storm is brewing in my heart.\\" I see the little boat Shylee has drawn being tossed about in the waves.<br /><br />Growing Up - This seems to be the most playful chapter in the book. Even Shylee's angel at the start has a look of mischievousness in her eyes. The first poem made me laugh when I read the ending. It reminded me of myself on many occasions. Then, \\"I Get to Be\\" explores various aspects of how a woman still sometimes wants to be a girl. Many of these poems are based in the realities of the uncertain teenage years.<br /><br />Philosophical - Lori explores spirituality, speaks of life, freedom and death. She explores being a writer and having positive thoughts. \\"If I Were Dying\\" is an interesting exploration into how we would treat someone if we thought they were leaving. A poignant moment and it gave me a lot to think about.<br /><br />Maternally Speaking, of course - The poems in this section are sure to make you smile and maybe even wish for your own child to wake you in the morning saying: mama, mama. One of the poems might make you cry.<br /><br />Man's Point of View - This is sort of amusing because it is written by a woman and here we see Lori's \\"male?\\" side. Perhaps she wants someone to write these poems to her. I adore this idea. It is really interesting how she gets into a guy's mind and writes as if he was creating the images.<br /><br />Emotionally Drained - Poems about being sad, hurt, angry, depressed, frustrated, needy, all that.<br /><br />Chapter 9 & 10 - These are mostly \\"Silky Thoughts\\" - Lori gives the last two chapters another name, but I think they are simply silky thoughts. A friend once told me that even our sexiest thoughts are innocent when seen through the eyes of love. These are sweet,loving expressions of a woman in love who knows she can be sexy and sweet or even have a case of the bad girl blues.<br /><br />\\"Inspired by You\\" is a rare find that will be appreciated by poetry lovers. Lori's poems are beautiful expressions of her inner self and they mingle beautifully with Shylee's art. \\"Inspired by You\\" is an expression of innocence and maturity. Lori's poetry is a beautiful expression of all it is to be a woman. She writes of her own experiences and also draws on her vivid imagination and delves into the experiences of mysterious fictional characters. Many of the poems have a wonderful lyrical quality and I could see the words mingling with music and dancing as a song.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\\" is a rare find that will be appreciated by poetry lovers.

Beamer: A Day in the Life of a Dreamer	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Magical Dreams	Megan is a dreamer who is living in a world where everyone keeps telling her, \\"Don't,\\" \\"No,\\" \\"Stop,\\" and \\"Grow Up.\\" She has a vivid imagination and loves to act out her dreams. As she runs into the kitchen, she imagines she is the fastest kid alive. Well, until she knocks over the bucket of soapy water and her mother says: \\"Megan, go outside to run.\\"<br /><br />We find Megan in playful situations where she is dancing \\"between\\" raindrops, traveling to Mars or exploring wild jungles. I love the page where Megan says: \\"I dance between raindrops and never get wet.\\" I remember thinking this was possible when I was a child. There is a cute picture of Megan playing on the lawn with the sprinkler, a dog and a mouse with an umbrella. On the left side of the two open pages, you see a dream-style cloud picture with Megan dressed as a ballerina and the dog is even dressed as an angel. The mouse, blue bird, squirrel, cat, dog and little yellow chicken appear in most of the scenes and this is amusing and cute. Children will enjoy looking for the animals.<br /><br />Laurie Barrows has created the reality and the dream on all the pages where Megan is pretending to be what she imagines herself to be in her dreams. When she is playing by a stream in the mud, she is really thinking that she is a pretty mermaid diving deep into the ocean to find treasure. Laurie Barrows just has an amazing imagination and she has filled the pages to the brim with art, art and more art. This is truly one of those books you can read and read and never see everything on every page. Each time your child reads this book, they will be delighted to discover new aspects of the pictures.<br /><br />Of course, no one else realizes that Megan is living in her own little world and so they don't appreciate her free-spirited and joyful attitude to life. Finally, she starts to get very discouraged and the scenes change to Megan wandering through her day discouraged and alone. Laurie Barrows captures the loneliness and dejection Megan feels and finally her mother asks her if she is having a bad day. The next scenes are so endearing as Megan and her mother have a conversation about why everyone wants Megan to be different than she is.<br /><br />\\"Well, sometimes people forget what it's like to be a kid. Even other kids can forget what it's like to be a kid,\\" Megan's mother answers.<br /><br />As Megan and her mother sit on a garden bench, Megan's mother explains the entire situation and reassures Megan that she loves her just the way she is.<br /><br />\\"But Megan, I love your dreams.<br />I love your energy.<br />And even though I get tired<br />sometimes and can get crabby,<br />I wouldn't change you.<br />I love you just the way you are.\\"<br /><br />Once Megan realizes that at least one person loves her just for being herself, she is back to being her imaginative, impulsive, creative, free-spirited self.<br /><br />Karen Gedig Burnett has lovingly penned the words and her story is beautiful and teaches children to love themselves for who they are and to accept other people for who they are. This story also teaches us to love people unconditionally and to encourage them in their dreams.<br /><br />This is Karen Gedig Burnett's fourth book. She has spent twenty years as a school counselor and her stories are now helping children throughout the world. Karen's books are for children of all ages. She is known for developing plays, stories and programs to help children learn how to handle life's challenges.<br /><br />I truly hope Karen Gedig Burnett (a.k.a. Grandma Rose) keeps writing children's books. These are truly books children will love and they help parents and teachers to teach kindness and understanding. \\"The Magical, Marvelous Megan G. Beamer\\" is a story that remains in your heart and the message is eternal. We all want to be accepted and loved. When we are loved for who we truly are, we can reach beyond our dreams and become more than we thought we could ever be.<br /><br/>~The Rebecca Review	2004-01-09

You can experience wealth, health, romance, self-esteem, job success, creativity, and a life released from resentment and pain.\\" ~Louise L. Hay, author of You Can Heal Your Life<br /><br />If you are looking for a way to create more happiness in your life, these cards can inspire you on a daily basis. The beautiful tiny box holds 60 affirmation cards a variety of subjects. You can read about romance, wealth, health, forgiveness, creativity, overcoming stress, job success and self-esteem.<br /><br />Lately I've started to believe that you truly do hold the keys to your future. You can literally dream your future into life. Although, I am also convinced that you need a lot of encouraging books and encouraging people in your life to overcome life's immense and at times overwhelming hurdles. If you can find just one person who believes in you and a few books that bring an encouraging message into your life, you really can heal your world.<br /><br />Louise Hay shows this positive philosophy in her \\"I Can Do It Cards.\\" There are immediate and essential things you must do to heal your life. One of them is to encourage yourself daily. You can't give up and let yourself fall back into negative patterns that are defeating and harmful to your life. These cards encourage you to look at your life in a more positive way.<br /><br />The first card says: \\"Love is all there is!\\"<br />Then, on the back: \\"Love is powerful - your love and my love. Love brings us peace on Earth.\\"<br /><br />I adore this card:<br /><br />\\"I love myself exactly as I am. I no longer wait to be perfect in order to love myself.\\"<br />Back of Card: \\"The greatest gift I can give myself is unconditional love.\\"<br /><br />While we often hear that we should love others \\"unconditionally,\\" but how many times do we hear that we should love \\"ourselves unconditionally?\\" These cards are a wonderful reminder. The colors (lavender, blue, pink, yellow, green and orange) on these cards are beautiful and there are pictures on both sides. There are pictures of steaming cups of tea, sandy beaches, butterflies, angels, lots of hearts, treasure chests, flowers, birds, stars and I even found a picture of Louise's book: \\"You Can Heal Your Life.\\"<br /><br />The \\"I now do work I love, and I am well paid for it\\" card sounds just wonderful and I hope that reading this card will make some of my dreams come true in 2004.<br /><br />Louise L. Hay is a metaphysical lecturer and the best-selling author of 27 books. Her works have been translated into 25 languages.<br /><br />The \\"I Can Do It Cards\\" may just be what you need to move to a higher level in your awareness of life. There are so many beautiful places we can go. Sometimes we just need a little motivation. You can put these cards on your refrigerator, in your pocket, on a bulletin board, leave one on a co-workers desk or even slip them into a card for a friend. In that case, you might need two boxes. :)<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewutiful and there are pictures on both sides.

Repeat the affirmation on the card as a mantra before you fall asleep and again as you wake up. As you sleep it will do its work. Repeat the affirmation during the day.

He specializes in dream coaching and contributes to magazines, radio programs and national newspapers.<br /><br />The cards are beautifully illustrated in a modern style of art. These images are bold and imprint themselves in your mind. They are like mini-posters. The first cards says: \\"Wish Upon a Dream.\\"<br /><br />Then, you will find cards on the following topics: Abundance, Acceptance, Altruism, Bliss, Confidence, Dedication, Gratefulness, Moderation, Optimism, Patience, Success, Trust and more.<br /><br />My favorite card says:<br /><br />\\"Bliss\\" and then you turn it over and read: \\"My mind is free from disturbance.

This was the first card I took out of the cards in an \\"intuitive fashion.\\"<br /><br />I also enjoyed reading:<br /><br />\\"Dedicated\\"<br />\\"I move towards my ideals with absolute devotion.\\"<br /><br />\\"Satisfied\\"<br />\\"All my needs are fulfilled at the right moment.\\"<br />(There is a picture of a contented cat on the front of the card.)<br /><br />My father always told me that the dreams of the night were a result of the activities of the day and I think that same idea is being put into practice with these cards.

A Simple Guide to Romantic Happiness	Books	5	26	27	N	N	Love Is	\\"A loving relationship is meant to serve not as a safe harbor for our unhealthy tendencies but rather as a healthy place of reformation where such tendencies can be eliminated. Only by exposing the dark spiritual poisons within us can we transform them in the light of spiritual healing.\\" ~Taro Gold<br /><br />\\"What is Love?\\" is inspired by the universal principles of Buddhism. When we learn to be at peace with ourselves, we can spread this peace to the world. Unconditional love truly can heal the world. In a similar way that music unites us, love is what we need to unite the world. Hate destroys while love nurtures. I have found that there is a point at which the pain of life dissolves into the bliss of love.<br /><br />This tiny book explores the topic of \\"Love\\" in 80 exquisite pages. \\"What is Love?\\" is filled with inspirational quotes, watercolors and Taro's wisdom. There are swirling goldfish, flowers clinging delicately to the edge of pages, pots of orchids, birds perched on bamboo leaves and cherry trees, and a variety of creatively patterned pages.<br /><br />There are three main sections:<br /><br />Part One: Love and Illusion - Taro introduces a variety of interesting ideas and explains how in early Buddhist teachings, romantic love is seen as unstable while compassionate love is seen as limitless. He truly starts to delve into the meaning of love and explains why love as an illusion will disappear as fast as it appeared. I loved the humorous ending to the \\"Zuri\\" story that is almost as funny as the quote by Woody Allen, which just spins your mind. \\"Needy Love\\" is not often discussed and this is the first time I've seen an author explain this aspect of love in such a concise manner. Taro explains why \\"needy love\\" is ultimately unfulfilling. \\"Moments of temporary insanity\\" - I can relate to this.<br /><br />Part Two: Love and Reality - Taro's writing is filled with creativity and speaks directly to the heart. He explains relationships through the retelling of an ancient Japanese comedic tale. Taro then explores change, the three main types of love, self-mastery and \\"meeting your soul mate.\\" This book makes complete sense although the issue of greater and lesser worlds was a new concept to me. Who would not want to reach the place of \\"Enlightened, altruistic, unshakable happiness.\\" Page 50 is just powerful. The entire section on enlightenment makes the concept very easy to understand. Most books do not reach this depth, nor do they make enlightenment quite so attainable. Taro takes mysterious topics and transforms then into everyday wisdom.<br /><br />Part Three: Love and Life - Taro's thoughts continue to create a connection between the quotes and his experience with Buddhist wisdom. The quotes are not all Eastern and you will find quotes from Judith Viorst, Alfred, Lord Tennyson and even Victor Hugo. He explores the topics of loyalty, romance, commitment and karma. The story of how we become mirrors in relationships is so true.<br /><br />Taro Gold has spent much of his life living overseas. He has been successful as an author, children's counselor, teacher, interpreter, actor, singer and songwriter. He has traveled to over thirty countries and has lived in Australia, Spain and Japan. He has also written extensively for international Buddhist publications and his books have been published in seven languages.<br /><br />I find Taro's choice of art for the covers to be quite intriguing. His message is definitely \\"peace and hope\\" for a better world. \\"What Is Love?\\" is a gift for our hearts and this book is much more than a book of quotes. It is a journey into the true meaning of love in all its forms. You will we see a picture of the type of love you feel reflected in the pages. You will also see images of love you will want to emulate in their fullest forms.<br /><br />\\"What is Love?\\" is a true combination of Buddhist wisdom and real-life experience. Taro Gold's books are well worth collecting and make the perfect giftsfor any occasion.

You will learn things that you cannot learn from words. You will feel the truth.\\" pg. 13<br /><br />If your partner wonders why you are looking more deeply into their eyes, then they might also notice this tiny book sitting atop your desk next to a bottle of rose oil. This is a flip-style book that can be held safely in the case or set out on your desk or on your bedside table. Sometimes all it takes is a reminder of how we should move and breathe as love to encourage us to be more romantic. After all, what is life without pleasure and a touch of romantic adventure.<br /><br />Barbara De Angelis, Ph.D. is an expert on human relations and an influential teacher in the area of personal and spiritual development. She has learned from her own life and wants to share her knowledge with you in this tiny book filled with the inspiration you need to be more motivated in the area of romance.<br /><br />Some of the topics include: feeling safe, making love all day, imaging love as fire, listing goals for your relationship, sharing your inner world and feeding your partner with words of love that will nourish his or her heart.<br /><br />I was actually amazed at how this tiny book started to change my own relationship. I didn't realize how much influence a woman can have on her romantic relationship. You don't have to wait for your partner to be romantic, you can take the lead and it will actually encourage a more loving mood when you start giving instead of asking for what you need. By giving what you think your partner needs or you would want to receive, you get much more in return.<br /><br />Barbara also explains how it is best to help your lover make you happy by letting them know what your deepest needs and desires.<br /><br />\\"101 Ways to Romance\\" is the perfect gift for your lover and you might also want your own copy! One of the most beautiful \\"tiny books\\" I've seen this year. The messages are deeply meaningful and you can put the ideas into practice and see immediate results.

Digital technology, from cameras to software to the Internet, enabled Americans to tell their own stories in a way that's never been possible before.\\"<br /><br />DK has a worldwide reputation for publishing high-quality nonfiction books. \\"America 24/7\\" takes their vision a step further. Now you can design your own custom cover. If you have always wanted to have your picture on the cover of a book, your day has arrived. Yes, you can now order a personalized cover for \\"America 24/7.\\" This could get rather interesting and surprise a number of your family members. \\"We didn't know you were famous\\" they will say as they enviously view your beautiful picture in all its glossy glory. Or, how would you like to surprise your friends and family with \\"their\\" picture on this gorgeous coffee table collectable?<br /><br />The possibilities are endless: birthdays, graduation, anniversaries, baby showers, \\"just because\\" presents, \\"I think you are amazing\\" presents or \\"you're the best friend on the planet\\" presents. Is there anyone who would not love a custom cover?<br /><br />What about all your pet loving friends who would go wild with happy puppy/kitten joy to see their dog or cat's picture on the cover of a book. As you can tell, I was rather excited about the possibilities of putting photographs of my cats on a book cover. Better yet, I had found a picture of my grandmother holding a cat on her shoulder that is quite unique and artistic. The ordering process was professional and within minutes I could see a picture of the finished product - \\"a glossy high quality customized wrap-around dust jacket.\\" Now that is what I call amazing! The picture I used was also rather small before I scanned it and I was impressed with how well it turned out on the picture of the cover.<br /><br />To order a custom cover, you go to the URL listed on the back flap and then upload an image that has been taken with a 1.2 Megapixel camera (640x508 pixels).  For even better results, use a photograph that was taken with a 2 Megapixel camera or greater (1200x940 pixels). The maximum file size is 5MB. You can also scan a picture. In seven steps you have your custom cover and it is ready to ship. Apparently there is an overwhelming demand for the covers.<br /><br />Now as for the pictures and how they are organized:<br /><br />There are six chapters: Hearth & Home, Hard at Work, American at Play, Reason to Believe, Our Town, and Sea to Shining Sea. Each pictures shows America as it is, what was happening in 2003 and this is literally a 2003 time capsule of photographs. DK has planned 50 more books, one for each state, so look for a book about your state in the Fall of 2004. You can already pre-order a copy featuring your state!<br /><br />The scale of this project was immense and Rick Smolan and David Elliot Cohen (The original creators of the \\"Day in the Life\\" series of photography books) brought together the finest technology services for every publishing step. The sheer talent that went into creating this work of art takes your breath away. 25,000 photographers spent one week shooting digital photos of American life. More than one million photos were taken in the week of May 12-13, 2003. Not only does this 304-page, hard-cover book feature over 1,200 photographs, there are six 750-word essays introducing each chapter.<br /><br />This book was selected as one of \\"Oprah's Favorite Things\\" in November 2003 and I can see why. You can even order a framed or unframed photograph from this book. \\"Monument Valley, Arizona\\" is definitely worth framing!<br /><br />There are so many beautiful photographs, but the picture of \\"Nine-year-old Nora Garcia cuddling her baby sister\\" is angelic. My favorite picture is of Charlotte Day-Reiss reading books with the sunlight filtering in through the window and it made me nostalgic for days gone by and afternoons reading in bed. I'm sure she is a reviewer of the future!<br /><br />I had a good laugh when viewing the picture of Kari Lloyd-Jones trying to do yoga while her son, Ian, joins in. There is also a spectacular picture of the seventh-floor garden at Rockefeller Center in New York. I had to look twice, then, kept looking at the \\"Longaberger Headquarters\\" that is a seven-story replica market basket in bright yellow. I was also amazed to find a picture of Mt. Rainier, a very dangerous volcano in the Cascades looming above the Seattle area and a picture taken in Pike Place Market. We hope Mt. Rainier stays beautifully capped in all its snowy glory.<br /><br />This is the America we know and love. You will recognize the true-life settings as a mirror of your own life and be amazed by the creativity and adventurous spirit of the photographers. America 24/7 is an authentic and creative photographic journey into the real America we embrace in our daily lives. This is a book about family, growing up in America, home, celebrations, religious traditions, adventure, sports, nature, reading story books on the porch and the simple breathless beauty of everyday life.

We should all be together.\\"<br /><br />As snow blankets the farm, Ernest braves the snow to look for Chester. Since Chester is white and the snow is getting deeper, Ernest almost trips over Chester. Ernest is a thoughtful little donkey and he knows he has to get Chester back to the barn. So, he quickly rounds up all the other animals and even the birds and mice join in to help. Ernest shows love and determination and helps his friend so they can celebrate Christmas together.<br /><br />The watercolor illustrations are beautiful and Carol A. Camburn has created the cutest miniature donkey who looks like a huggable cuddly stuffed toy. Chester and Ernest are real friends and you can see their \\"real\\" picture on the inside of the cover. Carol has a horse named Billy and also loves cats. Laura and her husband live on a farm in New Jersey. They have made a home for homeless horses and miniature donkeys who enjoy a quiet retirement.

One of his first ideas included an analysis of what you have been doing that caused defeat and once I figured out that I was not making my workouts a priority, I was able to be more consistent and started to see some results I had not seen in 8 weeks! In one week, by the sheer consistency of my workouts, I had lost inches, finally! I know this seems logical, but I had been working out for months and nothing was happening. By putting aside my disappointment and visualizing a new me, I started to change into the new me.

Remember, it only takes a second to shift into a new place!\\" ~SARK<br /><br />Susan Ariel Rainbow Kennedy is a best-selling author, speaker, teacher and artist. She has designed 50 cards to show us how to live a more spontaneous life. Each whimsical card presents a powerful new way to look at our lives.<br /><br />Living Juicy is a way to say that you are allowed to roll down a bright grassy hill, sleep all day to stay in a dream or take your shoes off at the beach. You could also buy flowers, find places inside yourself that make you happy or do things that bring out your magical inner creature. The message also seems to be about letting out our inner child, the nurturing woman and the sexy goddess.<br /><br />Some of my favorite cards included:<br /><br />Front of Card: \\"Invite Someone Dangerous To Tea\\" - on this card you are encouraged to fling yourself into story telling and tea sipping. Dangerous tea also includes delicious chocolate cake!<br />Back of Card: \\"Let's share outrageous stories and eat impossibly delicious cake.\\"<br /><br />Front of Card: Your Dreams Need YOU to Make Them Real<br />Back of Card: Your Dreams Are Already Coming True<br /><br />SARK's cards show a sense of exuberance and joy and she also likes \\"naps and dreaming.\\" These cards do really give you permission to just \\"play or relax.\\" A card that says: \\"Stop Doing\\" might encourage you to pull out a meditation or yoga DVD.<br /><br />\\"The Inspiration Guide\\" is a fun idea. After you read: \\"Open a book to any page let that paragraph inspire you,\\" you might go find a book and actually try this activity. Her idea reminds me of books by Carol Bolt where you open to a page and there is an answer for each question you have asked.<br /><br />The \\"Being a Succulent Wild Woman\\" card is rather cute. Here, SARK encourages us to eat mangoes, be rare and eccentric, discover your own goodness and paint your soul.<br /><br />This set of cards would be perfect to give to any of your friends with a bunch of flowers or you could even give individual cards away, post them at your office or leave them here or there to brighten up the world. You might need two or more boxes! :) One to keep and lots to give away.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewourages us to eat mangoes, be rare and eccentric, discover your own goodness and paint your soul.

Then the kids shout &quot;Watch out, Pop!&quot;<br />In a &quot;gingerbread boy&quot; fashion, the pancakes leap onto their edges and roll out the door.<br />&quot;We couldn't cry out &quot;murder!&quot; Yelling &quot;Fire&quot; would be rash. So we loudly bellowed &quot;Pancakes!&quot; then took off at a dash.&quot;<br />Soon, all three children notice that the pancakes have replaced wheels, a steering wheel, the traffic lights and even a manhole cover on the city street. This almost seems normal when compared to a few pages later when it is raining &quot;syrup.&quot; I love when the pancakes turn into umbrellas. The kid in me loves the idea of the rain being made out of maple syrup. What a delicious idea and half the picture looks like it jumped right out of an art gallery. Scott Goto uses interesting perspectives. As a reader, you really feel that you are being pulled right into the story.<br />Finally, the children return home and after showing their &quot;magician&quot; father that he used the wrong book, they manage to call back all the pancakes. The only problem is that the pancakes turn back into batter.<br />Younger children will enjoy finding the &quot;cute bunny rabbit&quot; in each scene and looking for &quot;circle&quot; shapes. The art is stunning, imaginative and quite impressive. Each time you read the story, you see something new.<br />The entire story teaches children that even if you don't succeed at what you first started, you can always make waffles. Life is a recipe that might change at any moment, so they should be prepared to adapt to new situations. The children do however work together to retrieve the pancakes and therefore did persist in their mission until the end. The children didn't whine or cry about their lost breakfast, they just took charge and fixed waffles.<br />Paul Many has been making pancakes from the time he was ten years old. He was known for making pancakes with chocolate and raisins. Now he enjoys making blueberry pancakes.<br />Kids will probably want to make pancakes after you read this book, so look for &quot; Maple Grove Breakfast in a Crate&quot; right here at Amazon.

Traveling light means learning to trust God to release the burdens you were never intended to bear. Give it a try. I suggest you spend a few minutes each day lightening your load... the suitcase of guilt... the trunk of discontent ... a backpack of anxiety.\\" ~Max Lucado<br /><br />Max Lucado has written a number of best-selling books, including \\"He Chose the Nails\\" and \\"Traveling Light.\\" This set of cards are based on his New York Times bestseller, Traveling Light. Here he reflects on the promises and comfort of Psalm 23.<br /><br />Through reading these cards, you can start to give up all that luggage you don't want to carry with you through life. Say goodbye to fear, worry, grief and discontentment.<br /><br />The first card says: The 23rd Psalm. On the back of the card you can read the Psalm. Then, there are cards which are messages for your heart and soul that follow a progression of thoughts. The first four cards explain the present situation and explain the purpose of the cards to follow. Then, each card has a message on the front and a thought on the back.<br /><br />Front of Card: Surrender Your Cumbersome Lack of Contentment to God.<br />Back of Card: You may gain your marriage. You may gain precious hours with your children. You may gain your self-respect. You may gain joy. You may gain the faith to say, \\"The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want.\\"<br /><br />There are also some humorous cards, like the card that says: \\"If creation didn't crash when I rested, it won't crash when you do.\\" The message is simple, God is in control.<br /><br />One of the cards said: \\"Perhaps loneliness is God's way of getting our attention.\\" This is an interesting concept.<br /><br />If you are feeling lonely, a little world weary or just need to restore hope to your soul, these cards can help you release your burdens and trust God to show you where the still waters flow.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewshow you where the still waters flow.     ~The Rebecca Review	2003-12-11

I had just taken a sip of tea when I happened upon page 21 and I almost couldn't swallow my tea. I then realized it was probably best not to eat or drink anything while reading this book. It is way too funny.<br /><br />Not only did I spend last night laughing loudly enough to wake up my husband a few times, I realized Ben Stein should have put a warning in this book: \\"So funny, don't read in the middle of the night as you might wake the neighbors.\\"<br /><br />Ben's theory seems to include \\"opposite therapy.\\" This is not like any other relationship book you will ever read. You know those other books with the \\"to do\\" lists. While reading \\"How to Ruin Your Love Life\\" there were some moments of \\"stunning truth.\\" I'd never really thought about people who were successful being the types of people who overcome their compulsions. This was a moment of truth for me.<br /><br />In 116 pages, you will encounter almost every \\"relationship mistake\\" you could ever think of. All in glowing detail. First, we find the two main rules that will lead you to loneliness and despair and they are:<br /><br />1. You are better than anyone else.<br />2. Never forgive and never forget.<br /><br />Well, those seem easy enough to remember.<br /><br />Throughout this book, Ben Stein gives 44 rules that are guaranteed to ruin your love life. Everything from never telling your lover you love them to never being grateful for the gifts you get.<br /><br />\\"Why should you utter those three insignificant words? Don't you have any short-term memory? I just told you a few pages back that love was a junior high school game. Why didn't you believe me? What that meant was that although your lover is expected to constantly tell you that she loves you, you never have to reply in kind. Make her pant for it. Make her beg (similar to stingily doling out affection)! Make her yearn desperately for even a hint of \\"I love you.\\" .....Repeat after me: Love is a junior high school game if you really want to do it well (and cruelly). So spare those three little words ... and spoil the relationship.\\" ~pg. 52<br /><br />If you have ever met someone who did this to you, you've probably spent a lot of time crying and if you then went on to meet someone who gave you love even before you asked, then you have known some measure of true happiness.<br /><br />Throughout this book, you will encounter a variety of \\"relationship-killers.\\" Not saying \\"I Love You\\" can kill a relationship faster than anything I've ever seen. It is deadly. I must still have a sense of humor because I still laughed.<br /><br />Then, there is the \\"never admit that you're wrong or apologize in any dispute\\" rule.<br /><br />While each chapter is filled with wry wit, the endings of some of the chapters are especially good. Some of the endings lead to the next chapter and the ideas tie together in amusing ways. Like:<br /><br />\\"Now, back to driving your lover crazy instead of driving yourself crazy...\\" or \\"Well, I'm so glad you brought that up. Because the truth is...\\"<br /><br />This book could save your relationship from certain doom. I myself found a variety of ideas very useful. At times I think we don't realize how others see us and it can be quite enlightening to read a book that is ingeniously candid. Whatever you do, do the opposite of what he tells you!

Each card has a message and then an explanation on the back. All the cards are quite beautiful and show not only creativity in their creation, they are quite inspirational.<br /><br />The cards come in a high-quality, colorful little box with a lid. The cards are really a reminder of what you know to be true. Sometimes you just need that little affirmation and you can continue on in your life path. These cards propelled me forward into my future.<br /><br />I especially liked:<br /><br />Front of Card: \\"Inner Peace Creates World Peace.\\"<br />Back of Card: \\"You get world peace through inner peace. If you've got a world of people who have inner peace, then you have a peaceful world.\\"<br /><br />Front of Card: \\"Love Is My Gift To The World\\"<br />Back of Card: \\"I fill myself with love, and I send that love out into the world. How others treat me is their path; how I react is mine.\\"<br /><br />Front of Card: \\"I learn from both positive and negative experiences.\\"<br />Back of Card: \\"Your joy is divine, and so is your suffering. There's so much to be learned from both.\\"<br /><br />Many of the cards do focus on the aspect of \\"controlling our own destiny.\\" By looking inward and reacting in a positive way, we make room for positive change. You can put these cards on your fridge, bulletin board, on the dashboard of your car or on your computer at work. You could also put them in letters to friends to help others find inner peace.<br /><br />Another beautiful gift from Wayne Dyer! These inspirational cards can be used to enhance your contentment, happiness and peace of mind.

Some of the pictures are sentimental and show the dreams of children.<br /><br />When my mother bought my husband his first Lionel Train, I think he spent most of one afternoon putting the track together and then would amuse our cats by running the train at least once a day, complete with smoke billowing about in our mostly empty room. I kept wondering what was burning. My memories of Lionel Trains now include cats jumping across tracks to avoid the impending doom. They were actually quite fascinated for weeks.<br /><br />This book highlights classic Lionel trains, helps to revive memories of toy trains from the past and analyzes art and its relationship to dreams and values.<br /><br />The Chapters Include:<br /><br />Dreams of Ambition 1900-1923<br />Dreams of Consumption 1920-1933<br />Dreams of Authority  1931-1947<br />Dreams of Security  1946-1964<br />Dreams of Nostalgia 1963-1993<br />Dreams of Tomorrow 1990-2003<br /><br />This book is a history of Lionel Trains from 1900-2003 and is the perfect gift for Lionel Train fans everywhere. Each chapter contains detailed information on all things train through an analysis of advertising.<br /><br />What I noticed, is a sense of family unity throughout the pictures. It also seems that a Lionel Train looks best with a Christmas tree. Artists actually started promoting this idea back in the1920s. The text in the advertising is readable in most cases. You have to love the pictures of the poor kids watching while \\"grandpa and dad\\" took over the train tracks.<br /><br />Roger Carp has been a member of the editorial staff of Classic Toy Trains magazine since 1988.

He first sees Hope (an adorable pink mushroom with white spots) playing on a swing that looks like it is made out of telephone wire. As Chip (a mushroom with blue and black stripes who wears big glasses) hides behind the blade of grass he feels afraid and doesn't want to ask if he can play too. So, he secretly follows Edger (a blue mushroom with white spots) and Hope as they head for the Big Red Barn.<br />&quot;Hope and Edger hopped until they came to the stream. Edger said, 'The Big Red Barn is on the other side of the stream. Let's go check it out.' Hope wasn't sure she wanted to go but Edger hopped on and Hope followed him.&quot;<br />When they get to the barn, they find a caterpillar caught in a huge spider web. When the spider appears, Chip grabs a rope and knocks the spider off the ledge.<br />The picture of the caterpillar (who becomes the mushroom's pet), three mushrooms, blue flowers and bright green grass is worth seeing. The mushrooms are adorable and the colors are beautiful.<br />Christa &amp; Jeff Galer's story works well with the computer modeled illustrations.

Is this part of his charm? I think for someone to find beauty in the ordinary, you have to have a vivid imagination and transform the simple into the magnificent.<br /><br />Collins was reappointed to the post of U.S. Poet Laureate in the summer of 2002. He travels throughout the country for readings, lectures and is well loved by his audiences.<br /><br />While some reviewers don't feel his poetry has beauty, I think the beauty is when you connect with a specific poem. In this book, I had to read all the way to page 39 before anything really \\"struck\\" me as amazing. There is a cute poem about breakfast, a story of fishing and then on page 17 I found: \\"no matter what the size the aquarium of one's learning, another colored pebble can always be dropped in.\\"<br /><br />I think what I like is the conversational style. Billy seems to mostly be talking to the reader or explaining a situation that he enjoyed. There is a casual elegance in his poems. He invites you to journey with him through the poems, although at times Collins throws in a highly imaginative sentence or an entire poem that throws you for an intellectual loop. Billy Collins vocabulary is stunning all on its own. The way he blends the words into images and colors is more than impressive.<br /><br />In \\"Journal\\" you can imagine yourself walking in the dark, downstairs in a robe and trying to compose an entry in a journal. Any writer knows, you can hardly go to sleep when thoughts are pouring out of your mind and begging to be dripped through a pen onto a new page.<br /><br />My favorite poem in this book was: \\"I Go Back to the House for a Book\\" because anyone who loves reading can relate to being stranded without a book. Here one part of himself goes back to the house while another part races off into the world. He plays with a similar idea in \\"The Night House,\\" where his body, heart, mind and soul go to different areas of the house.<br /><br />\\"Moon\\" is rather interesting. Here, Collins speaks of our inner child and how even if we don't have a child, we can care for our inner child.  I have to laugh when I read \\"Paradelle for Susan,\\" because even the poem sounds nervous. Collins repeats most of the lines. Apparently a Paradelle is not that easy to write and it might be a fun challenge to try to write your own poem in this \\"fixed form.\\"<br /><br />Reading the poems in \\"Picnic, Lightning\\" might make you feel slightly poetic yourself.<br /><br />Pittsburgh Press has issued special limited edition hardcovers of three of Billy Collins' books: Questions about Angels, The Art of Drowning, and Picnic, Lightning.

This tiny, easy-to-read cookbook has recipes for everything from Chocolate Chip Cookies to Peppermint Cake. Stephanie teaches a cooking class entitled \\"101 Things to Do with a cake Mix\\" for Macey's Little Cooking Theatre in Provo and Orem, Utah.<br /><br />There are a few helpful hints on page 9 that teach you a few tricks about baking cakes, making chewier cookies and keeping fruit fresh. I've never used glass or stoneware baking dishes for cakes, so that is a new idea for me. I've been buying my cake pans from \\"Jane's Cakes & Chocolates.\\" The results were rather stunning when I used the pans she sells.<br /><br />What amazes me about this cookbook is the sheer simplicity of the recipes and the absolute beauty of the results. Some of the recipes you might enjoy:<br /><br />White-Chocolate Fudge Bars<br />Easy Snicker Doodles<br />Lemon-Lime Refrigerator Cake<br />Apple-Spice Cake<br />Valentine Love Cake (strawberry juice soaks into the cake)<br />Orange-Pumpkin Cake<br />Oatmeal-Raisin Muffins<br />Easy Ice Cream Sandwiches<br /><br />It was quite by accident that I tried the recipe on \\"page 101\\" and took the cake to our Thanksgiving party. The recipe was for Pistachio Pound Cake and it turned out to be \\"Moist, chocolaty, pistachio, dream cake.\\" My relatives were impressed. It is not every day that I try a new recipe and then bravely take the cake to a party, but this book looked like a winner. The ingredients are little more than a white cake mix and pistachio instant pudding. In fact, I made this so fast, I thought for sure I'd missed a few steps.<br /><br />Well, there are really only three steps and 8 ingredients. It is the easiest cake I've ever made and the instant pudding and chocolate syrup take vanilla cake to new heights. Already my husband has asked me to make this cake again and I'm planning on making it and shipping it to friends and relatives.<br /><br />While the cake is a pound cake, there is no reason why you can't make a orange cream icing by mixing two cups of confectioners' sugar with a little orange juice and cream until it is a smooth consistency. Then, pour over the top of the cake. A few sprinkles of orange zest and off to the party you go. I think this cake will ship very well and plan to try to ship it out to my homemade-cake-deprived friends. No, I'm not telling them this is made from a box mix!<br /><br />All I have left to say is, you will get requests for the cakes in this book. I look forward to trying more of the recipes as soon as I can get to the store to buy more cake mixes and instant puddings.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewu can't make a orange cream icing by mixing two cups of confectioners' sugar with a little orange juice and cream until it is a smooth consistency.

Perched on a slippery stone<br />that shifts with each shivering breath.<br />no choice but to take the next step-<br />deeper into the black river\\"<br />~Black River<br /><br />\\"The Rain at Midnight\\" is a collection of poems that so aptly describe the male perspective. Joseph Hutchison delves into a variety of situations ranging from the observations he makes in nature to the inner experiences he weaves into poems. Each poem is an adventure into the reality of existence. At times his words are playful, profound or show a focus on presence.<br /><br />I loved how he talks about tidal pools photographing his face or how the sun is like \\"apricot fire dripping.\\" He uses such vivid images and often sexuality is never far below the surface of his thoughts. I like the unbridled words in \\"Internal Combustion.\\" It seems anger is sparked and it burns or sinks down inside him writhing like a demon.<br /><br />Joseph Hutchison explores everything from the awakening jolt of youthful discovery to the slow passionate ritual of languishing in love. He also explores the tragedy of a failed relationship.<br /><br />\\"Brightness and Shadow\\" reveals the romantic nature of love, while other poems touch briefly on the tragedy of broken promises. I love \\"Brightness and Shadow\\" and would recommend the book for just this one poem alone. Here, he is remembering a night of love while he finds various items all over the room. It is loving and sexy and quite exquisite.<br /><br />There is a sad, yet sweet acceptance in \\"An Amusing Anecdote\\" as he sits with his ex-wife after their divorce is final and \\"perhaps\\" an analysis of decisions leading to the situation, in \\"Good.\\"<br /><br />\\"I might have denied myself your kiss, your caress.<br />I might have sneered, \\"What's happiness worth?\\"<br />I might have let my duties define my desires.<br />I might have hurt no one. I might have been good.\\"<br /><br />How could a man living at this depth of awareness be satisfied with less than a downpour of love? Yet, his heart makes choices and leads him to love and wounds, failures and bitter struggles that keep the peace at bay.<br /><br />In the first poem, he showers while trying not to wake his family and in the last poem, he pretends to sleep while listening to the rain at midnight as the rain drops become the chattering voices of three beautiful sisters.<br /><br />\\"or maybe they'd simply blend back<br />into rain, a dark rain, the lull of it,<br />the sweet nothing noise and the kiss of it,<br />the tears and the healing sleep of it at last.\\"<br /><br />Joseph Hutchison knows how to transform even the most casual observation into pictures where rivers of words tumble over slippery stones and you can imagine yourself lost in the river, stumbling near a shore of \\"ink-black\\" pines where \\"feverish stars have risen\\" and there is a cold comfort in the \\"bone-white moon.\\"<br /><br />It seems life gives us choices and then at times, it throws us into a dark river where we have no choice but to swim deeper into life itself.<br /><br />These poems are about surviving life and appreciating beauty along the way.

It was funnier when my husband read it to me. I'm not sure why. He and I were reading in bed and I asked him to read me some poems. He liked \\"The Biography of a Cloud,\\" especially the lines: \\"but early one morning over Arizona it held the distinction of being the only one in the sky.\\" He loves going to Arizona, so he could easily imagine the lonely cloud drifting across an open sky.<br /><br />You hardly imagine that reading poetry in bed would be anything less than romantic, yet with many of Billy Collins' poems, this is exactly what happens. Apparently I'm not the only one who was highly amused by \\"Nightclub.\\" My husband was just calmly reading and I was lost in laughter as if there were some private joke only I was acknowledging.<br /><br />Many of the poems seem quite intimate, like cozy conversations with the reader. There is an inner vision and motion. At times Billy Collins peers into frankness as it looks back starkly and at other times his matter-of-fact observations show irony. Then, suddenly we are drowned in nostalgia, awakened by dread or simply wondering at the sheer imagination it takes to write the last few lines of \\"Tuesday.\\"<br /><br />You have to love the \\"book recommendations\\" in \\"Canada,\\" or the story of trees reciting poems in \\"Fiftieth Birthday Eve.\\" Collins turns poetry into magic. These are not just words dancing before your eyes, they are living creatures jumping off the page into our imagination. His choice of words is like the choice of colors for a painting, yet the painting is occurring in minds. The better your imagination, the better the poem. You must submit the canvas for the artwork. You can remain closed, only seeing the words, or let the words into your mind and allow them to paint vivid images, recollection, connect with past memories or propel you into thinking about the future.<br /><br />The title of this book refers to a poem called: The Art of Drowning and it deals with the concept of your life flashing before your eyes. Here, Billy Collins takes a rather irreverent look at what happens when you die and why your life might not necessarily \\"flash\\" but might take other forms.<br /><br />Billy Collins' poems amaze me, not only because he can adjust his focus in a variety of amusing and out-of-the-box ways. He amazes due to his ability to make each poem an emotion or a moment in time, representative of his present condition. There are moments of longing, the dreams of travel and other places he'd rather be. There is also a comfort in the present and common life or solitude when observing nature.<br /><br />Many poems (in general) make me feel that I am on the outside looking in. Billy Collins' poems make me feel that I am on the inside, looking out as Billy Collins observes his world.<br /><br />He does at times seem to be an observer as words break on the page. There are undercurrents of emotions surging inside him and occasionally they break on the page as sarcasm, irony or a sheer appreciation for being. In \\"Conversion\\" he takes us into the past while in \\"Death Beds\\" he takes us into the future. Here we think about where we will be when we die. Not something I think about daily, but an interesting concept.<br /><br />\\"I wouldhope for a window,<br />the usual frame of reference,<br />a clear sky, or think high clouds,<br />an abundance of sun, a cool pillow.\\"<br /><br />\\"Medium\\" is stunning because it explains how Collins would love to write on more surfaces than paper and I'm sure he realized that each time he writes a poem, he is writing on our hearts or across our minds and many of his poems are unforgettable and seep into your soul. Some of the poems will even drown you in laughter.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewce of sun, a cool pillow.\\"     \\"Medium\\" is stunning because it explains how Collins would love to write on more surfaces than paper and I'm sure he realized that each time he writes a poem, he is writing on our hearts or across our minds and many of his poems are unforgettable and seep into your soul.

There are annotated maps, charts and timelines. It also has \\"information keyword buttons.\\" They are little gray dots with white words or white words highlighted in gray. They are easy to find and are blended in all over the pages. When looking at information on volcanoes, I find a button with the word: volcanoes and a highlighted word: Lava.<br /><br />By entering the site URL to a special area of the DK/Google site, you can find more detailed information. Then, you type in the keywords to find additional information, real-time reports, satellite images, virtual tours and databases. There are also downloadable images and just about everything kids need for homework and projects.<br /><br />So, say you are researching Ancient Greece and have traveled through this book arriving at say pg. 376. There, you will find a picture of The Parthenon, information on amphitheaters and even a picture of an Athenian coin. To access additional information, you go to the \\"DK/Google\\" site and type in the keyword: \\"Ancient Greece.\\" This takes you to a page with more options.<br /><br />Explore everyday life in Ancient Greece<br />Important sites in Ancient Greece<br />Find out more about the Ancient Greeks<br />Examine Ancient Greek Artifacts<br /><br />Then you click on \\"Explore everyday life in Ancient Greece\\" and are transported into a page from the history channel. So, in this way, you can find information super fast. It does seem they have made every effort to make links to only reputable sites so parents won't have to worry about children encountering inappropriate material. There are links to more than 1,000 useful sites.<br /><br />So, do you have to pay extra to use the e.encyclopedia website?<br /><br />No, it is free.

Once you purchase the book, the website is free.<br /><br />This book covers a wide variety of subjects including: Earth, Nature, Science and Technology, People and Places, Society and Beliefs, Arts and Entertainment, History and the Human Body.<br /><br />I think they have gone out of their way to make this kid friendly, however, even adults might be interested in finding many of the links. I found the section on seeing how an embryo develops in the womb to be rather fascinating. The section on new materials was quite interesting. Could seaweed be used to make a new plastic? Apparently there is material called \\"Seagel\\" that is made from agar and is the lightest solid.<br /><br />You will also find answers to the following questions:<br /><br />Are mountains still growing?<br />What causes tides?<br />How do scientists use the Quantum Theory?<br />Why is a swimming pool deeper than it looks?<br />Who were the first philosophers?<br />How are Musical instruments categorized?<br />What is a nanomachine?<br />Who really invented the World Wide Web?<br />How does the Internet Work?<br /><br />DK excels in the illustration department.

Loved the picture of the nanorobots and the pictures for the diatonms were rather pretty. Also, who knew a pollen grain was so beautiful. The photography is spectacular.<br /><br />DK & Google have joined forces to make homework fun. There is so much information here, I could spend hours just looking through page after page. e.encyclopedia will give your children a basic overview of our life on earth.

Laura survived cancer and has written some inspirational books to show women the way through a life-threatening situation. Now, they seem determined to live each day with a sense of joy and enthusiasm. Christmas is no exception.<br /><br />Through this book, you will realize that everyone celebrates Christmas in a unique way. Laura and Michael love making homemade gifts, but they also participate in \\"Operation Christmas Child\\" and fill shoeboxes with small gifts for kids in need in Third World countries.<br /><br />I could relate to the cookie making. Normally, I get in the mood about one week before Christmas and bake like crazy. My grandmother always had about 20 tins of cookies piled all in one place. They were sort of hidden, but we always found them.<br /><br />I love baking and this book has quite a few recipes. There is a recipe for Michael's Famous Carrot Cake with a Cream Cheese Frosting with a secret ingredient. Michael and Laura also share a love of making crafts and give a few examples and ideas of how you can make your own gifts.<br /><br />Michael is also a trivia buff and gives some interesting facts about \\"Merry \\"X\\"mas.\\" It isn't what I thought it meant. There are also lists of favorite songs and favorite movies sprinkled through the pages.<br /><br />I enjoyed all the \\"top secret\\" ideas I found in this book. Going on a vacation at Christmas time sounds like a good plan to me. Escaping to a movie. Giving pets gifts. It all sounds so cozy. My two cats will defiantly be considering the \\"kit kat\\" bar gifts. I'm imagining them having their picture taken in little red hats. I see icicle lights sparkling against the night sky and scented candles releasing the scent of pine into the living room where I am watching \\"It's a Wonderful Life.\\"<br /><br />After reading this book, you might go find your loose change and take it to a Salvation Army bell ringer (like Michael does) or maybe even go to the World Vision site and donate a milk goat to a poor family in some faraway land. There are some ideas in this book for helping underprivileged kids.<br /><br />I understand why at times people can become \\"Scroogey.\\" Yes, perhaps it is the disappointment some people feel at a holiday not being quite what you thought it would be. Maybe people feel that because they can't participate quite so fully in the giving that they are left out of the joy. With so many people losing jobs and all the problems that have occurred in America in the past few years, I'd imagine there are some rather jaded people during Christmas. I think holidays can also become painful because of loss or because you can't be with the person you love most in all the world. Life is definitely not perfect. So, after reading this book, you might find yourself reaching out to the world in various ways.<br /><br />After years of cleaning up pine needles in other people's homes, I had vowed to never be a decorator of Christmas Trees and yet at times I long for the scent of pine and the warmth of my grandmother's home where each year she seemed to spend a week decorating for the holiday season.<br /><br />My mother always asks me when I'm going to get a tree and had a good laugh as she read pg. 14. She then proceeded to laugh even more as she informed me that this book was perfect for me and that I was the woman who would decorate the house in Victorian Style, while my husband would prefer Looney Tunes decorations. My mother actually bought my husband a Lionel Train with a Looney Tune car. Laura tells of how Michael recently purchased a train.<br /><br />Christmas for Laura and Michael is a celebration of life itself. If anyone can get you to go out and buy a Christmas Tree, Laura and Michael can!

Haddad<br /><br />If God is just and if God is omnipotent, omniscient and good, then why does He allow natural evil? Why does He allow any evil?<br /><br />Proving the existence of a \\"good\\" God through sheer logic would seem a challenge to most authors. For Richard Y. Haddad, reasoning was the only option and he presents a highly intelligent argument. His writing is creative and he offers a new insight into questions plaguing the human mind since the beginning of time.<br /><br />What is \\"natural evil\\" and why should we question undeserved pain and suffering?<br />How can faith and reason coexist?<br />If God is good, why is there evil?<br />What is the point of life?<br />Who am I?<br />Why am I here?<br />Do I have a purpose?<br />Is evil one of God's creations?<br /><br />Through an extremely logical thought process, Mr. Haddad takes on some of the most fundamental issues confronting mankind. He presents some compelling arguments and comes to some stunning conclusions. He does this all without consulting spiritual texts or drawing on predetermined conclusions.<br /><br />For over 10 years, Mr. Haddad researched this subject and quickly found himself immersed in the thoughts of philosophers and scientists. As he encountered each new principle or explanation, he found himself surrounded in even deeper principles and even more questions. Finally he came to a variety of conclusions that satisfied his own curiosity. Although, even at the end of this book, he says: \\"Logic is not in fact the sole route to all truths, although my own tendency has always to feel that it is.\\"<br /><br />\\"No Sign in the Sky\\" is a journey through questions and answers that led to more questions. At times it is a mind boggling journey into reflections on eternity itself. While our minds may not be able to comprehend that which has no beginning, Richard Haddad proves without a doubt that there is a just God and that he has always existed and is perfect, omnipotent, omniscient, intelligent and eternal.<br /><br />If you are struggling with the concept of eternity, the presence of a God, the idea of there being only one God or the concept of evil in general, this book will provide some insights and may take you from unbelief to belief. Once you can logically prove that there is a God, you can take your mind and heart to new levels. For many people, a simple faith is all they need to build an entire foundation of beliefs. If faith is not your \\"style\\" or if you need \\"proof,\\" then \\"No Sign in the Sky\\" provides an entertaining and scientific explanation of natural evil and shows why God can still be \\"good\\" when he can at times seem uncaring and distant. Faith might be the step after drawing logical conclusions.<br /><br />Richard Y. Haddad does not delve past scientific explanation. If you want to go deeper into the principles presented in this book, you might enjoy studying works by C. S. Lewis and J. Budziszewski. I think there are ideas about the afterlife that can only be dealt with from a religious perspective.<br /><br />Thoughts:<br /><br />One area of this book had me thinking more deeply than all others. The author said:<br /><br />\\"Freedom to choose implies choices to be made, and even in the afterlife one may remain fallible - not perfect -and make a wrong choice. This will lead to - at least - disappointment and chagrin.\\" Pg. 104<br /><br />While we can contemplate our current existence, it is almost impossible to comprehend the magnificence of an eternity in a world where there will be no pain and suffering or to comprehend eternal suffering.<br /><br />The author does not reach any conclusions on how we shall escape one fate or embrace another. In all my own research, I have only drawn one main conclusion. Jesus Christ is the answer to getting out of this world alive and He alone can make us perfect so we can enter a \\"perfect heaven.\\" Why does my heart fill with utter happinesswhen I imagine a perfect heaven? The song: \\"I can only imagine\\" says it all.<br /><br />If God is perfect as the author describes, why would the next life \\"with God\\" be imperfect? To say that God is just while we live in this world and then won't provide a perfect environment in the next life \\"as promised,\\" would seem to point to the conclusion of an unjust God. I think the principle of forgiveness and souls being eternal would not allow for suffering in the next life. If we are free from our bodies, then we won't have earthly desires. Don't we make the choice to accept God or reject God before we die?<br /><br />I say the following with respect, yet I have a few comments about his assumptions. The author does seem to assume that the rules of \\"this universe\\" will hold true in the next life. He also seems to assume that the world was not created perfect. What if mankind allowed evil, even natural evil into the world? Did we have the power of \\"immortals\\" before we made the decision to fall to the temptation of knowledge? From my own research, it seems mankind was only capable of dying after he had the knowledge of good and evil.<br /><br />Perhaps without the knowledge of evil, we would have never experienced the effects<br />of moral evil or natural evil. Through reading this book, I came to the conclusion that our minds are so powerful, we not only created our present condition on earth, we will also be in control of our future destination.<br /><br />As someone once said: \\"Choose Wisely.\\" ;)<br /><br />\\"No Sign In The Sky\\" will cause deep contemplation, beyond the concepts presented on 126 pages. That is my highest compliment for any book. No book has all the answers, only puzzle pieces.

In \\"Questions About Angels,\\" Billy Collins presents the world in an almost animated fashion. At times his words glide across your mind like slow moving images in a movie or a long sweep of a lens. At other times, the \\"movie\\" is highly animated and takes on bizarre characteristics.<br /><br />The first few poems flew by my mind. I was aware of the content of the poems, they were observations, memories of childhood. However, it wasn't until I reached \\"Reading Myself to Sleep\\" that I made a connection. While I had enjoyed the endings of the first few poems, suddenly, I was relating to emotions and images I had experienced.<br /><br />\\"Is there a more gentle way to go into the night<br />than to follow an endless rope of sentences<br />and then slip drowsily under the surface of a page\\"<br /><br />Then, I started to notice a unique imaginative twist to many of the poems and even an occasional tendency towards the macabre in \\"Purity.\\"  Billy Collins seems to see himself in an animated world where the laws of life and death don't always apply. While \\"Purity\\" is rather comical and shows a tongue-in-cheek attitude to the freedom he might be experiencing in his writing, \\"The Wires of the Night\\" is a solemn animation of death. While the skeleton in \\"Purity\\" is free, \\"Death\\" soaks itself into the poets mind and seems to present an instability and then a calm release from thought.<br /><br />I had to smile while reading \\"Wolf\\" because it was just rather cute. We find a wolf reading a fairy tale and later in the evening he is found knocking over houses with his breath. I am sure this poem has a much deeper meaning. Devouring words and then acting upon them or perhaps words setting us into action or leading us to our fate.<br /><br />While Billy Collins often seems to paint cartoons on the canvas of our minds (\\"Love in the Sahara\\" where a camel leaves a pack of cigarettes was rather comical) with a magical twist, the moment of brilliance, for me at least, was on page 70. He is describing himself as the New York Public Library.<br /><br />\\"I would feel the pages of books turning inside me like butterflies.\\"<br /><br />What more can I say?

Unique quotes and passages from Anatole France, Theophane the Monk, Parker J. Palmer, Rumi, William Shakespeare, D. H. Lawrence, William James, Piet Hein, Walt Whitman and Albert Schweitzer made this book quite interesting. Especially since these were not quotes you would find that easily. There are also many stories that are part of oral traditions passed down through generations of storytellers.<br /><br />Each chapter begins with a story or poetic quotations and then Alan provides a few paragraphs of insight. There are 52 selections. You can read one a week or devour them all in a single sitting. I enjoyed this book so much, I seriously could not stop reading and the pages kept turning.<br /><br />Many of the stories have humorous endings. This book will also heal with laughter. I loved the story about \\"Caller I.D.\\" in which a mystery is solved and two people find their soul mates. Then, in \\"Smoke Signals\\" we find that in the irony of life, our problems can be solved by what we first assume is a tragedy. In \\"True To Yourself\\" Alan shows how we can follow our unique path in life and reap the benefits of perseverance.<br /><br />Alan Cohen has a unique style of writing.

A small burst of birds goes over,<br />Black fireworks on blue, like last night's showers-<br />rose, green, white on black, -the full moon orange<br />and low, and over the filed among the trees fireflies'<br />echoing flash, glitter.\\" ~Morning, the Fifth of July<br /><br />Sandra Kohler takes her observations of life and weaves them into a lyrical offering. There is a fluidity of thought and a splash of honesty in the vivid descriptions. She plays with words to explore the inner and outer drama of the human experience.<br /><br />\\"The Ceremonies of Longing\\" is divided into three sections:<br /><br />THE LIFE<br /><br />In nearly all of these poems, Sandra speaks of domestic life. Her mind dances in a world of words, selecting perfect partners for her experiences. Poetry becomes a diary of vivid recollections.<br /><br />If you are a worshiper of words, Sandra's poems will make your mind breathless. Many of the poems are written in the first person as she honestly takes a look at what it is to be a lover, a woman, a wife, a mother and a gardener.<br /><br />While reading this section of poems, sentences will trigger thoughts about your own existence. Sandra paints stories and scenes with precision.<br /><br />In her poems, she speaks of her garden, the change of seasons, conversations with lovers and friends, the rain, kissing, birds, her son running through the house, mulberry trees, rivers, love, doctor's visits, music, sleep, moments of mourning, dreams, loss, fear, youth, trees, labyrinths and visiting your previous life.<br /><br />\\"The river moves through like a woman who wants to be anywhere but in the future, the only place she is sure she is going.\\"<br /><br />THE OTHER HOUR<br /><br />Sandra turns more of her observations to areas outside her immediate environment. She leaves the safety of home and wanders out with her son. She begins to question the inner workings of other's minds. She observes them with an interest and in depth sense of perception. And yet, she is still in her poems: \\"I can't remember when I've been so heavy with outworn longing.\\" In \\"Recapitulation\\" she again speaks of birds, but here the birds are yellow/blue and seem to represent her longing to be free with her lover.<br /><br />\\"Primary Colors\\" is stunning. Here she uses colors to describe a series of events taking place. As each color appears, the scene changes rapidly in this fast-paced poem filled with moving images.<br /><br />TUESDAY<br /><br />Here, Sandra embraces some of the incongruity and irony of life. Where you are and where you want to be becomes more clear. She imagines her life is endless and yet her \\"cells lie, every atom, false to the core.\\" She speaks of destiny and being grounded in the real, while she seems to long to let her thoughts trail off into a sea of clouds. She dreams of living under purple skies near a thunderous ocean.<br /><br />\\"Japanese Landscape\\" has a rather profound ending as she watches a butterfly and says: \\"I won't die easily.\\" Her image of the orange ghost sun and light washing the horizon are especially beautiful.<br /><br />Her concise style shows an appreciation for the simplicity of experience, while her choice of words shows the seduction of the complexity of the inner world we live while the outer world swirls around us in color, sound and texture. Sandra finds stunning beauty in the ordinary and has been writing since she was 15. She speaks of pleasure, life, death, longing.<br /><br />Sandra Kohler's poetry is the recipient of many awards. This book was the winner of the 2002 AWP (Associated Writing Programs) Award Series in Poetry. Her poems have also appeared in a variety of journals and publications. Ms. Kohler has taught literature and writing courses at levels ranging from elementary school to adult education.<br /><br />The longing I felt while reading \\"Ceremonies of Longing\\" was a desire to keep reading every single poem. You can read this collection of Sandra's poems in a few hours. I found these poems to be quite calming, although the world around me came alive in words and colors.<br /><br />\\"The Ceremonies of Longing\\" will transform a part of your soul into an awakened butterfly. Sandra's poems are an affirmation of what we know to be true in our souls. We should enjoy this life as one passing through on our way to eternity. Sandra's poems truly do encourage me to live as if I was immortal. She has the gift of intoxicating the mind with words.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewpoem.

It is a story of how Elena followed her heart and her love of cooking. Each page shows Elena's devotion to entertaining. Now you can create cruise ship recipes and impress all your guests at your next party.<br /><br />Elena started her cooking voyage when she cooked with her father at the early age of 6. While she watched her father cook, he taught her an appreciation for cooking techniques she still uses in her cooking today. Some of her earliest memories include helping chefs make Russian Blini for French passengers.<br /><br />This early introduction to life on a cruise ship led her to travels in Spain, France, Germany, Romania, Switzerland and the Netherlands. She also learned six languages! As a freelance cook and food writer, she has worked with several international cruise lines and worked her way to a cruise line manager and chef.<br /><br />While working as a cruise director, she met her husband, David Gevanthor. They now live in Plantation, Florida. When Elena isn't cruising, entertaining guests at home, giving interviews or fascinating her cooking students with cooking demonstrations in her own kitchen, she is writing gorgeous cookbooks. \\"Cruising Cuisine\\" is the first book in a series of cruise themed cookbooks.<br /><br />The first volume: \\"Cruising Cuisine,\\" is divided into three main sections:<br /><br />Contemporary - Easy-to-prepare hors d'oeuvres and appetizers for the late afternoon or early evening. You will be enticed by recipes for Shrimp Salad Canap&eacute;s, Mini Quiche Loraine and the imaginative Crab Salad appetizer in which a tomato and an egg are magically transformed into a whimsical \\"toadstool.\\" The French Olivier Hors D'oeuvres made with Belgian endives are sure to add a touch of elegance to your parties. There are even some vegetarian favorites.<br /><br />Premium - This section introduces recipes with an added element of creativity. There is a wonderful recipe for delicate \\"Fillo Shells filled with Smoked Salmon & Lemon Dill Cream.\\"<br /><br />I personally loved the recipe for \\"Salmon Wellington.\\" The recipe makes 8-12 pastries you can freeze up to 1 week ahead of your party. I added a sprinkling of sesame seeds before baking. I made double the recipe as I knew this was going to be a winner. I cut two sheets of pastry into 12 rectangles (6 rectangles each) and transformed this recipe into an elegant dinner. I really felt like a chef while making these pastries and was even more impressed with the results. They are excellent with a lemon-butter sauce and a side of the vegetables of your choice.<br /><br />How could a dish this tasty be so easy to make? Elena has made the instructions simple to follow and her recipes gave me a lot of confidence and an added sense of accomplishment. One of the best features of this book is that it is sewn to lie flat on your kitchen counter. If you love cooking from cookbooks, this is an added bonus.<br /><br />Luxury- Elena's experience as a chef is especially evident in the last chapter. The recipes are filled with innovative ingredients. You will find everything from \\"Lobster & Crab Cappelletti in Pistachio & Garlic Sauce\\" to the exotic \\"Sesame Encrusted Tuna Bites.\\"  All of the recipes are sophisticated and the \\"Smoked Salmon with Caper Cream & Caviar\\" features thin slices of salmon rolled up into a rose.<br /><br />\\"Cruising Cuisine: For Home Entertaining\\" is filled with over 50 recipes and 120 photographs. Each recipe has vibrant color photographs of the finished dish and ingredients. Elena Vakhrenova is not only a natural in the kitchen; she spent six months photographing the food in her own kitchen.<br /><br />All the recipes are easy to read and have the ingredients are listed in bold text. The instructions are organized into the various steps and follow a logical progression. At the end of the recipe, Elena shows you how to present your dish in the most appealing way. I can't wait to try the \\"Lobster Spring Rolls\\" and the \\"Crab Cakes with Mustard Sauce.\\"<br /><br />Some of the Interesting Features Include:<br /><br />Garnishing and Serving Suggestions - Throughout the book you will find a number of secrets only a chef would tell you.<br /><br />Cooking Tips - Tips on how to keep lemons fresh for weeks, how to quickly peel tomatoes and how to add a tantalizing appeal to a variety of ingredients.<br /><br />A Glossary - Explains the main ingredients used in this book. Elena gives tips on how to find the best leeks and Portobello mushrooms.<br /><br />Mail Order Sources - Online sources for caviar, imported European food products, Market Delicacies and Cheeses.<br /><br />Helpful Cross-Referenced Index - The main ingredients used in this book are featured in a bold text.<br /><br />This cookbook also has \\"Cruise Discount Vouchers\\" for Carnival Cruises, Star Clippers and Cunard Line.<br /><br />I wish Elena all the success in the world as she sails into her future. I believe Elena will capture the attention of an even wider audience and I look forward to seeing her on a cooking show in the near future.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewe \\"Lobster Spring Rolls\\" and the \\"Crab Cakes with Mustard Sauce.\\"     Some of the Interesting Features Include:     Garnishing and Serving Suggestions - Throughout the book you will find a number of secrets only a chef would tell you.

I can't sleep.\\" Adam, Age 3 (during a lightening storm)<br /><br />When my mother showed me her notes about my childhood, I was very amused and could not believe she took the time to write down my first sentences and experiences of the world. She didn't have the luxury of this beautiful book!<br /><br />Your children will appreciate this tiny book when they become adults or have children of their own. As your child discovers their exciting new world, they will say some pretty funny things. Some parents have even taken to writing down everything their teenager says.<br /><br />The front cover is a photo frame. You might want to paste a picture onto a piece of paper and then slide it into the cover so you can position the picture exactly.<br /><br />Throughout this well-crafted book, you will find a variety of \\"question pages.\\" These can prompt \\"wit and wisdom.\\" Some of the pages include questions like:<br /><br />\\"What will you be when you grow up?\\"<br />\\"What's the prettiest thing you've ever seen?\\"<br />\\"What's the best secret you know?\\"<br />\\"What does mom always tell dad?\\"<br />\\"What could everyone do to make the world a nicer place?\\"<br /><br />The \\"My Dictionary\\" section is a special place to record words not found in any dictionary. You can record the words and their origins.<br /><br />\\"The World According To My Child\\" gives you a place to write down all the funny, witty things your children say. It is a lasting keepsake that will soon be filled with your child's wisdom and humor.<br /><br />If you love this concept, you might also want to look for: \\"Holiday Voices: Recordable Keepsakes.\\" They are Christmas ornaments you can keep on the tree or on the mantle. You record voices in \\"true sound\\" that can't be accidentally erased. You can re-record as often as you like. You decide which message you want to keep and it won't be lost or recorded over by mistake.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2003-11-12

The Book	Books	5	7	10	N	N	For the Mind that Loves Being Online	By nature, I'm the type of Internet user who only goes looking for information when I absolutely need it. It is pretty easy to get lost while online. Not to mention, distracted by tantalizing tidbits of information.<br /><br />Most books about the Internet seem to focus on websites or specific Web toys and topics. This book not only covers all the basics of online life, it also fills in the gaps with amazing secrets you won't find anywhere else. Yes, there are also plenty of URLs, yet that is not the main focus.<br /><br />John C. Dvorak and Chris Pirillo have created the ultimate Internet manual. In a matter of hours, you can read the latest information on hardware basics, ISPs, Music Downloads, E-Commerce, Gaming, Downloading, Email, Spam, Security, Viruses, Creating Your Own Web Site, Web Programming Languages, The Blog Phenomenon, Streaming Media, The Inner workings of a Modem, Networking, PDAs, Internet Marketing, Webcams, Content Management Instant Messaging, Peer-to-Peer Communication and Internet Law.<br /><br />John C. Dvorak writes the Inside Track column for PC Magazine and has been writing opinion columns about computers since the 1970s. Internet Guru Chris Pirillo has a site where you can find everything from the \\"Top 50 Windows XP Tips and Tricks\\" to \\"The 10 Quick Steps to Being a Great Radio Guest.\\" If you are a Windows Fanatic or want to keep your mind updated with the latest information, Chris has it covered. Ok, so he has lots of sites and even developed a Brain Trust.<br /><br />Wendy Taylor, the former editor of PC Computing, worked as the project manager and coordinated the knowledge flowing in from a team of experts from various organizations. Her organization of the material is awe inspiring.<br /><br />This Book is divided into four main sections:<br /><br />The Basics of Surfing - Shows the value of the Internet<br />Detailed Information on Downloads, Security and Virus Protection<br />How to Create a Web site<br />A Collection of Technical Information<br /><br />So, how will this book be of benefit to you?<br /><br />1. Are you buying a new computer? - Read chapter 2 on Hardware Basics and find out that in exclusive circles people are talking about \\"overclocking.\\" Beware the blue screen of death. The great feature of this chapter is the ability to quickly find information fast. If you are ordering a computer online and want to know the details about SDRAM, pg. 32 gives a basic overview. Then, skip on over to chapter 11 to read about security and chapter 12 to learn about viruses. Read about some famous viruses and learn how they operate. Did you know your computer is probably filled with spyware? Learn how to delete cookies and install antivirus programs.<br /><br />2. Love to Shop? This book has ideas on how to get the best combination of price and service for your next purchase. It also shows you how to establish yourself as a seller at major sites like eBay and Amazon Marketplace. You can sell just about anything at Amazon. There are a variety of programs and I've tried zShops and loved how fast items sold. Amazon now sells gourmet food!<br /><br />3. Did your phone company offer to rent you a Cable modem or DSL router? How much are you willing to pay to surf fast? Do you want to save money? How much time do you think you will be spending online? This book has helpful advice for every question I've ever had about online life.<br /><br />4. Interested in Meeting People? I'm glad the authors to talk about the emotional strain of online life. While it can be freeing to tell your best friend all the details of your life, it can be equally unpleasant to find you trusted the wrong person. It is however, very likely that you have a number of soul mates out there who can make your online life feel more like home. You might never meet them unless you were online. This section discusses chatrooms, lurking, netiquette, instant messaging, online dating, emoticons, acronyms, chat shorthand and even an interesting section on Japanese emoticons.<br /><br />5. Do you have your own Web site? The authors have summarized the basics. These are all concepts I learned by trial and error. I'll agree, FrontPage is amazing. Chapter 14 explains the basics of web programming Languages. HTML, WML, HDML, XML and JavaScript all make their appearance.<br /><br />6. Want to go Wireless? Read about how you can wear your computer or buy a smartphone.<br /><br />7. Starting a Business? Read the chapters on Internet Marketing and E-Commerce.<br /><br />8. Interested in Downloading Music? Read an article about the RIAA and Napster.<br /><br />An Exclusive Online Guide should appear soon. You have to love books that have their own site with additional information.<br /><br />\\"Online! The Book!\\" is the Official Netizen Brain Update! My little online heart also did a few flips.

It was not a stream, but a mighty river, with a boiling and bubbling turmoil of swollen waters. The hill behind them that was part of the Hawthornes garden was now a towering mountain and no matter where they turned, they were surrounded by huge peaks spiking into the sunny mist above them.\\" ~Susan Lancaster<br /><br />The story of Kate and Amanda is instantly compelling. Susan Lancaster's writing style allows her to paint stunning and unforgettable images with words.<br /><br />In the tradition of Mildred Wirt Benson, Susan Lancaster has been creating a mystery series for young adults. She transcends her role as a fantasy writer and weaves the magic of beautiful life lessons and fascinating history into the excitement of a fantasy adventure.<br /><br />\\"Hell's Gate\\" is the third story in a new adventure series, although it can be read alone without knowledge of any of the previous stories.<br /><br />Instead of journeying to the underworld (as the title might imply), Kate and Amanda journey into an unpredictable world where they must conquer their fears. The setting in \\"Hell's Gate\\" is the \\"Fraser River.\\" This Canadian river is considered to be one of the world's greatest salmon resources. Some of the salmon migrating upriver, swim as far as 1000 miles from the ocean to gravel beds to complete their life cycle.<br /><br />When Kate and Amanda first read about the \\"river of death,\\" they have no idea they may be fighting for their own lives or even saving the lives of others. They are also amazed by the natural wonder of the salmon being able to swim up this wild river. The Hell's Gate \\"fishways\\" now  allow migrating salmon an upstream passage.<br /><br />They have yet to learn about the desecration of spawning grounds and the plundering of tribal lands. It is 2003, and when Kate makes assumptions about the past, she is transported back in time, at the whim of the \\"In Between\\" forces. Fortunately, Amanda comes along for the ride.<br /><br />Kate and Amanda are living ordinary lives in 2003, yet are transported into another time, not unlike the way C.S. Lewis transported his characters into Narnia. Although in this story, the river is the doorway to the past. In both worlds, animals speak telepathically and Kate has her very own emissary ostrich. Jenza, the Siberian tiger also makes an appearance.<br /><br />Susan Lancaster has a wonderful way of fully developing her characters before proceeding on to the next introduction. She has filled \\"Hell's Gate\\" with convincing descriptions of Yale in 1858. She shows how Kate and Amanda must use their problem-solving skills and brave the river. \\"Hell's Gate\\" is an exciting adventure story that keeps your attention right to the last page.<br /><br />Susan Lancaster's experience as a management consultant gave her the opportunity to write and later she was a member of a research team in British Columbia. She has also worked in the United Kingdom. Once she discovered her love of writing, she created three books in short order.<br /><br />The Diamond Talisman (March 2003) - An innocent trip to the zoo changes Kate's life. This story explains how Kate met Oscar, Isia (an eagle) and Jenza. What is the mystery and intrigue surrounding the Mirendah Diamond?<br /><br />The Caves and the Skull (July 2003) - Kate, Amanda and James are looking forward to a perfect holiday on Grand Bahama Island. They soon find themselves in a new adventure that involves the masters of the underworld. As disaster looms, can Amanda and Kate uncover the dangerous operation on Doge Island?<br /><br />Hell's Gate (August 2003)<br /><br />I look forward to following the series and finding out what Kate, Amanda and their animal friends discover next!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewransported back in time, at the whim of the \\"In Between\\" forces.

She is rather mischievous and loves to swing from chandeliers, paint pictures on walls and hide.<br /><br />On these pages she is found on almost every page, sometimes she is hiding between books on a shelf or playing the piano.<br /><br />Sharon Watts has done an amazing job with the illustrations. This book has an added level of intrigue as some of the pages fold out. There is a lot going on behind the green curtain! The words within the pictures are often in full-color and I found the main story font was easy to read.<br /><br />In this story, Madame DuBois takes care of Emily as if she was her child. We find Emily eating in bed or being carried home from a shopping trip. She also enjoys taking Emily to outdoor markets where she eats famous French doughnuts. Madame DuBois also makes sure she wears fashionable clothes.<br /><br />One day, Emily goes wild and Madame DuBois takes her to the Zoo so she can be with other monkeys. She soon regrets this decision, but with some patience she learns this is best for a wild animal.<br /><br />This book is filled with wonderful art, some suspense and even a good laugh on the last page.

Jacobs<br /><br />There are two books in one beautiful keepsake box. The color of the box is reminiscent of burgundy leather and there are beautiful gold, pink, yellow and blue flowers on the top, sides and around the title on the front. These are high-quality books with beautiful long-lasting bindings, wonderful smooth warm covers and crisp pages. The type of books you dream about. The journal also has a gold thread bookmark to add a touch of elegance.<br /><br />You will receive:<br /><br />1. A Journal - a beautiful hardcover book with lined pages. Each page has a scroll design at the top. This book is for people with very small handwriting.<br /><br />2. \\"The Way In: Journal Writing for Self-Discovery\\"  by Rita D. Jacobs<br /><br />This is a high-quality journal set. When I first found this item, I thought it was just two blank journal books. What a wonderful surprise to find there was an actual book by Rita D. Jacobs.<br /><br />\\"The Way In\\" is divided into three sections:<br /><br />PART ONE: The Journal-writing Tradition<br /><br />If you love reading journals, there are a few treats in this book. You can ready an entry from Ralph Waldo Emerson's journal dated April 12-15, 1836. There are lists of prolific diarists like Anais Nin. Rita also shows how F. Scott Fitzgerald collected random observations in a series of notebooks and these were organized alphabetically. So, she explains how your diary/journal can be as unique as you want it to be.<br /><br />I loved the ideas of creating journals for fictional characters: \\"as a way of letting the reader understand more fully the motivations and internal landscapes of the characters.\\" There is also the famous quote from Gwendolyn in The Importance of Being Earnest, where she talks about her diary being a sensational read.<br /><br />PART TWO: Keeping Your Own Journal<br /><br />This section is especially for your own writing experience. I was especially interested in the difference between a journal and a memoir. The author shows how you have to create a \\"creature of remarkable depth\\" to capture an audiences attention. She also explains how writing on a computer is another option, but I think it is sometimes more fun to write in a real book. If you do have a lot to say, the computer might be a better option. I can say, I've never written a poem on a computer, so I have to agree with the author when she says that we can reach our uncensored depths by using free-flowing journal writing. Writing on real paper can also be rather therapeutic. You might want to keep a dream journal or a scrapbook journal. I like the idea of a scrapbook journal because often people say things to you that you want to remember and you can make up a journal of \\"others\\" thoughts.<br /><br />PART THREE: Writing to Find the Way In<br /><br />Freewriting is rather fun and the author shows how this is the most effective way to get in touch with your deepest self. This type of writing can suddenly appear and you have to scramble for a piece of paper. The author gives suggestions about how you can make this type of writing more of a focus.<br /><br />The section on making lists for accomplishing tasks was all too familiar.<br /><br />There is a section on page 106 which struck me as rather profound. It is a list of 52 topics on which you can reflect. Imagine writing about \\"the people you miss and why,\\" \\"things I'll never do again\\" or \\"dreams that I have.\\" There is also a list of memories. Imagine creating an entire book filled with your childhood memories or memories of love or memories of scents and cooking.<br /><br />Rita Jacobs covers a variety of topics including: Journals as Fiction, the Journal in times of Crisis, Journal or Diary, The Difference between a Journal and a Memoir, Beginning the Process, Kinds of Journals, Freewriting, Waking Dreams, Gossiping with Your Journal, Making Lists, Encounters With the Self, Elaborating Memories, Changing Your Point of View, Using Drawings in Journals, Encounters with the Creative Imagination and Mining Your Journals for Memoir Material.<br /><br />This book will interest anyone who has ever wanted to start a journal or anyone who wants to add an added dose of creativity to their writing. If you love collecting quotes, there are quite a few collectables!<br /><br />Rita D. Jacobs, Ph.D., is a college professor and journalist. She conducts workshops and classes on journal writing and has a beautiful writing style. She has written an essential book for anyone interested in starting a journal. There is also a handy index so you can find specific topics.

Finding Your Own Frontier	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Live the Life of Your Dreams	\\"None of us will ever accomplish anything excellent or commanding except when he listens to the whisper which is heard by him alone.\\" ~Ralph Waldo Emerson<br /><br />When Judith Kleinfeld's husband first heard the whisper calling him to a new frontier, Judith decided to embrace this new challenge. While Andrew was pursuing his dream of becoming a senator, Judith created new intellectual trails in the unexplored territories of Eskimo, Indian, and Aleut childhood education. Through her research, she was able to encourage positive change in the Alaskan education system. Together, Judith and Andrew Kleinfeld discovered \\"the frontier strategy.\\"<br /><br />\\"Go For It,\\" is not only an example of how two people ventured out into the unknown, it is also a guide for all Americans who want to find their own frontier and make a significant contribution to society. Judith Kleinfeld takes what she has learned from living in a physical frontier and shows how frontier living can also be a state of mind. She even explains how you can \\"homestead the electronic frontier.\\"<br /><br />One of the most intriguing aspects of this work was the entire concept of a \\"frontier.\\" The American view seems to be a unique in so many ways. When I looked up \\"frontier\\" in my thesaurus, I was surprised to find: border, boundary, confines, edge, limit.<br /><br />This book is not about limits, it is about expanding \\"borders\\", not seeing \\"boundaries,\\" breaking out of \\"confines\\" and boxes, being on the \\"cutting edge.\\" Perhaps it is about not even seeing limits. \\"Go For It,\\" is a book about freeing the self, finding your true calling, and exploring new and as yet undiscovered intellectual, physical or spiritual territories. It is truly an exciting study of the American psyche.<br /><br />\\"Go For It\\" is also filled with captivating stories of how Americans made their mark, how they expanded their skills and how they became more resourceful and inventive. I loved the story about the golf course with a den of red foxes, the couple who won a homestead in Alaska's land lottery and the story of the girl who dreamed of standing on icebergs in the night with her dark hair flowing in the wind. There is a sense of romance and many journeys to a frontier start in the imagination.<br /><br />\\"In Alaska, the northern lights shimmer in the night, swaying in great canopies of red and green, blue and purple, silver and gold. As I sit at my computer ... the sun is rising over the blue mountains. Bare, black aspen trees shoot into the sky and the clouds hover, filled with delicate shades of rose and purple light. You feel expansive. Your ideas match the mountains.\\" ~pg. 98<br /><br />Judith writes with an optimistic sense of purpose. She has found a place of authentic happiness and knows what it takes to lead a satisfying and successful life. She asks questions to encourage you to take the first step, then she shows you how to find or create your own frontier. There is also information on \\"what you need for your journey\\" or \\"how to become a frontier angel.\\" She also explains \\"how a frontier works\\" and \\"how to steer clear of the dangers.\\" This book will show you how to develop new talents, use the talents you already have to accomplish more than you thought possible, start over in a new location or find your frontier in your present location and increase your confidence level so you can live your dream.<br /><br />Judith and her husband are living their dreams. Judith is now a professor of psychology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and her husband, Andrew Kleinfeld, is a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Their three children have also found their own frontiers in experimental theater, bioethics and consulting.<br /><br />Judith also writes a bi-weekly column in \\"Heartland,\\" and has been featured in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, the Chronicle of Higher Education, and Psychology Today. She has appeared on National Public Radio and has been interviewed by national and local television and radio.<br /><br />This book is really on the cutting edge. According to the National Federation of Independent Business, small business optimism is soaring to new heights. The U.S. economy also seems to be heading in a positive direction as American businesses are able to make new investments due to tax relief. Even consumer confidence is on the rise.<br /><br />Now is the time to read: \\"Go For It.\\" Judith has written a trail guide for the world of frontier living. This book will give you an added boost of confidence, so you can make your dreams a reality.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviews been interviewed by national and local television and radio.<br /><br />This book is really on the cutting edge.

Within this beautiful story, there are clues for those seeking to commit to marriage for life.<br /><br />Tom and Nancy were married for over forty-one years. Nancy died suddenly on December 18, 1998. This story is told by her husband Tom, but Nancy's memory adds vibrancy, wit and life to each chapter.<br /><br />The first chapter is a revealing and sometimes beautiful, yet heart-wrenching look at what it means to lose the love of your life.<br /><br />The second chapter \\"I take thee, Nancy,\\" starts with humor and then I was instantly crying. What a love this couple had. I was trying to read page 16 but it was a bit difficult when I couldn't see the words. It occurred to me that this is how a woman wants to be loved. This deeply and profoundly and long after she is gone. I have never thought about what a man thinks about when he loses the woman he loves. This was truly insightful and I think Nancy would have loved to read this book.<br /><br />Tom Mullen brings out some interesting concepts. He explains how a spouse should not \\"accept\\" psychological abuse and that to accept such abuse is to deny one's own self-worth. He explains how a woman had a emotional breakdown because of self-inflicted martyrdom. While he believes in a good marriage and sees that as ideal, he is not promoting \\"for better or abuse, infidelity or pain.\\" He also counseled couples and has seen all sides of relationship issues. This is a story of Tom and Nancy, but also includes stories of other couples and how they dealt with their differences, conflicts and needs.<br /><br />After reading this book, I realized that the reason this marriage lasted was because Tom took an active role in the romantic side of the relationship. How could a woman resist staying with a man who cherished her and made her feel loved? He says he wondered what she saw in him. For me, the answers jumped off the pages, one after another. This marriage lasted because a husband loved his wife and she responded to his attention.<br /><br />\\"A Very Good Marriage\\" is a rare, honest and beautiful look at the concept of \\"love for a lifetime.\\" Tom Mullen and his wife took their wedding vows seriously and worked at keeping their marriage at the top of their priority list. This book will be a comfort to anyone who is trying to keep their marriage vows.<br /><br />You might also enjoy reading:<br /><br />\\"Living Longer and Other Sobering Possibilities\\" by Tom Mullen<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewhed her and made her feel loved?

925924:US	50199793	R1JI1SAEFO4PZZ	140190131X	973372960	Getting in the Gap: Making Conscious Contact with God Through Meditation (Book & CD)	Books	5	247	249	N	N	Go To The Ocean Directly	\\"For the raindrop, joy is in entering the river...\\" ~Mirza Ghalib<br /><br />Have you ever wished you could escape to a place of peace? \\"The Gap\\" is a place between your thoughts. It is the place where you can be still and release yourself from the 60,000 thoughts hurtling through your mind during the course of a day.<br /><br />Meditation can encourage physical healing, reduce stress, eliminate fatigue, make you feel younger, brighten your eyes and complexion, keep you focused on your spiritual connection, alleviate depression, and improve your memory. Meditation also allows you to find some of the secrets of peace. When you are thinking about God, how can you think of problems? How can your heart be anxious when it is freed from pain and sorrow and is resting in an ocean of love.<br /><br />Once you have experienced this \\"place of peace/the gap,\\" you can go there again. I first experienced this \\"space between my thoughts\\" during the end of a yoga workout. I had no idea you could escape the pain of life in this manner. I felt good for two days after doing the meditation section of the workout.<br /><br />In this book, there is a CD that allows you to quickly enter the silence without the yoga workout, although I still like putting a fluffy down comforter on the floor as I do when I do yoga workouts. I was encouraged to learn that there is no \\"correct posture\\" or place for meditating. I actually meditate better when lying flat on my back. You could be sitting in your chair at work with your eyes closed during a 10-minute break, you could be at home, on a plane, or you could be out in nature.<br /><br />The book has six chapters explaining Japa Meditation and shows how this form of meditation can affect your life in a positive way. The meditation CD is in a little envelope at the back of the book. There are two meditations on the 40-minute CD. The first 10 minutes explains the CD. You can listen to this each time or forward to one of the meditation sections.<br /><br />The second section on the CD is a 10-minute meditation. The third section is a 20-minute meditation.  In the first guided meditation, you say the name of God twice each time between the words you are visualizing on the screen of your mind. Then, in the longer 20-minute meditation you say the name of God four times between the visualization. It is very calming.<br /><br />You visualize a word and then a second word. Then you \\"slip back to the space\\" between the words and I noticed that I was taking a deep breath each time. It was as if I was giving myself permission to relax. The further you go into the CD, the more relaxed you become.<br /><br />The first time I tried this CD, I was in total emotional conflict. I was crying when I started listening and in 20 minutes, my mind had totally become refocused and I felt like I could again enter the world. I was amazed at how quickly my focus changed from feeling very emotional to feeling very strong, loving and peaceful. It was as if I'd slept 8 hours and awoken without the past nights conflicts haunting me. I was amazed at how rested I felt.<br /><br />The feeling this CD evokes is similar to floating on an ocean of subtle vibrations that penetrate every part of your entire body making you become one with the ocean. It is like being unconditionally loved. If you have never said: \\"Ahhhhhh\\" along with a spiritual teacher, I highly recommend it. The beauty of this meditation is that you don't have to belong to any specific religion. Japa meditation is the Yoga of the Mind. It is actually practiced by all of the religions of the world but under different names.<br /><br />While this book has examples of how meditating even brought financial wealth, the greatest wealth is in the peace you will experience while meditating on the name of God.<br /><br />\\"Wisdom of the Ages\\" was my first introduction to Wayne Dyer. I love the quotes he finds, the passages he presents and how he weaves the past and present together to encourage a more peaceful future. His words have always captured my attention and had a profound effect on my life. I highly recommend this book and CD as an introduction to meditation. You can journey from stress to peace in as little as 10 minutes. \\"Getting in the Gap\\" is a true soul escape!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewa profound effect on my life.

The first is to provide a reference work which looks at the world as an outsider - as though standing on the moon, a possibility which is no longer the stuff of fantasy. The second is to separate fact from interpretation.\\" ~John B. Teeple<br /><br />DK is well known for their interest in creating some of the most fascinating books you will ever read. Not only is this book filled with full-color maps, it is also illustrated with contemporary and archival photographs and artwork.<br /><br />The features include: Entries organized according to dates and geographic regions, beautifully illustrated timelines, feature boxes and captions, cross-reference navigation tools, introductory narrative for each timeline, encyclopedic Subject Index and Glossary, comprehensive information on the arts, science and technology, exploration, philosophy and religion. The sidebars are used for detailed captions and additional chronologies.<br /><br />I also loved the \\"snapshot\\" maps where the pages fold out and you can see how the world evolves over time. You can visually compare the world in 1000 BCE with the world in 1975. The quick reference timelines at the start of each chapter shows the most important events of that time period.<br /><br />How is this book set up?<br /><br />As you read through this book you will find four columns: Asia, Africa, Europe and Americas & Australasian.<br /><br />On page 454 and 455 you will see lots of information, including the following facts:<br /><br />ASIA: 2002 Musharraf wins Pakistan general election.<br /><br />AFRICA: 2002 The threat of famine looms large in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Angola, Mozambique, Swaziland, and Lesotho as crops fail due to droughts and floods.<br /><br />EUROPE: 2002 Single European currency - the Euro-introduced in 11 of the 15 EU Member States.<br /><br />AMERICAS & AUSTRALASIA: 2002 Estimated Internet users worldwide 530 million.<br /><br />On each side of the four columns, you will find pictures with information on the Conflict in the Middle East, Asylum-seekers in Europe and a summary of Sept 11.<br /><br />While it doesn't seem much is going on in the Americas and Australasia until page 249, you have to see this all in context. Often this area is filled with pictures, so the space is not wasted. Basically the timelines show what happened and when. It is that simple.<br /><br />This book spans from 10,000 BCE to 2002. For instance, you will find entries like: c.1000 Adena culture develops in middle Ohio river valley in eastern N America. Things start picking up after pg. 271 when Christopher Columbus makes his appearance in search of Asia and lands on the Bahamas on his first expedition.<br /><br />The United States of America is not a big section of this book, simply because it is a young country in comparison to countries in Europe, Africa and Asia. I say all this to put the information in this book into perspective. It does seem that the editors went out of their way to include as much information as they could before the 15th century.<br /><br />The Main Contents include:<br /><br />The World to 10,000 BCE<br />Timeline: 10,000-5000<br />The Advent of Agriculture: 5000-2500 BCE<br />The First Cities: 2500-1000 BCE<br />Early Civilizations: 1000-500 BCE<br />The Early Classical Age: 1-500 BCE-1 CE<br />The Later Classical Age: 1-500 CE<br />Successors to the Classical Age: 500-1000 CE<br />The Early Middle Ages: 1000-1200 CE<br />The High Middle Ages: 1200-1400<br />The Renaissance: 1400-1600<br />The Expanding World: 1600-1800<br />The Age of Revolution: 1800-1900<br />Clash of Empires: 1900-1925<br />Timelines: 1901-1915<br />World War I<br />The World in 1925<br />The World between the Wars: 1925-1950<br />World War II<br />Timelines: 1941-1950<br />The Cold War World 1950-1975<br />Timelines: 1951-1960<br />The Cold War/The End of Colonial Rule<br />Timelines: 1961-1975<br />The Modern World: 1975-2002<br />Concordance - This goes from page 458-666.<br /><br />I find it interesting that this book has 666 pages.  The Concordance section of this book is worth the price alone. It is a collection of major events, brief biographies of key historical figures, lists of major rulers and leaders, individual chronologies of each of the world's nations and also acts as an index and glossary for the book.<br /><br />If you are researching \\"Plato,\\" you can look up his name in the alphabetically arranged concordance section and not only read about his basic philosophy, you will also be guided to page 59 where you will the date of 384 where he wrote his philosophical dialogue, The Symposium. If you look up United States of America, you can find all the important dates like 1776, followed by a list of the Presidents of the United States.<br /><br />If you are interested in world history and want to finally organize your thoughts into an historical context, you will love this book.<br /><br />I think of this as a History Dictionary/Encyclopedia of sorts. If I need information on any topic, from Microsoft to Buddhism, this is a great place to start and I can then put all the topics I'm researching into the proper historical perspective. This is a good sturdy book with a beautiful binding. A book you will be reading for years and years! I found it to be very reliable and all the facts I knew by heart where listed correctly.<br /><br />Sadly, the author, John B.

If you walk past a pet store and see a cute puppy, you might want to read this book first. There are excellent ideas like bringing a puppy home on a day when you will be home the next day or maybe for the weekend.<br /><br />Puppy proofing a house is also a great idea. Especially since \\"chewing on everything\\" is an expression of basic canine hunting instincts. Do you have a baby gate? You might want to buy one. There are grooming supplies, cleaning supplies and toys to think about. I had never considered the danger of electric cords. You mean they chew on those too? Yikes.<br /><br />This book was truly enlightening. For example, you should not buy a puppy that is not at least 9 weeks old because there is a \\"critical fear\\" period in which puppies who are frightened for any reason will become a lifelong fear. Even a car ride or a trip to the Vet could make them afraid of Vet visits and car rides.<br /><br />The Main Sections:<br /><br />So You Want a Puppy - Are you ready for a new puppy? How to decide on the type of dog you want to own. There are more than 400 dog breeds to choose from. There is also information on the types of breeds that require more frequent grooming. Do you want an active breed like a Shih Tzu or a laid-back breed like a Golden Retriever.<br /><br />Bringing Home Your New Best Friend - All the essentials. What you should do before bringing a new puppy home and how to set household rules, prepare for housetraining and the essential first 24 hours. Do you have any poisonous plants in your yard? Is your fence secure enough to prevent escapes? How do you housetrain? Some great ideas about \\"not using newspapers\\" because apparently this is a bad idea in the long run!<br /><br />Your Puppy's Health - Everything from the first visit to the vet to what your puppy should eat. Also helpful information for emergencies. There is a lot to think about in this chapter including vaccinations, spaying and neutering.<br /><br />How to Train Your Puppy - Interesting tips on how to be your puppy's teacher. How you can use training to avoid trouble. If you don't want your puppy to chew on his leash, you can simply dip it in vinegar. There are simple ways to show your puppy you are the leader of the pack. Liz Palika also gives \\"Ten Simple Principles for Successful Training.\\" You start with the basics and then work your way into \\"boundary training.\\"<br /><br />More to Do... and Learn - What are the beset games and toys? Also a section on \\"Why Does My Puppy do That?\\" You will find out some creative ways to get a puppy to stop barking.<br /><br />If you are trying to decide between owning a cat or a dog, this book will defiantly help you see if you are a \\"cat OR dog\\" person. You might be both.<br /><br />KISS books have so many great extras and pictures. You will find Trivia, definitions and website addresses.

You will find information about how to attract butterflies to your garden or the reason Queen Victoria requested that jam be made from Chilean guava berries. Have you ever read about a \\"curry leaf\\" in a recipe? Well, there is information in this book on how you can grow your own plant, but probably only in a greenhouse. A greenhouse seems essential if you are really serious about gardening.<br /><br />Jekka McVicar is a popular radio and television personality. She has helped to revitalize the traditional use of herbs and shows how herbs can enhance your home, health and garden. Jamie Oliver calls her the \\"queen of herbs.\\" Now I understand why he loves cooking with so many herbs.<br /><br />My favorite section was the \\"kitchen\\" section where you can learn how to make everything from \\"borage ice cubes\\" to \\"roasted vegetables with herbs.\\"<br /><br />Some of the highlights include:<br /><br />1. An A-Z of the top 100 herbs - Half the book is dedicated to pictures, cultivation techniques, harvesting tips and uses. 'After trying to grow French lavender from seeds (Hardy Lavender has more of a chance), I see the plants are best grown from cuttings taken in the spring. It seems only the \\"lavandula stoechas French Lavender\\" will grow from seeds and probably only inside with extra warmth, in \\"coir/bark/perlite,\\" and covered with perlite (naturally occurring siliceous rock with a neutral pH).<br /><br />I had never even heard of \\"perlite\\" before and this was all very enlightening for me. Coir is the outside layer of husk surrounding the shell of a coconut and bark would just be tree bark, but you need a fine grade bark and not fresh green bark. Finally, I realize why the poor little seeds I planted had no chance of germinating.<br /><br />2. Organic Gardening - Many of the herbs can be mixed in with your vegetable garden. If you grow beans, you might want to grow \\"blue borage flowers\\" alongside as they will attract bees that will pollinate the beans, producing a larger harvest.<br /><br />3. Lists of plants that will grow best in sand, clay, chalk, loam type soils.<br /><br />4. Designing an Herb Garden<br /><br />5. Detailed information on growing herbs from seeds, hardwood cuttings, layering, root cuttings and root division.<br /><br />6. Using Herbs in Petcare<br /><br />Ever since discovering a lavender furniture oil, I wondered how I could make my own. In the \\"Home\\" section, there are recipes for Natural furniture polish, upholstery shampoo and even herbal window cleaner. You might also want to make up an herbal first-aid kit. If you have ever steamed your face, you will appreciated the added benefit of herbs like lemon verbena or spearmint. There are recipes for mouthwash, shampoo, face packs, nail strengthener, bath tonics, bath bags and a foot bath. Having trouble sleeping? You can make a \\"hop pillow.\\"<br /><br />The Top 100 herbs include: Yarrow, Anise hyssop, Lady's mantle, Onions, Chives, Aloe, Lemon verbena, Angelica, Dill, Chervil, Horseradish, Arnica, Silver artemisias, Green-leaf artemisias, Borage, Box, Pot marigold, Incense plant, Caraway, Balm of Gilead, Bachelor's buttons, Gotu kola, Chamomile, Goosefoot, Chicory, Coriander, Sea fennel, Lemon Grass, Cardoon, Foxglove, Wild rocket, Echinacea, Cardamom, Wild rosemary, Joe Pye weed, Queen-of-the-meadow, Fennel, Wild strawberry, Sweet woodruff, Ginkgo, Licorice, Hops, St. John's Wort, Hyssop (gorgeous blue-violet flowers), Elecampane, Woad, Juniper, Bay leaves, Hardy Lavender, Colorful bract lavender, Tender lavender, Lovage, Flax, Luma, Gypsywort, Yellow loosestrife, Purple loosestrife, mallow, mandrake (toxic), White horehound, Lemon balm, Classic Mints, Peppermints, Meu, Wild bergamot, Curry Tree, Myrrh, Myrtle, Catnip, Black cumin, Basil, Eastern basil, Evening primrose, Olive tree, Hardy Oreganos, half-hardy oreganos, Scented pelargoniums, Fruit-scented pelargoniums, Shiso, Vietnamese coriander, Parsley, Pokeroot, Purslane, Primrose, Australian mint bush, Rosemary, French sorrel, Rue, Sage, Aromatic sages, Elder, Salad burnet, Lavender cotton, Soapwort, Savory, Virginia skullcap, Houseleek, Goldenrod, Betony, Comfrey, Mexican marigolds, Siler tanacetums, Green tanacetums, Germanders, Wood sage, Upright thyme, Creeping Thymes, Mounding thymes, Nasturtium, Chilean guava, Valerian, Vervain and Viola.<br /><br />On each page there are cross-reference \\"buttons\\" to give you information on where to find uses for the plants in the home, garden and kitchen.<br /><br />This beautiful book will also be of interest to writers trying to describe herbs or to cooks who want to know what an entire plant looks like.<br /><br />A fascinating study of herbs that can also double as a fun-to-read coffee table book.

Do you want to take more control of your future health?<br /><br />\\"The Metabolic Plan\\" is an inspiring journey into the world of anti-aging solutions. I read every word in a state of absolute wonder. By the time you finish reading this book, you will understand how your body functions on the cellular level. You will also know the details of glycation and oxidation, understand why free-radical damage contributes to nearly all disease states, and discover the beauty of \\"clustered water.\\"<br /><br />Stephen Cherniske is an internationally renowned nutritional biochemist who not only explains aging on the biochemical level, he shows you how to slow and even reverse the process. He shows how the body really works, then he explains anabolic power. Once he has laid out his theory, he proves it with well-organized chapters and convincing arguments. Highly intellectual concepts have been made palatable. I really enjoyed his metaphors, humor, analogies, and how he made the complex understandable.<br /><br />Stephen Cherniske has not only unlocked the secrets of longevity, he is a living example. He has learned how to stop his body from going into a premature \\"shut down\\" sequence. He was born in 1948 although medical testing shows his biological age to be around 35 and he has the same muscle-to-fat ration he did when he graduated from high school.<br /><br />This is not a \\"diet\\" and the author says most diets send your metabolism in the wrong direction. If you are frustrated with diets, this is the healthy and logical alternative. The Metabolic Plan is really a lifestyle. You take stock of your current situation and develop a battle plan to defeat aging. With this plan you can improve your mood, sex drive, stamina, energy level, digestion, muscle mass and skin tone. You will notice a more radiant you in the mirror!<br /><br />The Chapters Include:<br /><br />1. Foundations<br />2. Restoring Your Anabolic Power<br />3. Putting the Brakes on Catabolic Metabolism<br />4. Stress and the Aging Process<br />5. How Good Do You Want to Look and Feel?<br />6. Illness, Immunity, and Metabolism<br />7. Energy, Exercise, and Metabolism<br />8. Optimal Nutrition: Building Blocks of the Metabolic Plan<br />9. Water: Lifespring of the Metabolic Plan<br />10. Metabolic Issues for Women and Men<br />11. Keeping Score, Staying Motivated, and Taking Action - Action steps for ages 35-75 (tests, supplements, exercise, major focus and major concerns)<br />12. Conclusion: A Question of Balance, the Nature of Time<br />Resources - lots of websites where you can do additional research.<br /><br />The Metabolic Plan has been featured in the Oprah magazine, Body & Soul, Southwest Airlines Spirit Magazine and Natural Health Magazine. Stephen's articles have also appeared in USA Today, Newsweek and Time. He has appeared on Dateline NBC, FOX News and 48 hours and is widely recognized as a top expert in nutrition.<br /><br />When I first heard Stephen Cherniske on a radio show, I was instantly intrigued. I knew I wanted to read his book and patiently waited for it to be published. What I didn't realize was how life-changing this information would be.<br /><br />\\"You are capable of replacing 300 billion cells every day.\\"<br /><br />This book presents the most logical and convincing argument for exercising I've ever read. My thought was: \\"You mean I'm telling my brain I'm older than I am? Wait, I'm going to change the signals I'm sending my brain! Today!\\" I then went out and bought a pedometer and some suggested supplements and healthy foods, not to mention green barley, aloe juice, milk thistle and melons. There are some delicious foods you can add to your grocery cart and in a few weeks you feel like a different person. Even eating freshfruits instead of drinking fructose laden drinks helps! I like his ideas about buying whole foods so you don't have to read so many labels!<br /><br />Some of the questions Stephen Cherniske answers:<br /><br />Is it possible to enjoy \\"the prime of life stage\\" until you are 65?<br />What is 7-Keto? Why should I not take DHEA before 35?<br />How can I get my doctor involved in my anti-aging journey?<br />How can I get my body to produce more DHEA and hGH naturally?<br />How can I enter a more restful level of sleep?<br />Why should I maintain optimal liver function?<br />Why is \\"just\\" taking a multivitamin similar to tossing a cup of water on a forest fire?<br /><br />Stephen Cherniske also provides information on tests you can request to show you your biological age. There is also a nice index so you can look up information when you need it fast.<br /><br />If you have recently had a visceral awakening (Help! I'm aging too fast!) and are nearing 40, \\"The Metabolic Plan\\" will give you all the information you need to make your life a more empowered experience. Suddenly, you will realize how much you can do to stay younger longer!<br /><br />\\"The Metabolic Plan\\" presents a proactive approach. Stephen Cherniske shows how you can restore anabolic metabolism and put the brakes on catabolic activity. You may also want to read: \\"The DHEA Breakthrough\\" and \\"Caffeine Blues.\\"<br /><br />I'm convinced that this is one of the most important books you will ever read! If you can read this book before you are 40, you will be way ahead of the game! Recommended reading for men and women between 35 and 75 years of age. I just turned 36 and already I've noticed I have more energy in the first month after starting this plan. I'm not even taking the DHEA yet! So, this book is not just about DHEA, it is about healthy life choices and supplements you can take to improve your quality of life.<br /><br />\\"The Metabolic Plan\\" is the most enlightening book on longevity I've read to date! This is cutting edge information. Highly Recommended.100 Stars!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewso many labels!

Quality food is defined as less processed, more natural, more basic foods-like fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, etc. Easy stuff to get at the market. There are however, concerns that we are necessarily, having to deal with in this 21st century.\\" ~Leanne Ely<br /><br />Need a recipe for Pesto or want to learn to make healthier French Fries? How did mom make those mashed potatoes anyway?<br /><br />Well, Leanne Ely has the answers and had created a cute cookbook filled with over 100 family-approved recipes.<br /><br />If your kids are hungry for pizza and there isn't a frozen pizza in sight, you might enjoy making the Pizza Muffins. If you keep a bottle of spaghetti sauce around, some mozzarella cheese, various toppings and mixed grain English muffins in the kitchen, you will have an easy-to-prepare snack.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed in this cookbook was an ingredient called \\"sucanat.\\" If you are wondering what this is, well, I was too. I found the answer on pg. 51, where the author also lists, kamut flour, carob and whole wheat pastry flour. I was then sent to the glossary for explanations.<br /><br />The glossary is not where you'd expect it to be, it is on page 59. Ok, so it is that natural cane sugar I've seen in health food stores! All the other ingredients seemed pretty normal to me, still, you might want to find a health food store in your area or most grocery stores seem to have an isle of natural foods. If you want to shop online, there is a resource section at the back of the book.<br /><br />The basic recipe sections:<br /><br />Breakfast in Bread and Other Comforts<br />Soup & Salad Bar<br />Life in the Fast Food Lane<br />The Main Thing<br />Dips, Snacks & Tricks<br />Just Desserts<br /><br />Some of the recipes include: Buttermilk Cornbread, Mega Manic Muffin Mix, Lentil Soup, Tabbouleh, Mama's Mashed Potatoes, Quinoa Pilaf, Shepherd's Pie, Roasted Garlic, Pizza, Hummus and Mexican Chicken Salad. Want to try something sweet? Try the Apple Cake or Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting.<br /><br />Some of the highlights of this cookbook include the short essays on food at the start of the book. Leanne Ely explains why writing this book became essential for the health of her family and how you can also change your food and change your life.<br /><br />Leanne believes we all know what works best for our bodies. She has been a victim of the experts who have given her ideal diets to follow. Finally, she decided to just follow the \\"guru\\" within. She explains the basics of protein, carbohydrates and fats.<br /><br />Then, she delves into the dangers lurking in our regular grocery store shelves. After reading chapter three, organic foods will start looking pretty darn good to you. Do you have a child who has allergies or want to teach \\"manners to the not so mannerly.\\" I recently read that the top food allergies are nuts, shellfish/seafood, milk, wheat, eggs, a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, cheese, yeast and soya protein. So even \\"healthy\\" foods might not be healthy for everyone. It is really tricky. Before she gets into the recipe section, she also explains basic tools and how to stock the pantry.<br /><br />Before you hand your very young child a peanut butter cookie, consider their age. Peanut butter should not be fed to children younger than 3 years old. It is almost as difficult to avoid peanut butter as it is to avoid cottonseed oil. It seems to be in everything. Even chocolate can have traces of peanuts as can soy protein bars, etc, etc. In fact, by avoiding cottonseed oil, palm kernel oils and peanut butter, you might notice your skin clearing up if you didn't realize you had an allergy to begin with. We all live and learn.<br /><br />If some of the health information intrigues you, you might also want to read: The Metabolic Plan by Stephen Cherniske. It takes health to new levels! A must-read! It has become more and more obvious to me that to live a long and healthy life, you need to read a lot of books!<br /><br />Choosing a healthy lifestyle seems to be key and it is really this huge puzzle you have to figure out on your own. You find some pieces in books and some pieces are the result of your own experience with food. Leanne Ely gives quite a few great suggestions on how to not only improve the health of your family, she also gives a basic overview of nutrition so you can feed your family well. There are a few puzzle pieces in this book, pieces I have never seen in any other cookbook.<br /><br />Leanne's \\"irreverent\\" style is cute and you will learn a ton about nutrition and I'm even thinking about using \\"sucanat\\" in some of my own recipes.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewey and it is really this huge puzzle you have to figure out on your own.

There are also plenty of full-color pictures.<br /><br />The Contents:<br /><br />The Universe & The Earth - Are you looking for the top 10 \\"Most Isolated Inhabited Islands\\" or just want to find the principal components of air, this book provides some interesting lists.<br /><br />Life on Earth - You will recognize common facts like the Cheetah being the fastest mammal, but what about the heaviest turtle? I also had no idea beetles were the most common insects, although ants, bees and wasps where third. May I say, beware the banana spider.... There is also a list of deadliest spiders. I was not happy about the list of animals used in experimentation. I had no idea they used cats.<br /><br />The Human World -  I was not surprised to see depression listed as the most common health disorder, but was a bit shocked that Schizophrenia is not far down the list. I had no idea that Nuts were the most common allergy. Yes, I'm not alone! But people are allergic to fresh fruit and fresh vegetables? Yikes, what is the world coming to. If you want your child to have a more unique name than most of the population, the top ten name lists will be helpful. It was not overly comforting to see that America has the sixth largest army although we have the largest defense budget. Want to know the top 10 religions of the world? You will find it all here.<br /><br />Town & Country - There are times when the US does not make it into the top ten, so they have put the \\"US\\" in Italics at the end and also included \\"World\\" calculations for comparison.<br /><br />Culture & Learning - So the Internet population is at 940,000,000. Oh, then it gets really fun. They list all the top 10 books! I loved that the \\"Jabberwocky\\" is one of the most popular poems in the world and who hasn't read: How Do I Love Thee? Let Me Count the Ways.\\" If you want to know how much someone paid for John Lennon's Steinway upright piano, this is where you find the prices.<br /><br />Music & Musicians -When you look through the song titles, do you notice anything? I see a lot of common themes.<br /><br />Stage & Screen - A great section to browse through if you are still trying to catch up with the top movies. They also have lists of \\"leading men and leading women\\" and most of their movies or those that made it to the top 10. You can also find the \\"raspberry awards.\\"<br /><br />Commercial World - It is pretty shocking to read that suicide is one of the top unnatural deaths in the US. Traffic accidents and homicides make sense, but who would have thought that we are all so dangerous when cooking! That is the top cause of domestic fire. Well, Amazon made it to the top of the Internet Retailers list. Well, second only to eBay. You will no longer wonder why Switzerland is so clean and be even more wary of online auctions. The \\"Food Favorites\\" section was great. Switzerland is still eating the most chocolate and must all be on an \\"in love\\" high.<br /><br />Transport & Tourism - Anyone ever heard of the \\"Seawise University?\\" Apparently this was the largest passenger ship ever to sink. Seems ships sinking in 1912 make better movies. The Titanic is all over this book, in lists galore. Was pleased to know I'd been to one of the busiest airports in the US and world. But then again, who hasn't? lol Nothing like getting lost in Atlanta. Frankfurt wasn't much fun either. Dreaming of riding the world's fastest roller coaster?

The DK Ultimate Visual Dictionary is the next step. It is not a dictionary in which the words are organized with pictures in alphabetical order. However, you can look up the words and find the corresponding page numbers, so finding words is relatively easy.<br /><br />This is a book in which 14 sections explain everything from The Universe to Calligraphy. This book doesn't include individual sentences using the words. \\"It shows you what each word means!\\" There are detailed illustrations and gorgeous photographs in rich color. Annotations surround the pictures.<br /><br />In the introduction, they explain how if you wanted to know what the bone at the end of your little finger was called, a normal dictionary would leave you still wondering. With this dictionary, all you have to do is look up \\"hand\\" and you find your way to page 211. This is the section on the human body. Turn a few pages and you start to see amazingly detailed information. By page 230, you will see the hand in full detail and find a picture with the annotation reading: \\"Distal phalanx.\\" The \\"Visual Dictionary\\" gives you access to thousands of words used by architects, musicians, doctors, scientists, sportspeople, astronomers and mechanics.<br /><br />The 14 Sections include:<br /><br />The Universe - This book explains why the Milky Way appears brighter in the southern sky than in the northern sky. There are pictures of everything from the solar system to the individual planets, stars and black holes.<br /><br />Prehistoric Earth - Kids will love the pictures of the dinosaurs and the constant movement of the earth's crustal plates shows how the continents have moved across the earth's surface.<br /><br />Plants - This book contains perhaps the most interesting explanation of photosynthesis and pollination I've seen yet. Kids will enjoy reading about the Venus Flytrap or how a seed germinates.<br /><br />Animals -The skeletal structures and internal organs (mostly drawings) of a wide variety of animals are all shown in pictures. I loved the part where they show the hatching of a quail's egg. The rabbits and rodents section will be of interest to anyone who has these cute animals as pets.<br /><br />The Human Body - If you want to know where the organs in your body are located or are even just trying to name various parts of a body, this section is essential for writing, research and home study projects. You can grab this book and see what an instructor is talking about when she says \\"deltoid\\" or \\"external oblique.\\" The section on the development of jaw and teeth was very helpful in understanding how you eventually get your set of 32 permanent teeth. You see it all in a series of pictures. The Development of a baby will fascinate children.<br /><br />Geology, Geography, and Meteorology - There is a section devoted to minerals. Kids will also enjoy the section on volcanoes and fossils. I always wondered how caves form.<br /><br />Physics and Chemistry - A full periodic table and visual explanation of chemical reactions, light, electricity, atoms and force and motion are given here.<br /><br />Rail and Road -A Volkswagen Beetle is disassembled, modern engines are shown in sectioned view and the mechanical components of a typical car are shown with all the parts spread out across the page. The section on \\"Bicycle Anatomy\\" will be of use to anyone who loves to ride and fix their own bikes.<br /><br />Sea and Air - Everything from Viking Ships to the anatomy of an iron ship, jet engines and helicopters.<br /><br />The Visual Arts - Finally an explanation on how mosaics are created. The budding artist will also enjoy the section on painting.<br /><br />Architecture - I was fascinated by the Medieval castles and churches. Someone spent a lot of time tracking down the models for buildings from Ancient Rome to modern times. What a collection!<br /><br />Music - Trying to learn how to read notes or interested in the names of all the instruments in an orchestra? They even take a guitar apart and sow you a variety of acoustic guitars.<br /><br />Sports - An extremely detailed section on every main sport you can think of. The playing field, rules, equipment, everything is shown. They even have pictures of each type of swimming stroke. I'm impressed! The authors thought of everything.<br /><br />The Modern World -Ever wonder what the internal components of your Cell phone, PDA, or even vacuum cleaner looks like? The section describing the Internet was in itself worth the price of this book. Information on cloning technology, political maps of the world, time zones and metric-imperial conversions makes this very useful.<br /><br />Each sections starts with a table of contents and then every entry has introductions that explain the purpose of the illustrations and annotations.<br /><br />Since I am presently reading a book about health and the function of our cells, page 216-217 was very helpful. I first looked up \\"Mitochondrion\\" and was sent to page 217 and 239. There before my eyes was a cell in full detail. There is also a series of microscopic pictures of a wide variety of cells on the right hand side. The actual cell takes up most of the two pages.<br /><br />In fact, this dictionary has more than 31,500 terms and 6,000 color photographs and illustrations. This is the dictionary I would have loved to have had as a teenager. It would have made all my classes at school much more interesting.<br /><br />Highly recommended for teachers, libraries and families with inquiring minds.<br /><br />One of the most useful and beautiful books I've ever read.

It has an elegant and fascinating theology, an interpretaion of reality based on the Kabbalah, or Jewish mysticism, that many Jews find intellectually and spiritually compelling.\\" ~Sue Fishkoff<br /><br />On a rainy November afternoon in 1993, Sue Fishkoff received a call from the Lubavitch headquarters in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. At the time, she was not fully aware of the Hasidic movement and had never met a \\"Hasid.\\" Soon, Sue Fishkoff was traveling throughout America and immersing herself in the world of Chabad Houses. As she discovered the optimism and devotion, she started to admire their openness to the world. She was in awe of how Lubavitchers tried to consciously show love in every moment of their lives and noticed that while they did adhere to Jewish rituals, they were nonjudgmental.<br /><br />The author does object to various aspects of Chabad in North America. She doesn't like the women's sheitels, sitting behind a mechitza, the aversion to modern culture and their refusal to consider concessions to the Palestinians. However, the author says her book is not about the political involvement, it is a comprehensive history of Lubavitch Hasidism and an exploration of basic human kindness. She also helps to shed light on the shlichim. These are young Luvavitch couples who act as Jewish missionaries to areas that do not follow Orthodox beliefs. They set up \\"Chabad Houses.\\"<br /><br />Most of the book focuses on the daily life and history of Chabad. She tells stories of how couples set up on a campus and then work their way into situations where they are feeding hundreds of students, holding campus celebrations for Jewish holidays and teaching classes in Bible, Talmud, Jewish Lawa and Hasidic philosophy. There is intriguing information on the \\"laws of mikvah\\" that govern a Jewish couple's sexual life. It interested me and I went to see the site they recommended and also found there were videos of the mikvah \\"the mysterious immersion in water\\" experience.<br /><br />It was interesting to read about what the Rabbi Manis said about shaking hands. This religion has very strict codes of conduct that almost make it seem impossible to avoid offending people who are not aware of these religious beliefs. Although, I've always thought shaking hands was overrated. It would be nice to do away with some formalities so you could break the ice in a more natural fashion.<br /><br />There is a sense of comfort in knowing there are people who are dedicated to their communities and who believe in a God who cares about us, protects us and gives us our very breath. I thought Vivi Deren from Connecticut made some excellent points about how society has elevated career, money and social position while devaluing home and family. I've worked in Jewish homes while working my way through college and what impressed me most was the commitment to family. Oh, and the chicken soup was pretty good too. I even learned to make Challah and I am thankful I was allowed to experience the beauty of Jewish culture.<br /><br />While reading this book, you might almost start to feel homesick for a beauty so rare, I'm not sure I can even describe it. It is the feeling of being loved for who you are and of being cared for by loving people who are as concerned about your soul as your physical well being. Sue Fishkoff has captured this wonderful feeling in a book! The sense of connection and support is impressive.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewexperience.

And I decided, if I don't go, I'll always regret it, and if I don't go now, I never will.\\" ~Mark Nolting<br /><br />After traveling all over the world, Mark Nolting decided to return to Africa and travel from Cairo to Cape Town. He has been researching travel on the African continent for over 25 years and has even climbed to Uhuru Peak on Mt. Kilimanjaro.<br /><br />To get the most out of any trip overseas, a travel book is essential. It is even more important when traveling in Africa, since a safari can be rather expensive. Especially if you want to stay in private lodges with swimming pools.<br /><br />Do you want a private safari or would you rather travel with a group? Are you looking for gourmet European cuisine, local dishes or just wholesome fare? Are you looking for a romantic trip while staying in luxury tented camps or do you want to stay at a five-star lodge like Singita near Kruger National Park in South Africa.<br /><br />In this new edition there are over 50 maps, helpful charts and over 32 pages of color photographs.<br /><br />You will discover:<br /><br />Where and when to see the best wildlife.<br />Where to enjoy boat safaris, night drives, hot-air balloon safaris, horeseback safaris, walking safaris, photo safaris and even canoe safaris.<br />The rainfall and temperature for different regions throughout the year<br />What to wear - very important to get a pair of earth-colored boots and a high-quality pair of binoculars.<br /><br />Each chapter has a map of the area and a \\"facts at a glance\\" section. You will find information on the size of the country, population, capitals and official languages. Detailed information of each country is followed by information on the accommodations which range from deluxe to tourist class. There are pictures so you know what to expect. If you are looking for fields of flowers, you might want to head to Namaqualand from August to September. If you are looking for a dreamy tour along one of the most beautiful drives in Africa, you might choose the \\"Garden Route.\\" You can stay in huge resorts or find isolation in a game reserve.<br /><br />Once you decide what you want and where you want to stay, you can look up further information and plan a safari with The African Adventure Company.<br /><br />The author dispels myths about travel in Africa and says one of the safest places in the world has to be in the African bush. You can also go to Africa for the mountain climbing, fishing, star gazing, scuba diving, snorkeling, whale watching and even white-water rafting.<br /><br />You will find information on Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Namibia, Malawi, Swaziland, Lesotho, Seychelles and Mauritius.<br /><br />Additional features include information on the Latin/Scientific names of Mammals & Reptiles, Suggested Reading Lists, Places and People Index, Animal and Plant Index, List of Maps, List of Charts and a List of Animal Profiles.<br /><br />Mark Nolting is also the author of \\"African Safari Journal.\\" He gives you all the secrets for enjoying your trip all the more. If you are looking for luxury, you might not want to make the mistake of booking a \\"full participation mobile tented camp safari.\\" If you are honeymooning, your trip could turn into the ultimate Out of Africa experience complete with eating outdoors. I was impressed with the pictures of \\"Dining on a deck at Ngorongoro Crater Lodge.\\"<br /><br />After living in South Africa for 12 years, I can tell you Africa is one of the most beautiful places in the world. Everyone seems to speak at least three or four languages and everyone seems to speak English and Afrikaans. The food is also incredible with added variety and exotic flavors like guava and granadilla.<br /><br />Being a \\"cat lover\\" at heart, we used to visit the game parks just to see the lions. This bookbrought back many memories and even the \\"memory\\" scent of the ocean. The areas around the South Coast (Coastal Forest) and Cape Town (Heathland) were our favorite holiday escapes from the area around Johannesburg, which is a Grassland (veld). A part of my heart will always be watching sunsets from the deck of a house at Cyara in Hekpoort, South Africa near the Magaliesberg Mountains where the Jacaranda trees burst with lilac blossoms.<br /><br />If you are dreaming of an adventure in Africa, this book will be essential. Mark Nolting has written a beautiful book based on his own exploration of Africa. He has also helped travelers plan the safari of a lifetime. After reading \\"Africa's Top Wildlife Countries,\\" I'm convinced traveling with \\"The Africa Adventure Company\\" is the way to go! I was worried about traveling in Africa again, but after reading this book, I was very encouraged and have started dreaming of returning to my childhood home.<br /><br />Also look for the \\"African Safari Journal\\" to take with you on safari.

Like \\"Some Like it Hot\\" is listed in AFI's Top 100 American Movies and while it is listed under AFI's 100 Funniest American Movies, they save space by referring you to pg. 383 for the detailed information.<br /><br />This section also has a collection of \\"movie quotations\\" like: \\"I'd love to kiss you, but I just washed my hair.\\" ~Bette Davis (Madge), Cabin in the Cotton (1932)<br /><br />If you enjoy watching Foreign Films, this chapter has information about films around the globe.

To be honest, I was rather impressed with this collection. Not only do you see his entire life in pictures, there are many exclusive pictures you won't find in any other collection.<br /><br />What DK has literally done is given fans a memorable collection at an affordable price. This book has a classic feel while also showing Elvis at his prime. The truth is, if you've never understood the fascination with Elvis, you will after reading this comprehensive volume.<br /><br />This is a unique collection of over 600 photographs. You will find archive pictures, news photographs, autographed photographs, rare memorabilia, movie stills and never-before-published pictures. If you are interested in the details of Elvis' life, you will enjoy reading the detailed caption tidbits sprinkled throughout this well-organized visual feast.<br /><br />This celebration is organized into ten chapters:<br /><br />Child & Teenager (1935-1955)<br />The Sun Years (1954-1956)<br />Superstardom (1956-1957)<br />The King (1957-1958)<br />Army Days & After (1958-1961)<br />In the Movies (1960-1969)<br />Relaxing (1967-1973)<br />TV & Vegas (1968-1969)<br />Elvis on Tour (1970-1977)<br />Elvis Lives: The Legend Continues<br /><br />Since I have mostly seen pictures from later in his life, I was personally surprised by the sheer magnetism of his younger years. In a way, this volume spares us from the reality of his rapid decline by highlighting the high points of his life and only briefly touching on the later years. There is a list of \\"facts, figures and statistics\\" on the life of Elvis at the end of the book which will be appreciated by the true fan.<br /><br />Who knew that in 1957 Elvis was promoting \\"Teddy Bear Eau De Parfum\\" or \\"Elvis Presley Lipstick.\\" The pictures of \\"Elvis in the Army\\" are quite interesting and you can also read about how Priscilla met Elvis when she was only 14 in Germany.

It is so distinct, so lovely. It seems endless, and I can just listen. I wish I could remember it! This is my connection to the infinite, to the Divine, I believe. It is very deeply buried, surrounded like a pristine, secret garden by the dark forest of my imperfect waking thoughts.\\" ~Robert Murray Diefendorf<br /><br />\\"Release the Butterfly\\" follows the life of a butterfly and the journey of a musician as he becomes a master teacher. It is a guide to teaching piano with interesting quotes about the lifecycle of a butterfly. You really learn about two subjects at once. The author uses the butterfly's stages of change as a model for artistic growth.<br /><br />This book had my heart by page 8. By page 61, I was fascinated by the way Robert Murray Diefendorf draws you into his own experiences and presents words that flow together in lyrical beauty. At times his writing is a melody only your soul can hear. This book is truthfully a brilliantly crafted message from the heart.<br /><br />The author's wisdom reveals how he allowed an open environment for his mind to process ideas and information on other people's experiences. At times his sense of humor hit a chord with me and it occurred to me that you can survive a lot in life with a healthy does of laughter. The last two pages are also rather amusing.<br /><br />There are quite a few practical ideas in this book. Ideas I don't remember my own piano teachers using. I loved the ideas on how to encourage students to become composers and how at times they would play their creations later at their piano recital. Robert gives examples of how he encourages creativity and even sees the positive side of mistakes. Anger can become \\"edge.\\" A melancholy streak can infuse a performance with a mysterious quality.<br /><br />It is also interesting how this master teacher uses analogies to solve technical or musical problems.<br /><br />\\"We stopped and built an image of a rain forest. It was dusk, just after a rain, the forest creatures were still. She closed her eyes, and after a few moments, played perfectly evenly.\\"<br /><br />I often see images when listening to music, but didn't realize you could use an analogy to improve your own musical abilities. I love how the author describes his unique ability to visualize keys as colors.<br /><br />Robert teaches piano in Princeton, New Jersey, at the Westminster Conservatory of Music. He is also the founder and president of Small Miracles Foundation, Inc. that has provided free lessons, music and pianos to disadvantaged children in central New Jersey since 1996.<br /><br />\\"Release the Butterfly\\" is a reflective journey for teachers who want to emulate the qualities of a master teacher who has learned to synarchate. This is a study in how students can discover their potential through the combination of a teacher's wisdom and their own search for the innate creativity buried deep in the soul.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewforest creatures were still.

Approximately 10 percent of women experience depression. Of these, about 15 percent are so severely depressed that they attempt suicide.\\"<br /><br />During a time when you would imagine most women would be happy and fulfilled in their new roles as a mother, many women experience the nightmare of postpartum depression. While many of us have heard of postpartum depression (PPD), I was unaware of prenatal depression. In fact, this book presents five postpartum mood disorders that can also occur during pregnancy.<br /><br />Since depression can have fatal results, it is essential to get counseling. This book is not intended to be a replacement for individual counseling, medical assessment or group support. \\"Beyond the Blues\\" shows the reality of Prenatal and Postpartum depression. It is one of the most well-organized books I've seen on any type of depression. You can quickly assess the condition and find help, treatment options and support.<br /><br />The authors wrote this book to help provide critical information to psychotherapists and clients. Shoshana S. Bennett, Ph. D., founded \\"Postpartum Assistance for Mothers in 1987\\" and also holds her second masters degree in Psychology and a doctorate in Clinical Counseling. Pec Indman, Ed.D., MFT has a doctorate in counseling and a masters degree in health psychology.<br /><br />Our Stories - Shoshana and Pec show how they became aware of perinatal mood disorders. You soon realize the lack of sensitivity out there in the \\"real world\\" and can't believe we humans are not more nurturing. For some women, becoming a new mom can be a shocking experience when they start feeling suicidal.<br /><br />Pregnancy and Postpartum Psychiatric Illness - An excellent chapter showing how perinatal mood disorders are caused by hormonal changes. The authors explain a variety of mood disorders. Some are not \\"considered a disorder\\" but can be experienced by 80 percent of mothers. What I found interesting was the \\"risk factors.\\" PMS and PMDD are risk factors. This chapter contains stories of women who went through one of the mood disorders. I was shocked at how much I didn't know about pregnancy even after reading numerous books on the subject.<br /><br />Women With Postpartum Mood Disorders - Once you have analyzed your behaviour or the behavior of a friend/client, you can then find a therapist, website information, find people to support you, understand the value of medication and develop a healthier lifestyle. The section on \\"myths\\" was enlightening.<br /><br />Partners - You will be especially encouraged by the \\"What to Say, What Not to Say\\" comments. Learning to be encouraging should be an essential life skill.<br /><br />Siblings, Family, and Friends - A great chapter on how you can explain this disorder to children, family and friends. Love the list of \\"What you can do to help.\\"<br /><br />Health Practitioners - The authors present answers to the questions they have been asked over the years. They deal with signs, symptoms and treatment. This is just an excellent chapter for doctors who are going to be asking the pertinent questions. Later, in the Appendix, there are Medical Terms with definitions.<br /><br />Treatment - Yes, there is hope. Read this chapter to find out how you can use a combination of therapies to encourage a more balanced mood. It was interesting to consider the \\"impact of medication vs. the impact of illness.\\" It was very comforting to know that SSRIs or TCAs can be used during pregnancy. This was news to me and will give you a sense of security, especially if you have realized the risk factors involved in getting pregnant in the first place. The authors also discuss drugs that should not be taken during pregnancy. You can even use sleep aids? Who knew! This was very helpful. There are even charts showing what treatment should be used during what stage. Doctors need this information!<br /><br />Resources - A collection of websites and organizations to help you take care of yourself and do more research. You may also want to read additional books on this subject. A list is provided. The book ends with a helpful index.<br /><br />If you have ever been depressed, you know that sometimes just knowing someone understands what you are going through, can be very healing. \\"Beyond the Blues\\" is a beautiful gift to women struggling with pregnancy-related mood disorders.

As the reader, you will also want to jump into the book and stop the abuse. It makes you very aware that this type of situation occurs on a daily basis.<br /><br />The author can at times write scenes so vivid, you can't imagine he has not witnessed the abusive situations Amanda finds herself in. There is a true sense of horror and helplessness in Amanda's private thoughts. She is definitely the portrait of a victim. Fortunately she is able to escape.<br /><br />While escaping, she crashes her car into a tree and travels back in time to 1965. Not only does she meet the teenage version of her own father, she discovers he is under attack from his own family.<br /><br />When Matthew falls in love with his future daughter, this takes on a new spin. Amanda not only understands what her father is going through, she now has to help him realize he can't date her. Amanda struggles with her feelings and has to realize this \\"IS\\" her father. But can she save her \\"father\\" from killing himself and get back to her own world?<br /><br />Throughout the book there are some revealing moments and realistic letters written by Matthew explaining his life as a victim of his own father's abuse. The scenes are as realistic as any movie and the characters show a wide range of emotions beyond what I've seen in many novels. If any book explains the emotions of a victim, this book does so with startling clarity.<br /><br />Adam-Michael James has interests in acting, music and radio, however his first love is writing. This is his first novel and it seems to be based on his own experiences as a teenager living in an abusive situation. Perhaps if he could undo his own past, he would.

Success is no accident, nor is it unconscious. People who achieve their goals are almost always acutely aware of what directions they take in reaching their destinations.\\" ~Charles Stuart Platkin<br /><br />If you are tired of spinning in the same circular conversations, walking the same paths to the same unfulfilling destinations or can't seem to implement strategies to reach your goals, \\"Breaking the Pattern\\" might encourage you to remodel your life.<br /><br />Charles Stuart Platkin has discovered five basic principles you can apply to your life in order to make changes, reach your dreams and finally live the ideal life of your choosing. He used the principles in this book to change his own life.<br /><br />What started as a letter to a friend turned into self-reflection and through writing, Charles started to think more clearly. Through further interviews and discussions with friends and professionals the author started to find real answers:<br /><br />1. What's a Pattern and How Do I Know What Mine Are? - A study of self-sabotaging and self-paralyzing behavior. Are you choosing the easy path of substance abuse, short cuts or just making bad choices and finding someone else to blame? What are your triggers?<br /><br />2. Self-Evaluation and Reflection Workshop - A variety of exercises where you answer questions and then analyze the answers. One of the most important sections in this chapter is \\"Asking the Right Questions.\\"<br /><br />3. Failure Is an Asset Waiting to Be Discovered - Successful people seem to see rejection and failure as a reminder that they are still on the path towards their goals. Sometimes just having the goal and continuing towards that goal, no matter what, is a formula for success. The author explains how you can overcome fear and move beyond failure.<br /><br />4. Taking Responsibility Leads to Freedom - An interesting look at blame, being a victim, making excuses, avoiding responsibility and being the martyr. A discussion of why many people surrender their responsibility to a higher power.<br /><br />5. What Makes a Goal a Goal?  - An interesting section on intrinsic rewards.<br /><br />6. If You Can See It,It Can Happen - Do you have the discipline it takes to reach your goals? Ideas on how to set realistic goals and overcome obstacles in your way. There is a place to write down your ideas for short and long-term goals.<br /><br />7. Making Change Happen and Transforming Your Life -What are your values? Are you open to possibility? How do you find the positive patterns?<br /><br />8. Tactics and Strategies for Changing Your Life -In the final chapter, the author explains how our \\"internal commentary\\" can change our lives.<br /><br />I loved all the inspirational quotes and stories, the positive and healing environment this book provides, and the idea that short-term failure is no excuse not to achieve long-term success.<br /><br />Do you feel imprisoned by the past? Do you desire a more fulfilling future? \\"Breaking the Pattern\\" will help to set you free from the disappointments of the past so you can reach for a more positive future.<br /><br />\\"Breaking the Pattern\\" is a well-written and well-organized collection of empowering ideas to help you modify your own behavior so you can finally leave failure in the dust. This is a book to help you reach your personal, relationship and career goals. It is perhaps one of the most important books you will ever read if you want to break free from destructive patterns of behavior.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewexcuses, avoiding responsibility and being the martyr.

They need to stop expending energy and rest in order to recharge. Extroverts are like solar panels that need the sun to recharge. Extroverts need to be out and about to refuel.\\" ~Marti Olsen Laney<br /><br />Imagine feeling alone in a crowd, preferring a quiet corner to the limelight and feeling overwhelmed by phones, parties and office meetings. Do people often think you are shy, aloof or antisocial? If you are an introvert, you are going to completely relate to a variety of comments that are like fireworks going off in recognition of truth. Introverts can hide their talents and only show them in certain situations.<br /><br />Through reading this wonderful and often humorous book, you will be assured that nothing is wrong with you. In fact, there is a connection between Introversion and Intelligence.<br /><br />What is fascinating is how Marti Olsen Laney explains how introverts create energy in the opposite way extroverts do. I'm often drained of all energy after being with people for extended periods of time, but being with a book can set me on fire with creativity and energy. I can handle small groups and connecting with familiar faces can actually energize me, but after three hours, I want to find a more peaceful setting.<br /><br />This book helped me understand why I have deeper thoughts when I'm by myself than in a group setting. People seem to not know who I am in the \\"real-world,\\" but online, I have found a place to show my true self. This is apparently because introverts are more comfortable with writing than speaking in public.<br /><br />Are You an Introvert?<br /><br />Are you detail oriented yet details in public spaces overwhelm you?<br />Do you prefer small parties with intimate friends?<br />Do you avoid crowds?<br />Would you rather be reading books in bed in your pajamas?<br />Do you get tired when you are around people, but energized when alone?<br />Do you feel guilty about having to \\"limit\\" your social experiences so you can survive?<br /><br />Does your mind sometimes go blank in group situations?<br />Do you dislike being interrupted in the middle of a project?<br /><br />The author has divided her comments into three main sections. First you find out if you really are an introvert, then you discover how to navigate the extrovert world. The last section explains how you can create the perfect life by \\"extroverting.\\" This is just another way of saying that an introvert can also shine their light out into the world.<br /><br />After reading the list of famous introverts, you will see similarities in their personalities. The author also gives a list of movies to add to your \\"must-see\\" list. Marti also spends time seeking the in-depth answers to brain chemistry. You will also find out if you are a Right or Left-Brained Introvert.<br /><br />Then onward to \\"dating.\\" The \\"Relationships: Face the Music and Dance\\" chapter shows how personality types collide, how to meet the challenge and then how to appreciate the differences. Even by reading the chapter on Parenting, I started to understand extroverts in a new way. I find extroverts to be fascinating, yet at times they overwhelm my cozy-sit-in-the-corner cat nature with their tiger tactics. Extroverts just seem so aggressive at times. The world can look a little threatening and a party can be overwhelming.<br /><br />I love the author's ideas about how to be a sea anemone at a party. I've survived many parties with this tactic. If you are worried about what to say at a party, Marti gives plenty of solutions in the form of openers, sustainers, transitions and closers. Then she dives into the hazards from 9 to 5. This chapter will also shed some light on your personal relationships. Ok, by the time I read \\"Pack Your Survival Kit\\" this book had been more than helpful. These tips alone will encourage you to create a more peaceful planet.<br /><br />\\"The Introvert Advantage\\" is an encouraging book for anyone who has felt the pain of being an introvert in an extrovert world. Marti Olsen Laney also shows how it can be equally painful and unfulfilling to remain in a state of seclusion. Through reading thoughtful segments on a daily basis, you can finally start to find balance in your daily existence.<br /><br />This is a must-read book for all Introverts and the people who love them. The author has a comfortable writing style and you will feel \\"at home\\" and find yourself \\"completely\\" relating to her experiences. It is rare to find a book where you just fall in love with an author's personality. She is cute, witty and intellectual too. Finally someone out there understands!

By learning the basic skills of an organized parent, you can react in a calm professional manner so that you control your household, rather than allowing it to control you.\\" ~Debbie Williams<br /><br />If your home looks like a hurricane just hit and there is no storm in sight, this book might help you finally tackle your organizational challenges. If you just have a few things out of place, here or there, then this will give you a few basic ideas you can implement in your organizational wars.<br /><br />My mother's idea of organizing was to put everything in my room in the middle of the floor and let me sit and organize it for hours on end. Even after all this training, I still occasionally find myself in the middle of some disorganized, creative whirlwind.<br /><br />There are times when you might be more in the mood to organize than at other times. To use those to the best advantage, read this book! It is really about more than just putting away clutter. I love her ideas about writing down items you run out of on \\"inventory\\" sheets hanging in various rooms. It saves running to the other room to find that pen and paper and ...oops, you already forgot what you were going to write down. This is a great time saver.<br /><br />Debbie Williams presents an action plan:<br /><br />1. Let's Get it Together -You will finally have ideas for how to sort through the items in your house. I like her idea about organizing one room at a time. It will give you a sense of satisfaction to see your home changing one room at a time.<br /><br />2. Home Management 101 - A great section on managing paper clutter. I take ideas about sorting mail very seriously these days. One idea I discovered that saved me a ton of time sorting mail, was to get a P.O. Box. That way, I only get mail once a week for the most part and I take time all at once to sort through everything and organize bills, etc. As Debbie says: \\"Did you know that eighty percent of what you file is never looked at again.\\"<br /><br />3. Conquering Common Clutter - It is very easy to organize your closets. The author gives ideas for various ways to organize various items. I used her system to organize my clothes into various sections so it is easy to decide on formal/casual, etc. I like her ideas on \\"rules about inside/outside toys\\" and \\"one toy rule\\" to keep toys put away when not in use. Her \\"conquering kitchen clutter\\" was enlightening. I finally purchased a \\"chore chart\\" and put it on the front of the refrigerator. Want to remove some of that art on the front of the refrigerator? The author has some ideas about how to organize your children's creative offerings.<br /><br />4. The Organized Parent - Ever considered organizing your car? This chapter has ideas about mobile desks, diaper bag checklists, creating a traveling nursery, creating stress-free holidays and even ideas on how to save money when ordering Christmas cards.<br /><br />5. Office Management 101 - This situation is often a very highly specialized organization task, however most of us need the same basic items. Debbie gives ideas on how to consider the needs of all the people in your family who will be using this area.<br /><br />6. From Here to There: Effective Time Management - This chapter really makes you more aware of the reality of priorities. Debbie encourages you to define what is most important in your life and schedule time for work, family AND yourself. She ends the chapter with a discussion about goal planning and the difference between must, should and would.<br /><br />7. It's A Dirty Job, But ...- How to organize bathrooms, complete spring cleaning. Her ideas about freshening up pillows and comforters really do work and save drycleaner bills.<br /><br />8. More Help for the Organizationally Challenged - A list of books with ISBN numbers so they are easy to look up at Am land. There is also a list of fun organizing products you can shop for online.<br /><br />Throughout the book, the author gives Bright Ideas that are very helpful.  One idea that has helped me be more organized is just getting a big black trash bag and walking through the house now and then. I did this for years and finally I can hardly find anything I want to give away. It has helped me keep the clutter down and it is less painful to get rid of your precious possessions a little at a time. After a few years, you start looking forward to donating items to good causes.<br /><br />A cute book that is a fast-read so you can get right to all that organizing!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewuthor gives Bright Ideas that are very helpful.

There is a \\"Quick Reference for Those Who Face the Death of a Loved One.\\" In the midst of grief, this book could also help you quickly select various services and methods of burial before arriving at the funeral home.<br /><br />This is a book for people who are worried about \\"Death Care Professionals\\" taking advantage of them. The information in this book will encourage a more frugal approach.<br /><br />John M. Reigle is an advocate for consumer rights in the funeral industry. He believes people should examine all their options and create a more meaningful service for the living, with less emphasis on caskets, urns and vaults.<br /><br />While reading, you will discover:<br /><br />1. The services provided by a funeral home should also include finalizing details after the funeral. I was amazed at all the details that can be taken care of by the funeral home.<br />2. The wide variety of funeral service options.<br />3. Sample Forms and checklists.<br />4. A Memorial Service Planner.<br />5. Pros and Cons of each burial situation.<br />6.

There should still be some dignity in death. For the survivors, and for the deceased.<br /><br />However, if you are not informed, under duress or don't have the time to compare prices of services, you could be taken advantage of and feel worse than you do already due to added financial burdens.

There were so many great recipes, I had trouble deciding on which one to make. Lots of these recipes have a touch of sophistication and many use vermouth, sherry, white wine and cognac.<br /><br />You will find recipes for: Soups, Stews, Chilies, Beans, Entrees, Festive Food, Desserts and even Beverages.<br /><br />Finally, I bought 10 peaches and ended up using just seven, which seemed to fit perfectly in the base of my crockpot. I'd never used \\"Sherry\\" on peaches, but the facts are, it is delicious. The recipe calls for dark brown sugar, but you might enjoy adding a little Muscovado Brown sugar if you can find it.<br /><br />After cooking the peaches for 2 hours they were just perfect. I did try one after 1 hour and it was still good, but the extra hour helped. There is no time on the recipe, so it is up to you. We served this dish with whipping cream. You could possibly add a few pastry cut-outs, but otherwise, it was one of the most delicious peach dishes I've ever tasted. Plus, it was rather fun to make. I was a little liberal with the Sherry. The sauce is just buttery, smooth and sophisticated.<br /><br />Some other recipes you might enjoy are: Chicken Corn Chowder, Joan's Chicken in a Pot, L.J.'s Barbecued Ribs, Mom's Stuffed Flank Steak, Scalloped Potatoes and Ham for a Crowd, Corn on the Cob, Hot Fruit Compote, Cheryl?s Sherried Pears Served with Creme Fraiche, and Misteletoe Punch.<br /><br />All the recipes are very easy to read and some have \\"cook's notes\\" on them to save you time or to give you great serving tips. Each chapter has its own index and then there is a full index at the end of the book. Most of the recipes are on one or two pages and you rarely have to turn a page to complete a recipe.<br /><br />The author gives some excellent tips on how you can assemble recipes the night before. I had some questions about how that would work if the crockpot liner was cold, but I now have the answer to this question. I didn?t want an abrupt change of temperature to ruin the liner.<br /><br />Personally, a world without a crockpot would not be as cozy. There is just something so comforting about a meal cooked in a crockpot. Plus, you can cuddle up in your down comforter on the couch and watch a good movie while you are cooking dinner.<br /><br />All I have left to say is: TRY THE SHERRY PEACH RECIPE.

You always wonder what it would be like to live in an extreme climate and this book tells you about all the people who live in extreme locales from North Carolina to Hawaii. If you think it might be interesting to read about people living in towns ravaged by wildfires, erupting volcanoes or ocean storms, this is your book.<br /><br />Jake Halpern has written for the New Republic, The New Yorker, Commonweal and other magazines. He has lived in New York, Prague, Tel Aviv, Washington, D.C. and India and seems to enjoy visiting really dangerous places.<br /><br />The authors interest in people who don?t want to move seems to originate from a time when he wrote a story about Jewish settlers living in Hebron. When he returned to the United States, he wondered if the desire to keep one's home was more universal than originally thought. Jake Halpern has also been known to return to where he grew up in Buffalo, New York. As he says: \\"I kinda like it here.\\" The area is also inhabited by people who refuse to leave.<br /><br />Soon, he was writing a story about Centralia, Pennsylvania where the coal mines have been on fire for almost 40 years. He became intrigued by the thought that in a world of jetsetters, \\"permanent homes\\" still existed.<br /><br />In this book you get to vicariously experience the lives of brave souls who refuse to move. While the average American is moving 12 times during their life, some residents have said enough is enough and not even an eviction notice sends them packing. They remain in frozen outposts, submerged towns and other seemingly godforsaken places.<br /><br />Through Halpern's writing, you will journey to an underwater town in Princeville, N.C; The Lava-Side Inn, Royal Gardens, Hawaii; the Canyon of the Firefighting Hillbillies in Malibu, California; the Home of the Storm Riders in Grand Isle, Louisiana; and the Unique Indoor city/tower in Wittier, Alaska.<br /><br />If you get a job offer from any of these places, may I suggest this book?<br /><br />You can visit with Thad Knight who survived Hurricane Floyd and found peace returning to his old home instead of staying at the cramped gravel parking lot of the displacement camp. His story of survival is quite amazing. Not only did he have to get the power company to put his property back on the grid, he had to remove coffins from his lawn in N.C.<br /><br />The story of Whittier, Alaska is rather fascinating. Let us just conclude that if Babs Reynolds could survive her three husbands, Alaska is no problem. There is also some humor and stories of Brenda Tolman and her pet reindeers who try to escape into the snowbanks.<br /><br />Why anyone would continue to build homes in Malibu, is beyond me. Millie Decker has been fighting fires since 1928. Believe it or not, I could relate to beating the ground furiously with wet gunnysacks. I loved the story of the pet mountain lions!<br /><br />Researching The Lava-Side Inn sounds like a good reason for a vacation, although once you read about Jack Thompson operating a B&B in the middle of a lava flow, it gets a bit tricky. It is interesting how Jake and Jack have a similar interest in people \\"Living on the Edge.\\" If you think walking on top of a lava flow is interesting, wait until you read about what happens when it rains.<br /><br />The story of \\"Island Storm Riders\\" brought back memories. These people are brave, brave, brave! Get out the kerosene lanterns. You will also learn why people are buried above ground. Those who are alive are not the only ones riding out the storms.<br /><br />It was interesting to learn about place identity,Projected Dates of Disappearance, to feel a sense of homesickness for places you have never been, and to remembervarious situations where you could relate directly to the experiences in this book. \\"Braving Home\\" reveals the true sense of home and gives you the feeling that we are all survivors, no matter where we live.<br /><br />Halpern's \\"traveling to dangerous places\\" writing is fresh, witty and he has a real talent for investigating the forsaken. You just have to love how stubbornly some Americans hold onto that place we call home. In the Epilogue he tells how he returns to each location.<br /><br />One of the most intriguing and heartfelt books on \\"home\\" I've read this year!

Well, at least the recipes that use a crockpot basically cook themselves.<br /><br />My favorite recipe in this tiny book is on pg. 26 and is called: \\"Brown Gravy Beef Roast with Vegetables.\\" It is a spin on the pot roast and uses two packets of brown gravy mix. Once you assemble all the ingredients and close the lid, you cook it for 5 hours on high and you are done. The recipe says 7-9 hours, but magically this dish was done two hours early.<br /><br />The beef, carrots and potatoes were all covered with a delicious gravy and the entire dish was ready to serve. It did take 20 minutes to assemble the dish, but think of all the time you have while you are not standing watching something cook. Once you discover crockpot cooking, there is no looking back. You will love it. Especially in the winter.<br /><br />This book contains recipes for appetizers, main meals, delectable desserts and etcetera. All the recipes are sized for 6 servings unless otherwise noted. At the end of the book, you will find sections that include pre-planned menus and grocery lists.<br /><br />Some of the recipes you might want to try include: Baked Mozzarella Sticks, Grecian Style Potatoes, Chicken Pot Pie, Taco Pizza, Cream Cheese Dream Bars and Fruit Pizza.<br /><br />Brook Noel has a few rules for rush hour recipes.<br /><br />1. All the ingredients must be pronounced through the phonetic use of the English Language<br /><br />2. Each ingredient can be located in the market without engaging in a full scale scavenger hunt.<br /><br />3. No list of ingredients shall be longer than the instructions.<br /><br />4. Each recipe has to be durable enough to survive me, the Queen-of-Incapable-Cooking, and elicit a compliment.<br /><br />5. The Rush Hour Cook's finicky child will eat it-or some portion of it.<br /><br />Brook Noel's cookbooks are cute, fun and easy to read. Keep this one handy for<br />the Pot Roast recipe, it is a real winner.<br /><br />You might also find some of her other books rather entertaining:<br /><br />Effortless Entertaining<br />Pasta Presto<br />Family Favorites<br />One-Pot Wonders<br />Very-Tasty Vegetarian<br />Healthy at Home<br />Impressive Italian<br />Make-Mine-Mexican<br />The Rush Hour Cook: Weekly Wonders<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewread.

Can anger addiction be similar to alcohol addiction? Are there really biochemical changes in our bodies when we become angry, swear or pound things?<br /><br />Newton Hightower was once a rageaholic who tried meditation, pillow-pounding and other methods, to no avail. He kept thinking he could gain control and change his behavior. Through his own experience with rage, and the consequences of being fired and becoming depressed, he developed the Recovery Method.<br /><br />Did you know that children whose parents fight are more depressed than children from non-fighting families?<br /><br />Did you know there is a way to control your conversations. It is not only humorous, it<br />will be very healing for your partner.<br /><br />The conversation on pg. 45 is just a brilliant example. A man who is in control of his emotions, can say he is sorry and can admit to being wrong can be very sexy. Especially if he is controlling his emotions and making you feel safe and secure at the same time. There are ways to make a woman blossom and there are ways to kill her spirit. This book discusses both. Often, fighting is a way to say: \\"You are not paying me any attention, so I'll fight with you and get your attention.\\"<br /><br />The author offers:<br /><br />15 Behaviors to avoid when angry. Some behaviors to avoid are: \\"Speaking, being sarcastic, yelling, criticizing, interrupting and name-calling.\\"<br /><br />20 Principles to replace negative traits - This list will encourage spiritual change that will not only benefit a marriage relationship. It will help men live on a deeper level.<br /><br />11 Comments partners should avoid in order to defuse tense situations.<br />9 Ideas to help partners overcome their angry outbursts<br />7 Guidelines for effective communication with angry partners<br /><br />Anger can destroy relationships and Newton Hightower went through two divorces before he realized his anger was a contributing factor in the failure of his marriages. Surprisingly, he was also trying to cure rage in others and it was making their rage worse. He had not found the answers. He then decided that if rage could be increased, it could also be decreased. He found the answers through a painful personal journey.<br /><br />This book is divided into three main sections. The Introduction explains anger and also gives an Anger Self-Assessment Test.<br /><br />Section I: The ABCs for Angry Men<br />Section II: Decision Time for Women<br />Section III: The ABCs for Women Who Are Training Angry Men<br /><br />Throughout the book, you will find cute cartoons, great examples, enlightening quotes, conversations and statistics. I found this book to be insightful, truthful and informative. Now only will you find out the truth about anger, you will be enlightened in a new way. These principles can be used to improve communication on all levels.<br /><br />This book is filled with truth. As a woman, I can say that yes, it can take a long time to get over the emotional pain of being verbally abused. No matter how short the argument, it can leave a woman damaged and even suicidal. A woman will often just stop speaking because she has become that angry herself. I would rather hear \\"I love you, I?m sorry for what I just said,\\" than \\"I'm crazy.\\"<br /><br />Some of the conversations were such beautiful examples of how a man can take control of his relationships and really show the woman he is with that he loves her more than he loves his anger. I also enjoyed the wisdom gained from a variety of cultures and religions.<br /><br />Chapter four is interesting and frightening. There are women all over America who live in fear of being at home. It was shocking to learn that twice as many women are killed by their husbands or boyfriends than are murdered by strangers. The author explains how some men are Cobras and others are Pit Bulls. He also explains how you should protect yourself. There is a list of organizations to assist women who are being battered.<br /><br />If you are a man who wants to stop fault-finding, sarcasm, arguing, self-justification, rage and violence, this program might save your marriage, help you keep your job, keep you out of prison or prevent death. In general, this book can encourage healthy relationships.<br /><br />If you are a woman, this might be the book you have been searching for. Finally you might be able to have a conversation with your husband without being verbally abused and finally live in an emotionally healthy climate.<br /><br />The principles in \\"Anger Busting 101\\" encourage men to change their behavior quickly, dramatically and forever. If you are experiencing verbal abuse from the man you love, I can highly recommend this book. You will finally know if you should leave, stay and help your husband or seek counseling yourself. Anger will not only destroy a relationship, it can destroy your entire life.<br /><br />You can make Peace with Your Anger.<br />You can make Your Relationships More Peaceful.<br /><br />This is a guide to Peace. There is hope that you can calm the volcano and stop the destruction before it overflows into the lives of those you love.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewtrangers.

A Candid Look at Dating, Communication, Respect, & Sexual Assault Awareness	Books	5	7	10	N	N	Never give up your self-respect	\\"I asked my friends, 'How do you date?' and soon learned that the average male's actions on a date were not far from the motivations of a serial rapist. Males were assuming what women wanted and then acting upon their own assumptions. Our society was teaching females to accept this unhealthy dating culture.\\" ~Michael J. Domitrz<br /><br />Michael Domitrz is a nationally renowned expert on dating. He travels the country teaching students, parents, educators and professionals about respect and sexual assault awareness. His life was changed when his sister was raped in the fall of 1989. He started to question how he viewed dating. Over the years he created a program to change the way people view dating, respect and sexual assault.<br /><br />\\"May I Kiss You?\\" takes a look at more than sexual assault. This book asks challenging questions, provides thought provoking scenarios and presents dynamic solutions.<br /><br />Whether or not you have decided to wait until marriage or think you could never be raped, this book will give you the insight you need to not only protect yourself, but to protect the person you are dating.<br /><br />Michael Domitrz discusses body language and how unreliable it can be. He asks if you are sending the right messages to your dates. What is very interesting is how males and females read body language in a completely different fashion. While the male's reaction includes ideas about how the woman is very interested, the female's response will include statements reflecting her nervousness and how uncomfortable she is with a particular situation.<br /><br />Recently while watching a movie, the man asked the woman if he could kiss her. How often does this occur? Should it occur more? The author thinks it should. I have to agree that women will find this romantic. Of course, I can't see that a guy would have to ask each time. As a relationship progresses into various stages, mutual respect and trust will guide more than questions. Right? The author doesn't seem to agree.<br /><br />The author makes some interesting points about how you should receive consent or you could be acting under the parameters of a sexual assault. The emotional pain and trauma from a sexual assault can be intense. Victims can react in dramatic ways, drop out of school or want to move away from the area where the assault occurred.<br /><br />\\"Sexual assault can happen when two good people are dating each other and one person acts with disregard for the other person's feelings and rights.\\"<br /><br />So what do you do if you feel you have been raped? Chapter five gives you the resources you need to take action. The author says that you always have the right to say STOP. Personally, I think you should think about what you are doing way before you need to say stop! If you don't want sex, then perhaps putting yourself in the position of being alone with a person is not a good idea. A Mob Mentality is however something to consider. Hanging around with the wrong types of people can be equally harmful.<br /><br />The author also discusses \\"Weapons of Self-Defense\\" and shows how your body and clothes can be used as defense against an attack. He also explains how the body and mind shut down during traumatic experiences and shock can limit your ability to physically react to your assailant. Thinking ahead seems KEY. Going out with a group of ?good? friends on the first date seems a good idea.<br /><br />The author gives excellent ideas on how to avoid being raped. Something as simple as selecting a different time of day for the date could save you years of trying to recover from a sexual assault. He discusses a variety of ways you can stay in control of your body. Even paying for half the date will give you more power or avoiding alcohol can help you remain in control. Date rape drugs are drugs everyone should be aware of so you can avoid this happening to you.<br /><br />\\"May I Kiss You?\\" is not about whether you should have sex or not. This book does not discuss religious beliefs. It is about protecting yourself from having sex if you don't want sex in any given situation. It is about creating a safe environment in a world of potential predators.<br /><br />Every parent should read this book and discuss it with their teenagers. No matter what your religious beliefs, this book has information that could save your life. This book deals with the realities of our modern world and will give teenagers and adults the information they need to protect their self-esteem and protect the people they love.<br /><br />Highly Recommended for the Life Saving Information.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewng sex if you don't want sex in any given situation.

Are you playing games with people in your life who do not have your best interests at heart? Are you afraid of what you want most? Do you want to know who you really are? Do you want to feel empowered and healed spiritually? Do relationships make you feel needy?<br /><br />One of the most beautiful spiritual gifts anyone has given me was introducing me to the Caroline Myss Self-Esteem CDs.<br /><br />You will learn the details of why:<br /><br />1. People with healthy self-esteem heal faster.<br />2. The old view of self-esteem differs from the new view.<br />3. Wars are started due to lack of self-esteem.<br />4. Meditation is not the only answer.<br />5. People around you won't celebrate your empowerment.<br />6. Knowledge is not a spiritual practice.<br />7. Standing up for yourself can change your entire life.<br />8. We destroy others to compensate for our own fears.<br />9. Our greatest fears are being alone and abandoned and how we smother people.<br /><br />Caroline's teachings are healing, beautiful gifts for your soul. Heal your life, heal your friendships, start giving love instead of always asking for love.<br /><br />An Empowering, healing, spiritually electrifying journey. If you want to be primarily responsible for your spiritual growth and understand how to create the empowered self, these CDs will help you in your search for understanding self-esteem on the spiritual level.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2003-08-17

While children do seem to have minds and motivations all of their own, there are times when authors think up the most creative solutions to everyday conundrums.<br /><br />In sharp contrast, the most uncreative solutions include ideas like: \\"Putting your children to bed and letting them cry themselves to sleep.\\" Sounds fun for the children, doesn't it?<br /><br />This book is much more creative. Janie Peterson is a Child behavior specialist who presents a fascinating solution to the eternal question:<br /><br />\\"How do you get your kids to stay in bed once they are there?\\"<br /><br />Not only does this book contain a magical formula for getting your children to stay in their own beds, it appeals to your child?s magical inner world. That place where they dream, imagine and wish. Positive rewards work well for other teaching moments and so Janie Peterson imagined they would also work well at bedtime.<br /><br />Now, if there it a Tooth Fairy, why shouldn't there be a Sleep Fairy?<br /><br />Years ago, Janie and Roger Peterson discovered a delightful Sleep Fairy who helped them teach their children to stay in bed at night. Since then, they have shared this magical solution with other parents who then learned how to sprinkle a little fairy dust themselves.<br /><br />So who is the Sleep Fairy? Well, you of course. It is a job that has the rewards of: no whining, no tantrums, no arguing, no crying and no begging.<br /><br />The Sleep Fairy simply stocks up on a collection of small treats children enjoy. It could be as simple as a bookmark, sticker, ribbon, piece of candy or a tiny toy.<br /><br />The author suggests that you read this story every night when you first start to put this idea into action. Once your children are staying in bed, the sleep fairy then visits them quite often for two weeks. After this, you phase out the routine and tell your children the Sleep Fairy will only be an occasional visitor.<br /><br />The story itself has been designed in vivid colors and the text is warm, snuggly and often rhymes. Molly and Katie are the two girls in the story. They get ready for bed and brush their teeth. After Dad reads a bedtime story, Mom tucks the girls into be and Mom and Dad tiptoe out of the room.<br /><br />\\"Minutes Later\\" Molly climbs out of bed and asks for another drink. Then Molly and Katie beg for another story. When Mom and Dad say: \\"GO BACK TO BED,\\" the two girls unhappily return to sleep.<br /><br />There had to be a better solution, so the next night Dad reads a magical story. He tells Molly and Katie about the Sleep Fairy and suddenly going to bed and sleeping is much more fun. As Molly and Katie snuggle into bed, they have happy dreams and don't get out of bed.<br /><br />The next morning both girls find a tiny lovable doll.<br /><br />Reading \\"The Sleep Fairy\\" is a ingenious way to encourage your children to magically remain in bed.

Most of the Desserts are made with fast food items like Jell-O, frozen cheesecakes and Ice cream and sauces.<br /><br />As far as cleaning goes, I have to agree with his ideas of a \\"dishwasher\\" being rather essential. I still haven't tried the Wetjet Swiffer, but now I'm about to go buy one. Crawling about on the kitchen floor is less and less appealing as the years go by.<br /><br />Peter Wright shows a lot of wisdom in the last chapter where he discusses the pro's and con's of allowing children to help around the house. I had to laugh when I read: Show your children how to measure out the soap. He is referring to washing the clothes and let me tell you, that is one of the most important steps. I myself caused an entire room to be filled with bubbles when I was a child. I think we used half a bottle. Ahh, the days of youth.<br /><br />Hey, this guy even makes Risotto, what's not to love?

It is also becoming clear that our current programs and orientations towards physical fitness simply aren't working.\\"<br /><br />Frank Forencich has written a book about exercise that is primal, humorous and realistic. He studied human biology at Stanford University and has experience in martial art, functional fitness, massage and aviation. He has also climbed throughout North America and loves traveling in Africa to study the environment.<br /><br />The author believes that most books about fitness present information about weight-loss, nutrition, strength, flexibility or single-sport performance and yet ignore the history. In this book, the author seeks to present the core concepts behind exercise.<br /><br />A lot of research is very apparent in this book. For example, since WWII, he says the rate of depression has more than doubled and the use of anti-depression medications have also skyrocketed. The author might just be correct when he says we have lost contact with our bodies and the joy that occurs from spontaneous play.<br /><br />Now, the author does start with the premise that we have evolved and goes into detail about human evolution. If you are a believer in creation, you can breeze on by \\"Life in an Alien Environment\\" and go on to read \\"The Cult of Cosmetics.\\" Now and then the author returns to the evolutionary discussion.<br /><br />The author presents some intriguing points about American society. Too often, yes, we do focus on strict routines and workouts. I guess he is right when he says we should ?play? more. I myself miss a good wrestling match, the kind you had as a kid where you and your friends ended up on your backs laughing yourselves silly. There is definitely room for play.<br /><br />\\"When we play, we're excited and enthusiastic. There's no labor involved, no drudgery. We're focused, engaged and attentive. In other words, we're stoked.\\" ~Frank Forencich<br /><br />I'm imagining a workout video that takes this into consideration.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading his theories about walking barefoot. Often I will exercise barefoot because it does feel more primal. I?ve had foot injuries from wearing certain shoes and to me the barefoot life is sometimes best. I run about barefoot as much as I can, but probably because I grew up in Africa as a child. The fact that this author has traveled so much in Africa probably has influenced him. I wonder if he has walked barefoot on the sun baked earth in Africa. To me, it was bliss. I felt equally as blissful walking barefoot in New Mexico for some reason.<br /><br />I'm so glad my treadmill is finally fixed. Now I'm in the mood to go for a walk. I'll imagine I'm walking through a beautiful field of flowers in Africa. They do have those and plenty of them.<br /><br />I like the authors idea about putting your scale in the closet. That is where mine lives most of the time, however I do weigh myself occasionally, normally after a diet to see if it worked.<br /><br />\\"Play as if Your Life Depends on it\\" has some intriguing and original ideas. It is a book about fitness that will definitely appeal to your intellectual side.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewsed, engaged and attentive.

Mangrove trees with gnarled roots grew in the swamps and marshes around the edge of the lake. Bordering these swamps, in deeper water, were thick forests of rasau, a type of spiky reed, higher than a man could reach, and so dense we had difficulty poling our rafts through them.\\"<br /><br />Harold Stephens has written a book about Southeast Asia based on true stories and places. Some of the material was originally published in the Bangkok Post, The Asia Magazine, Living in Thailand, Signature, Travel & Leisure and Thai Airways International's in-flight magazine: Sawasdee.<br /><br />Several of the chapters in this book also appeared in the author?s previous travel book called: Asian Adventure published in Singapore.<br /><br />This land is so new to me. I've traveled in Europe and Africa and across America, but Asia has always been rather mysterious. Plenty of my friends have traveled there and some have gone there to live and have disappeared into their fantasy life.<br /><br />Harold at times uses great humor. Like the time he had to decide if stoking up the fire would be best to keep away \\"tigers\\" or if it would attract the \\"elephants.\\" Such a difficult decision really. I also liked his thoughts about meeting a long lost cousin of the Loch Ness monster.<br /><br />\\"If you let your imagination run wild, fear of the jungle can be awesome.\\"<br /><br />The author really does immerse himself in the culture, natural environment and each experience. He writes about his own experience and fills in the details about the history of each location.<br /><br />This book is fascinating.

That was the reason they gave, but there were other factors at hand which they didn't tell us. These we would find out for ourselves later. All we knew now was that we were going to a foreign land we hardly knew existed, nor did we know exactly why we were going. We made no decisions, and controlled no destinies, not even our own. We were told to pack our gear, and to load the ships. That was all we knew.\\"<br /><br />Harold Stephens has dedicated this book to the men of the 29th Marines Sixth Marine Division. He served with them at the Battle of Okinawa and during the occupation in China, as China Marines.<br /><br />What happened between October 15, 1945 and May 1949 is the story of the last of the China Marines.<br /><br />Harold Stephens is a brilliant writer who captures place, time and situation all in the first few pages. You are instantly drawn into this story. He is famous for his travel writing.<br /><br />In this book he gives vivid descriptions of his time on ships and tells of times when they were caught in storms for sixteen endless hours. His descriptions of the bathhouse are amusing. Then there are always the mechanics of eating with chopsticks.<br /><br />Harold Stephens also presents brief descriptions of the horrors of war. The sheer brutality of the rapes and treatment of women is shocking, even when you know how evil humans can be.<br /><br />He balances the book with stories of love and at times the price of love in foreign countries.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2003-07-29

Inside, they both knew they would find Ma's comforting arms, some warm food, and plenty of love waiting for them.\\"<br /><br />Evelyn Horan is a native Texan who has spent many years as a teacher-counselor. Over 200 of her children's articles have appeared in over 80 periodicals and publications.<br /><br />This is the first book in a four book series set in the Texas frontier. It is a cute innocent tale of friendship and adventure. Through the characters' experiences, Evelyn shows us that life threatening events can make us stronger and that even when life isn't going exactly as we planned, we can still trust God.<br /><br />Twelve-year-old Jeannie is eager to experience the adventures in West Texas during the 1880s. She loves her horse, Diamond, and together they survive many tests out in the wild. Jeannie is a bit of a tomboy who would rather be out riding horses than doing chores at home. There is an adorable scene where Diamond is a bit naughty:<br /><br />\\"Mister, if you ain't the most ungrateful horse!\\" she shouted angrily, rubbing her sore nose. \\"I come all the way out here, bring you sugar, feed you , and ...and ...\\" She ran out of breath. Oh! You just wait. I'll ride you yet!\\"<br /><br />She prefers the outdoor life and is an impulsive, lively child. When Diamond is stolen, she is not about to stay home. She helps her father raid the Indian camp to find her horse. Her mother is not impressed and thinks she should try to be a bit more of a lady.<br /><br />Jeannie's mom is a great cook. I was getting rather hungry reading about the Christmas festivities with pecan pie and blackberry cobbler, not to mention a two layer chocolate cake.<br /><br />This is not an easy life. The family members have to pick cotton, tend the livestock and do chores in the Texas heat. However, they seem happy. Everyone has a place in their little world and they are appreciated for their contributions.<br /><br />Jeannie's friend Helga has recently arrived from Germany and when they promise one another to remain best friends, they really mean it.<br /><br />In this book you will find out:<br /><br />1 What it feels like to meet a rattlesnake and a mountain lion.<br />2. How you survive a cyclone.<br /><br />This is a book for children and adults who enjoy reading about the Texas Frontier and seeing the courageous pioneer spirit in action.<br /><br />Evelyn makes a note at the start of the book about The Comanche Indians at the time. During the early frontier days, they roamed the grassy plains in Texas. She explains how they were encouraged to steal horses and raid settlers for food and horses. She also talks about how the Indians were given land and how the government now regrets how they treated the Indians during the early years of expansion. At the time of this story, settlers still feared the Comanche tribes and the author explains this fully before the story begins.<br /><br />There is a West Texas Map from the 1800s and this shows where Jeannie and Helga live. The locations of the Church, school, creek and Trading post are all on the map.<br /><br />In book 2 Jeannie wants her own horse ranch. She and Helga become teenagers and follow their dreams for a wonderful future. Their lives are filled with puppies and a new colt to train.

He knows he has to write her and tell her how he feels, but he is rather shy. After overcoming his shyness he writes her a simple note. Soon the two meet and fall madly in love. This story follows their lives through high school and then up their engagement.<br /><br />Then the unthinkable occurs.<br /><br />This is book will be interesting to anyone who is considering joining the military or who is experiencing a separation from the one they love. It also gives some insight into the thoughts of a person in pain. The way in which Charles is not able to connect emotionally shows how hurt he was. He probably broke a lot of hearts on his journey to find the love of his life. That first love he lost. How could anyone compare?<br /><br />Before I left, we kissed one last time to finish a memorable night. She whispered into my ear, \\"Never forget our promise. I will always love you.\\"<br /><br />A sad story of everlasting love that wasn't meant to last.

While it might be logical, they do say that children who did not have a best friend as a child grow up to be lonely young adults. They found that friends teach us about social grace and how to solve disagreements, not to mention supporting each other through stressful times.<br /><br />One of the most ingenious ideas is to develop interests that attract friends. My parents used to have birthday parties for us and bake really good cupcakes. That was sure to attract friends, however, I soon learned that often kids would be my friend just so they could have some of my lunch. My dad made the best lunches for me to take to school.

She also gives workshops for parents, teachers and therapists. She uses the ideas in this book at home with her own children.<br /><br />Cynthia makes an excellent point about children finding negative ways to get attention. She recommends complimenting the good behavior and seeing if that helps change the situation.<br /><br />\\"The more positive attention you give, the better things get.\\"<br /><br />This is a very organized book. Not only can you organize the behaviors you love, dislike and want to stop, you can also pick them right off a nice list.<br /><br />I also loved her ideas of \\"do say and don't say.\\" There are things that will encourage a variety of behaviors you might not want to encourage even when you are being positive. This has to do with sibling rivalry and making a child successful at the expense of others. Being compared to your brothers and sisters just isn't fun.<br /><br />You will also see the value of:<br /><br />Making praise a habit.<br />Making Big Tasks Manageable<br />How to use \\"Ignore\\" to the best advantage.<br />Offering choices (oh, this is a good one and it works)<br />Making a better behaviour chart<br />Setting limits<br />Time-Out<br />Battle Plans<br /><br />This book presents practical solutions to everyday problems. This is an excellent resource for parents, grandparents, teachers, babysitters and day care workers.<br /><br />According to Cynthia, \\"spanking and screaming\\" are not options you have to engage in.

Even science has shown the healing power of laughter. Cancer isn't funny, but somehow the author finds a way to heal through her own vibrant wit. Many of the chapters are rather serious until the end when she gives the punch line.<br /><br />This is a book about courage, hope and humor. Laura Jensen Walker demonstrates her ability to face the challenge of cancer and fight it with faith, hope and \\"mild/laid back\\" humor.<br /><br />I learned a lot about reconstruction, chemo and was amazed at how Laura's husband stood by her through the entire process.<br /><br />\\"How to Lose Thirty Pounds in Thirty Days: The Chemo Diet Way.

From the time we are born until we die, people and experiences show us a way to conduct our lives.\\"<br /><br />Jeanie Davis Pullen remembers how wisdom was passed from adult to child in a more relaxed setting. In a time when family \\"matters\\" were settled on the porch with a glass of ice tea in a easy, musing fashion. Her parents didn't have to be experts, they just learned from their own experiences.<br /><br />Jeanie is an educator, consultant and speaker with an advanced degree in gifted education. She also teaches high school and graduate courses at the university level.<br /><br />Jeanie has often been asked to give talks about child raising, communication and growth paths in education and life. She has raised two daughters who are now successfully living their own lives. Over the years, people also started asking Jeanie to write about the importance of an individual creating a responsible, personal way of life.<br /><br />The first story is about how the author is listening to her two daughters having a conversation in their late twenties. She began to wonder how children developed to this point. How they became happy, confident adults who contributed positively to society.<br /><br />In the second chapter we learn about the list the author made in order to guide herself in parenting. She wanted her daughters to have a love of words, be confident, have wisdom, be able to see beauty in everyday things and have a sense of wonderment.<br /><br />I love the way this book is written, it is really a conversation with the reader. I am pretty sure you are supposed to be sitting in a rocking chair on a porch while reading this book. ;)<br /><br />Jeanie really pours out her thoughts and they are quite refreshing. She explains how she discovered that respect was a huge over-arching theme, how she made time for her children and the beautiful way she taught her children to get her attention even if she was talking to someone (I don't think \\"mom,\\" \\"mom,\\" \\"mom,\\" \\"mom\\" worked well for me as a child.;).

I started to look at my life as an endless cycle of yard work, house painting, decorating and cleaning. Frankly, I was spending my time in a less than spiritual way. What my soul craved was \\"reading,\\" \\"sitting outside in the sun,\\" \\"going for long walks,\\" \\"cooking at a leisurely pace\\" and \\"healing my soul through books, yoga and meditation.\\"<br /><br />I just didn't know exactly where to begin. Selling our home was just the start of my journey to a higher place. It has been difficult emotionally because whenever you lose people, places or things, you are forced to grow in different directions. Growth can be painful, but is ultimately very satisfying. This week I finally feel that I am starting to bloom again. The plant that was uprooted is taking root in a new life and finally flowers are appearing here and there. God had to do some serious pruning to get me to see that my life's purpose was not to be consumed with a materialistic lifestyle.<br /><br />If you are on this path or want to learn more about a \\"less materialistic\\" lifestyle, then this will be an interesting book. It is a mild introduction into various freeing concepts great thinkers of the past have put into practice in their own lives. To pursue a more spiritual existence, you almost need to lessen your materialistic distractions. You might also have to prune various elements of our life in order to move forward in a positive direction. Yes, painful at first. But I think the challenge is very exciting and freeing.<br /><br />I can literally say I was in a place of emotional torment until I finally just let it all go. I released myself from the chains.<br /><br />Bruce Eric Van Horn has found humor to be a great way to break through boundaries and release chains. He has created a series of books to encourage people who are facing physical, mental, emotional and economic challenges. He believes that pain can be used to help you grow. Perhaps pain is just a way of telling us we need to find a new path. That the old path has come to an end and there are only thorny bushes up ahead. We could throw ourselves into the thorn bushes or we can take the nice path down by a lake and watch sailboats using the force of the wind to speed across the water.<br /><br />Eventually, the choice becomes easy. We can only take so much pain.<br /><br />This series of books uses a number of different healing modalities such as art, music, yoga, meditation and humor.<br /><br />Bruce addresses Materialism in this book. He also considers the following questions:<br /><br />What is the real American Dream? Is it Materialism? Bruce has another idea which<br />makes much more sense.<br /><br />What will empower you?<br />What is the key to financial freedom?<br />Where does much of our unhappiness stem from? The answer might surprise you.<br /><br />The Contents Include:<br /><br />1.Understanding Belief Systems that Bind Us to Materialism<br />2. Four Step Program for Individual and Organizational Wellness: Humor, Art, Music, Self Acceptance.<br />3. Relationship to Money<br />4. Financial Freedom<br />5. Enough is Enough<br /><br />I enjoy listening to the CDs while looking through the books and enjoying the cartoons and visual reminders of the concepts Bruce is presenting. Bruce has a beautiful voice that is calming and healing. He also has a wicked sense of wit. I especially enjoy his \\"inner comic\\" routine.<br /><br />If you are on the stress treadmill, Bruce's voice will slow you down to a peaceful state where you can evaluate your life and your purpose on the planet. He will also present some uncommon thoughts that could change your life. There are two meditations. One is a \\"Meditation on Thankfulness\\" and one is a \\"Sun Meditation on Wholeness.\\"<br /><br />I'd love to be in the middle of the field of wild flowers Bruce talks about in the second meditation.

Those in fast-track careers in corporate America are often overcome by stress.\\" ~Bruce Eric Van Horn<br /><br />Bruce Eric Van Horn is the author and CEO of Yoga for Business. This is a company dedicated to individual and organizational growth. Bruce is convinced he can offer society more as a writer than an accountant and I think he is corret.<br /><br />The CD in this book starts with a Yoga Workout.<br /><br />If you are used to yoga workout videos, this is quite a change. First, you might want to read through the book to become aware of the yoga positions. If you are very familiar with yoga, you will enjoy this \\"Daily Yoga Class\\" which combines Bruce Eric Van Horn's instruction with peaceful guitar music.<br /><br />Some of the poses are:<br /><br />Bending over Backwards to serve your customers (Camel Pose)<br />Change from the Top Down (Headstand Pose)<br />Firm Footing in a Changing Marketplace (Warrior Pose/Tree pose)<br />Global Vision (Spinal Twist)<br /><br />This is all pretty creative!<br /><br />There is a special section on the CD for meditation. I loved how he said that \\"your thoughts are leaves falling into a stream.\\" How calming ...ahhhh. There is also a Sailboat Meditation. I love the visual pictures Bruce paints in my mind. I think I'd love to keep sailing and sailing forever.<br /><br />The cartoons are also pretty hilarious. I think the one about Tantra would amuse David Deida although I don't think Bruce and David would agree on page 104.<br /><br />I was actually looking for a book with most of the yoga positions, so this has been helpful. I would like to say that you might want to read through the book and take a look at the positions before attempting to follow along with the CD. In a way, some of the poses are easier to do while listening than viewing anyway. Who can see the TV screen when you are upside down!<br /><br />The Contents Include:<br /><br />1. Why Yoga?<br />2.

Soon after a midlife crises, he left his \\"business\\" job to become a Yoga Instructor.

The Right Season and Developing Synchronicity<br /><br />In this book, we are taken into the area of the changing marketplace. Ships seem to be sinking all around us and often we can feel vulnerable and quite stressed. You can either leave the ship or encourage a healing environment in the workplace.<br /><br />I like the concept of \\"Spiritual Capitalism.\\" The cartoons in this book will be especially enjoyable to any employee or manager in the business world. If you are familiar with some of the yoga postures, the cartoon on page 34 is pretty good!<br /><br />Some Ideas I found useful:<br /><br />Keep trying different solutions until successful.<br />Change the type of books we read<br />Work for a company that has the same goals we do.

We hide it from those we love. Everyone has a way of dealing with emotional pain.<br /><br />Herb Orrell presents a book for those who think \\"they might never get over\\" their loss or have questions about why God would allow grief into their lives.<br /><br />When you are in the middle of a raging sea, you can't always see the safety of the shore. Your anchor doesn't keep the waves from crashing over you and sometimes it doesn't seem like anyone says the right things to you. Sometimes it almost feels that people are making fun of your feelings when really, they might just be trying to brighten your mood. That is probably not what you want in the middle of grief.<br /><br />That is when it is time to read a book. \\"Unspeakable\\" is a quiet conversation with an author who is able to explain the grieving process in detail. Finally someone understands!<br /><br />Herb Orrell is an ordained pastor who has counseled souls in their darkest hours. He knows there is a hidden stage in the grieving process.<br /><br />Herb Orrell speaks about the following issues:<br /><br />The Hidden Stage in the Grieving Process<br />Learning to Pretend<br />Forbidden Fruit<br />On the Tip of the Tongue<br />A Preexisting Condition<br />America's Self-Helpnotic Trance<br />Virtual Spirituality<br />Our Deepest Fear<br />Beyond Atonement<br />Unspeakable<br />There Isn't a Moment to Lose<br /><br />What if your grief could launch you into a new path of spiritual renewal and new life?<br /><br />Herb Orrell's book will show us why we look for meaning in the midst of trama. Why \\"meaning\\" plays a critical role in our recover. He also explains PTSD.<br /><br />If you have ever been mad at God, then this book will also be of interest to you. I have always felt it was healing to tell God I was mad at him, to look up at the sky and ask: \\"Why are you doing this to me?\\" because normally I figure out why and can take a new direction in life that is more fulfilling than the path I was on before the tragedy occurred. Sometimes it was a decision I made and sometimes it is beyond my understanding.<br /><br />It seems God allows suffering in our lives so we will love him more, not less. It just takes us a while to get from our intense grief to the place of feeling safe in God's love again. There is a shore and a safe place to run to but perhaps we have to pull up the anchor, ride the waves of grief and sail home to God.<br /><br />You can be healed from grief and this book will show you that it is OK to tell God you are angry. After all, even Jesus asked God why he had been forsaken.<br /><br />It has occurred to me on occasion that grief comes into our lives so we can realize how much we really do love God. Eventually you do start to see your pain as a way for God to change your life. This books shows us that there is still a God you can trust.<br /><br />Additional Selections:<br /><br />The only way I know to overcome grief is to give so much love away that my pain turns into love and flows out into the world.<br /><br />I can also highly recommend: \\"A Grief Expressed\\" by Marta Felber<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewurred.

Not only was it prepared under the direction of Shakespearean scholars, it contains an introduction to the play, information about Shakespeare?s life and interesting description of the theater in Shakespeare?s time.<br /><br />\\"The Tempest\\" is a rather mysterious play filled with monsters, spirits, clowns, lovers and villans. It starts with a magical tempest and ends happily. It is a magical love story between Miranda and Ferdinand filled with adventure and humor. This story was written when Shakespeare was about forty-seven and was his last completed play.<br /><br />Strangely enough this book helped me understand a book by Henry David Thoreau. He was talking about a \\"harpy\\" and there is a picture of one in this book.<br /><br />The companion video is available separately from Random House Home Video.<br /><br />Also look for: Hamlet, Macbeth, A Midsummer Night?s Dream, Romeo and Juliet and Twelfth Night.<br /><br />A readable volume for kids of all ages.

I'd not recommend it. lol Ok, reality is that there is no happily after. I am so tired of people telling me, \\"Go find happily ever after.\\" It doesn't exist and they read too many fairy tales.

Well this book turned out to be quite healing when my husband found it and decided to read it to me. I was more than amused. He took great \\"glee\\" in saying I was definitely the girl with the ponytail on the top of her head.

You can then discuss the emotion and decide which action is best when you feel that emotion. \\"It is not okay to hit people or throw things, but it is okay to stomp your feet.\\"<br /><br />Jana Cain's family posed for the illustrations and enjoy swimming, biking, hanging out with friends and now understand all their emotions.

He attended Harvard from 1833 to 1837. He had a complete fascination with the natural world and great literature in general. Life seemed to him to be a playground of thoughts. He draws from a great volume of understanding and his thirst for information seems unquenchable.<br /><br />If you have read or listened to The Iliad and The Odyssey, you will especially enjoy some of his references. He also weaves verses from the Bible into his writing in an interesting way and you will appreciate his writing more if you have a basic understanding of Homer, Shakespeare, Plato, Chaucer, John Milton, Alexander Pope and Emerson.<br /><br />Within this book you will meet a man of independent thought who is completely consumed with the sheer delight of discovery. To wander in the woods in solitary thought was a spiritual experience. He was also involved in a philosophical and literary movement which flourished in New England from 1835 to 1860. Both he and Ralph Waldo Emerson were at the center of transcendentalism and influential in American thought and literature.<br /><br />Thoreau's thoughts flow from one subject to the other throughout this book. The contents include Walden, A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, Cape Cod, The Allegash and East Branch, Walking, Civil Disobedience, Slavery in Massachusetts, A Plea for Captain John Brown and Life Without Principle.<br /><br />Walden - Walden represents our ability to follow our individual dreams all while being willing to be satisfied with less in order to gain greater intellectual freedom.<br /><br />Thoreau built himself a cabin on the edge of Walden Pond and lived there from 1845 to 1847. During this time he supported himself by surveying and growing vegetables.<br /><br />He rambled about in the woods and collected his thoughts in detailed journals. His friendships seemed few and far between, however the friends did make seemed to turn into deeply satisfying relationships.<br /><br />Walden Pond becomes Thoreau's lover. He drinks from her cool refreshment, swims in her enveloping waters, knows her every mood in summer or winter and observes her with the utmost attention as she freezes, melts and dances playfully in the sun. The descriptions of this pond are well-worth reading as he has a talent for capturing her very essence with his extensive vocabulary.<br /><br />A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers - Thoreau and his brother made a river voyage in a boat they built. This experience was the basis for his first self-published book in 1849. One minute you are reading about the river and the next you enter an entirely different world of thought about friendship.<br /><br />\\"You are the fact in a fiction, - you are the truth more strange and admirable than fiction. Consent only to be what you are. I alone will never stand in your way. This is what I would like, -to be as intimate with you as our spirits are intimate, -respecting you as I respect my ideal. Never to profane one another by word or action, even by a thought.\\"<br /><br />Cape Cod  - Thoreau made the first of four trips to Cape Cod in 1849, and he later delivered lectures about his experiences.<br /><br />Allegash and East Branch - A journey made in 1857 with Edward Hoar and an Indian guide who brings some humor to the tale. Edward gets lost and we see a side of Thoreau that shows his concern for his fellow human beings. He is normally just so independent.<br /><br />Walking - Quite humorous at times and explains his love for walking and for letting the wildness in man come out to play.<br /><br />Civil Disobedience - This essay seems to have been born during the time Thoreau had to stay in a prison because he refused to pay a poll tax. This essay is said to have influenced Gandhi in India and the civil-rights movement led by Martin Luther King.<br /><br />Slavery in Massachusetts - A lecture given in 1854 at an Independence Day meeting of the American Anti-Slavery Society.<br /><br />Plea for Captain John Brown - In October 1859 the abolitionist Capt. John Brown raided the federal arsenal at Harper's Ferry, and Thoreau spoke in defense of his character.<br /><br />Life Without Principle - Here he gives his views on rushing off to California in search of gold.<br /><br />This man's mind was a deep forest and his descriptions of nature are quite inspiring. Where else would I have read about a whale's vertebra being used as a mortar or been so highly entertained by his conversations with an eccentric elderly gentleman?<br /><br />There are also descriptions of shipwrecks and discussions about survival in the woods. Thoreau's humor will often catch you unaware and if you collect quotes, you will find quite a few.<br /><br />Since most of us will never build our own homes, cook over a wood fire on a regular basis or take our baths in a pond, this book presents a lifestyle we may never experience. You will rarely find an individual in your own circle of friends who would encourage you to downsize your life in a super-size world.<br /><br />The uncommon perspective presented in 732 pages will appeal to writers, poets, philosophers and anyone who values their thoughts more than material possessions.<br /><br />During the week of reading this book, I was inspired to take a trip out to the mountains, walked along a river, and worked in my garden with a new sense of purpose. The world became a vibrant, new environment filled with possibilities.<br /><br />Intense reading? Yes. A week's worth of reading will inspire you for a lifetime.<br /><br />If at all possible, read while this book while floating in a boat on a pond or while on a camping trip in the woods.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewthe American Anti-Slavery Society.

Make my love a hundred times greater than it is today! And let me love for love's sake!\\"<br /><br />\\"The First Love Stories\\" are beautiful, humorous and mysterious stories that go all the way back to 2500 B.C. Each story presents a different aspect of love.<br /><br />The Stories include:<br /><br />Isis and Osiris (Egyptian)<br />Inanna and Dumzi (Sumerian)<br />Shiva and Sati (Hindu)<br />The Song of Songs (Hebrew)<br />Psyche and Eros (Greco-Roman)<br />Layla and Majnun (Arabic-Persian)<br />Tristan and Iseult (Celtic-European)<br /><br />In \\"Isis and Osiris\\" we find love that is stronger than the forces of nature and the sunboat of a million years. In \\"Shiva and Sati\\" we find out how to tame the mind and the eternal dance of the universe. \\"The Songs of Songs\\" is a Hebrew celebration of the sensuous where lovers want to run to one another and run away. In \\"Layla and Majnum\\" we find the path of the soul and loving for love's sake. The struggle for loyalty is expressed in the story of \\"Tristan and Iseult.\\"<br /><br />Diane read these stories to adults by candlelight. How amazing it would be to have someone read you these stories in a theatre by candlelight!<br /><br />Each story will affect you differently. During some of the writing, Diane herself underwent a transformation. As she worked on \\"Layla and Majnn\\" she was going through a period of her own personal grief and sadness and somehow working on the story helped to ease her own pain. She was nourished, inspired and comforted by these mysterious stories.<br /><br />A Glossary is included to explain words like \\"Ankh\\" or \\"ka.\\" The Folklore notes at the end of the book are helpful for understanding the stories. For example, Diane explains how there is not extant Egyptian text called \\"Isis and Osiris.\\" She composed the story by choosing selections from Egyptian and Greek texts. Her story of \\"Inanna and Dumuzi\\" is based on Sumerian love song, poems and stories. \\"Psyche and Eros\\" is a retelling of the story based on Philip Shutz's literal translation from the Latin of Apuleius' fairy tale.

She then worked at The Washington Post for 25 years, covering social events at the White House. Later she became a theater and drama critic. In 1978, she created the Miss Manners column.<br /><br />This tiny book is a compilation of ideas from a lecture given at Harvard University. Judith Martin approached her field work in a different way from most social scientists. Instead of studying a segment of society for a limited period of time, she simply invited everyone in the country to write to her so she could analyze the problems and provide helpful solutions to perplexing questions about etiquette.<br /><br />\\"The state of American etiquette is, however, now worse than ever. Miss Manners is forced to act. I shall attempt to show what went wrong, and to propose a modest solution.\\"<br /><br />Judith Martin then continues with humor, which I happily laughed along with (out loud) right through this book. I had no idea she was such a comedian.<br /><br />She explains how America is a place where you do your own thing and guides us into the area of manners vs. morals. She can't believe how anyone would not be able to figure out which fork to use if she could go from using quill pen to using a personal computer in three days.<br /><br />This book will make you think about how you speak to people when going to a party. I know for a fact, there are many people who don't like being asked: \\"What do you do?\\" As if that is more important than \\"who you are.\\" Perhaps we should go up to people and say: \\"What is your dream? Who do you want to become?\\" I myself am more my hobbies than what I do to make money.<br /><br />I grew up in a country where children were seen and not heard, where everyone seemed to mind their manners, but in America, I often feel very confused about what people expect, because often when I'm very polite, they become offended by my sense of trying to be nice. As if it is not real. Manners online is another story altogether. At forums, it often seems to be survival of the fittest, which is why I went back to my silent life of reviewing.<br /><br />This tiny book has a huge helping of humor!

I am also deeply touched by the sheer beauty of the souls who surrounded Stephanie during a time when she became so very human and vulnerable.<br /><br />Stephanie had a dream for her life. She was pursuing a career and wanted to start a family when her life turned into a nightmare instead of the dream she had envisioned.<br /><br />After becoming concerned about a painful, swollen breast, all the tests showed the presence of a tumor. At the young at of 33, she was diagnosed with a highly aggressive breast cancer. Doctors said she only had a 50 percent chance of surviving five years.<br /><br />Stephanie refused to see this situation as an obstacle to her dreams. Although she struggled with cancer for eight years, she decided to get married, buy a home, earn her Ph.D. and even travel the world. Stephanie didn't give up on life because life decided to take her on a path that would show her the limits of her own endurance.<br /><br />Knowing Stephanie is a combination of Charlee Brodsky's photographs and Stephanie Byram's words. There is also an wonderful essay by Jennifer Matesa to give us a story of the medical journey without being overly clinical.<br /><br />In \\"Reconstructing a Life\\" we learn how Stephanie found out about her cancer and how chemotherapy works. We finally understand what causes the nausea and why patients undergoing chemo go bald and experience neutropenia.<br /><br />In this collaborative effort, you will meet Stephanie and learn about her struggles. You will see how she took charge of her own life and relive the experiences of chemotherapy and doctor visits through photographs. There are also beautiful notes from her mother, father and niece. She makes of list of everything her friends and family did to help her including telling her is was \\"OK to cry.\\"<br /><br />Stephanie had weaknesses and strengths and both are portrayed in this story. We are invited to share her love of gardening, the feelings she experiences as she wondered how men would accept her after her surgery, how she is suddenly confronted with her mortality and how she uses the experiences in her life to heal instead of withdrawing into the darkness of despair.<br /><br />A portrait of a woman who refused to see cancer as anything less than an opportunity to embrace life in all its beauty and sadness and learn from the experience. Her optimism and determination is an inspiration to us all.<br /><br />\\"What is my future: love, laughter, gardens, family, friends, spirituality, travel ...more of what I love in life.

He engaged in conversations about our best impulses, the optimism of a young country and the spirit of the American people. His quotes are little gems that shine as brightly today as they did when he first lectured in 1833.<br /><br />His thoughts made sense to people and some said his words made music. Even today, while writing an e-mail to a friend, I thought: \\"The only way to have a friend is to be one.\\" Where did that thought come from? Well, I just found it in this book! I am laughing now as I read this book because my friend said: \\"You remember best what leaves you\\" which is similar to: \\"We remember those things which we love.\\" Of course, neither of us considered that our thoughts are similar to Emerson's thoughts and yet somehow they have become part of us as easily as if we drank the thoughts in a cup of coffee.<br /><br />While reading this book, you will realize where some of your own thought originated from and I love the idea that \\"Books are the best of things, well used; abused among the worst.\\"<br /><br />I am also laughing about his ideas that there are no more than a dozen people in the world who read and understand Plato. Since I'm about to dive into a book about Plato.

Many are filled with unquenchable longings and some with such appreciation for the love of his life.<br /><br />These are the most widely read and loved poems in literature. As you read through these sonnets, you can see the heart of Shakespeare instead of the jester.<br /><br />You will probably agree that there are a few sonnets that are essential reading and the rest will provide casual enjoyment. The more you read them, the more familiar they become and the more you start to enjoy reading these sonnets.<br /><br />\\"Being your slave, what should I do but tend<br />Upon the hours and times of your desire?<br />I have no precious time at all to spend,<br />Nor services to do, till you require.\\" LVII<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2003-07-09

And the evenings often closed in brilliant, iridescent sunsets, kaleidoscopes of shifting colors. It was an enchanted land existing in a distant place and peopled by descendants of a remote age. To enter it was to step through the looking glass.\\"<br /><br />What would it be like to be a woman living in the Brazilian Amazon Basin? What if you lived in the moment, survival being a daily challenge? How would you set up your life so you had the support you needed when a man walked out of your life leaving you to care for his children? The women in the Amazon have it all figured out. In the first four pages you see the exotic beauty and undeniable reality of life.<br /><br />The authors were a newly married couple when they first walked into a Mundurucu village in 1952. This book was written in the 70s and explains life from the perspective of a female anthropologist. Yolanda spent time with the women who accepted her as a friend and sister. Robert spent time with the men and learned about the ways they felt towards the women and how seriously they took their religious beliefs. This book really does include both sides, but has a definite focus on women.<br /><br />This is a fascinating study of how the Mundurucu women humor the \\"mythically dominant\\" males, how they care for their men and how they survive when their marriages don't work out. It is a story about how women have found a way to survive by bonding with other women and sticking together through life.<br /><br />When you read this book you realize how universal women really are. They all seem to basically want the same thing. You have to laugh when you read how the women encourage their husbands to work harder so they can buy new clothes and are even quite willing to do the work themselves. In fact, from this book, it does appear both sexes are working rather hard all day long just to survive. Afternoon naps are however a necessity because of the heat.<br /><br />This story is also a beautiful look at survival. Of how men and women depend on one another to meet their basic needs. In the Mundurucu society, women and men took on various roles and responsibilities although the women tended to do most of the menial tasks and raised the children. Sound familiar? Well life is changing all over the world and by the end of this book, you can see how the Mundurucu Indians have already adapted to change.<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Woman's Day<br />The Land and the People<br />Munmdurucu Culture<br />Women in Myth and Symbol<br />The Woman's World<br />Women and Married Life<br />Women and Social Change<br />Women and Men<br /><br />The work of Yolanda and Robert Murphy encourages an understanding of women's lives in the non-Western world. It focuses on gender relations and the social roles women play in the Amazon forest. Yolanda explains how the women rear their children, take care of their husbands, form groups to complete tasks and keep control of their lives even in difficult situations. There are descriptions of bathing in rivers, preparing foods, gardening, feasts, childcare, rubber collection and all sorts of interesting facts about the lives of the Mundurucu people.<br /><br />While I thought this book would be only focusing on the women, the second chapter surprised me with information about the land and there are a few maps. There is also plenty of information about the men and what they desire, miss about the older cultures and how they even laugh and say that the homes really do belong to the women and in some areas the men live in a \\"men's house.\\" There is information about hunting trips and the crafts the men work on in their spare time.<br /><br />The processing of the manioc plant will interest anyone who has ever cooked tapioca. Themyths are entertaining and it was interesting to read their version of the Adam and Eve story.<br /><br />A widely read and beautifully written classic study of Brazil's Mundurucu Indians.<br /><br />~The Rebecca ReviewA widely read and beautifully written classic study of Brazil's Mundurucu Indians.    ~The Rebecca Review	2003-06-29

Have we suddenly discovered a lack of fulfillment in our materialistic endeavors or have we always felt this way but have only recently decided to talk about it?<br /><br />I have recently met more Multisensory individuals who believe we have a soul and who are striving for spiritual fulfillment. They see more than a world where we experience pleasure from our five senses. They also seem very aware that there is more to life than the American Dream. I myself have found out about the American Nightmare.<br /><br />We are looking for a deeper life, a life where people care about one another, where we all feel valuable, safe and loved. Compassionate and wise individuals are heaven to meet and can be teachers who present stunning insight and convincing arguments to lead us to believe in our own ability to find authentic power.<br /><br />To me, the American Nightmare is reaching the American Dream and realizing it is not everything you hoped for and your life becoming a whirlwind of things to do which just don't satisfy the cravings of your soul. Just because you have the big house, the car, the huge kitchen doesn't mean you will be happy. In fact, having too much can detract from your spiritual goals. Materialism can be a heavy burden for the soul who desires a world of freedom, love and joy.<br /><br />After downsizing my life so I could spend more time washing my soul with encouraging words, I decided it was time to go back to where I first started on this journey and read another book by Gary Zukav.<br /><br />I like his idea about viewing life as a school and that has become tightly woven into my own earth experience. If Earth is a School and teachers appear when we need them most, then Gary has been one of my teachers when I most needed the information he has to present to this student of life.<br /><br />I see Gary Zukav evolving himself as I read each new book. \\"The Heart of the Soul\\" is his most organized work to date. Theory and heart are balanced fully. Linda and Gary balance one another fully and together they have created a beautiful work.<br /><br />While \\"Seat of the Soul\\" and \\"Soul Stories\\" explained the basic principles, this is specifically a guidebook to the emotional world we experience on a daily basis but might have difficulty categorizing.<br /><br />This is really a book for everyone who wants to figure out where our emotions come from and where they can take us on our spiritual journey. To grow spiritually and act from a place of authentic power, we often have to step back and observe those emotions that are evolving from fear. This can feel like an ocean is pulling you under and you are fighting to swim to the surface.<br /><br />Gary almost suggests that we should allow ourselves to enter this ocean of emotions and observe the way the waves are moving until we can control the ocean with our own minds instead of letting the ocean control our bodies and minds.<br /><br />You start to realize how powerful your mind really is. Instead of running off into life and only seeking your own pleasure, you start to think more about how your actions would cause other people to feel.<br /><br />You become more aware of your intentions. You wait for your emotions to subside before making rash decisions that could change people's lives. Who has not made a poor decision when in a state of extreme anxiety, fear or anger? Waiting out the tidal waves of pain can leave you resting on a peaceful beach, observing the destruction yet knowing you survived.<br /><br />Gary focuses on some real-life issues which can make your life hell. These include perfectionism, addiction to drugs and alcohol, overeating, obsessive compulsive behaviors, idol worship, power struggles, searching for salvation, judging others, anger, workaholism and even sexual addiction.<br /><br />Either you can learn how to avoid the hell through your own personal experience, or you can be made aware of how to avoid painful situations in your life through a deeper awareness of what causes that pain. This book also contains illustrations, diagrams, empowering thoughts and authentic power practices to encourage emotional awareness.<br /><br />I do not think one person has all the answers, but Gary?s thoughts are definitely pieces of the puzzle I need to make my life more complete. This book would not mean as much to me if I was not already on a spiritual path and had a belief in a God who sent Jesus Christ to take the burden of my sins, provide me genuine salvation for my soul and who can take my actions from stray emotions and toss them into a sea of absolute forgiveness. I am freed from my guilt and can rest in the knowledge of a loving God who put me on this earth to learn how to love. Failing only means I have to try again. God is always willing to forgive. Learning from our past mistakes is just part of life. Not making new mistakes might be very connected to becoming more emotionally aware.<br /><br />To be interested in spirituality can at times only heighten the tests, create immense spiritual struggles and cause you to analyze your entire life so that you can then start to figure out was is eternally important rather than what is momentarily significant.<br /><br />You don't always have to act on all your desires or be swayed by all your emotions. This book will teach you how to create a better life for yourself by listening to your emotions who become teachers in themselves or at least are classes you can either pass or take repeatedly through life.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewdeeper awareness of what causes that pain.

The more we are able to love ourselves and others, the more others can love us. The more we are loved, the easier it is for us to love others.\\" ~Brent N. Hunter<br /><br />THE RAINBOW BRIDGE is a book for all people who are seeking a deeper understanding of the common ground between the world's major religions. After a series of spiritual awakenings and realizations, the author decided to write a book he felt would help others who are going through a challenging time or are seeking more meaning and peace in their own lives.<br /><br />Brent N. Hunter was born part Muslim, part Jewish and raised as a Christian. Through his life he has been practicing the pursuit of knowledge through spiritual studies. In this book he draws on the wisdom from Buddhism, Christianity, Earth-based traditions, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Native American traditions and Taoism.<br /><br />I was especially happy to find \\"The Invitation\\" on pg. 116. It is a profound statement and draws on a deeper wisdom of the inner world. While we often become distracted by our outer lives, what really matters is the inner journey. It is a beautiful series of statements speaking about what sustains us from the inside when everything else in our lives dissolves.<br /><br />Through reading this book you will also find a moment of sheer beauty. Mine occurred on page 108 when I read: \\"I am a star, awoken from its sleep, by the longing cries of mankind's dreams.\\" From A Child of the Universe by Ralph-Armand Beck.<br /><br />How absolutely beautiful to know that each of us are here because someone needs us to exist. The quote on pg. 115 was also especially meaningful as Trina Paulus describes what it takes to be a butterfly instead of a caterpillar.<br /><br />Some of the topics include: Life, Death, Respect, Service, Karma, Love, Friendship, Mystery, Power of Now, Dedication, Devotion, Commitment, Surrender, Meditation, Ego, Change, Peaks, Valleys, Breathing, Trust, Interpretation, Discernment, Music, Listening, Patience, Forgiveness and Sharing.<br /><br />The author has envisioned an international project that includes a book series, board game, television show and interactive website. This is the first book in the series which he hopes will lead humanity to a place where all beings are showered with love, compassion, happiness, joy, peace, bliss, ecstasy, appreciation, prosperity, pleasure, dedication, devotion, commitment and devotion.<br /><br />\\"You will manifest what you focus on.\\"<br /><br />During the reading of this book, I started to wonder about a few of the statements the author made. A few pages later, I felt like I was reading an interactive book as my question was answered.<br /><br />I am not yet \\"beyond the dualistic world\\" as I believe there is still right and wrong, good and evil and that you can't always make decisions from your heart. From my own experience, it does seem that if you always make decisions from your heart, you can also at times hurt people more than if you make a well-thought out decision.<br /><br />It helps to balance the author's belief of making decisions from your heart by understanding the \\"path of the heart.\\" If you are following certain principles, then technically you are using your mind to help your heart decide. The author discusses some of these principles.<br /><br />I also appreciated how the author mentions how the media is overly focused on the ills of society and that even in our technically advanced world, we still struggle with race issues, poverty and violence. And all we really want is to be loved and to give love.<br /><br />So why can't we experience this deepest desire? Why is the world filled with hate? Who can forgive us and who can help us find our way to God? While this book does not deal with the issues of personal faith or any particular faith, these ideas are worth considering in your own personal search.<br /><br />The Rainbow Bridge Translation team is currently translating this book into Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, and Turkish. It will also eventually be translated into Farsi, Hindi, Korean and Portuguese.<br /><br />I must also say that the art on the cover is perhaps the most spiritually beautiful cover I have seen. I also like the picture of the glowing emerald eyed Sphynx cat, Orion on the back cover. Brent's eyes also shine with a peaceful knowing.<br /><br />\\"The Rainbow Bridge is a beautiful expression of the inner child's desire for world peace.

They are about heart-connected sex and evoke vivid images of warm loving relationships. This truly is a celebration of the moments of beauty in the sexual experience.<br /><br />I love the way Natasha Josefowitz describes herself as a violin and how Robert Wrigley talks about painting his lovers skin with invisible roses. There are beautiful metaphors mixed in with bolder expressions of the real-life experience.<br /><br />I started reading the poems and within a few hours I had read the entire book. Each poem was filled with such mystery and beauty. I noticed they were arranged from the excitement of new love to the experience of finding time for sex when you have a family and then the book ends with poems about the autumn of love.<br /><br />If you are inspired by the universal experience of poetry and enjoy the mysteries of sexual love, these poems provide a healthy look at sexual intimacy.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2003-05-21

The woman has her feet on the accelerator and brake pedals. He decides where they are going. She decides how fast.\\" ~Thomas David Kehoe<br /><br />Dating is a journey into the unknown. Not only do you have to access your personal beliefs, you also have to equip yourself with dating knowledge.<br /><br />Men now expect a woman to call them part of the time, while some women are sometimes still waiting at home for men to call them. This can promote frustration as men and women struggle to fit into the new modern dating pattern.<br /><br />Men and women are traditionally hardwired for fixed masculine and feminine roles. In \\"Hearts and Minds,\\" Thomas David Kehoe shows how men and women are capable of using both masculine and feminine energy to improve their relationships.<br /><br />The authors has includes some intriguing facts and concepts:<br /><br />The Ancient Greeks had six words for love - we need or give various types of love in different stages of our lives.<br /><br />Is he/she just your friend or are you really dating? How can you tell?<br />How do you play the dating game?<br /><br />How do you make the object of your desire want you?<br />Does speed dating work?<br /><br />When should you call her?<br /><br />The first section of the book is essential in order to understand the terms used later and casually throughout. The writing builds upon itself in such a way that I was amazed at the organization and fluid association of thoughts.<br /><br />The book is divided into four main sections:<br /><br />Science:<br />The Evolution of the Human Brain<br />How Women Select Men<br />How Men Select Women<br />How Our Ancestors Lived<br />Monogamy and Polygamy<br />Hormones<br />Communication Styles<br /><br />Life Stages:<br />Childhood - Seeking Unconditional Love<br />Adolescence-Seeking Romantic Love<br />Adulthood-Families and Forgiveness<br />Agape-Altruistic Love<br /><br />Relationships:<br />Where Couples Met<br />Flirting<br />How to Write a Personal Ad<br />Dating<br />Sex<br />Becoming a Couple<br />Conflict in Relationships<br /><br />Archetypes:<br /><br />Emotional Control Systems<br />Zeus-Hera<br />Poseidon-Athena<br />Apollo-Artemis<br />Hermes-Hestia<br />Ares-Hephaestus-Aphrodite<br />Dionysus-Demeter<br />Hades-Persephone<br /><br />The Archetypes section is fascinating. You will be able to analyze your own relationships. There are 7 couples to analyze. These personality types have become recognizable through history and here these archetypes appear in the ancient world as gods. They are amazingly true!<br /><br />I also enjoyed the humor in this book. There was one point when I was laughing so hard I could hardly see the page. Thomas David Kehoe displays great creativity and has a wicked streak of wit. The scientific explanations made complete sense.

You will be able to analyze your own relationships. There are 7 couples to analyze.

The scientific explanations made complete sense. You will find wonderful quotes, entire passages and bold headings that organize the thoughts beautifully.

I want to work myself like a silken thread in a web to which I belong.\\" ~Denise Bissonnette<br /><br />Through creative writing, Denise encourages the individual to traverse the unknown and to start a journey into the world of soul. The place inside us longing to discover, inquire, solve mysteries, be surprised, awaken to passion or live in a place of fulfillment and purpose.<br /><br />The feather on the cover seems to be symbolizing the individual or perhaps a writing tool through which we communicate. I also think this symbolizes our ability to fly. This illuminating guide while help you live a more soulful life. \\"The Wholehearted Journey\\" will encourage you to leave your path in the world of the mundane and fly in the world of inspiration.<br /><br />The experience while reading this book is similar to being captivated by a speaker who has found a way to communicate with your soul. In fact Denise is an internationally renowned writer, impassioned trainer and speaker.<br /><br />In this work, she draws on an eclectic array of sources. Her work is also enriched with quotations from inspirational writers, teachers, poets, spiritual leaders and philosophers. There are over 500 quotes! There is nothing I love more than to find a book filled with stories, quotes, poems and divine metaphors. Denise is not only a poet when writing her poems. The way she sees life is truly beautiful.<br /><br />I loved the themes of the 20 chapters:<br /><br />I Dedicate This Day: Bringing the Sacred into the Everyday<br />Unlived Dreams and Rising Bread: Shaping Fresh Hope from New Dreams<br />Arriving: Embracing the Unknown<br />Nurture Your Nature: Celebrating Your Gifts<br />Rekindle the Flame: Restoring Purpose and Passion<br />The Masquerade: Befriending Yourself and Others<br />New Wings: Moving Through Fear<br />Lessons from the Apple Tree: Accepting Change<br />Meadowlarks: Renewing the Joy of Giving<br />The Puppeteer: Pulling Your Own Strings<br />The Beauty of Today: Seizing the Day<br />The Journey to Belong: Employing Your Inner Compass<br />On Second Thought: Harnessing Perspective<br />At the Feet of the World: Becoming More Teachable<br />A Heart Contained: Choosing Joy<br />I want to Live in Color: Living Wholeheartedly<br />Not One Alike: Valuing your Part in the Whole<br />Rhythm: Cultivating Balance in Life and Work<br />Veil of Wonder: Seeing through New Eyes<br />A Pilgrim's Plea: Remaining True to the Soul<br /><br />Denise starts each chapter with an original poem, she then reflects on the concepts presented in the poem and presents additional passages and quotes for reflection. There are stories which present profound wisdom in only a few lines, quotes teaching truly interesting concepts and insights to inspire you in your own writing or journey. There is a page after each chapter for your own notes.<br /><br />Her original poems are something she receives, not something she crafts. That is very true when writing poetry. While many poets seem to be writing in a code only they understand, Denise's poems are written with an open heart and a focus on reality.<br /><br />Her creativity spills onto the pages in a refreshing stream. Her focus is not only on the outer world. She has an honest and deep desire to share what she has learned so the reader can enter the inner world. The place where your most important journey occurs.<br /><br />\\"For each of us must travel<br />the uncharted seas of our lives, alone.<br />yet, blessedly, together, side by side.<br /><br />Trusting that inner compass of hope<br />and courage and imagination.<br />Never forgetting that<br />when we bring heart to the journey,<br />we make it holy.<br />When we bring heart to the journey,<br />we will not lose sight of the brilliant<br />stars in the immense night sky.\\"<br /><br />What makes this book truly life changing is the \\"To Ponder and Practice\\" sections. After reading each chapter you have the opportunity to reflect on your own life and make notes that will guide you to a more fulfilled existence.<br /><br />Through the chapters, you will learn how to live in the hear and there, dedicate your days, put your imagination to work, kick the habit of comparison, embrace your limitations and potential, celebrate the differences of your gifts, believe in invisible forces, befriend the dragon, soar on wings of choice, take the unknown one piece at a time, claim your power, seize the present day, rest in the warm pockets of the world, harness the power of perspective, recognize your teachers, cultivate joy, refuse to be tamed by the world, practiced compassion, make balance a priority, recognize your path and so much more!<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the \\"lessons from the apple tree\\" because my grandmother always made pies from an apple tree in her backyard. There are actually two parts to the poem in this chapter. One is written by Denise and one is \\"humorously\\" written by the Apple Tree. In this same chapter, Denise gives us one of many gifts. She retells a story she told to her daughter about a rose bush. I found this interesting and meaningful as my grandmother's yard was also filled with rose bushes.<br /><br />I spent about five evenings reading this book and found it to be healing and inspirational. Each evening I climbed into bed and lost myself in the pages for hours at a time. You could also read one chapter a day for 20 days or only read one chapter a week. Once you start reading this book, it will be difficult not to want to keep reading all night long!<br /><br />I think this book will come into your life when you need it most. Don't all books arrive just when you need them? I am definitely going to add many of the books the author mentioned to my reading list.<br /><br />In fact, while reading this book, many things were going on in my life and I found it very interesting how I would read a chapter and feel as if this book had been sent to me by an angel to help me understand certain situations.

For as human knowledge grows, it encompasses other cultures and other ways of thinking. This expansion of awareness cannot but convince people of the truth and beauty of other great religious teachings.\\" ~Swami Kriyananda<br /><br />Although J. Donald Walters was raised as an Episcopalian, he was later initiated into an Indian monastic order and took the spiritual name, Swami Kriyananda. Through his teaching he challenges the reader to attain a deeper form of belief. He often contrasts real spirituality with the outward show of pomp and ceremony.<br /><br />The author encourages a deeper understanding of what you believe. It is not enough to say you believe, you must \\"live out your faith.\\"<br /><br />I've been very impressed with his \\"Secrets of\\" series. They are little books that can really help you change the way you are thinking so you can be more successful, peaceful or fulfilled as a human being living on this uncertain planet.<br /><br />In all the uncertainty, J. Donald Walters brings us to some of the most important ideas Jesus taught and compares them with teachings in the Bhagavad Gita. Walters explains the Bible in ways you can't even imagine are possible. Yet, in the end it makes complete sense. I loved his explanation of how God is the \\"Word.\\"<br /><br />J. Donald Walters says that everything in this book is consistent with Paramhansa Yoganda's actual writing, so he says it is not really his book, but rather a disciples attempt to present his guru's teachings in a way as to reach a wider audience. Yogananda's mission is to show the underlying oneness of the Holy Bible and the Bhagavad Gita.<br /><br />The Bhagavad Gita is a conversation between Krishna (representing God) and Arjuna (a devotee/aspirant toward divine union). I was amazed by the sheer poetic beauty of the text.<br /><br />The Contents Include:<br /><br />Part I - The Eternal Christ<br />The Eternal Word: Key to Manifested Existence<br />What is the Source of Life?<br /><br />Why is the Light \\"Incomprehensible\\" to Darkness?<br />The Incarnation<br />\\"The Only Begotten\\" - Why?<br />Receptivity: they key to Spiritual Development<br />Divine Grace vs. Divine Law<br />Can God Be Know?<br /><br />Part II - The Instruments of Recognition<br />How to Study the Scriptures<br />Finding a True Teacher<br />How to Relate to a Master<br />Heaven Is Our Birthright!<br />Imperfection Is of the Ego- Perfection Is of the Soul<br /><br />Part III- Son of Man: Son of God?<br />Who is This Son of Man?<br />Resurrection, and the Meaning of Divine Tests<br /><br />Part IV- The Soul's Ascent<br />The Way Beckons<br />\\"Works\\" That Lead to Perfection<br />\\"Be Ye Therefore Perfect!\\"<br />Restlessness vs. God-Centeredness<br />The \\"On Thing Needful.\\"<br />The Inner Way of Pilgrimage<br />The Inner Kingdom<br />How Devotees Fall<br />How Devotess Can Rise Again<br />The Eternal Present<br />The Redeeming Light<br /><br />Index of Bible Quotations<br />Index of Bhagavad Gita Quotations<br />Index of Quotations by Paramhansa Yogananda<br /><br />Most of the book does seem to focus on the teachings of Christ. It is important to note that the author believes in reincarnation. Rather interesting theories on this subject. He also has some thoughts on Astrology and its origins. There are ideas you may accept or reject, however the explanations are always entertaining and often enlightening.<br /><br />He talks about the Divine Consciousness which is the true life which enlightens human minds and speaks of a time where there will be more cooperation's between the world's religions. He seems to promote a unity of all religious beliefs and explains how the quest for divine truth is the essence of all religions.<br /><br />\\"Love is not great because Jesus loved. Jesus, rather was great because he demonstrated so perfectly the quality of love.\\" pg. 25<br /><br />Is there a way to know all the happiness and fulfillment you have ever craved?<br />Should our goal in life be to know God?<br />What is the Christ Consciousness?<br />Who can satisfy our deepest longing for divine love?<br />What did Jesus really mean when he said: \\"Let the dead bury the dead.\\"<br />How long should you meditate?<br /><br />In a time when religion has become one of the most neglected of human concerns, this book will help to recharge your soul and lift up your spiritual consciousness.<br /><br />A fascinating explanation of ancient scriptures.

Donald Walters give some very unique ideas, he draws on deep principles and is a keen observer of human interaction.<br /><br />The Secret Books are part of a series of \\"seed thoughts.\\" Two pages are offered for a day of the month. You can read the saying several times and with each repetition, the words will become absorbed more deeply into your subconscious.<br /><br />J. Donald Walters starts the book in a practical way by giving the first secret and explaining the type of friends you want to choose. If your friends are not sincere and loyal then you may be pouring your life into leaking vessels and find your time essentially spent mopping up spills.<br /><br />Besides marriage, keeping friendships vibrant, alive and interesting may be one of the most difficult tasks. You really do have to work at being a good friend. The best friends are very accepting of you as a soul and are willing to help you overcome your perilous ways. In fact, they care enough to tell you the truth even if it hurts. Although, at times we tend to like the friends who baby us and shield us from the truth. We like some friends to be a refuge from the storm.<br /><br />The author presents Friendship in an open and free way.<br /><br />\\"The secret of friendship is accepting your friends as they are, and not trying to re-create them in your image, or according to your own desires.\\" -Day Nine<br /><br />[[ASIN:1565890442 Secrets of Emotional Healing (Secrets Gift Book)]]<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2003-03-26

Lest anyone think I am reviewing the same book, the last one was 132 pages ; Dimensions (in inches): 0.52 x 5.30 x 5.36.<br /><br />After finding this version, I think the smaller book is my new favorite. Not only is it much cuter, you can easily put it in a small purse or keep it in the pocket of your favorite coat.<br /><br />I was looking for a copy of the original book for a relative and found the smaller book. This is an example of when less is more. For some reason, I enjoyed reading this book more than the larger version. Perhaps it seems easier to absorb the information in smaller bites.<br /><br />Some of my favorite quotes:<br /><br />\\"Become a master of words.\\"<br /><br />\\"To change our lives, we must first change our minds.\\"<br /><br />\\"The surest path is one dedicated to a greater cause.\\"<br /><br />I believe these must be the words of Taro Gold who writes extensively for Buddhist publications. Taro Gold has spent much of his life living overseas. He has traveled to over thirty countries and has lived in Australia, Spain and Japan. His thoughts reflect deep contemplation over life's purpose and how to live on this planet to encourage happiness in those around us.<br /><br />For instance, he says: \\"Do something today to improve someone else's life.\\" This could be easily accomplished by buying a book for all your friends and relatives for \\"just because\\" presents. I'm sending this to a relative on Monday who I think will just love the mini version.<br /><br />Often I think we shelter ourselves from the wisdom of other cultures, religions and when we are more open to reading selections and thoughts, we can then deepen our own beliefs and add a beautiful new meaning to our lives. There are many universal truths and many are presented in this tiny book.<br /><br />I love the page about achieving goals and the list of how negative actions arise from one or more of fourteen categories. The story about the stranded starfish being saved by a little boy is a beautiful way to illustrate hope.<br /><br />It does seem we have been put on this planet to test our souls. This is a beautiful book which provides guidance and hope.

This is more of a textbook than a book you can simply enjoy reading one afternoon on the couch. It is a hefty 553 pages plus Index. This is for the serious student or overly ambitious cook. I read it because I'm darn curious.<br /><br />This book took me about a week to read. It is extremely well written and yet somewhat dry in places with the occasional oasis. You cannot skim over the pages, you have to analyze the sentences at times and then look up a few words here and there. I also thought the organization of the essays could have been greatly improved to provide more interesting reading. I wanted maps, timelines and perhaps more pictures of actual food from the time periods. There are a few pictures of famous art displaying food.<br /><br />While reading, you will soon realize how fortunate we are to live in America in the present day. In general, the world has not eaten very well according to the descriptions in this book.<br /><br />Some comments on the essays:<br /><br />Some of the authors neglect to take religious beliefs into consideration when they discusses why man became an omnivore although he does touch on some facts about the Ancient Hebrews.<br /><br />Evolution is presented as a \\"fact,\\" while creation is presented as a \\"myth.\\" I feel we have more evidence that points towards a creator and evolution seems somewhat illogical to me at least. Cooked meat is a natural byproduct of forest fires? Oh, I had a good laugh over that one. Sure, it could have happened, but what about considering what we do know about the past.<br /><br />What about cooked meat being a natural result of sacrifices to the creator or even a goddess? I guess it is just a different way of looking at the past. I'd say you should take the first few chapters with a grain of \\"Fleur de Sel/French Sea Salt.\\"<br /><br />Francis Joannes writes a wonderful essay on \\"The Social Function of Banquets in the Earliest Civilizations\\" and mentions the epic of Gilgamesh and explains some details about a marriage in Assyria.<br /><br />Jean Soler writes a fascinating chapter on \\"Biblical Reasons: The Dietary Rules of the Ancient Hebrews.\\" I had never understood the concept of \\"culinary incest\\" which completely awakened my curiosity and Jean Soler provided well-thought out explanations as to why prescribed rituals had to be observed. I didn't realize that many cultures in history actually only consumed meat after ritual sacrifice. The taking of an animal's life takes on an entirely new meaning after reading this chapter. There are reasons why humans did not originally eat meat and they are very complex and have to do with a Creator having the power over life and death. In a way, humans were given the right to take away life in certain instances.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading Chapter 18 which deals with \\"Mediterranean Jewish Diet and Traditions in the Middle Ages.\\" Here you can learn the basics of Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Sukkoth, Purim and Passover.<br /><br />If you are especially interested in Medieval Life, then you will love this book for the content on Medieval Cooking.

(You will be shocked)<br />Who actually first discovered the Theobroma cacao plant/tree or learned how to use the beans (they look a lot like giant almonds in the picture) in the pods (look like an elongated squash) growing directly from the tree trunk? (It wasn't the Aztecs)<br />Do ungerminated beans have the same flavor as germinated beans?<br /><br />The story of chocolate is extremely detailed. This book traces the discovery of chocolate from it's earliest pre-Columbian roots to modern times. The way we serve chocolate today almost seems primitive when you read how many ways the Aztecs made their chocolate drinks.<br /><br />Honeyed Chocolate<br />Flowered Chocolate<br />Green Vanilla Flavored Chocolate<br />Bright Red Chocolate<br /><br />It is amazing how this book came together as it has, because Sophie D. Coe was diagnosed with cancer before the book was completed. Her husband, Michael D. Coe, took on the responsibility of literally thousands of pages of notes and finished a book she started.<br /><br />The authors spent hundreds of hours tracing down all possible references to chocolate in Libraries in America and Europe. They also searched in 400-year-old books in the Biblioteca Angelica in Rome.<br /><br />The story of Chocolate is amazing. Just the way it is made is a process that was kept secret for many years.<br /><br />From Research I've done in the past:<br />Seed pods, growing on the trunk and main branches are harvested and opened with sharp blades to reveal creamy white cacao beans which darken, then ferment under banana leaves for up to nine days as they lay in the sun. After a 250* to 350* hour-long roasting process, the beans are dehulled leaving small pieces called nibs.<br /><br />Cocoa powder results from ground roasted beans which have the cocoa butter removed. After the cocoa butter is extracted, dry cakes of cocoa are ground and sifted to make fine cocoa powder. Most cocoa powder is naturally 97.75% caffeine-free. A 1/2 tablespoon cocoa powder contains about .0002 ounces of caffeine. There is 10 times as much caffeine in a 6-ounce cup of coffee.<br /><br />The Dutch chemist Coenraad Van Houten added alkali to neutralize the acidity of chocolate and mellow the flavor. This is how the darker Dutch-process cocoa was created. Black cocoa is slightly more bitter and is the darkest cocoa powder available. It is best combined with a Dutch-process cocoa powder. When manufacturers make chocolate bars, the roasted beans are crushed with sugar and vanilla to make chocolate liquor.<br /><br />The chocolate liquor is refined to evaporate excess moisture and acidity, then it is ground so fine that the mouth no longer perceives the beans as individual particles. After heating and cooling, chocolate is poured into molds, cooled and wrapped to be sold as bittersweet, semisweet or unsweetened chocolate bars, depending on sugar content or lack of it.<br /><br />This book takes you on a \\"chocolate\\" journey. This is a book about the history of chocolate and does contain some rather interesting \\"chocolate drink formulas.\\"<br /><br />I guess one of my only objections might include places where the authors called a ritual \\"spectacular\\" instead of \\"detailed/extravagant.\\" It made it seem that they were defending the Aztec's brutal way of life although I'm sure they were not. They just tried to look at the reality of the situation and probably found the rituals rather out of the ordinary. The reason forthe rituals seems based on \\"fear that the world would end.\\"<br /><br />There also did seem to be some rather morbid uses for chocolate in the past. There is also a passage that says something about a \\"baseless\\" claim for chocolate having aphrodisiac properties. We do know that it contains substances, which do produce an \\"in love\\" feeling.<br /><br />What really had my attention was the topic of Crillo beans vs. \\"Forastero\\" beans. The Crillo tree produces the best quality beans, while the Forastero produces a more bitter bean. Valrhona Manjari is made exclusively with rare Indian Ocean Crillo beans. This gives the chocolate a winey, bittersweet flavor and incredible aroma.<br /><br />If you have yet to taste this or use it in cooking, look for it online or by looking for the N.Y. Cake and Baking Distributor catalog or Formaggio Kitchen catalog.<br /><br />Many chefs swear by this chocolate and I can tell you it is the best I've found besides a chocolate I love called \\"Peter's Chocolate from Nestle.\\" Nestle chocolate is my ultimate favorite. Especially the milk chocolate. The use of cocoa butter in place of all those other palm oils is rather refreshing. Being one can be highly allergic to palm oils and cottonseed oils and the like.<br /><br />The difference between the bars is that you can eat Peter's Chocolate straight off the bars, but the Valrhona Manjari bars are a bit bitter on their own. When you mix in a little cream and sugar, it becomes magic.<br /><br />Valrhona chocolate is of course considered to be one of the finest chocolates in the world. I myself won't use anything but Valrhona Manjari in my Chocolate Ice Cream and Mocha Freeze. I also discovered Valrhona Caraque for use in Truffles. The authors also include the meaning for \\"Manjari\\" which is \\"Sanskrit for \\"bouquet.\\"<br /><br />If you are hungry for information about chocolate, this is the best book I've read so far.

Whole nutmeg is often kept in European kitchens and it is believed that as long as there is a whole nutmeg seed in the kitchen, the marriage will last. So I keep two whole nutmeg seeds in my kitchen as extra insurance. :><br /><br />The title of this book actually refers to another situation in which Elizabeth David becomes disappointed with restaurants not keeping a nutmeg grinder for their clients to use when they are served various dishes with cheese or pasta.<br /><br />Some information from my own research about Nutmeg:<br /><br />Nutmeg is actually native to the East Indies and was very popular from the fifteenth to the nineteenth century. It is one of the original spices cultivated in Tidore and Ternate, two tiny Spice Islands in Eastern Indonesia.<br /><br />The best nutmeg is now grown on the Island of Grenadain in the West Indies. A yellow peach-like fruit is harvested with a woven wicker basket attached to the end of a long pole. The inner seed is the nutmeg spice and is superior when freshly ground. The red-orange net/aril covering the outer seed is dried and ground to produce mace.<br /><br />Elizabeth David's writing in \\"Is there a Nutmeg in the House\\" is much more scholarly than I had expected. These are essays describing the practical, historical and earthy aspects of cooking. She does however often make your mouth water with tales of remembering \\"cake with orange icing\\" or gathering fresh mushrooms from fields near her home as a child.<br /><br />This book begins with a brief overview of Elizabeth's life. Most of the memories involve cooking. She even cooked in a kitchen in Egypt. This might explain recipes for \\"Spiced Lentil Soup.\\" She defiantly likes spicy foods and also has a recipe for Garam Masala.<br /><br />She shows her love and dislike of various dishes, ingredients and recipes. She also describes her dream kitchen and would definitely not approve of my refrigerator being next to the stove. I have to admit the pictures of her kitchen are quaint and the use of a table in the middle of the kitchen made me nostalgic for my grandmother's kitchen. I learned to make my grandmother's apple pie on a small table in her kitchen. Many cooks find a table essential to roll out pastry.<br /><br />I also loved the use of a French armoire, English dressers and wooden plate racks in her kitchen. While the kitchen looked more cluttered in comparison to today's streamlined sterile spaces, it has a sense of beauty and comfort. I at times long for a kitchen with a fireplace, just to warm up the atmosphere.<br /><br />While the modern kitchen is more practical, they can at times feel cold. Unless of course you pack them full of cookbooks.<br /><br />Elizabeth is rather famous for saying:<br /><br />\\"One certainly cannot learn the technical details of cookery entirely from books; but if the cooks, celebrated and obscure, of the past had believed that written recipes were unnecessary, we should now be in a sad plight indeed.\\"<br /><br />-Elizabeth David, French Provincial Cooking (1960)<br /><br />She had quite a collection of cookbooks and it shows in her writing. She does seem to have a working knowledge of the history of cuisine. Through her own research, she helped to change the way we think about food.<br /><br />The material in this collection has not appeared in previous books. Here she emphasizes authentic recipes and fresh ingredients. The recipes are written out in paragraph style. They are more of a conversation with the cook than a quick formula. In this way you can obtain valuable insight into the methods or reasons for why food is prepared in a specific way. I did not however find out how to extract juice from a pomegranate. I was asked this question and since I never had to deal with the question before am still trying to figure out if everyone else out there uses a sieve and presses out the juice. Seems to work.<br /><br />Elizabeth spends a great deal of time discussing \\"oxo cubes\\" and discusses the fear cooks feel when a recipe calls for \\"stock.\\" I remember such a fear before I discovered stock pastes. Of course these days stock can easily be made in a crock pot while you are at work or you can really just use a stock base/paste. I have to agree with her when she says that it is satisfying to learn how to \\"cook from scratch.\\" She mentions this in regards to making stocks. A homemade soup made with homemade stock can be incomparable.<br /><br />\\"The making of broths and stocks and consomm&eacute;s is to me one of the most interesting and satisfactory of all cooking processes.\\" pg. 27<br /><br />While making stock still remains a valuable skill, I can't imagine wanting to learn how to make yogurt. Like a Frenchwoman not wanting to make her own bread, I prefer to leave yogurt up to the experts. Still, if you wish to know, Elizabeth has included this information. These days many also make their own cheese and bread, so I guess why not yogurt? I make bread myself. Mostly because the homemade taste is superior.<br /><br />Elizabeth explains why she finds dried yeast unsatisfactory. My thought is that it was not as reliable as the yeast we have today. I can keep dried yeast in my refrigerator for a long time and never even take time to \\"proof\\" the yeast. We are so terribly spoiled these days and unless we take time to read about the past, we can't fully appreciate packages of \\"quick-rise yeast.\\"<br /><br />I had to laugh as I read about her dissatisfaction with a garlic press. Could this be similar to the one we use today? I love my garlic press. Please don't make me live without it. It sure saves peeling cloves. I can extract the garlic paste in no time for recipe after recipe.<br /><br />You might be amused by her recollection of her housekeeper in Greece tossing a basket of live seafood on her \\"eiderdown.\\" What a character.<br />Enjoyable reading and essential for anyone who is interested in culinary history.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewthese days stock can easily be made in a crock pot while you are at work or you can really just use a stock base/paste.

1212913:US	50199793	RGGZH59X2P88A	0453007740	627065254	The Iliad (Classics on Cassette)	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Hurling down to the House of Death so many sturdy souls	Although the facts remain in doubt, Robert Fagles brings a vigor to Homer's 2,700-year-old story of the Trojan War. This translation is read by Derek Jacobi and narrated by Maria Tucci.<br /><br />This story begins with an explanation by Maria Tucci which tells of a time when a sea nymph married a mortal and all the gods and goddesses attended the wedding. The \\"Goddess Strife\\" threw a golden apple among the guests declaring it as a prize for the most beautiful goddess on Olympus. Three goddesses claimed the apple. Zeus then instructed Paris to make the choice. Aphrodite offered him the love of Helen, the mortal daughter of Zeus, therefore, he gave her the apple. The other two goddesses were angered and went to plot the destruction of Troy.<br /><br />I have always been interested in why men would give up their lives to save a woman. Is the woman worth saving or giving your life for? This is not really answered in the Iliad.<br /><br />If you are interested in Greek Mythology, this is a good introduction to various gods and goddesses.<br /><br />There are many descriptions of absolute cruelty and brutality that if viewed onscreen would probably be a bit intense. However, it is helpful to remember when this was written and how men viewed war at this time. Have things changed? Are we more civilized now? Perhaps we respect life and death more now and while warriors saw their death as the ultimate sacrifice then, perhaps warriors of today wish to not only defeat the enemy, but also to preserve their lives and the lives of as many as possible on the way to peace. It does seem that today, in war, we try to find ways to not kill as many people. Here the brutality explodes and there is a passionate energy to kill. It is very primal.<br /><br />Here in the scenes presented, it seems like death is the only objective at times. The savage fighting hand to hand is almost enjoyment for the gods. Woman are also seen as \\"war prizes.\\"<br /><br />I was surprised by how lyrical the translation is. This is not about war. It is also about he observation and there are magnificent metaphors to be had. I was surprised by the sensual images like when the dawn has red fingers and rises from bed or the goddesses and food are described. While I can't say I love goat cheese, you will probably want to go have a barbecue. Savory smoke swirling up towards the skies and an endless ocean with salt green depths and churning surf add depth and color to the story.<br /><br />There is also humor to be had. Derek Jacobi's voice is adorably cute when he changes and reads the \\"goddess\\" parts. I can't explain why it is funny, just listen and you will see. It is as if the goddesses are the ultimate in femininity. They do present themselves as the most delicate of woman, while the gods are ferocious and seem to represent the ultimate in male behavior. Be that good or bad. Zeus is not especially interested in saving life. His \\"sport\\" seems to be to watch humans in battle. He commands the storm clouds and has a wife that nags him. Sounds like any normal human relationship to me. And I thought the gods would be above this. However, they seem to have the same desires as humans, yet seem detached from the pain of human suffering.<br /><br />There is a huge difference in the Pope vs. Fagles translation.<br /><br />For example, in the Alexander Pope's translation it reads:<br /><br />Achilles' wrath, to Greece the direful spring<br />Of woes unnumber'd, heavenly goddess, sing!<br />That wrath which hurl'd to Pluto's gloomy reign<br /><br />The souls of might chiefs untimely slain;<br />Whose limbs unburied on the naked shore,<br />Devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore:<br />Since great Achilles and Atrides strove,<br />Such was the sovereign doom, and such the will of Jove!<br /><br />Robert Fagles:<br /><br />Rage -- Goddess, sing the rage of Peleus' son Achilles,<br />murderous, doomed, that cost the Achaeans countless losses,<br />hurling down to the House of Death so manysturdy souls,<br />great fighters' souls, but made their bodies carrion<br />feasts for the dogs and birds,<br />and the will of Zeus was moving toward its end.<br />Begin, Muse, when the two first broke and clashed,<br />Agamemnon lord of men and brilliant Achilles.<br /><br />What a contrast! You can definitely appreciate the majesty of the second version. It sings, it shouts beauty even in death. It doesn't try to fit into a \\"poem\\" format. It flows and drives along like a story should. You wait for each word with almost an anticipation in the Fagles version. In Alexander Pope's translation, you stop, start and are more concerned with the rhyme than the story.<br /><br />I'm pleased to know I picked the best translation to listen to. If you are going to spend this much time (9 hours) then it is well worth buying the \\"Robert Fagles\\" version.<br /><br />A wonderful introduction to Homer and it sure beats reading this all in bed for days. I'd rather listen to The Iliad than pour over pages for hours. I think listening gives an added benefit that reading alone can never hope to achieve.<br /><br />I'm now completely \\"in love\\" with audiobooks! I can't wait to hear how the Odyssey is read. That has always been my favorite because of the \\"sirens\\" and travels. Now, I won't be able to decide my favorite until I listen to the Odyssey audiobook version.<br /><br />~The Rebecca ReviewZeus was moving toward its end.

As spring water rushes through open earth, so happiness flows through open lives.\\" -Taro Gold<br /><br />Taro Gold has spent much of his life living overseas. He has traveled to over thirty countries and has lived in Australia, Spain and Japan. This is the second book and larger edition of \\"Open Your Mind, Open Your Life.\\" The author has also written extensively for international Buddhist publications and is currently living in California.<br /><br />Quotes have always intrigued me because they contain condensed wisdom. In just a few words of a good quote, you see the big picture or universal truth. This is a collection of Eastern Wisdom and contains quotes by Buddhist and Eastern thinkers such as Nichiren, Lao Tzu, Confucius, and Mahatma Gandhi.<br /><br />Taro sees these quotes as \\"guideposts.\\" He believes in having an open mind and in illuminating your life's path with wisdom from great thinkers.<br /><br />Taro also includes:<br /><br />The Buddhist concept of the Ten Worlds<br />Short Allegories<br />Short Biographical paragraphs of Historical Figures quoted in this book<br />Longer passages for reflection<br />Common Sense Quotes<br />Universal Truths<br />Eastern Wisdom<br /><br />An Iris represents Faith, Hope, Wisdom and Valor. Not only is the cover beautiful and filled with flowers, the entire books is beautifully illustrated in an ornate fashion. Almost every page has a beautiful border and then the quotes are in black ink and easy to read on white paper.<br /><br />Some of the quotes do not have sources and are probably sayings passed down through many generations. These include Japanese, Buddhist and Chinese proverbs.<br /><br />I've been contemplating the reality of how we become what we think. Lately I've been watching how my own thoughts change my behavior. Some of the quotes deal with the inherent nature of mankind or ask: \\"What is truth?\\"<br /><br />Taro Gold has included a quote from Mahatma Gandhi:<br /><br />\\"Keep your thoughts positive, because your thoughts become your words.

These exercises also provide a quiet place where you can just be by yourself and nurture yourself. In a way, they are like Yoga where you have time to yourself just<br />to reflect and move in the moment.<br /><br />You need three items to fully appreciate Winsor Pilates:<br /><br />The Pilates Powerhouse book<br />The Winsor Pilates Body Sculpting Program<br />The Pilates Workout Journal<br /><br />This book is probably best purchased along with the Winsor Pilates Body Sculpting Program and Pilates Workout Journal. To find the Body Sculpting program, link over to the drugstore.com area that is connected with Amazon. For some reason, I can't get<br />the program to list when searching for Mari Winsor at Amazon.<br /><br />I would like to see this book in a \\"spiral bound\\" version because you will want to be able to keep the pages open. This is a book you want to use, not just read once. I would also like to find a Pilates wall chart. No luck so far.<br /><br />The exercises in this book are all in Mari's Body Sculpting program. To do these exercises correctly, I find it is essential to watch the videos first. Then, you can use this book to remind yourself of the exercises while doing other fun things like watching movies. The journal is also useful as it has a beginner to advance routine and you can follow the lists.<br /><br />I've thought about cutting out all the pictures in the book and pasting them onto note cards and placing them on a key ring so I can have the exercises all in a row. This might be what I resort to if I can't find a chart.<br /><br />The reason I personally love this method of exercising is because I can do the exercises while watching TV or a movie.<br /><br />This book is going to tell you all the basics you need to know. The explanations do go into more depth than even on the videos. Yet, I think to appreciate the program, it is best to watch the videos first.<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Introduction: Find out who Joseph Pilates was and why he was a revolutionary force in the world of fitness.<br /><br />Part One: The Power of Pilates<br /><br />1. The Joy of Movement - What are the benefits? These are rather convincing. If you are stressed out by other routines, these exercises provide a loving, nurturing environment in which your body can change. You feel that you are really caring for yourself.<br /><br />2. Principles of Understanding - Learn about breathing, relaxation, concentration, control, fluidity, strength, flexibility, freedom and control. There is a certain joy in the opposites presented in these exercises. You stretch and tone. You relax and work out. There is a certain balance you achieve through each routine.<br /><br />3. The Powerhouse - The secret and essential ingredient. I didn't really understand fully what this was until reading this book. There is not enough time on the videos to go into depth. That is why this book is essential!<br /><br />Part Two: Doing It<br /><br />4. Before You Begin - More motivation and pep talk from Mari. I love her style. I love the way she can convince me to get down on the floor and work out. What a woman!<br /><br />5. Pilates Mat Work - These are the exercises. A full list of 41 ways to firm, tone and stretch. All the exercises are shown with complete detailed explanations. Most have a \\"prep, ready and action\\" area. Some only need a \\"ready and action.\\" The instructions are easy-to-understand, but to fully understand them, I again recommend the videos. So worth the price.<br /><br />Part Three: Injuries and Injury Prevention<br /><br />6. Defying Defeat- If you have been injured and are in pain, Pilates might be the perfect remedy for healing and diminishing chronic pain. I know it has helped my back and my entire body feels stronger.<br /><br />7. Neck Injuries - Neck stretches you can do to alleviate pain. When first doing these exercises, you will notice some tension in your shoulders and neck, but that quickly subsides as you build up muscles to support your head. There are also variations so you don't have to lift your head as much when doing the exercises. Of course, you want to work to that level.<br /><br />8. Lower Back Pain - Stretches and modifications. \\"Rolling Down the Wall\\" is a fun exercise to stretch out your lower back.<br /><br />9. Asthma - interesting to have included this in the book. But asthma is actually very common. Breathing through your nose is what Mari recommends. I've heard that cold air on the back of the throat can actually aggravate Asthma. Exercise induced Asthma is a reality.<br /><br />10. Beyond the Mat - Look for a Pilates studio. The equipment can help give you a deeper stretch and added resistance. In this section, it would have been nice to see the exercise machines. She gives a toll-free number so you can call and find a studio in your area.<br /><br />Like Yoga, Pilates is really a way of life for many. You can add this type of program to a walking program and see added benefits. I like this better than Yoga, because there are still some pretty intense moves in Yoga that will take me years to perfect. With Pilates, you feel almost proficient from the start. None of the exercises are \\"too difficult\\" or \\"impossible.\\"<br /><br />A Balanced approach to Life and Exercise.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewh the price.

I loved the fact that this book presents itself as a \\"dark, dark\\" book and it really is funny that it is not a \\"dark\\" tale at all. The \\"darkness\\" is more about the lack of light than it being about evil.<br /><br />You start in a moor and walk through a woods. Then there is a dark castle and you walk up to the door. Once you enter the castle, you are in a dark hall and go up some dark stairs. You are in a fairy tale castle and then you see a dark passage. You are tempted to look behind a dark curtain and then the cat stands looking up at a dark cupboard.<br /><br />The last page shows a mouse in a box with a rather frightened look on its face. So the only fear in this book is that the cat has found the mouse. Although it does seem the cat leaves the mouse sleeping happily in his little bed with his miniature candle and miniature slippers.<br /><br />The beauty of this book is in the art.

This is not a comprehensive history of all that has been thought and believed, it is more an understanding of who and what God is to humans around the globe.<br /><br />This book explores the ways in which a belief in God began and how it has developed in the major religious traditions of the world. If you believe there is only one true God, you are going to have some problems with the way God is presented in this book. There is even an argument for atheism and a section on the positive role of witches.<br /><br />This book is really not just about God, it is about a wide variety of topics including ritual, myth, music, science, art, sacrifice, architecture, The religions of India, Asia, Abraham and \\"In the End.\\" Since many religions have their own dating systems, the dates in this book are given according to the western calendar.<br /><br />This is really a brief overview of all the religions in the world.<br /><br />\\"The claim is sometimes made that belief in God is like belief in fairies or Father Christmas: we may believe in such things when young but grown out of them when we are older and wiser. Phenomenology at the second level shows why that claim is wrong.\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed the section on Rumi because I've read some of his poetry and now I understand what a sulfi is. Apparently is it a man or woman with a broken heart. Someone who is always sensitive to the heartbreak of the world and who is always sensitive to Divine Beauty. Once the heart breaks open, it goes on breaking forever and there is beauty and majesty and agony in the experience.<br /><br />\\"I was snow. I melted in you rays.

This is a story about John and his wife Mary Ann who make their home in Minnesota, one of the nation's leading producers of honey.<br /><br />This book shows how a beekeeper works with bees through the seasons. It show how he introduces a new queen into a hive in the spring, tends the hives during the summer months and extracts the honey in the fall. Who knew you had to help the bees stay warm in the winter. And bees getting antibiotics or stealing honey from one another.

While you are drinking your tea, you might enjoy eating the \\"Honey/Chocolate Chip/Coconut Cookie.\\" There is a recipe on the last page.

Poetry expresses a nation's deepest concerns, ambitions and longings.<br /><br />Poems are read by Liza Ross, Garrick Hagon, William Hootkins, Kate harper, Alibe Parsons and James Goode.<br /><br />I was pleased to hear my favorite poem read by Kate Harper. I had not yet read \\"Wild Peaches,\\" also by Elinor Hoyt. She is so fanciful in her exploration of words, yet describes words quite perfectly. I think she and author and poet, Frances Mayes would have made perfect friends. I hear Frances Mayes voice in Elinor Hoyt Wylie's poems. Or maybe it is the other way around. Either way, there is an echo of beauty in their writing.<br /><br />Pretty Words<br /><br />Poets make pets of pretty, docile words:<br />I love smooth words, like gold-enameled fish<br />Which circle slowly with a silken swish,<br />And tender ones, like downy-feathered birds:<br />Words shy and dappled, deep-eyed deer in herds,<br />Come to my hand, and playful if I wish,<br />Or purring softly at a silver disk,<br />Blue Persian kittens, fed on cream and curds.<br />I love bright words, words up and singing early;<br />Words that are luminous in the dark, and sing;<br />Warm lazy words, white cattle under trees;<br />I love words opalescent, cool, and pearly,<br />Like midsummer moths, and honied words like bees,<br />Gilded and sticky, with a little sting.<br />~ Elinor Hoyt Wylie (1885-1928)<br /><br />I thought Mr. Hagon read The Star Spangled Banner a bit too fast at the start. But I've only heard it sung, so honestly maybe it is supposed to be read fast. I did like how he interpreted The Road Not Taken because he seems to have a casualness in his voice that was well suited to the poem.<br /><br />I absolutely loved \\"The Song of Hiawatha from The Wooing: At the doorway of his wigwam.\\" William Hootkins is brilliant in his interpretation and he paints wonderful pictures with his voice. It is a beautiful love story and has some really cute moments. I also loved his reading of The Raven. It is completely spooky. He almost channels the ghostly feel through his voice. The haunting mood and masterly musical technique of Allen Poe's writing comes alive with each inflection.<br /><br />Liza Ross has a lovely lilt to her voice well suited to the reading of \\"A Lesson in a Picture\\" by Sarah Morgan Bryan Piatt (1836-1919)<br /><br />Alibe Parsons has the ability to say a word and make it completely vivid in your mind. This was especially apparent in \\"The wind begun to rock the grass\\" by Emily Dickinson when she says \\"scooped\\" and \\"unhooked.\\"<br /><br />James Goode has a mature sexiness to his voice which emphasizes beauty even in death in \\"Rendezvous\\" by Alan Seeger (1888-1916) and then gives a painful passion to \\"Sympathy\\" by Paul Lawrence Dunbar (1872-1906). His reading of \\"Bury Me in a Free Land\\" is spectacular.<br /><br />The CD booklet gives information about how poetry changed over the years.

Since I've met so many people who read Under the Tuscan Sun, I've found out that lots of people feel this way. It's complicated but feels so very easy. The warmth of the people, the human scale of the towns, the robust food, yes, but I've begun to think, too, that it's the natural connection with art, the natural exposure to beauty on a day-to-day basis.\\" -Frances Mayes<br /><br />Frances Mayes presents a sensual celebration of Tuscany with hypnotic descriptions of culinary bliss and everyday rituals on long days when she savors the sun. This is creative writing heaven! She is not only a best-selling author, widely published poet and gourmet cook; she is also a travel writer who can describe lands and culture in sensuous and evocative language.<br /><br />Halfway into the book, I became heady with the desire to just run away to Tuscany. I want to write like her, I want to think like her, I am intoxicated by her creativity.<br /><br />I first fell in love with creative writing when my teacher in Africa explained metaphors to me. It is no wonder I have just completely fallen in love with Frances Mayes writing style. I also discovered she is a creative writing professor at San Francisco State University and has directed The Poetry Center and chaired the Department of Creative Writing.<br /><br />Frances first started visiting Tuscany when she was fresh out of college. In 1985, she rented a farmhouse for the first time and enjoyed going to the local markets to buy suntan lotion and culinary specialties. After this visit, she and Ed rented various farmhouses around Tuscany and finally decided to buy Bramasole.<br /><br />Frances Mayes gives a vivid and compelling account of how she bought and started restoring this farmhouse in Tuscany. \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\" is really an outgrowth of the diary she kept about her experiences when she first moved to Italy.<br /><br />She sees homes as metaphors for the self and gives herself to decorating and renovating them with a certain passion. \\"The houses that are important to us,\\" she writes, \\"are the ones that allow us to dream in peace.\\"<br /><br />In sumptuous detail, Frances Mayes describes her home and Italy like a delicate poem as she balances enjoyment of life with responsibility to finishing an extensive renovation. Her writing shows she is most at home in Italy and enjoys immersing herself in words that describe her private escape. She is living the fantasy and sharing every delicious bit of her joy in this fascinating memoir.<br /><br />I love her observations about life. While they sometimes have little to do with Tuscany, they are enlightening. Through gorgeous descriptions, she says: \\"Life is beautiful, take deep breathes, enjoy food and pleasure.\\" Through intimate reflection, she considers how life changes so we can go forward in our thinking.<br /><br />She writes about tours of ancient churches and towns, fig-pollinating wasps, the ancient tile roof, books with blue leather binding, art, festivals, walks through the piazza, gardens and even gives us her precious recipes.<br /><br />Then she continues to describe lush fruits, vegetables, and flowers, olive groves, orchards, and vineyards violet blue hazes, pelting rain, green landscapes, olive oil, hot waterfalls, olive wood fires, cool walks through chestnut forests, blood oranges, jars of plum jam, mascarpone custard, cherries, bees burrowing in pears, pecorino cheese, fertile earth rich as chocolate cake, wild strawberries, white peaches, fresh herbs and baskets for picking tomatoes.<br /><br />Thankfully I had some fruit cobbler and pecorino in the refrigerator or I would have gone half mad not being able to taste fruit and cheese after listening to the completely delicious descriptions.<br /><br />She also vividly captures a humorous moment when she has cement poured all over her head and gives a hilarious recounting of her first wall-building endeavor. She paints evocative descriptions of nearby Cortona, thinks about Elizabeth David's recipe for peach marmalade and considers passages from books by Henry James and D.H. Lawrence. Her knowledge of the world is impressive and fascinating. I even learned an interesting and amusing fact about James Joyce.<br /><br />I'm going to admit that a few times while listening to the unabridged version narrated by Barbara Caruso, the writing was so beautiful I was at times overwhelmed. I believe many of us feel a deep need to live in an almost rural community where people actually care about their neighbors or at least talk to them. Frances is now an honorary citizen of the town.<br /><br />At the end, she starts to talk about her life growing up in the South and focuses on religion and even makes a few observations about the sensual life and afternoon naps. There are moments throughout the book when she stops to compare her Californian and past Georgian existence with this Italian paradise.<br /><br />While some may say this is domestic sensuality at its best, I think it is love. Love for the land, love of food and love of life. Frances Mayes sees beauty in life and this book will be equally loved by those who also share the desire to find beauty in the simplicity of existence. Many have read this book and have changed their lives. The descriptions of life that moves at a slower pace has the power to make you want to leave America fast and arrive in Tuscany early.<br /><br />Read or listen and then plan your escape! I've just printed out information about a farmhouse in Tuscany. I shall continue to dream. I'm also going to go make some Biscotti!<br /><br />A lyrical account of a love affair with Italy you will never forget.<br /><br />Additional books you might want to possess: Ex Voto, Swan, The Best American Travel Writing 2002, Bella Tuscany and In Tuscany.<br /><br />This review is for the book and the unabridged recorded book version narrated by Barbara Caruso.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewonsiders passages from books by Henry James and D.H.

Russell is a professional loan broker who has been working in the trenches getting loans for his clients for years. He has also talked to thousands of people who didn't qualify for a loan and finally realized no one had written a complete book on the subject.<br /><br />\\"After you read this book, you will be able to get a copy of your credit report and sit down at the kitchen table with a pen, paper and calculator and determine whether you qualify for a loan or not. If you don't quality, you will know exactly why and what to do about it.\\" -Howard L. Russell<br /><br />The Insider Credit Handbook will show you:<br /><br />1. How to get, read and understand your credit report<br />2. How to establish credit<br />3. How to re-establish credit<br />4. What is a personal loan: what it takes to qualify for one and how to get it<br />the two kinds of car loans: what it takes to qualify and how to get one<br />5. Home equity loans: what they are and how to qualify to get one<br />6. Using a loan broker: what they do, what they charge and avoiding the rip-off guys<br />7. Bankruptcy and what to do next. An alternative to bankruptcy.<br /><br />In the first chapter you learn exactly where to go to find your credit report. Web site info and phone numbers and how to get your report fast. In the back of the book, there are sample reports so you can read this book and see examples on the actual forms.<br /><br />Once you get your \\"own\\" report, that is when this book gets really helpful!<br /><br />Like: You might see: Sum-ACCTS 18, 3-ZEROS, 14-ONES<br /><br />What does ACCTS:18 mean? When you see this on your report it will mean you have 18 loans listed on your credit report.<br /><br />The author takes you step-by-step through your entire report! How unique to actually have someone spend that much time explaining things. Oh the beauty of books. There is no way the author could spend this much time in person because he would be out getting loans for his clients. So, this is really the \\"decoder\\" for your report. Although, I must say, he does do everything he can to help people get their credit back so they can get a loan the next time they apply. There are plenty of examples and stories that were quite interesting to read.<br /><br />There are some very important \\"warnings\\" listed. Like if a loan officer pulls a credit report and sees lots of recent inquiries, it might mean you are trying to borrow a lot of money in a short period of time or you have already been turned down a few times.<br /><br />You know, I don't normally review \\"finance\\" type books, but this one is dang interesting! It is like entering this secret little world of loans. The font size is nice and easy on the eyes.<br /><br />This should be required reading at some time during high school! Everyone in America needs this information, because eventually you will need a loan. At that point it might be too late to undo the damage caused by mistakes you didn't even know you made!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewhe can to help people get their credit back so they can get a loan the next time they apply.

Books	5	7	7	N	N	Pet Care when You are Not Here	If you think your best friend in the world or your relatives will happily take care of your pets in the event that you can't, \\"think again.\\"<br /><br />Your friends might not be willing to say \\"no\\" while you are alive, but what happens later? I know for a fact, even my mother would not want to look after my cats because she doesn't really like cats. It would be unfair to the cats and to her to leave them in her care. Not everyone loves pets, that is for sure.<br /><br />While thinking about your soul is the most important thing you can ever do, thinking about what will happen to your pets if you are not here to look after them, could be a close second. Especially for those of us who think of our pets as being like kids.<br /><br />Apparently, many dogs, cats and other pets found in shelters end up there because their owners became ill or were unable to care for them. Some owners died without leaving plans for their pets' next home. Unfortunately, many of these animals are euthanized because they can't find homes.<br /><br />\\"64 percent of all pets that entered the participating shelters for any reason were euthanized.\\" -A survey conducted between 1994 and 1997 by the National Council on Pet Population Study and Policy<br /><br />We all heard the stories about pets being left behind in homes and apartments after the Sept 11th tragedy and while that was more \\"visible\\" to us, this problem is not uncommon.<br /><br />Lisa starts her book with a rather frightening story about how an owner died and his son had no interest in protecting animals and let them all out of the house to wander and fend for themselves. Fortunately a local animal shelter and rescue coordinator were able to save the animals and find homes for them. Lisa states that unfortunately not all stories end this happily.<br /><br />This book will show you why:<br /><br />1. Having a will isn't enough<br />2. Why probate is dangerous for your pets<br />3. How to fund a pet trust even if you're broke<br />4. How to avoid challenges from non-pet-loving relatives.<br /><br />5. Why it is a good idea to keep a \\"In Case of Emergency\\" wallet card.<br />6.

Legal photography provides the court and the jury with a clearer comprehension of the physical facts that could be be obtained otherwise.\\" -Benjamin J. Cantor<br /><br />Benjamin J. Cantor has given us the gift of his life experience in the \\"Courtroom Guide for Non-Lawyers.\\" This is a very helpful book for those who find themselves unfamiliar with the legal ramifications which take place during trials in courtrooms across America.<br /><br />After his daughter and editor, Ruth Roche, served as a juror in several court trials, she mentioned to her dad that if she only had more information about what to expect in a courtroom, her experiences would have been more enjoyable. This inspired Mr. Cantor to seek out more information on the subject, without much success. As a result, he decided to write an essential book for anyone who finds themselves in the position of litigant, witness or juror and has found themselves lost in the thicket of legal terminology and procedures.<br /><br />\\"It's important because It's amazing in this democratic society of ours that so many average citizens find the courtroom an enigma.\\" - Benjamin J. Cantor<br /><br />This book will also be helpful for doctors, engineers, accident reconstructionists, and anyone else who may serve as an expert witness in a court trial. Mr. Cantor graduated from engineering school in 1931 and in the midst of the Great Depression, there were few engineering jobs. He decided to reconstruct his long-time hobby in photography and make an avocation a vocation. This gave him the needed money for tuition for law school and helped him attain his long-range goal of becoming a patent attorney.<br /><br />By the time he received his law degree in 1937, he had already established a photography business specializing in legal photography. He provided photographs for attorneys to assist them in preparing for their lawsuits.<br /><br />Mr. Cantor founded and operated the Boston Photo Service which specializes in forensic photography for over 40 years. He has had a 50-year career in legal photography, during which he also testified in court as a expert photographic witness in hundreds of trials.<br /><br />\\"I became aware of the many imperfections and perplexities in the judicial system of our legal process, especially in the courtroom.\\" -Benjamin J. Cantor<br /><br />After his retirement, he has been a consultant to the Boston Photo Service and has also been conducting seminars on legal evidence photography and the role of the expert witness in a court trial.<br /><br />He has delivered lectures on forensic photography at Boston College Law School, Suffolk University Law School, Massachusetts Bar Associateion and many other legal forums. He is also the co-author of the treatise Photographs in Civil Litigation and has written numerous articles on forensic photography for professional law journals.<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />Interview with the Author - great idea!<br />488 Legal Terms<br />81 Suggestions for being a good witness<br />Information on Direct and Cross-Examination of a Photographer - This gives you a good idea of what to expect if you are called to testify as an expert witness.<br /><br />Examples of Effective use of Photographic Evidence<br /><br />My favorite section was the suggestions for being a good witness. Mr. Cantor includes a quote from Mark Twain that reads: \\"If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.\\"<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />1. Criminal Law and Civil Law<br />2. Participants in a Court Trial: Litigants, Lawyers, Judge, Witnesses, Jurors, Court Officers (or Bailiffs), Court Reporters (Court Stenographers), Court Clerk, Law Clerk, Spectators.<br />3. Civil Trial Court Procedure<br />4. Photographic Evidence vs. Oral Testimony<br />5. Expert Witness<br />6. Equality Before the Law<br />7. Small Claims Court<br />8. Juvenile Court<br />9. Perjury in the Courtroom<br /><br />I've already sent a copy of this book to a friend who I think may find it to be useful. Your friends will thank you if they find themselves as a witness and you present them with a copy of this book. I also thought this book would be helpful for authors who are doing research on the subject of courtroom procedures.<br /><br />Basically a hands-on guide for people who, at some time in their lives, are called upon as jurors or witnesses in a court trial.

There is probably a book out there for just about anything you have ever thought about. But how do you achieve your dream? Is reading the book enough?<br /><br />This is the first guide to show how you can use personal development books, tapes and seminars. Janne Ruokonen will show you how to:<br /><br />1. Find and use the best personal development advice<br />2. Understand why you may have failed before<br />3. Avoid the common self-help- pitfalls<br />4. Make sense of gurus and their ideas and methods<br />5. Discover how ordinary people achieve extraordinary results<br /><br />By reading this book you will see how to get the most out of the advice self-help books give. This is a realistic guide that shows you what works in real life and how you can create lasting change. Janne has come to the realization that many books fail to show the reader how to take the advice and use it to achieve maximum results.<br /><br />He started collecting self-help books, interviewing people who used the books and participated in online discussion groups. He soon saw a pattern emerging. In the last section of the book, he lists page after page of books you will want to read. I've always thought a good book was one that recommends other good books!<br /><br />The Contents Include:<br /><br />Part One: What You Can Achieve and Whose Advice to Follow<br />Part Two: Why Self-Improvement Fails and How to Succeed<br />Part Three: From Advice to Action: Making a Lasting Change in Your Life<br /><br />Janne also gives lists of what people are reading and listening to. Then he shows you how to read effectively and \\"actively.\\" I like that he says you should make notes and almost \\"review\\" the book. I've found that if I review a book I really do absorb more of the content. I'm not sure I could only read two chapters per week, but many people are probably encouraged if they can read two chapters of a self-help book each week. After all, that might not be all you are reading.<br /><br />Janne Ruokonen has worked as a manager and consultant. He knows how to put personal development ideas to work for himself and his staff and his career includes working at a leading personal development and sales training company.<br /><br />In this book you will realize that life is far too short to learn everything on your own by trial and error. Why not learn from other people's mistakes or success?<br /><br />Who would have thought you would need a self-help book to read self-help books, but it makes complete sense.<br /><br />One of my main problems is that I tend to think Big and then try to take Big steps. That is why I've failed with self-help on numerous occasions. When I sat down and realized that each time I tried to get fit, I was jumping in too fast and exhausting myself from the onset, I started to realize that at time if you take smaller steps at the start, you will be able to more easily reach your final goal. You would think this would be obvious, but ambition can often blind you to reality.<br /><br />I mean, you can sit and watch a workout tape all day, but if you don't get on the floor and start working out, it isn't going to get you very far. Sure, the tape is fun to watch and review, but the satisfaction comes from looking in the mirror and seeing the results you have achieved. I also found that watching movies while walking on the treadmill keeps me more interested in walking. So, everyone had to find that secret way to motivate themselves. Rewards do seem to work.<br /><br />Janne says that many people go wrong because they try to just focus on the \\"goal\\" and not on the \\"steps\\" to get to that goal. He also discusses Procrastination and \\"The Overload Barrier.\\"<br /><br />\\"How to Read How-To & Self-Help Books\\" is a balanced approach to achieving your goals, gives you the motivation to take the steps needed to improve your life and shows you how to realize your dreams!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewyou how to realize your dreams!     ~The Rebecca Review	2003-01-22

You meet someone, begin dating, date more seriously, fall into a semi or full-time living-together arrangement-and then it doesn't work out, leaving one or both of you heartbroken.\\"<br /><br />If you are a hopeless romantic, you probably think you will simply find the right person and get married. Not to mention living happily ever after. But do you know the right questions to ask? This book is more about applying the fundamental skills of SpeedDating to your own relationships and is based on the tenets of Jewish philosophy and wisdom.<br /><br />Speed Dating is about saving time in the dating process. If \\"What was I thinking\\" is your lament, then this book will provide the questions you should ask yourself, your date and others so you can evaluate your relationships more quickly before you commit hours of your time to a person you might really not be compatible with.<br /><br />You will learn:<br /><br />How to eliminate time-wasting, heartbreaking relationship habits<br />How to tell when you are \\"in love\\" and whether this will last<br />How to determine four levels of commonality with the person you are dating<br />How to accurately evaluate your date in the shortest amount of time<br />Tips for keeping dating productive as well as fun<br />Tools for discovering your date's true character<br /><br />The following questions are discussed in Part 1:<br /><br />1. What is my desired outcome?<br />2. How can I tell When I'm in Love?<br />3. Am I attracted to who people are or to what they have or what they can do for me?<br />4. What do we have in common - and does it matter?<br />5. What type of person do I enjoy giving to?<br />6. Am I reliving the same bad date over and over again.<br />7. Am I spending as much time in product development as I am in marketing?<br />8. What do I like and respect about myself?<br />9. Who is my team?<br />10. Do I trust this is going to work out - that I will find my soul mate?<br /><br />Part 2 focuses on the SpeedDating way and includes \\"SpeedDating pacing\\"and more questions.<br /><br />11. Do I enjoy being with this person?<br />12. What are my thoughts telling me - which should I listen to and which should I ignore.<br />13. Is this an action, or my interpretation of an action?<br />14. Is this relationship ready for physical intimacy?<br />15. What am I going to learn during this date?<br />16. Did my date pass the team screen?<br />17. How does my date behave when not on a date?<br />18. What challenges will this relationship have, and am I prepared to handle or live with these challenges long-term?<br /><br />You will also find out how to recognize a \\"shaper,\\" \\"avoider,\\" \\"defaulter,\\" and \\"cynic.\\"<br /><br />The section on chemistry is intriguing. There are aspects of love that cannot be expressed verbally.<br /><br />\\"If love is a feeling that mysteriously appears and disappears, how can we ever be certain that it won't suddenly disappear?\\" pg. 16<br /><br />I could appreciate the section on how a \\"giver\\" and a \\"taker\\" can result in a painful situation. The taker has strong expectations that everyone should give to him and the giver often wants appreciation and doesn't receive it. As they say, giving to a taker is extremely painful. I think we all want to be appreciated for the gifts we give.<br /><br />The section on self-esteem was enlightening. Taking care of yourself physically and emotionally might also mean you are willing to be more aware of the needs of others.<br /><br />Never doubt that the small things count. Like how much TV a person watches or if they are interested in their health.<br /><br />The aspect of sexual relations is intriguing and from a Jewish perspective, physical intimacy is the merging of two souls. So, when you are intimate with someone your souls join and a part of each soul is exchanged. I also loved the chapter on Soul Mates. Do soul mates exist? Apparently a soul mate is the person who will help you reach your fullest potential, tolerate your flaws and love you for who you are.<br /><br />I don't think you can fully appreciate what a soul mate is until you have found them. I'm of the opinion that soul mates appear when you are supposed to change into who you are becoming and they don't normally appear a minute sooner.<br /><br />A book that tries to take the pain out of the dating game.

The value established is the property's present market value.\\" -Dr. Suter<br /><br />For over 50 years, Dr. Robers C. Suter has had the opportunity to study and to think about farm appraisals. He also taught the appraisal course to juniors and seniors in the College of Agriculture at Purdue University.<br /><br />He is well-known as a practical, informative and experienced teacher. He is also known for teaching two-day seminars for realtors, appraisers, farm loan officers and assessors in 29 states.<br /><br />He has written a book about farm and ranch appraisals done in the United States. This book answers questions farm appraisers have been asking for years. It provides constructive suggestions through numerous stories. Former students lamented that they had wished they had a copy of Dr. Suter's anecdotes, parables and vignettes.<br /><br />You might ask how an appraiser gains experience.<br /><br />\\"Numerous seminars teach adherence to certain standards, which is good. However neither the college classrooms nor the appraisal seminars recognize the wide variation in farm and ranch properties and in appraisal techniques.\\" -Dr. Robert C.

Normally I like to take my time and cook at my leisure. I've learned the bliss of a bread machine and the luxury of a slow cooker, not to mention the fun of an ice cream maker.<br /><br />However, my love of reviewing has changed my life in various ways. Now I love writing as much as cooking. What is a girl to do? Write or Cook?<br /><br />In a world filled with time challenges, I choose both. My husband also doesn't have a regular work schedule, so when he arrives home \\"earlier or later than expected\\" I have to figure out what to cook and I don't have time to waste. By purchasing ingredients at the start of each week and having cookbooks like \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to 20-minute Meals\\" to inspire me, cooking is more of a pleasure instead of a stressful experience.<br /><br />Cooking is always in a process of evolution. Often we look for cookbooks to inspire us in our own creativity or we are just looking for new recipes to satisfy our current cravings. Tod Dimmick is known for his writing and weekly \\"Gourmet Cooking on a Budget\\" e-mail newsletter that is read by over 75,000 subscribers.<br /><br />Tod has written this completely wonderful book about cooking in a day when we often feel we don't have time to cook. He made me feel like a pro in the kitchen. There are just some recipes that make me feel like \\"more of a chef\\" than others.<br /><br />There is a recipe for \\"Chicken Marsala\\" on page 107 which I absolutely loved. Sure, I made a few changes because in this type of recipe, you can actually play around a bit with how you create the dish. I ended up using only the butter instead of the additional olive oil and using skinless chicken tenderloins. Also, I fried the mushrooms in the butter with the chicken and used a chicken base mixed with water instead of just a canned broth.<br /><br />This recipe can be taken to the level of gourmet very easily. The reason I had to change the recipe was because I only had frozen chicken and frozen chicken doesn't really like being rolled about in flour and I was saving time by not defrosting them slowly in the microwave. So, I mixed flour with water and thickened the sauce at the end instead. Experimentation is half the fun of cooking!<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Part 1: Meals Done Quick, Done Right<br /><br />This section explores the elements of the successful kitchen. You learn everything about kitchen tools to spices, herbs and the ingredients for the perfect pantry.<br /><br />1. Why 20-minute cuisine is an important part of today's busy lifestyle.<br />2. Ingredients: The basics for the pantry, the fridge and the freezer.<br />3. Methods: A review of cooking methods perfect for 20-minute cuisine.<br />4. Equipment: A review of those key pots, pans, tools, and equipment that make cooking easier.<br />5. Practical Secrets: Tips for a fun, tasty, and speedy meal.<br /><br />Part 2: Main Courses<br /><br />Here are recipes and tips for preparation of quick, tasty entrees. Breakfast, Pizza, Pasta, Seafood, White Meats, Richer Meats, Vegetarian.<br /><br />Part 3: Make the Meal Complete: Side Dishes, Quick Vegetable Dishes, Breads, Dessert Time.<br /><br />Part 4: Theme Cuisine: Easy Timesavers, Comfort Foods, Ethnic Magic, Healthy and Delicious, Whirlwind Romance Food, Entertain Sane, Leftovers.<br /><br />Part 5: Behind the Scenes: Internet Sources, Inspiration, Wine-food parings, Gardening.<br /><br />Tod also encourage a \\"love of cooking\\" instead of just providing recipes. He believes attitude is the difference between something being a hassle or a pleasure. This perspective is built into every chapter. He actually went through a phase where he didn't like to cook and slowly discovered the value of home cooked meals.<br /><br />Little \\"Extra Morsel\\" sections appear throughout the book and are helpful hints. They are just small boxes with info related to the topic at hand. Words and phrases, tips, cuisine content/background info and secrets are all revealed.<br /><br />You will soon see that cooking a great meal doesn't always require a lot of time. \\"20-minute cuisine\\" becomes a pleasurable way you can cook and still have time to spend with your family.<br /><br />Page 5:<br /><br />Case Study 1 - Fatigued Friday<br /><br />\\"At the end of a long week, I want to relax and enjoy the feeling of the weekend.

The book begins with a question. \\"What is Art Today?\\"<br /><br />Erich Steingraber explains how we can no longer answer this question unequivocally. Art has undergone a radical change from art in the past. This guide explores all these aspects and shows the changes, page by page.<br /><br />Features Include:<br /><br />2,200 Color Illustrations, photographs and drawings<br />World History of Art<br />Everything from Prehistoric cave paintings to Post-Modernism and Present-Day computer art<br />A Chronological Overview in each chapter<br />Significant Movements in Art<br />Analyses of key works<br />Insight into artist techniques<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />1. Prehistoric and Ancient Art<br /><br />In this section there is a chart of old world Neolithic ceramic forms. Then you can find pictures of Egyptian jewelry and discussions about famous tombart. In the Hellenic and Italic Civilizations you will find page after page of Greek and Italic Art. The elongated figures in some pictures look like modern art and strangely do look similar to figures sculpted by the 20th century Italian sculptor Giacometti. The authors explain why temple architecture in Italy developed differently from Greek architecture. I was fascinated by the \\"Nile Landscape\\" on page 92 because I love mosaics. If you have been to the Louvre, Paris, you will recognize \\"The Victory of Samothrace.\\"<br /><br />2. The Ancient World from the Roman Empire to the Fourth Crusade<br /><br />Then you can delve into the rather serious art of the Roman Empire. Barbarian Art? Yes, but it is only loosely describing a broad range of people and art styles that existed alongside the \\"civilized\\" cultures of the Mediterranean, China and the Near East.<br /><br />Byzantine Art, Persian & Islamic Art, India and the Far East and the Classical Art of sub-Saharan Africa complete this section. I enjoyed seeing the intricacy of the \\"rock crystal jug with bird decoration and inscription\\" from AD992. The transparent and colorless quartz was one of the most sought-after semiprecious materials and you will realize why.<br /><br />3. From the Great Cities of Europe to the Four Corners of the World<br /><br />This section really brought back memories. The Notre-Dame Cathedral is probably the most beautiful cathedral I've ever visited. They have a full-color picture on more than half a page. It is truly even more magnificent when you see it in person.<br /><br />In the Early Renaissance and High Renaissance they feature:<br /><br />Andrea Mantegna: \\"Oculus of the Camera Picta\\" - 1473; fresco. Detailed analyses is included with a variety of close-up \\"shots.\\"<br /><br />Michelangelo: \\"Creation of Adam\\" from the vault of the Sistine Chapel<br /><br />In the 17th Century: The Age of Spectacle we find pictures of Giuseppe Arcimboldo's art. This section really focuses more on sculpture and architecture.<br /><br />The Splendors of the 18th Century includes a delightful array of tapestry from the Palace of Versailles and Musee du Louvre, Paris.<br /><br />The art of Asia is in such contrast with zen gardens and painted scrolls depicting fierce deities.<br /><br />Pre-Columbian Art has a small section and focuses more on vases, temples, goldwork.  and pyramids.<br /><br />4. Art, Commerce & Industry<br /><br />Neoclassicism - inspired by the excavations of the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum.<br /><br />Romanticism - You have to see the exquisite piece called \\"Morning\\" by German artist Philipp Otto Runge who took refuge in the myth of childhood.<br /><br />Orientalism - After the British expansion in India, curiosity about these lands influenced European taste and we see elements of the exotic permeating trends in literature, music and the visual arts throughout the 19th century.<br /><br />Official Art<br /><br />This was the name given to a style of paintings that flourished in Europe in the second half of the 19th century. They feature:<br />The Birth of Venus, 1862<br />Flaming June<br />The Death of Cleopatra, 1874<br /><br />The Creation of the Metropolis<br /><br />This chapter will make you want to go traveling just to see this architecture in person. Pleasure Gardens, castles and bridges are featured.<br /><br />Art, Technology & Industry - focuses on printing and photographic techniques.<br /><br />Furnishings & Fashions - One of my favorite chapters as they include pictures of the interior of castles and a picture of Neuschwanstein Castle.<br /><br />The European Influence - Artistic styles were imitated and adapted in the colonies. Explanations of Theatre design, architecture, American Classicism and Tiffany Glass.<br /><br />5.

For many people, these supplements have come to play an important role in medical self-care, either as preventative medicine or as therapy for a variety of ailments.\\" -David Edelberg, M.D., the chief consultant for this book<br /><br />\\"The Healing Power of Vitamins, Minerals, and Herbs\\" is an A-Z guide and so much more. This book will encourage a deeper understanding of how various supplements can enhance your health.<br /><br />These supplement may not always work miracles, but they do have proven benefits. A combination of supplements with a healthy diet and lifestyle changes (regular exercise, weight control, stress reduction) can help you avoid many trips to the doctor and help you avoid the \\"standard\\" medication or \\"prescription\\" refills we are all so used to.<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Comprehensive list of over 90 ailments discussed. The supplements and dosages to treat conditions is very helpful. This is the first section in the book and each ailment is given it's own two pages.

Simple ideas like not skipping breakfast of avoiding caffeinated beverages. Could it be a vitamin B12 deficiency? Is it a result of stress? Too much exercise? The list goes on. Anyway, it is all very interesting to see the options.<br /><br />Ailments sections include:<br /><br />Acne, Aging, Alcoholism, Allergies, Alzheimer's disease, Anemia, Angina, Anxiety and Panic, Arrythmias, Arthritis, Asthma, Athlete's food, Back pain, Bad breath, Bronchitis, Burns, Cancer, Cancer Prevention, Canker sores, Carpal tunnel syndrome, Cataracts, Chronic fatigue syndrome, Chronic pain, Cold sores, Colds and flue, Congestive heart failure, Constipation, Cough, Cuts and Scrapes, Depression, Diabetes, Diarrhea, Diverticular disorders, Dizziness, Earache, Eczema, Endometriosis, Epilepsy, Eye infections, Fatigue, Fibrocystic breasts, Fibromyalgia, Flatulence, Gallstones, Gout, Gum disease, hair problems, Heart disease prevention, Heartburn, Hemorrhoids, Hepatitis, High blood pressure, High cholesterol, HIV/AIDS, Impotence, Infertility (male and female), Inflammatory bowel disease, Insect bites and stings, Insomnia, Irritable bowel syndrome, Lupus, Macular degeneration, Menopause, Menstral disorders, Migraine, Multiple sclerosis, Muscle aches and pains, Nail problems, Nausea and vomiting, Numbness and tingling, Osteoporosis, Overweight, Parkinson's disease, Premenstral syndrome, Prostate problems, Psoriasis, Raynaud's disease, Rheumatoid arthritis, Rosacea, Shingles, Sinusitis, Smoking, Sore throat, Sprains and strains, Stress, sunburn, Thyroid diseases, Tinnitus, Ulcers, Urinary tract infection, Varicose veins, Warts and Yeast Infections.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewsee the options.

This is the third edition and it is completely amazing how many food, drink and culinary terms can be packed into such a tiny package.<br /><br />I love the feel and weight of this book and the ease of which you can use this book to look up terms fast and furiously when you are writing about food. The rounded corners on the pages make this a book you can flip through very easily and it is all pleasantly alphabetical.<br /><br />The Contents Include:<br /><br />Terms: The volume of the work.<br /><br />The Extras:<br /><br />Ingredient Equivalents<br />Substituting Ingredients<br />Pan Substitution Chart<br />High-Altitude Baking Adjustments<br />Boiling Point of Water at Various Altitudes<br />General Temperature Equivalents<br />Hand Test for Grilling Temperatures<br />Oven Temperatures<br />Fahrenheit/Celsius Conversion Formulas<br />Microwave Oven Conversion Chart<br />Recommended Safe cooking Temperatures<br /><br />Candymaking Cold-Water Tests<br />Frying Temperatures<br />Smoke Points of Popular Oils<br />Fatty Acid Profiles of Popular Oils<br />U.S. Measurement Equivalents<br />Wine and Spirit Bottle Sizes<br />Approximate Metric Equivalents<br />Metric Conversion Formulas<br />Food Guide Pyramid<br />What's a Serving?<br />Food Label Terms<br />A Guide to Food Labels<br />Pasta Glossary<br />British and American Food and Cooking Terms<br />Consumer Information Sources<br />Meat Charts<br />Additives Directory<br /><br />Did I say this was Comprehensive? For food lovers this reaches a point of inspiration unlike any other book on food I've found. I love having so much information all in one book. It is literally a food dictionary which describes food in all its delicious detail.<br /><br />This book has received  an overwhelmingly enthusiastic acceptance in the culinary community. For home cooks, it is also a real bonus and could be considered an essential compliment to your entire cookbook collection.<br /><br />This edition has changed slightly. The listings increased to almost 6,000 and there are thousands of food tidbits sprinkled throughout the tantalizing pages of information. I love the historical lore and information on the exotic origins of some of our most innocent and sweet selections. Vanilla is suddenly seductive and is actually native to tropical America.<br /><br />\\"The vanilla bean was once considered an aphrodisiac, and was so rare that it was reserved for royalty....The saga begins with the orchid blossoms, which open only one day a year.\\"<br /><br />There are almost three pages filled with information on this orchid. Who would have known unless you were doing intensive research. Sharon Tyler Herbst has given us an incredible gift by doing the research for us.<br /><br />If you are unsure of how to pronounce an ingredient, there are pronunciations for all the basic words.<br /><br />The basic bibliomaniac delights in this book include:<br /><br />-Entries arranged alphabetically and cross-referenced<br /><br />-Alphabetization by letter, rather than just by word, so that multiple-word entries are treated as single words.<br /><br />-Multicultural entries galore!<br /><br />khachapuri<br />pakora<br />fraise des bois<br /><br />- Beloved Terms from French Cooking like \\"pâte &agrave; choux\\"<br /><br />- Cooking Methods described for new cooks<br /><br />- Famous Dishes like the \\"Sacher torte\\" are seen in a completely new light<br /><br />- Cooking Equipment also known as \\"batterie de cuisine.\\"<br /><br />When looking up beef jerky you will be sent to look up \\"Jerky.\\" So as not to repeat information, this occurs at various times. This allows Sharon to be more extravagant with other entries. Did you know that tomatoes were once called \\"love apples?\\"<br /><br />You can also look up cooking tools like a pastry brush or a mortar and pestle. I think culinary catalog owners should all have a copy of this book because at times I've had to point out the error of their ways when they have listed kitchen tools incorrectly. One had the mortar and pestle reversed in their description and this was very amusing to me at least.<br /><br />This book may also stir childhood memories. Like when your parents battered and dipped \\"squash blossoms.\\" As I read, the faint scent of frying blossoms floated through my scent memory. Don't even ask me how hungry I get when I read about key lime pie. To find out more about the actual limes used in the pie, you turn to \\"lime.\\" Here you learn that the key lime is much smaller and once I realized the difference I was able to buy the correct limes for pies.<br /><br />I had memories of sitting up in a mulberry tree while reading that there are actually three varieties of mulberries. All I know is we tried to make pies and jam with the ones we picked fresh from this absolutely huge tree when we lived in Africa. They are not as good as youngberries or raspberries, but have a charm all of their own.<br /><br />If you still are trying to discover foods like Yorkshire Pudding, you will not be dissapointed. However, this book does not contain recipes and so it will send you off hunting in all directions for ways to use the ingredients listed in such a lovely fashion. You may find yourself looking for online catalogs or even online scouting out your newest culinary interests.<br /><br />Cooking is an amazing journey and you can enjoy the journey all the more if you have more insight into the terms, definitions, origins and lore of food. Now I feel compelled to go make more biscotti and definitely need to make crullers if I could only find my recipe.<br /><br />I guess my only complaint is that this book does not contain pictures. For that you will have to search elsewhere. Perhaps a copy of \\"Cooking Hints & Tips\\" by Christine France would be helpful to new cooks. \\"Cooking A-Z\\" by Jane Horn is a beautiful discovery. \\"The Cambridge World History of Food\\" by Kenneth F. Kiple is extensive and another must-have \\"encyclopedia\\" of food.<br /><br />If you have not yet discovered \\"The New Food Lover's Tiptionary\\" it is also a must read and is \\"also\\" by Sharon Tyler Herbst.<br /><br />America's best-selling culinary reference and for good reason!

There is a moment when you are so consumed in the moment it can devour you. This book is not about being consumed by the moment, but rather watching the moment pass by.<br /><br />It is amazing that people often feel as if they always need to be doing something, as if to escape their thoughts or the reality of their situation. They find it difficult to genuinely relax and enjoy moments in their life because they feel an certain \\"level of dissatisfaction\\" with their lives. Many times they are limited by their past failures or threatened by the thought of failure in the future, otherwise known as \\"worry.\\" This worry then limits our potential to experience good.<br /><br />Shannon Duncan encourages us to live our life with a \\"relaxed confidence.\\" He explains how humans want to be valued, noticed, understood, respected and loved. When our perception is distorted, we can have a different version of reality.<br /><br />\\"When your perspective on life shifts, changes in your feelings and behavior will naturally follow suit. Your life can become less of a struggle and more of a pleasure when you learn what it means to be present in the moment.\\" ~Shannon Duncan<br /><br />You are still allowed to have emotions, but they are \\"observed\\" and not taken as seriously. You \\"pass through the dissatisfaction.\\"<br /><br />This book will encourage you to:<br /><br />Let go of the mental static<br />Decrease your inner turbulence<br />Just \\"Be\\" in the moment<br />Let go of daydreams and worries<br />Release overwhelming emotions<br />Shift your Perception<br />Stop being tense and emotionally reactive<br />Stop creating your own emotional suffering<br />Cease pointless wrestling with circumstances beyond your control<br />Realize your dreams<br />Focus on the good in your life<br />Improve communication with those around you<br /><br />This book is part of a program and you might want to order the \\"Focus Tool.\\" At first I couldn't figure out what this was until I saw a picture on the back flap of the cover. It is a waking alarm clock that has vibrating or audible alerts, perhaps like a beeper. There are various exercises you do when the beeper goes off. These change throughout the book, but all are to bring you back to the present moment.<br /><br />Perhaps the best way to enjoy the moment is not to be worried about your eternal destiny. This was not discussed and I think it is crucial to being able to live a worry-free existence. This is not a religious book however as James Baldwin once said: \\"If you're afraid to die, you will not be able to live.\\"<br /><br />May you find the peace only God can give while you live in the present moment.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewstling with circumstances beyond your control  Realize your dreams  Focus on the good in your life  Improve communication with those around you    This book is part of a program and you might want to order the \\"Focus Tool.\\" At first I couldn't figure out what this was until I saw a picture on the back flap of the cover.

The answers are all between the covers.<br /><br />Even if they do put a picture up here at Amazon, it won't do the book justice. The book is about 2-inches thick and the size of your hand. If you saw this book on a coffee table, you would instinctively reach out and pick up this book. It would seduce any bibliomaniac instantly.<br /><br />The first time I saw one of Carol's books I was instantly intrigued. When I picked up the book I had no idea how to use it. Of course, I'm not known for reading instructions. However, once you realize you are playing a \\"foretelling the future\\" game, it becomes an enjoyable treat. I don't take this too seriously. It is more for amusement value.<br /><br />First you ask a yes/no type question while holding the book and concentrating on your question for a few seconds.<br /><br />Then you place one hand palm down on the book's front cover and open the book when you feel the time is right.<br /><br />The page you see will contain your answer.<br /><br />So, I ask the book: \\"Will I have a romantic evening tonight?\\" Answer: \\"Watch out for Clinging Vines.\\"<br /><br />Since I love towers and castles this was amusing. Could this mean a handsome knight will climb up into the tower?<br /><br />Answer: \\"Use your imagination.\\"<br /><br />Again, I ask: \\"Does my lover love me truly and deeply.\\" Answer: \\"You're in hot water; make bubbles.\\"<br /><br />Mmm, I got that twice even on the second try the same page appeared. The fact that I asked about \\"deeply\\" and the answer contained the word \\"water\\" was interesting. Will I soon own a jacuzzi tub?<br /><br />Answer: \\"Allow room for surprises.\\"<br /><br />I love Carol's books because they really work for me. She produced the original Book of Answers in 1998 and the book was then published commercially later that same year. It went on to become a best-seller.<br /><br />I was one of the last people at a book signing party in Issaquah where Carol was just starting to put away the books. I became intrigued by these little books and found an Autographed copy. I opened the book and saw a few words on each page.<br /><br />Fortunately Carol Bolt was there to save me and explained how the book worked. She is perhaps one of the nicest authors I've met. She is just as fun to talk to as her book is to read. She is a multi-disciplinary artist who has a passion for quotes and also incorporates words into her two-dimensional and sculptural works.<br /><br />As soon as I knew the secret of how to play with this new book toy for my brain, I was laughing and had to buy the first book. Each book Carol writes just is more fun than the last. They have the intrigue of a magic eight ball, except way more answers.<br /><br />Other answers include:<br /><br />\\"What are you waiting for?\\"<br />\\"Keep it to yourself.\\"<br />\\"You're going to need a map.\\"<br />\\"It will be harder than you think.\\"<br />\\"Could be good under different circumstances.\\"<br />\\"Set a date.\\"<br /><br />Just be very careful what you ask.<br />You might just get the right answer.<br /><br />Mysterious little books that intrigue the mind.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewt away the books.

Sandra Lee is known to audiences nationwide from her appearances on the QVC shopping channel and numerous network and cable television programs. Her Semi-Homemade solutions have also been featured in People, Redbook, Better Homes and Gardens, Traditional Home, Country Home and Victoria. She has also appeared on NBC's Today. FOX's Good Day LA and Good Day New York.<br /><br />Sandra Lee is a member of the International Association of Culinary Professionals She also studied at the acclaimed Cordon Bleu.<br /><br />When selecting a cookbook, normally I will buy cookbooks that promote \\"cooking from scratch.\\" This is the first cookbook that claims that \\"Nothing is Made from Scratch.\\" What Sandra means is, you will still be cooking, just parts of the recipe are \\"convenience/prepackaged foods\\" or packet mixes. This slices time off making cakes for sure!<br /><br />Firstly, these recipes looked far too easy and so I was a bit skeptical. Secondly, I don't normally buy anything not in its raw state. Buying \\"pancake mix\\" was new to me. Heading home from the grocery store, I almost felt a little sinful.<br /><br />This cookbook contains 101 recipes such as Pumpkin Cinnamon Pancakes, Southwestern Turkey Chili, roasted Pepper Soup, Kahlua Tiramisu and Berry Cookie Cobbler. You will find recipes for appetizers, soups, salads, main dishes, desserts, snacks and even treats you can make for your pets.<br /><br />The beauty of this cookbook is almost more in the \\"Semi-Homemade\\" techniques than in the actual recipes. Technically, you can adapt these recipes for your own use in many ways.<br /><br />Tonight I made the \\"Steak Pinwheels with Sun-Dried Tomato Stuffing and Rosemary Mashed Potatoes.\\" In the recipe, it calls for sun-dried tomatoes that are not packed in oil, but I just used the ones I had in oil and reduced the amount to 2 tablespoons chopped sun-dried tomatoes in oil.<br /><br />The Stove top stuffing mix I found was only 6 ounces, but the recipe called for a 6.6 ounce box. It still worked fine. Instead of just salt and pepper on the skirt steak, I used garlic salt and freshly ground Tellicherry peppercorns. Ok, so I cheated and made the potatoes from scratch because I had potatoes I needed to use up.<br /><br />Then, for desert, no lies! I waited to make the desert until \\"after\\" dinner. This was new. I didn't feel stressed at all. I took the pound cake out of the freezer, cut it into cubes and drizzled the rum-butter sauce all over the cake. Yum! Then, for an added touch, you can mix in some frozen raspberries with the jam. I also used frozen raspberries on top and added whipped cream. The \\"Raspberry Trifle with Rum Sauce\\" is absolutely delish! She doesn't say to use whipped cream, but Trifle without whipped cream just isn't the same.<br /><br />So, to explain how much time I saved, I made the recipe in about 10 minutes. Since the vanilla pudding was already cold and the frozen raspberries cooled down the entire desert very fast, I could have served this almost immediately. Not having to make the pound cake was a real treat and hey, I didn't even have to make custard.<br /><br />My husband absolutely loved the Trifle and the gravy for the Steak Pinwheels. I was queen of the kitchen!<br /><br />The full-color, full-page photographs are really tempting. Unlike other cookbooks, the food I made actually did look exactly like the pictures. Each recipe has time estimates and suggested brand-name ingredients. If you are looking for a cookbook for entertaining, this one has some excellent time saving ideas.<br /><br />I noticed that Sandra also suggests you plan your entire week's menu in advance. This is a great time-saving idea and has worked for me for years! Keeping \\"staples\\" on hand is always useful.<br /><br />Contents Include:<br /><br />Grocery Shopping - Hints and Tips to get you in and out of the store fast.<br /><br />Brand Names, Prepping, Cooking, and cooling Times, Budget, Leftovers, Storage, Music<br /><br />Some Examples of the Recipes:<br /><br />Breakfast - Muffins, Crepes and Country Biscuits and Gravy<br /><br />Lunch - Curried bowtie Salad, Beefy Stew or Gnocchi Dippers<br /><br />Dinner - Dijon Chicken and Mushrooms, Meaty Microwave Lasagna, Tropical Salmon<br /><br />Desserts - Vanilla Cream Pie, Bananas Foster Pie, Rum Cake<br /><br />Appetizers - Sesame Chicken Drumettes, Italian Fondue, Smoked Salmon and Olive Blini or Oriental Pork Wrappers<br /><br />Soups & Salads - Roasted Pepper Soup, Cheddar Potato Soup, Bay Shrimp and Avocado Salad, Spicy Crab Salad.<br /><br />Snacks - Caramel Popcorn, Hummus Pitas, Bagel Chip Dip<br /><br />Gravies & Sauces - Sherry Mushroom Gravy, Pesto, Hollandaise Sauce<br /><br />Pet Foods - Bone-Nanza Bones, Healthy Hound Stew, Kitty Katafornia Rolls<br /><br />Sandra starts each chapter with a note about the recipes to follow. There is a full index, but each chapter also has its own contents page.<br /><br />Semi-Homemade is for any cook who is looking for \\"shortcut\\" strategies. You really can make delicious meals in \\"minutes.\\" If you are looking for more leisure time, but want to still enjoy home-made meals, this might be for you.<br /><br />If you are looking for low-salt, low-fat cooking, I think you could adapt many of the recipes by purchasing low-salt beef stock or mixes that say low salt. With prepackaged foods, that has to be a consideration. Although many of the recipes are healthier because she uses techniques that make them low-fat. Like her \\"Healthy Onion Rings\\" that are made in the oven.<br /><br />I can't wait to make the Tropical Salmon and Pumpkin Cinnamon Pancakes.<br /><br />A cookbook to make your life easier! Really inspired me to get back in the kitchen and have some fun.

If you are looking for low-salt, low-fat cooking, I think you could adapt many of the recipes by purchasing low-salt beef stock or mixes that say low salt. With prepackaged foods, that has to be a consideration. Although many of the recipes are healthier because she uses techniques that make them low-fat. Like her \\"Healthy Onion Rings\\" that are made in the oven.     I can't wait to make the Tropical Salmon and Pumpkin Cinnamon Pancakes.     A cookbook to make your life easier! Really inspired me to get back in the kitchen and have some fun. It was like a cooking holiday!    ~The Rebecca Review	2002-12-24

Through their experiences they see the world in an entirely new way. Not only do they find themselves developing a heightened spiritual awareness, they find out what makes life truly important. They want their lives to have some eternal significance.<br /><br />If you haven't traveled the world, you might not realize the absolute luxury of your life in America. If you have traveled the world, you may already realize that physical poverty does not equal poverty of the soul and physical health and wealth does not equal richness of spirit.<br /><br />If you are looking for the larger picture, the meaning in life or think of life as a journey, you will enjoy this book. \\"Four Souls\\" chronicles a spiritual and literal journey around the globe. Mike, Matt, Jedd and Trey live and work with locals around the world. In each country they touch lives and encourage people who have varied religious beliefs. Their focus is not on one religion, but rather they bring a new sense of adventure to living a life with meaning and purpose and according to the principles of Christ.<br /><br />They travel to:<br /><br />Mexico<br />Guatamala<br />Russia<br />Egypt<br />South Africa<br />India<br />Bangladesh<br />Thailand<br />Vietnam<br /><br />Through their travels, conversations, journaling, and real-life cultural experiences they have the dawning realization that the Epic life is the type of life that makes each day worth waking up for. This journey is just part of the process of turning them into the type of men they want to be.<br /><br />\\"Snowflakes flurried in the darkness. Whereas the jungles and hills of Guatemala had teemed with movement and noise, chatter and kaleidoscopic color, these ancient forests smothered all sounds beneath their snows. But this realm did not feel less alive. It felt more so, like diving into a lake on a frost-covered morning. There was none of the mental dizziness caused by tropical haze and drowsy warmth. We felt as awake and sharp as the edge of a razor.\\" pg. 106<br /><br />The writing is often vivid and describes moments with fascinating creativity which shows great powers of observation. Throughout the book, journal sections explore the philosophical ideas each considers while traveling to unique places in the mind as well as the world. They compare the values and culture in America with how unique values are expressed overseas.<br /><br />Their journey is complicated by overwhelming challenges. First, they must drive through hurricane damaged roads in order to get to Guatemala. They then narrowly escape the eruption of Mount Etna which wreaked havoc on the Sicilian countryside.<br /><br />To add to the stress of the situation, they leave on their mission with less than the amount needed to complete the trip. They are ten thousand dollars short of their expected budget and then they have many unexpected expenses to deal with along the way. They must deal with corrupt governments, a riot in South Africa, crime and even guerrilla warfare.<br /><br />They soon realize that America is thought of as a mythical land across the sea and that we have so much while the rest of the world struggles in impoverished conditions. Yet, as they travel, they find that hospitality is given in its purest form, that people live in the moment and the search for wealth is not as important as an emphasis on the beauty of human relationships.<br /><br />There is also a moment of innocent romance where one of the friends gets a crush on a Russian girl. I loved the descriptions of the cuisine in each country and how the authors brought a sense of culture to each chapter.<br /><br />\\"I would have thought that living without the conveniences of electricity, running water, or a car would give one less time for relationships. Surprisingly, I have found the opposite to be true. Wealth and material things so often detract from time for relationships. The complexities that come with more possessions-even while making life more convenient-often bind people to having bad relationships rather than free them to have good ones.\\" -Matt<br /><br />\\"What I saw today was just a minor incident, but I think it says a lot about the turmoil that South Africa is going through at this time.\\" -Mike<br /><br />\\"If Jesus is who He claimed to be, through, He is the Master of life! From what I've seen in those who really seek to follow Him, living as He taught leads to the epic life I want so badly-not necessarily life without trials, but one full of purpose even in the ordinary moments of everyday life.\\" -Jedd<br /><br />\\"Through this trip, we've experienced what an incredible gift it is to be taken in and taken care of. There's just nothing that conveys love and acceptance like an open home and hearth.\\" -Trey<br /><br />If you enjoy looking at life from unique perspectives, you will enjoy the \\"reflection sections\\" which are excerpts from each friend's journal.

Its blood spilled in red luminescence onto the stark blue of the sky, creating pools of glistening crimson. The clouds raced to stanch the flow, but only succeeded in turning their white loveliness a pale pink. The streaks of their tears formed a rainbow against the sky...\\"<br /><br />J. Winter is a master of the metaphor. He makes love to each page with visions that could only come from a keen sense of observation and extended contemplation. Personification also moves to an entirely new magical level and the simile is unabashed in its beauty as it lays open on the page.<br /><br />There is such intense beauty in the writing style it becomes a perfume that drifts through the pages never letting you escape its pure scent. The rhythm of the words entice you into poetry and spiritual elements so rare, the writing at times becomes art.<br /><br />The basic plot is one of a tragic love story that lays bare the pain of separation, the loneliness of the human heart, true love and ultimate sacrifice. These elements blend into a unity and here and there a tiny droplet of horror emerges to balance the romance.<br /><br />The love between a Korean woman (Changmi) and a Native American man (Ainsley) flesh out the story with sensual images painted in lyrical language. The long flowing sentence mingle with warm conversation and all have the undercurrent of emotion needed to connect the feelings of the characters with the readers own deep and perhaps even hidden emotions.<br /><br />Changmi/Rose is untouched by love until she meets Ainsley. She is working at a cat house while he is an animal trainer working with Tigers, Lions and Jaguars. He has never been scarred by love, but carries a physical scar inflicted by a jaguar. Rose and Ainsley almost seem to stalk around one another, only getting close enough to let their wild natures show for moments in time.<br /><br />Ainsley is lonely and seeks comfort in the arms of Rose who refuses to become emotionally involved due to the nature of her employment. They never realize that their relationship will turn into a mystical journey into the depths of loneliness and sacrifice.<br /><br />The story begins with Ainsley saving a girls life after she falls into a Tiger exhibit. He risks his life and is willing to die. He seems to be one with the animals in a spiritual way and is unafraid of dying. This fearless spirit is heroic and yet is his dangerous rebellious spirit that haunts him.<br /><br />I found the theme of cats and flowers fascinating throughout the novel. The entire story resembles two roses tangled together and growing towards the sun or the warmth of love. Changmi's story weaves around Ainsley's life in such a way as to take hold of him and bring them both beauty and pain. This story unravels at its own pace if you let it flow through you.<br /><br />T'ongil is completely satisfying, unpredictable, unique and stunningly sexy. This is a story you could read repeatedly just to drown in the decadent descriptions!

The day is suspended too, between winter and spring.\\" Pg. 144<br /><br />There are rare and beautiful books and this is one of them. The author moves from a deep winter of the soul to a spring where she can again appreciate life, the love of family and the feeling of just being alive.<br /><br />Through the pain of her loss, Carolyn Kent Bailey learns that even the Tulips come back into bloom after a long winter. That in the spring, there is renewal and hope.<br /><br />When Carolyn decides to undergo a hysterectomy she never imagines what will occur months and even years down the road. She has no idea how depressed she will feel or how she will have to cling to every shred of happiness just to make it through another day.<br /><br />Through writing in a journal, taking action to heal herself through her own research and by surrounding herself with loving friends and family, Carolyn survives. As the years go by, she heals. Not just physically, but emotionally.<br /><br />This book is in itself, very healing. It is a journey into the most secret thoughts of a woman who has had a total abdominal hysterectomy. She is blunt in her honesty and yet even as you are crying along with her, you start laughing moments later. I felt emotional when reading the first page. I think she captured my heart in one sentence and from there I went on an emotional roller coaster throughout the entire book. Laughing at the uniqueness and genuine wit of the frivolous moments and empathizing and contemplating the emotional upheaval, the panic attacks, the depression.<br /><br />Even in her emotional pain, she somehow manages to conjure up a child-like joy. Even in the depth of her depression, she worries about the animals having enough food in the winter. I laugh to myself as I read: \\"I lie to myself when I need to but there are only ten occasions.\\" The list makes complete sense to me.<br /><br />There is a delightful story of how she raised a squirrel and there is even a poem about how to enchant a squirrel. There are thoughts of pure delight balanced by worries and thoughts about how life changes vividly as you age. This is set up as journal entries.<br /><br />There are poems that are highly relevant to the moment. Carolyn's thoughts inspire her to create poems. From her pain comes great beauty. I found her poems to all be deeply meaningful because I understood the context. After all, she had just told me the story that went with each one<br /><br />Everyone was unique and yet had a definite purpose within the complete process of her inner discovery.<br /><br />When the Sun is a Peony<br /><br />Dip your fingers in the green sea<br />and write a love letter in my hair.<br />Trace the words that tell of a plunge to coral gardens<br />where the flowers are parrotfish<br />and the sea surrounds us like music,<br />of how we lie in the silk of the sun,<br />how your hand on my skin ripples like water<br />and the scent of the air is yellow.<br /><br />Pg. 171<br /><br />Then, there were quotes, delicious quotes sprinkled through the pages in places where they became a natural part of a sentence, of a thought, of a moment. I want to share so many things about this book with you, but it is best experienced in a few hours, reading it alone, maybe in bed.<br /><br />I found the first part of the book was mainly about the surgery, but then Carolyn's writing could really be for anyone who wants to have one of those silent conversations with an author who we know would understand everything we are feeling. Strangely, her natural wit and love for life comes out most boldly when she is in the most physical pain. When she moves into the stages of depression, her creativity seems to bloom like a field of flowers and yet there are dew drops or tears on the flowers. And then when the wind blows and she is refreshed by a moment in time, the flowers laugh.<br /><br />I cannot tell you how many times I laughedout loud and then went right back<br />to crying! Part of me was emotional because of the beauty of her writing and part of me was empathizing with the moments of pain, frustration and the depth of her depression.<br /><br />I hope gynecologists will also read this book so they can empathize with their patients emotional needs. Too often it does seem that we find doctors who are simply viewing the physical symptoms and have forgotten their patients have a soul.<br /><br />I can recommended this book to every woman because you might have to make this choice. I personally had no idea this was the most common surgery performed in the United States! I can think of so many people I want to share this book with because parts of this book touched me so deeply. I felt that some of the author's words have now<br />become a part of me.<br /><br />In losing a precious part of herself that enabled her to give life to two children, Carolyn Kent Bailey has given birth to a book from her soul.<br /><br />What a beautiful gift!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewzing with the moments of pain, frustration and the depth of her depression.

The story focuses on the lives of a few individuals caught in a world of desire, power and intrigue. While dark forces attempt to use these individuals for their own purposes, Michael Valens has been chosen to protect a small smooth stone first discovered in Atlantis.<br /><br /> \\"The Stone of Alexandria\\" in this book might also be known as The Philosopher's Stone. Yet, in this novel, it can be used for good or evil and is controlled by the mind of the person who possesses it. The Philosopher's Stone is said to have a universal binding power that unites minds a souls and encourages the highest realm of pure thought and altruistic existence.<br /><br />Lleu Christopher does not present the stone as a substance that can turn baser metals into gold and almost laughs at the absurdity of such insignificance. He presents it as a powerful object similar to \\"The Ring\\" in the \\"Lord of The Rings\\" movie. This object has a mind of its own and almost protects itself by moving from one person to the next giving them each temporal power. Michael Valens is chosen as a \\"keeper of sorts.\\" First, he has to find the stone!<br /><br />Michael is thrown into a fantasy adventure by his own curiosity and search for spiritual significance. His curiosity leads him to a magickal society.  This book is more fantasy than occult manual and is a metaphysical fantasy about secret societies. It turns into more of an adventure in which Lleu Christopher paints vivid pictures of a fate already decided since the beginning of time.<br /><br />As Michael stands watching his own life, his fate is decided. He must now embrace his new task for the good of the world that is now threatened by the power of thought and intention of the evil ones looking for the stone.<br /><br />Craig Matthews appears as a rival and unlikely candidate to protect an item so powerful as the Stone of Alexandra. He develops a curiosity about \\"The Network\\" and an interest in this magickal stone. The Network protects this magickal object.<br /><br />Lleu adds a touch of romance here and there and effortlessly blends myth with reality and time travel with dark conspiracies and mystical stones. He creates suspense with a kidnapping and draws characters into the story that have emotional significance to the other participants. You can see Michael change from an observer to a highly responsible soul who accepts his mission willingly.<br /><br />\\"Sara was leading him on yet another journey into unknown realities. This, however, was quite unlike his recent dreams and otherworldly travels, where he had felt as much a hostage as a visitor. Where he went with Sara - the terrain changed too quickly for him to focus clearly, but he saw and felt impossibly turquoise seas which blended into scarlet skies, through meadows with kaleidoscopically bright flowers, and black space lit by blue starlight-he would not have traded for anything.\\" Pg. 323<br /><br />Sara is an intriguing character who is actually a faerie creature who captivates Michael's attention. Lleu Christopher draws from his experiences while living in New York City and often used to take the subways in the course of everyday life. He encountered many \\"street people\\" and found out there was a virtual underground city beneath the subway system. He explores subterranean homes briefly in this novel.<br /><br />Lleu Christopher is a writer of both fiction and nonfiction and also reviews various works here at Amazon, including Kybalion: A Study of the Hermetic Philosophy of Ancient Egypt and Greece.<br /><br /> His essays can be found online and he brings perspective to world issues with the use of the theoretical philosophy of being and knowing. He is a writer, philosopher and sociologist and calls himself a \\"fringe dweller.\\" He is interested in Western and Eastern mysticism.<br /><br />Lleu Christopher weaves a story of magick, secret societies, faeries, reincarnation and other ideas in-between a web of intrigue. He introduces each character and develops them fully before weaving their lives into the intricacies of the story. He has an exceptionally intelligent writing style and a background to compliment this novel. He obviously has insight into the nature of the Philosopher's stone.<br /><br />While many see the Philosopher's Stone quite differently and this novel takes many ideas and weaves them into a intriguing plot, it is interesting to consider that the universal binding power which unites minds and souls could in fact be the Son of God. The Philosopher's Stone might not really be a physical substance, but perhaps a spiritual experience in which you accept your destiny through your own spiritual decisions and move towards eternity. After all, to the mystic, the Philosopher's Stone is perfect love. The Hermetic Stone is Divine Power.<br /><br />\\"He who possesses the Philosopher's Stone possesses Truth, the greatest of all treasures, and is therefore rich beyond the calculation of man; he is immortal because reason takes no account of death and he is healed of Ignorance - the most loathsome of all diseases.\\" (The Secret Teachings of All Ages)<br /><br />Rabbi's know of a white powder of gold which is somehow connected to Philosopher's stone, but no one knows how to make it since the knowledge was destroyed along with the first Temple of Solomon.

Wendy presents a back-to-basics approach to healthy living. First, she dispels the myths associated with dieting and boldly declares:<br /><br />\\"Dieting wreaks havoc on the mind, body and soul.\\"<br /><br />Dieting has failed us. Dieting preys on our insecurities. Scientific research indicates that dieters only succeed in weight loss 2% of the time. Dieting also leads to a tense and uncomfortable relationship with food. In fact, Diets can in fact encourage eating disorders.<br /><br />In reality, the less I eat, the more weight I seem to gain. Wendy explains why this occurs! I'm a big fan of the Suzanne Somers' approach because I'm now a believer that it is not really how much you eat, but more the combination of what you eat and when. The only time I've ever lost weight and kept it off was when I was eating more food! Imagine that.<br /><br />Personally, I think dieting is depressing and I'm happy to see Wendy saying that diets don't work. I don't have time to count all those silly calories and I get so stressed out trying to figure out how much of this, how much of that. I give up in a day.<br /><br />With a diet, you know that all the weight you are trying so hard to get rid of is going to come back as soon as you go back to your regular routine. So it seems you should try to find balance and a healthy lifestyle that includes foods that are good for you and will encourage a healthy approach to eating.  There are foods you should be eating to encourage health. Those foods are not discussed in this book. This book deals with eating from a psychological perspective.<br /><br />Wendy also deals with the following questions:<br /><br />Why do we allow the diet industry to get rich while we become overweight?<br />Do you have an eating disorder?<br />Why do we accept our cultural myths about dieting?<br />Are you addicted to exercise?<br />Is your weight gain related to a medical condition?<br />What effect does cortisol have on your body? Can the stress of being on a diet actually make you gain weight?<br /><br />So, we are still hungry, we crave foods we are told are bad for us and we want to have the perfect figure and the perfect life. Wendy gives us a dose of reality by stating the facts.<br /><br />Our society has presented a pleasing view of an unpleasant situation. Models are unhealthy. The images we see flashing across our screens, in magazines and on every billboard scream \\"Be like me,\\" \\"I'm attractive,\\" I'm what you want to be.\\" Yet have you ever heard that some models lay in bed all day because they feel so sick and depressed they have no life besides modeling? I've heard these stories.<br /><br />The advertising industry is doing more harm than good all while filling their pockets with our money. They are feeding off our insecurity, our desire to belong and be loved. America is obsessed with beauty. As Wendy points out, \\"Perfectionism breeds low self-esteem.\\" The harder we try to become \\"perfect,\\" the more \\"imperfect\\" we feel.<br /><br />\\"With the advent of the mass media, however, women now find themselves being compared not just to the girl down the street, but also to the most beautiful (and often surgically enhanced) women in the world. It's no longer good enough to look normal'; instead, you need to look like Calista Flockhart or Demi Moore.\\" pg. 35<br /><br />Wendy gives us back a calm sense of control. She encourages the reader to achieve a sense of balance in their life through maintaining a healthy view of life.<br /><br />While she encourages us to evaluate our own lives, she also explains what didn't work for her and what isn't working for millions of Americans. She herself struggled with an eating disorder for ten years.<br /><br />Her purpose in writing \\"Fed Up!\\" is to encourage a \\"nationwide rethinking about whether dieting and maintaining mental lists of so called good and bad foods actually leads to long term health and weight management.\\" She wants her readers to think seriously about the impact of cultural pressures and the pursuit of unrealistic beauty standards.<br /><br />Wendy's book provides steps you can take to achieve a healthy mind and body. You will become more relaxed in your relationship with food and consider the psychological barriers to health and fitness.<br /><br />The steps are:<br /><br />Step One: Recognize Your Exhaustion: Is Food Preoccupations Running Your Life?<br /><br />In this chapter, you can take a \\"Are You Exhausted?\\" Self-Inventory test. The results may surprise you.<br /><br />Step Two: Reject the Cultural Myths That Make You Diet and Gain Weight<br /><br />In this chapter you will find information on how to calculate your BMI (Body Mass Index). This will help you figure out what weight you should be as opposed to how much you weigh now. With a few simple calculations you will find out if you are actually underweight, a healthy weight or overweight.<br /><br />Step Three: Decide That You Are Good Enough Today to Love Yourself Today<br />Step Four: Learn to Experience, Trust and Enjoy Hunger and Satiation<br />Step Five: Straight Talk about Exercise<br />Step Six: Get Your Doctor on Your Weight-Loss Team<br />Step Seven: Learn to Wait to Lose Weight<br />Step Eight: Break Through the Secrecy<br />Step Nine: Redefine Your Life: What's More Important to You Than Dieting?<br />Step Ten: Give to the Next Generation: Preventing Eating Disorders and Obesity in Children<br /><br />This is not a book about fancy meal plans, supplements, exercise equipment, foods you should and should not eat. There are no diets in this book!<br /><br />This book is about taking control of your mind and body. Wendy offers advice on how to develop an enjoyable, effective and sustainable fitness program. She also discusses how parents can help prevent eating disorders in their children.<br /><br />\\"Fed Up!\\" shows you how to enjoy the primordial pleasures of eating<br />while focusing on how to avoid the modern madness of diets.<br /><br />If you are ready to break free from the prison of dieting, this ten-step plan will help<br />you to control your eating, lose excess pound and maintain your ideal weight.<br /><br />Inspirational and Insightful.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewal lists of so called good and bad foods actually leads to long term health and weight management.\\" She wants her readers to think seriously about the impact of cultural pressures and the pursuit of unrealistic beauty standards.

The quantum theory was developed over a period of thirty years through the efforts of many scientists.<br /><br />While, Newtonian physics helps describe the orbit of the planets, quantum physics describes how electrons surround the nucleus of an atom and other subatomic actions. Atoms and subatomic particles are not solid, they are clouds of energy.<br /><br />Electrons don't orbit like planets, instead they form blurred clouds around the nucleus. The nucleus is made of protons and neutrons also known as hadrons. Hadrons are made up of three smaller particles called quarks that are \\"glued\\" together by tiny particles called \\"gluons.\\"<br /><br />According to old theories, energy was treated as a continuous phenomenon, while matter occupies a very specific region of space. In quantum theory, energy is emitted and absorbed in tiny amounts. An individual bundle of invisible energy called a \\"quantum\\" behaves in some situations like a particle of matter.<br /><br />In 1924, Louis de Broglie proposed that not only do light waves sometimes exhibit particle like properties, as in the photoelectric effect and atomic spectra, but particles may also exhibit wavelike properties.<br /><br />The light given off or absorbed by an atom has certain frequencies (wavelength). The quantum theory shows that those frequencies correspond to definite energies of the light quanta, or \\"photons.\\" The electrons of the atom can only have certain allowed energy values and when an electron changes from one level to another, a quantum of energy is emitted OR absorbed whose frequency is directly proportional to the energy difference between the two levels.<br /><br />After the discovery of the nuclear atom by Rutherford in 1911, the quantum theory was used to explain atomic structure and atomic spectra, showing the connection between the electrons' energy levels and the frequencies of light given off and absorbed.<br /><br />The uncertainty principle places an absolute, theoretical limit on the combined accuracy of certain pairs of simultaneous, related measurements. The accuracy of a measurement is given by the uncertainty in the result.  If a measurement is exact, the uncertainty is zero. However, only one of a pair of quantities can be measured precisely.  The value of the other must remain unknown.<br /><br />Perhaps Joseph A Stirt is a quantum mechanics philosopher who believes we live in two worlds.<br /><br />There are things that happen in the quantum world that he would consider \\"supernatural.\\" Have you ever thought about particles existing and not existing at the same time or a hundred trillion neutrinos whistling through your body every second.<br /><br />Neutrinos are similar to the more familiar electron, however they are electrically neutral! Their spin is also always oriented in the direction opposite to their velocity.<br /><br />F. Reines said Neutrinos are \\"... the most tiny quantity of reality ever imagined by a human being\\".<br /><br />With Neutrinos flying through us can we really believe reality is as \\"concrete\\" as we perceive it to be?<br /><br />By creating this book, the author is not attempting to be intellectual, but rather he is making an attempt to make sense of life. He is encouraging the reader to take hold of the idea that great forces have a part in our lives and that if we could somehow tap into this force, our lives would be more interesting.<br /><br />This book is a collection of quotes discovered by the author over the last 40 years. If you want to find a source, you can look it up in the Notes. I would almost have preferred to see the source next to the quote, however that might have broken up the thought patterns. So you must let the words flow into your mind like little neutrinos without a home.<br /><br />His inspiration comes from many sources including:<br /><br />The Age of Spiritual Machines by R. Kurzweil<br /><br />The Holographic Universe by M. Talbot<br /><br />Physics and Philosophy by W. Heisenberg<br /><br />You may want to start reading some of the works he lists in the Notes. They<br />do seem rather intriguing.<br /><br />\\"In a general sense, I'm trying to make some sense of things.\\" - Joseph A. Stirt, M.D.<br /><br />The first quote in the book says: \\"Only the incomprehensible is worth understanding.\\"<br /><br />How can you not love this book? This is a quote from \\"Only the Incomprehensible\\" by T. Parks, \\"Destiny\\" 2000<br /><br />I was immediately INTRIGUED.<br /><br />While reading the quotes, you might want to highlight the books/articles they come from and then do further study. There is space in the back of the book to write in your own thoughts. Perhaps at some point the author will include not only a few pages on his own life, but also a section explaining his research.<br /><br />This book will spin your mind in circles in some places and that is a good thing.

Cupcake is the hero of the story and the author was inspired to write about her due to her more-than-wild-kitten-like-behavior.<br /><br />Andy and Carol take on the responsibilities of a new kitten but are confused by her strange behavior. They buy books on cats and try to understand why she at times runs like mad through the house or goes tearing up the curtains. Cat owners will be able to relate to these stories.<br /><br />The first chapter is from Andy and Carol's perspective. The second chapter is from Cupcake's perspective and from there on out, she has a real personality and talks to another cat and has her own thoughts about the situation she is in. It is cute to see how she finds courage and learns to accept the new baby and how she gets up the courage to find the germ creatures.<br /><br />\\"Her ears picked up the scratching sound of the creature. She lowered her body and stalked along the wall toward the living room. She peered into the dimly lit room and saw the germ creature sitting on top of the coffee table. Cupcake trembled. She thought she wouldn't be afraid this time, but she didn't know where the other germ was.....\\"<br /><br />All the while, Cupcake is fighting off creatures Andy and Carol can't see in an attempt to protect them. She takes her job very seriously. This is a story for ages 9-12 which will make kids laugh and has enough suspense to keep their attention.<br /><br />Much of this story reminded me of both my cats when they were kittens. Cat \\"pets/owners\\" will enjoy the humor and remember when their kittens acted in similar ways. However, now you will know why. ;) You will relate to giving a cat a bath and know it is not their favorite activity.<br /><br />I would say it is not good to give cats milk, they do have milk \\"just\\" for cats now. However, the author mentions that: \\"The plastic from around the milk jug top was one of her favorite things to play with.\\" This is so true! I have yet to meet a cat who did not go wild with cat-like joy when they found the ring from around the milk jug top.<br /><br />Also, cats have been know to fight off disease by catching rats. The European bubonic plague of medieval times was largely due to the huge rat population. Cats are well known for controlling rodent populations, however people at that time did not see the connection and thought cats were evil.<br /><br />A clever story to teach children how to respect cats and perhaps they will want to know more about cats and maybe even adopt a kitten from a shelter.

The handicrafts represent a love of color and detail. This can be seen in the mirrored Kutch embroidery that consists of cotton and metallic threads interspersed with brilliant metallic or mirror sequins that look like tiny round mirrors.<br /><br />The needlework of the tribal artistes of Kutch, Gujarat is famous all over the world due to its precision and finesse. The wives of herdsmen, nomads and agriculturists sew in order to bring in a second income.<br /><br />The background is made from vegetable dyed fabric. A hook is used to create loops with metallic thread and a repetition of this movement leads to a line of chain stitches. Between these stitches, snakes of gold, cerise or pearl sequins enhance the beauty.<br /><br />This book looks like a cushion cover covered with rustic embroidery. This is not a fabric cover, it is smooth like leather, but has a representation of the needlework which is quite fascinating in itself.

He dispels the myth of unpredictability and guides you through the publicity process.<br /><br />Feeding the Media Beast is a extremely well organized book. First the author tells you what he is going to present to you and the proceeds to deliver a delicious array of pithy comments, witty remarks, insightful solutions, examples you can relate to, concise descriptions and snappy quotes. This book is well researched and to the point.<br /><br />The text is snappy and fresh and the author often displays an uncommon perspective. He presents unique ideas on conveying information and shows you how to use this highly potent marketing machine to promote your product or idea.<br /><br />I was rather impressed with how succinctly and honestly Mark Mathis describes the Media Beast and its voracious appetites. He shows you exactly how to serve up a story the beast won't be able to resist. In fact, he says it is quite predictable.<br /><br />\\"When a Media Leader latches onto your story, big things are bound to happen.\\"<br /><br />So, how exactly do you get the Media Beast to pay attention and hunger for your<br />information?  It seems that once you understand the nature of the beast, you can follow twelve simple rules to success.<br /><br />Mark Mathis has worked as a television reporter, columnist and talk radio host. In the past few years, he has been teaching the Media Rules. These rules include the Rule of Difference, Emotion, Simplicity, Preparation, Easy, Repetition, Resource, Invention, Timing, Ego, Balance, Ambush.<br /><br />You might be especially intrigued by how he answers the following questions:<br /><br />1. Why do reporters seem to have a worldview that differs from the general population?<br />2. Why do reporters tend to support liberal positions?<br />3. Where do journalists come from?<br />4. Why is the most popular news often irrelevant to your community?<br />5. How do you make a reporter care about your story?<br />6. Are you prepared to give an interview?<br />7. Do you know what the Media Beast wants for dinner?<br />8. Is bad publicity avoidable?<br />9. How can you get reporters to call you for your expert opinions?<br />10. How do you avoid the traps even PR professionals fall into?<br /><br />Mark Mathis explores all angles, highlights simple truth and elaborates with anecdotes that will often make you laugh. You will learn how to make a difference in the world, create a compelling message and utilize DES (difference, emotion and simplicity).<br /><br />Feeding the Media Beast is for anyone who views the news, produces the news, wants to be in the news or has been burned by the news.<br /><br />Fear the Beast no more!<br />Even if he is knocking at your door.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewnity?   5.

Keith first wrote these commandments when he was 19. What a concept! He challenged himself to do what he felt was right even if people responded in the wrong ways. More than 25 years later, he discovered that Mother Teresa had hung these commandments on the wall of her children's home in Calcutta. This book was first published in 1968.<br /><br />His Commandments show you that you should not limit yourself by what other people think of you. Some people are just difficult to love and some never give you the approval you may crave. Your parents may never be happy with your current position in life, you may always think that your parents could have done a better job in parenting, you can at times be disappointed that your friends don't show you unconditional love.<br /><br />Sometimes people can be illogical and unreasonable. They may see the world in a completely different way and to your mind, they make absolutely no sense. It helps to see why they are viewing the world the way they are. So many times you learn about one fact in a person's life and your entire concept of them can change.<br /><br />I think there are moments in life when people decide not to love others and supreme moments when people decide to love no matter what. It seems many people either don't show love because they don't approve of certain people or they simply don't have the time to reach out to people. You can literally shut your heart away in a little box inside of you or you can open that box and let all that love flow out. It is really up to you.<br /><br />Kent says that:<br /><br />People are illogical, unreasonable, and self-centered. Love them anyway. If you do good, people will accuse you of selfish ulterior motives. Do good anyway. If you are successful, you will win false friends and true enemies. Succeed anyway. The good you do today will be forgotten tomorrow. Do good anyway. Honesty and frankness make you vulnerable. Be honest and frank anyway. The biggest men and women with the biggest ideas can be shot down by the smallest men and women with the smallest minds. Think big anyway. People favor underdogs but follow only top dogs. Fight for a few underdogs anyway. What you spend years building may be destroyed overnight. Build anyway. People really need help but may attack you if you do help them. Help people anyway. Give the world the best you have and you'll get kicked in the teeth. Give the world the best you have anyway.<br /><br />As he says: If approval and worthiness were really a prerequisite for love, there would be very little love in the world. Love at its best is unconditional.\\"<br /><br />What many people don't realize is that unconditional love can be a great joy or a terrible burden. Of course, we all want to be loved unconditionally. I think it is our most basic human need.<br /><br />I have loved a few people in my life who didn't know how to love me back and I guess that is one of the most hurtful things in life. But for every situation where you are not loved, there are so many other situations where life can be beautiful, fulfilling and a true adventure.<br /><br />If you feel you can't love other people, try being more accepting of yourself. When you learn to love who you are, it is easier to love everyone else.<br /><br />\\"Your friend is the man who knows all about you, and still likes you.\\" -Elbert Hubbard<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewen with the biggest ideas can be shot down by the smallest men and women with the smallest minds.

In fact, I'm pretty sure you can think yourself into happiness, depression, frustration and just about any other emotion you can think of.<br /><br />What are you thinking of today? Are you stressed about a situation? Are you dreaming of a vacation? What are you saying to yourself right now? When you start to compare what you are thinking about to how your emotions are rolling along, it becomes very apparent that you either have to change your way of thinking or the words you use will start to control you in the wildest ways.<br /><br />Howard Kaminsky and Alexandra Penney have been great friends for 20 years or more. Together they have created a rather interesting book.<br /><br />Words can Hurt or Heal. They can also show that we have manners or that we know how to behave in various situations. \\"Magic\\" words can give us hope, show us things in a new light and can help us cope with situations that would actually overtake us if we did not control our thinking.<br /><br />Are you dealing with a stressful situation? When are we not dealing with stress! Anyway, this book will give you some ideas on how to use \\"Magic\\" words to deal with this stress. Sometimes you are just dying inside and you don't show it on the outside. There is a story about a woman who was going through a terrible time. She cried for weeks and then finally she started to say magic words and felt herself moving from tragedy to success.<br /><br />\\"It's a rough patch in the long road of life.\\"<br /><br />The authors make you rethink a few phrases, like \\"Time is Money\\" becomes \\"Time is Honey.\\" They encourage you to see those beautiful moments in time that taste sweet.<br /><br />Other ideas like telling people you really need them or you need their help, gives the situation a new focus and people are more willing to help you out of your problem.<br /><br />Words are extremely powerful, use<br />them with caution.<br /><br />Maybe the most powerful words in the world are: \\"I love you.\\"<br /><br />I'm pretty convinced that can change lives.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewnge lives.    ~The Rebecca Review	2002-10-01

And why do we sweat the small stuff so much? Is there some balance, some moment when you realize that most of it is all small stuff?<br /><br />Kristine Carlson is married to Richard Carlson and together they show great insight into the everyday life. Their books can seriously start to change your life if you use the principles they present in these easy-to-read compact books. I especially like their \\"Don't Sweat the Small Stuff in Love\\" book and I think it helped me improve my own relationship considerably by making me realize that one of the most important needs humans have is to be listened to. I had never really thought about what the other person needed in conversation, always so busy jabbering on. Wow, that was quite a revelation to me and it changed my entire view of conversation.<br /><br />Expect real revelations from these books. They are more than enlightening. Sometimes a simple awareness of an issue can trigger an entire thinking pattern that will help you make changes. When reading this book a highlighter is essential!<br /><br />Kristine discusses why you should set aside time every morning to reflect. See, that is a good excuse to spend a little time in the morning chatting online? Right? Ok, well I think that she actually meant spending time alone thinking about your day.<br /><br />As you move into your day, you try to get organized and at times the entire day feels like it is falling apart. Have you noticed that if you pick up the house in the morning, the entire day is more enjoyable? Kristine gives herself an hour each morning to clear the path of her day. She spends time each morning organizing her life. I loved her thought about laundry. A gentleman she met makes folding clothes a Zen meditation. Ok, so I am not burning candles while I fold towels, but I try not to be as stressed about it all.<br /><br />Some of her ideas include:<br /><br />Make Peace with The Mundane - Sometimes life just IS.<br />Ground Your Energy in Nature - Take a walk in the evening.<br />Protect Your Inner Flame - Nurture yourself.<br /><br />Plan an Inspiration Flow Day - Just go with the flow...oh, what fun this type of day is. It is very freeing and you do just what occurs to you. I write the most reviews on these types of days. They might include reading a great book, watching a movie, sitting outside with the cats, making dinner, writing in a journal, exercising. On other days, you might feel like just leaving the house for most of the day and forgetting about that load of laundry, those dishes, etc. Just escaping can be most freeing.<br /><br />Walk Through Open Doors - A positive attitude shows you more open doors.<br /><br />Let Go of \\"Perfect\\" Plans - have a sense of humor when things don't work instead of crying your eyes out. Dissapointment is so hard to take when you have very high expectations.<br /><br />Climb Your Mountain One Step at a Time - set goals, but take it one step at a time.<br /><br />Save Pot Stirring for Cooking Dinner (I really liked that one!)<br />Gather and Let Go<br />Define Your Small Stuff<br /><br />This is a collection of essays that will inspire you and you will learn to appreciate people in your life, swallow your anger, take time for yourself and nurture your friendships.<br /><br />Use this as a way to make your own list of things you want to change in your life.<br /><br />Then:<br /><br />Go run in a rain puddle<br />Light Candles while you watch a movie<br />Think about Beautiful Moments<br />Start a Journal<br />Say something inspirational to a friend<br />Tell someone in your life you love them<br />Let some things go, don't obsess so much (ok, but it is hard to do!)<br /><br />Define what is not really important then imagine it drifting away on a small boat, down the river in front of you. After all, who has time for all that baggage.<br /><br />Read this book to help you see the really important things in life.<br /><br />Great Insight!

I fondly remember spending hours just looking through this book and wishing the cookies I wanted to make would magically appear on a plate. Soon, I was old enough to cook the Peanut butter Cookies, Russian Teacakes and Candy Cane Cookies. My favorite page as a child was page 56. A page filled with storybook cookies.

We always used the traditional dip and sweep method for measuring the flour. Then, on the next page they explain why your cookie dough might be too soft. I've always found this rather amusing, since you see...if you use the sifting method, you will possibly not have enough flour, at least in my mind. Most cookbooks say to use one OR the<br />other method.<br /><br />Some of the cookies you might enjoy:<br /><br />Old-Fashioned Oatmeal Cookies<br />Butterscotch Brownies<br />Holiday Spritz<br />Snickerdoodles<br />Christmas Bells<br />Cream Wafers<br />Nougat Bars<br /><br />Definitely a collectable Betty Crocker Cookbook.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2002-09-29

With life moving at a record pace, you are doing well if you remember to drink your eight glasses of water a day. While water is undeniably essential to your well being, it is amazing how many of us forget to drink those extra glasses of water that could make all the difference. Remembering to take a multivitamin is another one of those daily things you almost have to write on your calendar to remember along with: \\"Exercise Today or Else!\\"<br /><br />As I sit here chewing a Country Life Adult's Multivitamin, I wonder if I am getting all the essential Vitamins and Minerals in one supplement. Would it not be ideal if all you had to take each day was one chewable and delicious pill and that was it. Well, life is just not that simple, unfortunately. Each multivitamin is formulated differently and to find one that is Vegetarian and Hypoallergenic was a real plus.<br /><br />Now, if you just picked up a bottle of multivitamins and you didn't know that taking over 8,000 I.U. of vitamin A per day was not advisable for pregnant women, you might want to read this book. If you are dealing with skin problems, you might want to take 10,000 IU and that would be fine. For Vitamin A to be toxic, you would have to take 100,000 IU daily for a period of months and you would not want to take such a high dose unless under a doctor's supervision.<br /><br />There is a handy chart where you can Troubleshoot for Disorders. If you have Insomnia, you might want to consider Calcium and Melatonin (Read the book by Ray Sahelian first if you take prescription medications).<br /><br />Most of us have taken Antibiotics. Did you know that this could cause a deficiency in B2, Biotin, Folic Acid, Niacin, C, D, Calcium, Iron, Magnesium, Potassium and Zinc?<br /><br />What this book will do for you is give you the basic information you need to make informed decisions about your health. You will know which supplement to take and how much you should take. This book is written by a practicing certified nutrition specialist.

Simple techniques like breathing properly or visualizing yourself in a peaceful scene can give immediate relief. There are lists of coping statements you can say to yourself to encourage calmness when you feel panic symptoms coming on. The list of 57 affirmations help you counter mistaken beliefs. Like, you tell yourself that you are responsible and in control of your life or you are willing to accept yourself the way you are and will take small steps to recover at your own pace.<br /><br />I also liked the \\"Self-Nurturing Activities\\" which is a fun list of activities to make yourself feel good. Something as simple as taking a warm bath to sleeping out under the stars. The \\"Life Events Survey\\" is very interesting. The Death of a spouse, divorced, marital separation or being fired from work are at the top of the stress scale. Christmas comes in at 12 on the stress score as compared to 29 when you have trouble with inlaws.<br /><br />For example: If you got married, changed to a different line of work, changed residence, and took two vacations, your total stress score would be at 132.<br /><br />According to this chart, my current stress level is at 143.

Milne was born in England in 1882 and wrote some delightful books about Winnie-the-Pooh and Christopher Robin. Pooh was actually inspired by a teddy bear belonging to Milne's son, Christopher. His books have been translated into over two dozen languages are favorites of children and adults throughout the world.<br /><br />So wherever I am, there's always Pooh,<br />There's always Pooh and Me.<br />\\"What would I do?\\" I said to Pooh,<br />\\"If it wasn't for you,\\" and Pooh said: \\"True,<br />It isn't much fun for One, but Two<br />Can stick together,\\" says Pooh, says he.<br />\\"That's how it is,\\" says Pooh.<br />-Us Two, pg. 3<br /><br />Ernest H. Shepard illustrated the Pooh books and Milne was so pleased with the drawings for the first book that he invited Shepard out to his home in Surrey, England so he could sketch the actual woodland settings for the stories.<br /><br />In this book we find \\"Us Two,\\" \\"Winnie-The-Pooh And Some Bees,\\" \\"Sneezles\\"and \\"An Expotition To the North Pole\\" followed by two poems and then a story about Tiger coming to the forest and a prayer.<br /><br />In the first story, Pooh falls out of a tree and it wasn't quite what he meant to do. He really just wanted some honey. \\"Sneezles\\" is about Christopher Robin which is a real tongue twister. In the next story after a simple meal of marmalade spread lightly over a honeycomb or two, Pooh goes off to see if Christopher Robin wants to go off on an \\"Expotition.\\" Yes, that is the spelling.<br /><br />Then, I the middle of the night, Winnie-the-Pooh woke up suddenly and found a tiger named Tigger. The two have a hilarious little conversation and then after breakfast they go off to see piglet, Eeyore and Kanga.<br /><br />These are the most delightful stories to read to children and have that added touch of charming humor that will delight adults and children alike. The illustrations are quite cute and the rhymes invariably silly.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2002-09-20

B. Smith somehow weaves this poem into his writing and you see Elissa's life playing out a series of inescapable choices in a world where it seems everyone else has found their destiny, their purpose in life.<br /><br />Elissa Laughlin is a young attorney who is dissatisfied with her position in life. She feels disconnected and also seems to be seeking an escape from reality. She is actually a little of every woman and I related well to her inability to just accept life as it occurs.<br /><br />Her reality is not the reality of those she loves or works with in her world that spins in a different direction. She finds one soul who seems at first to be a mirror to her own soul, she opens the door after he pursues her relentlessly. She doesn't want to open the door, she tries not to open the door, but eventually his persistence draws her into an inescapable romance.<br /><br />A place where reality is a thing seen by the mind. A place where she falls into the ocean of inescapable reflection. That place where she sees herself all too clearly, yet can't decide who she must become while she is already becoming.<br /><br />She truly wants love and Warren and tries his best to love her, despite the fact that his relationship with his mother is emotionally troubling and has scarred him in many ways.<br /><br />His loving, kind personality is overshadowed by her calm and irritating insistence that he do what she wants him to do. He longs for a woman who will accept him for who he is, someone who will love him and escape with him into his world. Perhaps he sees a bit of himself in Elissa, a soulmate who he longs to connect with on an intimate level.<br /><br />And yet, Elissa cannot seem to relax into fate, she fights her future by clinging to everything she should let go and embracing everything she should reject. She has dreams of finding the ideal love, the ideal situation and the ideal life. She has created the perfect world in her own mind, she is the queen of a city she builds, but will never see.<br /><br />Her father realizes that she is heading down a similar path to his own disappointment with life. He too dreams of a life he should have had. He is severely disappointed when she moves away from the family circle to pursue her own dreams and further her career.<br /><br />\\"I just feel so left behind,\\" she said. \\"I feel like everyone else is getting what they want except for me.\\" -Elissa<br /><br />Her concept of existence is to find the perfect life and everywhere she looks life is less that she expects it to be. Her hopes are dashed on the rocks of other's disregard. She hopes, dreams, wishes and those values most precious to her soul are tossed into the inability of others to live up to her expectations. She seems ready to give so much, to the right person, the right situation, the right moment. She has waited for that moment all her life.<br /><br />Elissa fears the worst and her fears stop her from taking what is rightfully hers. A life of love, happiness and enjoyment of the simple pleasures. Simple pleasures like taking a cup of tea from someone who loves you. Just accepting what they have to offer and not expecting anything more. Somehow, she wants more and she doesn't know how to get it. This frustration drives her away from all the people who try to love her as she seeks out the ideal love she has created in her mind. She is so afraid that the love she seeks doesn't exist.<br /><br />\\"But she did not realize how dangerous this was. She did not realize how impossible it would be to enjoy him without wanting, very much...\\"<br /><br />D. B. Smith writes with unending creativity and insight into the surroundings in which these characters live. He paints images of their lives quite vividly and the characters all have intensely real personalities. At timesit is like reading a movie, if one can explain such a concept. I found his descriptions rare and beautiful and they flow along with the dialogue, capturing each moment.<br /><br />The first part of the book is amusing, the second complex and the last not surprising and yet does have a strange twist. You will be quite amused by Elissa's family, yet there is some sense of Elissa not being quite able to fit into even her own family surroundings. Everyone is so consumed with their own lives, they don't see she is living in torment. She doesn't seem depressed, just perhaps she is a perfectionist at heart.<br /><br />I thought I would not become any of the characters and felt distanced at first, but near the end, I so became Elissa. I felt her turmoil, her depth of sadness, her loneliness of soul, her inability to connect with the normal life, the expected existence.<br /><br />It occurred to me after reading this book that you can in fact make all your fears come true just as easily as you can find a way to your dreams.<br /><br />A refined reading experience that is highly complex from a psychologically perspective and is compelling for that very reason.<br /><br />Revealing.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewnd beautiful and they flow along with the dialogue, capturing each moment.

What is going on in a child's mind? Are they developing a healthy self-esteem and a positive attitude towards learning?<br /><br />Are you sure your baby feels loved and secure? They discuss the myth about not picking up your infant when he/she cries too much. I have always wondered about this aspect, because I think it is natural for a mother to want to comfort an infant who is crying and it seems unnatural to leave a child crying for ages in a crib when you are who they depend on. This book also tells you that it is normal for babies to cry for certain periods of time during various stages.<br /><br />Some of the highlights include: The advantages of Breast feeding, Establishing Routines, How Babies Communicate and a discussion about how you can encourage your baby to communicate with you through \\"self-talk.\\"<br /><br />I also enjoyed the section on: Why Babies Cry and what to do about it, Understanding your child's unique temperament, Teaching self-discipline, Language and Learning, Play Time, Childproofing the house, The stage from crawling to walking and how to deal with crib-climbers.<br /><br />Questions they answer include:<br /><br />What causes colic and what is the normal duration of crying?<br />When do babies begin talking?<br />Why do children bite?<br />How can I prevent tantrums?<br />How do you provide your child with the best nutrition?<br />How often should you visit the doctor?<br />Will you ever get enough sleep again?<br />What do I do when my baby won't stop crying?<br />Is baby talk ok?<br /><br />This guide will encourage you to make the most of those first few years that can be so crucial to your child's development.

Over the years she has observed a growing interest in holistic remedies. This is quite important during pregnancy as women are seeking natural products, non-invasive treatments and drug-free methods of pain relief that will not harm their babies.<br /><br />She has organized her book, trimester by trimester, so you can follow along and not miss an important aspect of your pregnancy. After all, once the first trimester is over, you are onto the second! In fact, if you are like me, you are reading all these books before even thinking about getting pregnant. Strangely, they seem to be a great form of birth control.<br /><br />Pregnancy is not as easy as it looks. Sure, for most people, it is easy to get pregnant, but what do you do then?<br /><br />If you are like many women who want to plan out their lives to the very second in order to taste life to the fullest, you will enjoy this book as it gives detailed information, comprehensive nutrition plans and exercise suggestions. Along with all the information you really need to know, there are also tips on how to boost your immunity or how to minimize morning sickness.<br /><br />This book also explains your baby's development.<br /><br />The Contents include:<br /><br />Planning for Conception & Pregnancy - how to improve fertility, avoid pollution and reduce stress.<br /><br />Nutrition - Ideally you should be at peak health before pregnancy.<br /><br />Boosting Immunity - How to eat for health and boost the immune system with pressure therapy.<br /><br />Illness during Pregnancy - What do you do if you get a cold and can't take any of the remedies you took before you were pregnant.<br /><br />The First Trimester - You may want to consult other book for the week by week pictures, but this gives a basic overview of your baby's development. Nutrition, exercise and common problems are discussed in each section.<br /><br />The Second Trimester - A discussion of heartburn and Anemia. Discussion on how acupuncture, massage and yoga can help backache. How you can use hydrotherapy to help reduce varicose veins. What about depression?<br /><br />The Third Trimester - Sleeplessness, Skin Problems, Stress & Anxiety, High Blood Pressure, Leg cramps, How to get a Breech baby to turn, Respirator problems.<br /><br />Preparation for Labor & Baby - Detailed discussion of the Placenta, how to detoxify the body, the last few weeks of pregnancy, preparing your mind, natural pain relief, stages of labor.<br /><br />Postpartum Period - Ok, this section makes you want to get pregnant. It is a conspiracy. Here they tell you  about the day-by-day developments and a contented mother holds her child and looks so loving and happy. There is a discussion of Postpartum exercise, nutrition and how to solve problems in this time. Breast-feeding problems are discussed. You might want to choose acupuncture, homeopathy or western herbalism.<br />Complimentary Therapies<br /><br />If you are going to take the advice in this book about herbs, also consider purchasing: Natural Health Magazine Complete Guide to Safe Herbs. This book recommends a tea with chamomile, but it is well known that \\"large doses\\" of chamomile are not good for pregnant women and could increase the risk of complications. The tea they recommend also contains fennel, and I have also read that fennel is not for use during pregnancy. Instead, perhaps try ginger, which they say is safe in small amounts for pregnant women.<br /><br />Just use caution with all that Chamomile tea! If you take ANY herbs during pregnancy, consult with the Natural Health book or ask your doctor first.<br /><br />The Foreword by Kate Winslet is also well worth the price of this book!

This is a book about how to make a home more stylish, sensual and peaceful.<br /><br />There are useful ideas like how you can grow your own produce, recycle items you would normally throw away or how to use fewer chemicals and maybe even make your own compost heap.<br /><br />I found the text inspirational and thought provoking in many ways. It is creative and evokes a feeling of crisp ideas, nostalgic memories from childhood and an awakening to the senses. Pictures of hanging clothes on a clothesline or sweeping a porch barefoot almost make you long for simpler times.<br /><br />The pictures pour themselves over the pages with sheer beauty. This is a book you will want to sit and read while comfortably snuggling on your couch (which you wish looked like the pink one on page 190 where a child is peacefully sleeping) with a down comforter and a cup of tea. The pictures are interspersed with text in the first section. This is a combination of visual and intellectual appeal which I found to be almost unique in its form.<br /><br />There are cute ideas like a bowl of soup decorated with a heart crouton and herbs which I really thought was delightfully fun. The pictures of making a raspberry fool look absolutely sinfully delicious. You just want to put a spoonful of raspberries in your mouth or enjoy the process of folding berries into cream.<br /><br />Then there are ideas for scenting your bedlinen with fragrances or protecting your clothes with natural cedarwood blocks. There is a visual directory of ideas. The last section compliments the first as it gives you ideas on the materials needed to achieve the natural atmosphere described in the first section.<br /><br />There are ideas for building a fire on a damp blustery day or how to bring nature into your home to increase tactile sensations.<br /><br />While the ideas in \\"play\\" are not necessarily that original, you may have forgotten how as a child you carved out potato art to make potato prints. There is a cute way to decorate a tree with heart shaped pastry.<br /><br />To find the recipes you have to turn to page 393 where you can find \\"mini\\" recipes for Chestnut soup, roast chicken with lemon and herb butter, chicken stock, saut&eacute;ed carrots, mince pies, chocolate truffles, orange and almond cake and heart-shaped biscuits.<br /><br />After reading this book I had this almost ecstatic feeling of just peaceful oneness with the earth and home. My thought it is due to the combination of visual and intellectual appeal.<br /><br />A treat for the senses! Highly recommended for new home makers or for anyone who wants to immerse themselves in dreams, thoughts and creative ideas for a few hours.

Its celebration begins on the evening of the 14th of Nisan (first month of the religious calendar, corresponding to March-April) and lasts seven days in Israel.<br /><br />The Haggadah is a book containing the liturgy for the Seder service on the Jewish festival of Passover. The Seder is a ceremonial evening meal that commemorates the Exodus from Egypt and includes the reading of the Haggadah and the eating of symbolic foods.<br /><br />Only unleavened bread may be eaten throughout the festival, in memory of the fact that the Jews, hastening from Egypt, had no time to leaven their bread. Jewish law also requires special sets of cooking utensils and dishes be used. These may not be contaminated by use during the rest of the year.<br /><br />The purpose of this book is to encourage a study of the story of Exodus from Egypt. The questions are from Nechama's weekly Torah study sheets prepared over a thirty-year period. She came to learn Torah from medieval commentators. She also was known for how she valued people and this was a reflection of her deep humility.<br /><br />Sources include biblical texts, Midrashim, and medieval and modern commentaries. Yitshak Reiner and Shmuel Peerless give answers.<br /><br />Nechama Leibowitz (1905-97) used unique instructional methods and her approach was based on active learning. Through this book you will be able to independently analyze and draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />Some of the questions include:<br /><br />How does the Torah help us to understand why we drink four cups of wine at the Seder rather than five?<br /><br />Why does the Haggadah present the four sons in a different order to which they appear in the Torah?<br /><br />\\"And he went down to Egypt: compelled by the Divine decree.\\"<br />Where in the Torah do we find this decree?<br /><br />What is the difference of opinion among classical commentators regarding the purpose of the Pesach offering in Egypt?<br /><br />Some of the features of this book include a chart for the Order of the Seder.

Well in five words: \\"They learned from the experience.\\"<br /><br />If you want advice from a woman who has \\"been there/done that\\" then Dr. Laura is a good source of wisdom. She has fallen, picked herself up and moved on. Girlfriend, this is one woman who isn't going to take it anymore. She looks at the facts, pushes aside the romantic ideals and makes you face the reality of your situation. Personally, I kinda like her \\"in your face truth attitude.\\" It is refreshing to finally hear what no one else will tell you. Dr. Laura's hope is that people will learn to live more balanced lives.<br /><br />She takes a look at our unrealistic drives and primal needs. She says the \\"ultimate stupidity\\" is withholding from yourself the respect you deserve. She shows how women often tolerate obnoxious male behaviors in order to avoid loneliness, self-assertiveness, and self-sufficiency.<br /><br />The lovely contents include chapters on Attachment, Courtship, Devotion, Passion, Cohabitation, Expectations, Conception, Subjugation, Helplessness and Forgiving. While most of this book seems to be for women who are dating, every woman should read this book.<br /><br />\\"It is your job as a woman, as a person, to become as fully realized as you can by having dreams, forging a purpose, building an identity, having courage, and making commitments to things outside of yourself. In so doing, you take a more active role in the quality of your own life so that other people-friends, spouses, children-share in your growth rather than become responsible for it. You'll feel super. And you'll feel really womanly-as opposed to babyish or girlish-perhaps for the first time.\\" ~Dr. Laura<br /><br />She answers the following questions:<br /><br />Why hasn't he called?

Actually, Washington is a beautiful place to sail, yet, my soul longs for the beach life in Florida. The water is warmer for sure!<br /><br />This book seems more sophisticated than the KISS series by DK. I'd say you could use both. This has a nice easy to use Contents section which lists all the basics so you can find information faster.<br /><br />First Essentials is a chapter about safety, it lists the parts of the boat, essential equipment, how a boat sails, main controls, etc. I found it to be quite good.<br /><br />Then they divide the sailing information up into Dinghies, advanced dinghy sailing and cruiser sailing.<br /><br />The navigation section is rather good with information on charts, compasses, plotting equipment, navigation instruments, buoyage, pilotage, tides and tidal streams, plotting a position and passage skills.<br /><br />Weather, Practical Boat Care and Staying Safe are the last three chapters.<br />Highlights include:<br /><br />Great diagrams of the parts of a boat.<br />Learning to tie the six basic knots<br />Capsize Recovery<br />Trapeze FUN!<br />Catamarans<br />Cruiser Ropework - more advanced<br />Daily Changes - how to read the sky<br /><br />The author taught himself to sail at age 10 and was teaching others by the time he was age 14. He has taught daysailing, cruising, and competitive racing. Some people sure know how to live the good life. Jonathan McKee was born in Seattle, Washington where he began sailing at the age of 10. I'd imagine this book is a favorite in Seattle.<br /><br />In the case of sailing, knowledge really is freedom.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2002-07-02

To top it all off, I've done this when a storm was approaching fast. Feeling the wind just take your boat and fly it to the shore is great fun, but a few times I wasn't sure I'd make it there without tipping over.<br /><br />I like small boats where you risk getting your head knocked off by a flying boom, wack. It is such an adventure trying to keep the boat upright and a boom can surely get your attention fast. You soon learn the art of jibing.<br /><br />Sailing is really an art, and after one class in college and days of sailing many a catamaran in sunny Florida, I am still learning the basics. I love catamarans and there is a special section in this book. Plus, if they tip, they don't sink! Ha... Although, getting them upright again and getting everyone back onboard can be a challenge. I speak from the experience of the adventurous in my younger days.<br /><br />While a book will teach you the terminology, take a class!!!<br /><br />Ok, this book will give you the basics on how to sail everything from a dinghy to an offshore cruiser. It will help you know how to choose the type of sailing that is right for you. It might also dispel some fears about handling a boat in a tight situation. Did I mention wearing a life jacket? Ok. There is also a special section about using the liferaft.<br /><br />So, what is the info:<br /><br />Getting Started - Your first taste of freedom.<br /><br />Learning the Basics - How to hoist sails and start and stop. How to steer, turn, tack, jibe.<br /><br />Improving Small Boat Skills - Weather Basics, tides, mooring, anchoring, working with the wind, sailing in strong winds (fun but dangerous, you have been warned), sailing dinghies, catamarans and keelboats, racing.<br /><br />Cruiser Sailing Skills - Moving up to larger boats, power, large sails, small sails, passage plans, night, rough weather, fog!<br /><br />Finding Your Way - Navigation, chart Information, Buoys, electronic charts, compass reading, navigation instruments, heights of the tide, depth sounder, landfall, tidal currents and more. Not for the faint of heart.<br /><br />Looking After Boat and Crew - Running a happy ship, sailing with children, man overboard, first aid, propeller problems, hull damage, rig damage, fire fighting, distress signals, abandoning ship.<br /><br />In the Appendices: Ropes and knots, sailing on the web (similar to surfing), a glossary and nice index to help you plot your course through this book.<br /><br />Sailing is so wonderful.

A by-the-sea town with sparkling turquoise water, where cutesy-touristy restaurants serve homemade biscuits and gravy or a slice of strudel amidst glorious scenery.<br /><br />On a day when the cornflower-blue sky looks down on the hulls of old boats and waves that lazily lap at the sand in a never ending cycle, something washes up on the beach covered with seaweed and spoils the view.<br /><br />Bill is on a vacation from real life, playing out his fantasy as a part-time detective and part time knight in shining armor. He is on a journey to discover the true beauty of life while his own personal pain and loss seems to surround him. The turmoil of his own soul leads him down a path where he tries to drown the pain by drinking his life away.<br /><br />As Bill says: \\"Things happen. Sometimes you have to ride the wave.\\"<br /><br />He is a victim of circumstance, having taken his focus off his life for what seemed like moments, only to return to find his wife seeking solace in the arms of another. Now he finds his wife's love interest, Governor Wallace Moreno, in the arms of the sea, tossed onto the beach as casually as he feels he was tossed aside by his soon-to-be-ex-wife Eleana, a government official.<br /><br />State attorney Sally Solana has sought to rehabilitate him back to his former existence as an attorney after he was suspended for malpractice. When his wife and Sally disappear after the Moreno murder, he steps up to the challenge, all the while having to avoid becoming a suspect and therefore being detained.<br /><br />L.B. Cobb's writing style takes full advantage of verisimilitude in a similar way many of W. Somerset Maugham's stories evoke a sense of confidence in the reader. She also uses those little twists and turns that keep you questioning and her chapter endings plunge you into the next page with a sense of undeniable curiosity.<br /><br />The character development bonds the reader to the characters with heart-felt emotions and moral ambiguities, making them memorable and human.<br /><br />\\"I heard the agony in her voice as the stainless blade of betrayal sliced into her heart. I closed my eyes and saw the crimson drops of heart pain, hers and mine. I said nothing. What could I say? That, in a moment of selfish, hurting need, I had betrayed her? That I felt her pain along with my own? That once I had pledged my love ... there wasn't any left for another? pg. 111<br /><br />There are many moments of beauty and you will really start to love Bill for his thoughts. Be they the thoughts of a man in love or the conflicting thoughts he faces in trying to solve the mystery of his life.

This also teaches a child about the tools you need for cooking and shows step-by-step pictures in some recipes. The ingredients are divided into the recipe parts and the instructions are numbered.<br /><br />The recipe for butter might be worth buying the book because it teaches children how foods are made from scratch. They might never really think about how butter is made until they are older. This teaches them some of the basics. The carrot is used for coloring but I can't imagine why you would put the carrot in the blender with the cream. I just found that rather odd. The recipe for Popcorn and Milk is not exactly delicious. But hey, you can't always have it all. And who knows, maybe someone out there thinks carrot butter is good.<br /><br />The recipes include:<br /><br />Breakfast Sausage Balls<br />Butter & Jam Sandwiches<br />Buttermilk Cornbread<br />Creamy Oatmeal<br />Homemade Butter<br />Laura's Little Maple Cakes<br />Lemonade<br /><br />Ma's Best Butter Cookies<br />Pancakes<br />Popcorn and Milk<br />Strawberry Jam<br /><br />Most of the recipes look fine although I can't say I've tried any of them.

You can choose just to enhance your life with the exercises and stretching and I have found that is enough for me. However, this book does give you some insight into the roots of Yoga and gives you a more complete picture of why exercise is important for your health.<br /><br />Yoga can give you relief from pain and stress. It can enhance your emotional well-being and give you clarity. You seem to observe life slightly differently and have a calm sense of peace.<br /><br />\\"Yoga is an elegant, time-honored system for engendering a sense of vitality, well-being, and peace.

In the second section, she explains the traditional to contemporary forms. Then, she explains the meditation side of yoga which I have not tried. Part four delves into recipes and healing foods.

It is filled with gorgeous scenery and helps to create a sense of peace. Karen Voight has a workout video called: YogaSculpt. I can also recommend her Body Reform series that combines the teachings of Joseph Pilates, yoga and body-sculpting techniques.

Often, he would express a cynical attitude towards life and his love of traveling found its way into his writing. He didn't confine himself to one genre, but also wrote novels, essays and plays.<br /><br />His purpose was to entertain his readers, although you do learn the subtleties of human nature from many of his stories. His keen eye for the minute details of life is combined with his writing style in such away as to capture and keep your attention. It is said that due to becoming an orphan at the age of 10, he was shy and tended to be more of a passive observer rather than an active participant. This explains some of the detachment that you feel in various stories.<br /><br />\\"I have never pretended to be anything but a story teller. It has amused me to tell stories and I have told a great many. It is a misfortune for me that the telling of a story just for the sake of the story is not an activity that is in favor with the intelligentsia. In endeavor to bear my misfortunes with fortitude.\\" (from Creatures of Circumstance, 1947)<br /><br />In this collection you will find stories that are filled with tales of the South Seas, Europe and America. They are concise and persuasive and evoke a time and place where you completely are absorbed into a story that often has a nice unforeseen twist right at the end. Either you are surprised, laughing, sad life took a certain turn, or very amused.<br /><br />My Favorite Stories in this Collection :<br /><br />The Vessel of Wrath:  A tale of love between a missionary and a drunken reprobate that has a most surprising ending. It deals with how humans draw foregone conclusions and how people can change for the better.<br /><br />The Force of Circumstance: Story of almost unavoidable circumstances and deals with the emotions a woman feels when she finds out her husband has had children with a native woman in the village and seems to have neglected to inform her.<br /><br />The Colonel's Lady: A wife publishes her poetry without her husband's knowledge. He can't understand her or why everyone loves her writing. The reader might not understand him, but might understand his wife's need to express her creativity in her own way as obviously, he is not aware of that part of her life.<br /><br />The Round Dozen: Amusing and almost unavoidable ending.<br /><br />These are stories you can read when you have an hour here or there to read a few stories at a time. Some are short enough to be read in 15 minutes or less and are only a few pages long. I enjoyed the slightly longer ones as the character development intensifies and Maugham's powers of observation have time to play out to the full extent.<br /><br />An escape to another time and place.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewer husband has had children with a native woman in the village and seems to have neglected to inform her.

Many students encounter the study of rhetoric in public speaking classes where they are focusing on preparing their own speeches. They learn to make clear presentations, logical arguments and how to perfect their delivery techniques. By studying rhetoric, it is possible to develop individual communication skills.<br /><br />In selecting the speeches for this volume, the editors were guided by a commitment to the Isocratean perspective and have attempted to bring together instances of rhetorical practices which represent the height of rhetorical culture.<br /><br />\\"As an art, public speaking, or rhetoric as the ancients called it, is measured and evaluated generally in terms of the ideal forms through which it produces wisdom; as a political practice, however, it is measured and evaluated in terms of the material power or effect that it wields over the audiences who attend to it.\\"  -LMB/JLL<br /><br />The first set of speeches have important implications for contemporary American society as the genetic foundation of rhetorical culture. This section offers speeches drawn from the Greek, Roman, and Judeo-Christian rhetorical traditions. They include:<br /><br />Oratory in Classical Antiquity: Pericles (Funeral Oration), Gorgias of Leontini (Encomium on Helen), Lysias (Against Eratosthenes), Demosthenes (The Second Philippic), Marcus Tullius Cicero (the First Catilinarian), Moses (The Decalogue), Jesus of Nazareth (Sermon On The Mount) and St. Augustine (Sermon on The Lord's Prayer).<br /><br />In Pericles's Funeral Oration, there is an expression of ideological principles like \\"the good of the many vs. the good of the one,\\" that are as important today as they were in the fourth century B.C.E. These speeches also help students to develop a critical , historical perspective on the thetorical foundations of contemporary society than it has to do with understanding the cultures of classical antiquity.<br /><br />The second set of speeches come from the Golden Age of Oratory and these speeches deal with individual freedom. They include speeches by:<br /><br />Martin Luther (I'll Take My Stand), Peter Wentworth (On the Liberties of Commons), Queen Elizabeth I (To the Troops at Tilbury & The Golden Speech), Jonathan Edwards (Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God), James Otis (Writs of Assistance), William Pitt (The Right of Taxing America), Edmund Burke (Two Speeches to the Electors at Bristol), John Hancock (The Bostom Massacre Oration), Patrick Henry (Liberty or Death), George Washington (First Inaugural Address), Thomas Jefferson (First Inaugural Address), Sagoyewatha (Speech to the Council of Chiefs of the Six Nations), Daniel Webster (Bunker Hill Memorial Oration), Maria W. Steward (Lecture Delivered at the Franklin Hall), Ralph Waldo Emerson (The American Scholar), Wendell Phillips (The Murder of Lovejoy), Angelina Grimke (Address at Pennsylvania Hall), Sojourner Truth (Ain't I A Woman), Frederick Douglass (What, To the Slave, Is The Fourth of July?), Chief Seattle (Our People are Ebbing Away Like a Rapidly Receding Tide), Abraham Lincoln (A House Divided, Gettysburg Address & First and Second Inaugural Address) and Robert Toombs (On Secession).<br /><br />Then there is a third section on Oratory in the Modern Era which includes speeches by:<br /><br />Russell Conwell (Acres of Diamonds), Henry Grady (The New South), Elizabeth Cady Stanton (Solitude of Self), Booker T. Washington (Atlanta Exposition Address), Albert Beveridge (The Star of Empire), Woodrow Wilson (Declaration of War), Emma Goldman (Address To The Jury), Eugene V.

Long (Every Man A King), Adolf Hitler (Germany DemandsIts Rights & The Invasion of Poland), Sir Winston Spencer Churchill (The War Situation & Alliance of English-Speaking People), Margaret Chase Smith (Declaration of Conscience), Richard Milhous Nixon (My Side of The Story), Dwight David Eisenhower (Farewell Address). These speeches chart a transformation in the practice of public speaking and address a number of key public issues confronting Americans during this time period from a variety of perspectives.<br /><br />The last section includes Oratory in Contemporary America by John Fitzgerald Kennedy (Inaugural Address, 1961 & A Moral Crisis, 1963), George Corley Wallace (First Gubernatorial Inaugural Address, 1963), Martin Luther King, Jr. (I Have a Dream), Malcolm X (The Ballot or The Bullet), Lynndon Baines Johnson (Gulf of Tonkin Speech, 1964), Betty Friedan (The Crisis in Women's Identity), Cesar Estrada Chavez (The March 10th Speech), Robert Francis Kennedy (Speeches on the Assassination of the Rev.

This book shows why these parks are so worthy of protection.<br /><br />Not only are they places where indescribable beauty can be seen, they have also been formed by unique geological forces. From stunning mountain ranges to arid expanses of desert, these are the lands we view, wander in and learn from.<br /><br />America's National Parks is a celebration of the diversity of national parks throughout the United States. They are grouped according to the geological forces that helped to create them.<br /><br />Diagrammatic illustrations, important landmarks, travel routes, topographical maps and spectacular full-color photographs illustrate the sheer majestic beauty of nature.<br /><br />You will also find captivating information to encourage an awareness of the landforms, flora and fauna. Families will also find information to help enhance their vacations at the parks.<br /><br />Inside the front cover a map of America shows the location of each park I started to remember my trip to the Grand Canyon National Park and my husband's visit to Denali.<br /><br />Our Treasured Lands<br />The Rolling Land - Volcanic and Geothermal Forces<br />The Broken Crust - The Power of Mountain Building<br />Water Designing Lands - Waves, Caves and Currents<br />Ice Sculpting Stone - The Carving Power of Glaciers<br />The Patient Power - Wind and Water Erosion<br />Weather Shaping Life - Effects of Extreme Climates<br /><br />This book contains some of the most amazing photographs I've ever seen of America. From pictures of dripstone formations adorning New Mexico's Carlsbad Cavern in New Mexico to Lush Ecosystems shrouded in Fog in the National Park in Washington, these pictures help to vividly describe each park. I remember once having an argument with someone over the fact that there were rainforests near where I lived in Washington and no one would believe me. Well, here is proof!<br /><br />I was also especially interested in looking up the Painted Desert we visited once on a trip across America after college. At the time, I didn't actually realize I was in the Petrified Forest national Park in Arizona because technically, we were just driving right through and I wasn't paying attention.<br /><br />This book has helped to bring a new awareness to my own life and also encourages a desire for more exploration.

Life seems bleak and empty, your mind becomes a pool of muddled thoughts. Losing your spouse is even more painful and the grief a person feels when they have to struggle through the grieving process can be overwhelming.<br /><br />When you are trying to pick up the pieces and move on, it helps to know that there is someone out there who understands what you are going through. Marta Felber has dedicated this book to the reader with the hope that it will be of help in the journey through grief.<br /><br />Drawing on her training as a therapist and her experiences in self-healing after the death of her husband, she has written this guide as if she was a friend sitting with you and you were both drinking a cup of tea. She starts by expressing her heartfelt sorrow for the reader's loss and then proceeds to speak from the heart in small easy-to-read chapters. She deals with the deepest feelings in a very gentle way.<br /><br />She talks about how you should accept crying as a natural process, how you can start a journal and how you must still think about eating well and exercising even in this stage of grief. She speaks of how to forgive, accept and let the healing process begin.<br /><br />I think this is a book everyone should read whether they have experienced a loss or not because all of us will come into contact with someone in our lives who is experiencing loss. This will not only help you understand grief, but will allow you to understand what someone is going through. I think this book could also be used for when you have lost a very good friend who is very important to you as some of the same principles apply.<br /><br />I think writing can be theraputic and Marta has also written a companion book called Grief Expressed: When a Mate Dies. The second book consists of 64 written exercises that she completed for herself in the first year after she lost her own husband. She deals with a wide range of emotions and issues, such as loneliness, insecurity, friends, finance, sleeplessness, health and anniversaries.<br /><br />If you have a friend who has experienced a great loss, perhaps you could give this book to them with a flower and a ribbon tied to it and I think it will be a gift they won't forget. Actions do speak louder than words, in most things in life.<br /><br />I felt very calm and nurtured after reading both of Marta's books.<br /><br />Healing.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewraputic and Marta has also written a companion book called Grief Expressed: When a Mate Dies.

There are seven sections that explain the 175 best herbs and how to use them to promote healing and relive minor symptoms.<br /><br />The Contents Include:<br /><br />Introduction - Why you should take charge of your health naturally.<br />Safe & Effective Herbs - Safe herb catalog and herbal medicine explained<br />Safe and Effective Multiherb Formulas - Multiherb forumulas explained<br />Herb-Herb and Herb-Food Interactions - Potentially harmful interactions<br />Dietary Supplement-Herb Interactions - Beneficial dietary interactions, harmful interactions.<br />Drug-Herb Interactions - Drug catalog and understanding interactions.<br />Herbs for Special Cases - Safe herbs for children, potential dangerous herbs for children, unsafe herbs for pregnant and nursing women, safe herbs for older adults, dangerous herbs for older adults.<br />Buyer Beware - Herbal safety, herbs to avoid.<br />Appendix - Reliable manufacturers, suppliers, top-selling herbs, index of safe herbs, conditions index, additional reading, easy-to-use index.<br /><br />Not only does this book give you the best information I've seen on herbal medicines, it also is beautifully illustrated with full-color pictures of the plants being discussed. The layout of the items is especially appealing and you will find this book easy-to-use and very practical.<br /><br />For instance, if you are taking Anacin 3, Asprin-Free Excedrin, Bayer Select, Excedrin PM, Panadol or Tylenol, these contain Acetaminophen which is a pain reliever and fever reducer. While there is no known herbal interactions, you may want to help prevent liver damage from long-term use of acetaminophen by taking Milk thistle. So, preventative care is also discussed in detail.<br /><br />The Index of Safe Herbs by conditions gives you information fast. If you have Insomnia, you can look up the name of the condition and you will find recommendations for Catnip, Chamomile, Dill seed and Valerian. To read about Chamomile in detail, you can easily look up the herb at the front of the book in the safe herb guide.<br /><br />What you will find is a picture of the herb plant, why it is used, how it works, comments and cautions and dosage information. For instance, if you can't sleep, but are using a blood-thinning drug like warfarin, or you are allergic to ragweed, you might want to skip that remedy and research a second option. In the beneficial herb-herb interactions tables, you will see that catnip and passionflower are good combinations to relieve anxiety and insomnia. However, they should not be used with antidepressants or MAOI antidepressant drugs like phenelzine.<br /><br />As with any remedy, it is a good idea to discuss your health issues with your doctor before taking herbal supplements or vitamins. Use this book to catch those items your doctor might not even be aware of. Most physicians don't seem to be aware of the side effects of herbs and don't take a great interest in this area. That has been my experience. Once you know what works for you, I think you will see your doctor less and feel empowered that you can in fact help your body heal with your own knowledge.<br /><br />Echinacea, olive leaf extract and oregano have literally been a miracle for me and my husband. Within about three days of catching a cold, we seem to recover and get on with life. Before, even on antibiotics, it took one to two weeks to get well.<br /><br />I looked up Olive Leaf on page 44 and sure enough it is used to treat infections, including colds and ear infections. It contains oleuropein, thathas been shown to kill bacteria and viruses. It also has been used for antibiotic qualities for more than 6,000 years! Talk about an ancient remedy. Echinacea is also a Native America remedy and then you have oregano which contains substances that are known to be antibiotic and antifungal. I take the capsules as the oil is rather intense and is not recommended for internal use.<br /><br />Herbs may be the miracle you have been looking for.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewre than 6,000 years!

When someone you love has passed on to the next life, you can feel disoriented and alone.<br /><br />At that moment, you will feel that you need someone to talk to, someone who understands. In Marta Felbers first book: \\"Finding Your Way after Your Spouse Dies,\\" she gently leads you through the grieving process. She starts by expressing her heartfelt sorrow for the reader's loss and then proceeds to speak from the heart in small easy-to-read chapters. She deals with the deepest feelings in a very gentle way.<br /><br />In this second book you will find 64 written exercises that she completed for herself in the first year after she lost her own husband. She deals with a wide range of emotions and issues, such as loneliness, insecurity, friends, finance, sleeplessness, health and anniversaries. Marta started writing these feelings when her husband was dying and poured out her thoughts onto the paper of two journals.<br /><br />She starts by explaining how lost she felt that there was nobody else at home. She didn't want to go home and made a list of things that would make her house seem less empty. On the opposite page there is a place for you to write your feelings and a similar list of your own ideas. This format continues throughout the book.<br /><br />Some of her thoughts are so personal, you feel that she is inviting you into her world and sitting down with you over a cup of coffee, just pouring out her soul. I found both her books were very nurturing.<br /><br />I would like to recommend both books as a gift to anyone in your life who has experienced a great loss.  The exercises will help to pull all those feelings that are buried inside so the healing process can begin. The reader will move from a place of grief to a place of renewed self-identity and wholeness.<br /><br />A warm treasure that will help when going through a period of great loss.<br /><br />Encouraging.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewthat are buried inside so the healing process can begin.

Three mermaid like creatures are singing and clinging to the ship as Odysseus is tied to the mast so he can't be lured to his doom. The crew's ears are all filled with beeswax so they can't hear the sires' seductive chant. Odysseus was the first man to ever hear the sirens' song and live. When cheated of their prey, the sirens drowned themselves in anger and frustration.<br /><br />According to legend, the sires had originally been the companions of Persephone before she was abducted by Hades. Because they failed to save her, the goddess changed them into grotesque creatures as punishment. The sirens' song tells, falsely of the pleasures of the underworld. They also claimed the power of prophecy.<br /><br />This story was composed by the Greek poet Homer during the second half of the 8th century BC and preserved by word of mouth for centuries before being written down. According to legend, he was born on the island of Chios around 800 BC and was blind.<br /><br />The Odyssey is about the hero Odysseus who is doomed by the gods to wander for years from his home. This edition presents the story with photography and narrative illustration. It also explores the historical and geographical background to this timeless epic. There are sections on The Trojan War, Gods and Goddesses and Maps of Odysseus' Journey.<br /><br />Adrian Mitchell retells this seafaring adventure filled with storms, monsters, magic spells, curses and exotic lands. It appeals to the wandering adventurous spirit in us all.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2002-06-06

Louisa needed money to help support her parents and sisters. After deciding the girls she knew best were her three sisters, she based the book on her family. Jo March was her own fictional counterpart. Louisa struggled between her strong-willed nature and the docile behavior expected of girls in the 1800s. This was the first book to feature a spirited young heroine with a mind of her own.<br /><br />This edition explores the parallels between Little Women and Louisa's life by using quotes from her journal to reveal her most intimate thoughts.<br /><br />This is the story of four sisters growing up in New England during the Civil War and is one of the best-loved novels of all time. This edition uses photography and narrative illustration to reveal the historical background of this timeless story. Chris Molan has illustrated this story in such a way as to give each character a distinct personality.<br /><br />With their father away at war, Christmas looks bleak. Plus, they would not be giving presents. When they find out there is a poor woman who lives nearby who has nothing to eat, Jo and her sisters give their breakfast to the hungry family.<br /><br />\\"Later, the simple meal of bread and milk the Marches ate at home tasted just as delicious. The sisters were filled with happiness at having helped those poorer than themselves.\\"<br /><br />Later, Mr. Laurence invites Jo to tea and soon a friendship starts to grow between the Marches and the Laurences. The Laurences have a piano and a library lined with books. Laurie/Theodore was born in Italy, but when his parents die, he goes to live with his grandfather Mr. Laurence.<br /><br />Then one day Jo has to cook for the family and says she will make dinner and invite Laurie over.<br /><br />\\"The asparagus boiled for an hour, and the bread burned. The potatoes were undercooked, the dessert was lumpy, and many strawberries were unripe. Language cannot describe the anxieties and exertions that Jo underwent in the kitchen that morning.\\"<br /><br />Jo wasn't as good at cooking as she was at writing. She had a secret and when Laurie finds out that she is trying to sell her stories he is pleased he will get to see her stories in print. Will she ever be a published author and why does she have to cut off her hair and sell it?<br /><br />What I enjoyed about this book was the little details you don't learn just from reading the novel or even watching the movies. A section on Jo's world describes the changing roles in marriage, how Louisa May Alcott was the first woman registered to vote in Concord, Massachusetts and how limited employment was for women.

She presents her recipes in a Menu Format. Since a combination of dishes are normally served, this is quite helpful for anyone who is new to this exotic cuisine.<br /><br />\\"I believe that everything you eat evokes a memory of something. Many of these dishes remind me of Sunday mornings with my mother, when I was learning to cook.\\" pg. 9<br /><br />Monica Bhide has a lifelong passion for cooking. She is a caterer and home chef who specializes in Indian Cuisine and has taken formal cooking courses in her native India. She also loves to collect cookbooks, although she became frustrated with the lack of straightforward Indian cookbooks.<br /><br />These recipes do not require involved cooking techniques. Monica has also included delicious little tidbits of information about a particular ingredient or gives a serving suggestion and cooking tip.<br /><br />What is so great are her \\"Web Bites\\" that lead you to wonderful informational sites on the Internet so you can purchase the Indian ingredients you can't find in the stores. What an angel! Then, she worked with Shilpa Thakur, a senior nutritionist in North Delhi to provide a nutritional analysis for each recipe. That was also very impressive! Normally Indian cuisine is very rich and contains clarified butter, coconut milk, etc. Monica has tried to modify some of the recipes and has tried to avoid deep-frying in many recipes. She has tried to marinate ingredients in herbs and spices to increase the flavor instead of adding more butter or oil.<br /><br />Aromatic Indian Cuisine can be Mild, Medium or HOT. As Monica says: \\"Mild (Translation: what is this doing in a spicy cookbook?)\\" There is also a funny explanation of how to \\"fan\\" potatoes which I found very amusing.<br /><br />So, when making  Shimp in Coconut Milk on pg. 24, you will see one asterisk which means the recipe is mild. Chicken 65 and Yogurt and Red Chile Curry have three asterisks. You could make these recipes mild by simply taking out some of the red chiles, so all the recipes are technically adaptable unless you decide to put in the full amount of chile powder.<br /><br />Introduction - a lovely introduction to her recipes. She explains how her recipes evolved and also gives you tips on how to refashion recipes with out exotic ingredients.<br />Indian cuisine - she explains the philosophy of \\"athithi devo bhava.\\"<br />The spice sack - a cute chapter that describes the typical Indian Pantry. Here you can read about curry leaves, garam masala, paneer, saffron, toor dal and asafetida.<br />Indian cooking techniques - learn the most important secrets in Indian cooking.<br />Basic Recipes - learn to make your own garam masala, ginger garlic paste and besan bundi.<br /><br />The rest of the chapters are all organized in the same way. First a traditional Indian drink, then appetizers, \\"the real food/main course,\\" side dishes, desert and then what to do with the leftovers. It is such a unique approach for an Indian cookbook and it makes complete sense.<br /><br />At the start of each chapter, Monica gives a lovely short introduction to the dishes with a bit of history and a few cooking tips. Within the chapters you will find recipes in a great format. All the ingredients are listed in the order they are used, with recipe divisions clearly indicated by headings for marinades and spice rubs, etc.<br /><br />The ingredients for each part of the recipes are organized together under a heading. The instructions are in a paragraph format, with little stars inbetween the steps so you can easily find the next step. There seems to be a variation on each recipe which will inspire your own creativity.<br /><br />Here are the chapters and some recipes included in each. I won't type out all the recipes, but a few that are especially tempting:<br /><br />Seafood Sunday - Mango Juice, Mussels, Roasted Lentil Wafers, Baked Fish, Shrimp in Coconut Milk, Corn and Rice Pilaf, Onion Salad, Tapioca Clouds, Fish Sandwich (leftover idea), Onion Toast.<br />Let's try Indian - Honey Glazed chicken and Coriander Layered Potatoes.<br />An Indian Super Bowl Party - I'd suggest watching Lagaan with this meal after<br />reading the introduction. Imagine fresh fruit in a Mango Ginger Sauce for desert.<br />Happy Birthday to you - Finally a recipe for Mango Lassi and Trifle.<br />The boss is coming to dinner - Mushroom caps with Spinach Filling, Herb, Rice, and Chicken Bake (Biryani) and Tandoori Paratha (oven-baked Indian bread).<br />Hearty Sunday Brunch - Spinach and Corn Bake, Pumpkin with Whipped Yogurt Sauce and Rice Pudding.<br />A Picnic Basket - Watermelon Juice, Hummus with Pita Slices and Mango Cake for desert.<br />Delhi Fare for Four - Wines to serve with Indian Food, Tamarind Chutney (I have been looking for a recipe for this...forever!), Shallot Chicken with Coconut Curry, Saffron Fruit Custard.<br />An Intimate Dinner for Two - Red Lentil Curry and Sweet Bananas for desert.<br />Turkey Day - Kashmiri Cheese Kebabs, Tandoori Turkey, Cranberry Chutney, Pumpkin Halwa with Crepes.<br />Backyard Grilling - Lemonade, Lamb Kebabs, Chicken Tikka, Corn on the Cob with a Spicy Rub, Watermelon Drizzled with Honey, Kiwi Sorbet and for leftovers you can make a potato soup.

There are over 150 healthful versions of traditional Indian dishes as well as Western dishes with an Indian twist.<br /><br />Shopping Sources - more websites and mail order catalogs. Most of the ingredients should be readily available. Some of the ingredients you will want to order include: mango powder (although she says you can substitute lemon juice), poppy seed paste, mango pulp, sambar powder, etc.<br /><br />Index - Well organized and easy to find your favorite recipes.<br /><br />This is a down-to-earth cookbook with non-intimidating recipes and a fun style.

While other cookbooks had been printed, they were just reprints of European works. All had been written by men for men. At the time, no cookbook dealt so well with the unique food ingredients available in America.<br /><br />So, this was the first cookbook slanted towards female cooks and is the first book to show corn meal as a primary ingredient. Here you will find the first recipes for \\"Indian Slapjacks: or \\"Johnny Cake\\" which became staples during the following centuries.<br /><br />Amelia also presented the first recipe for pumpkin pie, Indian pudding, rice pudding and gingerbread. Here you can find the words \\"cookie\\" and \\"slaw\\" which come from the Dutch in America. Many of the recipes show you how to cook classic recipes for dumplins, biscuits and fruit pies.<br /><br />The most recent printing of this cookbook seems to be by Tresco Publishers and it was reprinted in 2001. This Ohio publisher obtained special permission to reprint a limited facsimile copy (all forty-seven octavo pages) of this American Classic.<br /><br /> The book I found has a facsimile copy of American Cookery from 1796 that is definately showing it was used often, complete with grease stains. Then, there is a translation into a modern printing font that is much easier to read. In the facsimile copy with Early American print fonts in which the letter \\"s\\" appeared as \\"f\\"... this makes the original harder to read. For example:<br /><br />\\"By having an opinion and determination, I would not be underftood to mean an obftinate perfeverance in trifles, which borders on obftinacy - by no means, but only an adherence to thofe rules and mazims which have ftood the teft of ages, and will forever eftablifh the female character, a virtuous character -altho' they conform to the ruling tafte of the age in cookery, drefs, language, manners, &c.\\"  ~Preface<br /><br />The dated language is amusing to read and you can glimpse a picture of America through Amelias eyes. The \\"spellings\\" of many words were of course different so they are not typographical errors. There is a glossary that explains terms like bullace (small plum), gallipot (earthen pot) and pannikin (small metal vessel).<br /><br />This book therefore \\"contains\\" the first cookbook published in America by an American author and the translation of the work into modern English. It is a first in cookbook literature and therefore is an historic document you will want to collect if you are a cookbook collector.<br /><br />Only two First Edition copies are known to exist. One is in the Bitting Collection of the Library of Congress, the other in the Whitney Collection of the New York Public Library. The book I have contains the dog-eared and stained copy from the Bitting Collection and includes a forward by Mary Tolford Wilson.<br /><br />By reading her cookbook, you can imagine a young colonial woman cooking over a hot cook fire, taking care of her children and using this cookbook to prepare her evening meal. It almost evokes a sense of nostalgia for when things were simpler, or were they?<br /><br />Diet Bread<br /><br />One pound sugar, 9 eggs, beat for an hour. Add to 14 ounces flour, spoonful rose water, one spoonful cinnamon or coriander. Bake quick.<br /><br />An hour? Who would have the time these days. It is amazing! And I thought kneading bread was work.<br /><br />You will also find recipes for:<br /><br />Minced Pie<br />Bread Pudding<br />Puff Pastry<br />Roast Mutton<br />Indian Pudding<br />Meats<br />Poultry<br />Fish<br /><br />My heart did beat a little faster just because it is so overwhelming how far cookbooks has come since this first American cookbook written by a woman and I was delighted to finally own a copy. This is not really a cookbook you would use as the recipes are not exactly easy to follow and don't always contain exact quantities of ingredients. It is more to amuse!<br /><br />This cookbook will produce in you a similar excitement that you might feel if you had happened upon this book in a musty library or in an attic. But then again, I read cookbooks in bed! ;)<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewbed! ;)    ~The Rebecca Review	2002-06-04

Yesterday I made homemade bread and I can promise you there is nothing quite like baking your own bread even if you employ the help of your loyal bread machine. Although, one imagines there is nothing quite like freshly baked Pain de Seigle. If you have ever watched A Year in Provence, you can't help dreaming about baking your own baguette's in Provence.<br /><br />Bread really is a universal food. This \\"photographic gallery\\" reveals the variety of breads. There are as seemingly large as life pictures of the breads. Everything from the continental classics such as Tuscan Focaccia scented with rosemary to sweet enriched reads studded with spices and fruit. You will also find flat breads from the Middle East and rustic country loaves from France. Sigh<br /><br />This is an exciting resource written by authors who are experts in bread baking. Eric Treuill was born in Cahors in southwest France and first became interested in breadmaking when he worked as a mitron in his uncle's boulangerie. Ursula Ferrigno grew up on her father's vegetable and olive-producing farm in southern Italy.<br /><br />\\"Ursula remembers the hot summer evenings when her grandmother would light the wood-fired oven on the terrace of their family home in Campania. She recalls the sweet, yeasty fragrance of the seemingly magically growing dough and its soft, springy texture as she formed it into a round, for it was a family tradition that each person shape and top his or her own pizza.\\"<br /><br />After  a brief introduction to the Fundamentals of Breadmaking a world of possibilities is revealed in the next few chapters. A Gallery of breads shows wonderful pictures of French, Italian, British, European, American, Eastern and Festive Breads.<br /><br />Baking Essentials - In this short chapter you explore: Wheat Flours, Nonwheat Flours, Ingredients and Equipment (lots of pictures!)

By applying some of the very simple techniques, you will see amazing results. This book will not only help you in your marriage or dating relationship, it will also help you to become a better friend in general.<br /><br />\\"Ideally, our relationship is one part of life that feels like a sanctuary - a partnership that is mutually nourishing and enriching both spiritually and emotionally.\\" ~pg. 106<br /><br />I noticed that when I changed, people around me started to change. It was as if this book contains those secrets we have all been looking for to improve all our relationships. There is a simple reason. This is written from the heart and deals with those real life issues we all care about. We all have that basic need to be unconditionally loved. Just to be loved and appreciated for who we are.<br /><br />However, we have all developed habits that break down our connection with those important people in our lives. It is those little annoying habits that limit communication, take us down paths we don't want to follow that seem to cause the most problems. We repeat these habits over and over again, each time destroying a part of a relationship we care about.<br /><br />At times we feel as if we are going to have to end a marriage or a friendship because the problems seem insurmountable. That is exactly the time we have to start to look at what \\"we\\" are doing to hurt or help our relationships. Those rare and beautiful friendships with people we really care about are so unique, I can't think of any reason not to put away our pride and start to mend the hurt we may have caused. Sometimes it means we have to say we are sorry or maybe we have to be willing to forgive the hurt others have caused us. The feeling of letting it all go is immensely rewarding and freeing.<br /><br />You will be amazed by the depth in this tiny book. In a few hours, you will gain an immense amount of wisdom. Putting the 100 tiny meditations into practice might take a while. We all resist change.<br /><br />What my husband and I decided to do, was to read the book with a highlighter in hand. First I read the book and marked the ideas I felt were important to me. Now he will read it and mark the sections he feels are important. Then we are going to work on various aspects of our relationship together.<br /><br />\\"I've yet to see an instance where becoming more loving wasn't an idea worth considering.\\" ~pg. 16<br /><br />One of the most important ideas is to commit to being a \\"kind\\" person. Some of the other ideas I thought were quite helpful included:<br /><br />Thinking of what your partner is doing, instead of what he is not doing.<br />Avoiding the temptation to connect loving praise with things that are bothering you.<br />Be willing to say \\"I'm Sorry\\" and Be willing to Forgive.<br />Realize that being listened to is a profound human need.<br />Don't be too serious. Learn to laugh at yourself.<br />Eliminate defensiveness in your personality.<br />Don't make people feel like they are constantly disappointing you.<br /><br />If you are experiencing any frustration in your present relationship, this book will give you fast, easy solutions to changing your own outlook. By applying the principles, you will be amazed at how empowered you will feel when you take charge of your own destiny.<br /><br />What a beautiful gift to humanity.

1570975:US	50199793	R1LG0HJ9ZUL9D3	083081891X	483879559	Written on the Heart: The Case for Natural Law	Books	5	125	133	N	Y	Ancient Truth	\\"Quarry the granite rock with razors, or moor the vessel with a thread of silk, then may you hope with such keen and delicate instruments as human knowledge and human reason to contend against those giants, the passion and the pride of man.\\" -John Henry Newman<br /><br />Everyday we make decisions about the paths we will take in life. At times we find ourselves conflicted beyond the normal level of simple decisions making. What we often desire is obviously in direct conflict with our inner knowledge of right and wrong and no matter how we try to rationalize our decisions, taking the wrong path brings us immense internal conflict and emotional pain.<br /><br />We lose our sense of peace and become filled with chaotic desires.  Frustrated with our decisions we try to find self-satisfying justifications for our unethical behavior. Breaking a general precept of the natural law carries the penalty of guilt. As human beings, we find this to be a constant struggle between what we want and need, what we should do and should not do.<br /><br />When our conscience accuses us of these facts, we either change the path we are on or smother the knowledge written on our hearts and keep right on walking, rationalizing to ourselves that the pleasure we will gain from this path is greater than the pain of the thorns of conscience we keep stepping on repeatedly.<br /><br />\\"The good of a human soul lies in the activity of using and following reason, and its highest good lies in the activity of using it and following it excellently.\\"<br /><br />Sometimes the only way off a path we have chosen is a decision to just do the right thing. The conflict that leads up to that decision can at times make us set up road blocks on paths we don't ever want to take again. Even J. Budziszewski lived through this process and if he could hear God's voice through the cacophony of voices in the modern world calling us in so many directions, anyone can find their way back to the inner knowledge of ancient truths.<br /><br />J. Budziszewski became a Christian at the early age of ten. He the fell away from his faith after becoming caught up in radical politics. He tried to find ways to believe that God didn't exist. While earning his Ph.D. at Yale, he was convinced he had found plenty of reasons for atheism and moral relativism.<br /><br />He came to believe that humans were not responsible for what they did and yet he came to feel a greater and greater horror about himself and an overpowering sense that his condition was terribly wrong. Finally his self-deception collapsed. He is now a defender of the natural-law tradition.<br /><br />He believes there are universal moral principles that are knowable to everyone and if they are followed, they bring good into the world instead of evil. This belief has roots all the way back to the rabbinical tradition of the Noachian commandments forbidding sexual immorality, idolatry, blasphemy, bloodshed and theft.<br /><br />In this \\"textbook-like\\" discussion, he presents an intellectual evolution of thoughts from the beginning of time to the present. It shows how the Human consciousness perceives God's moral law and how we can inherently understand divine truth. The challenge is to listen to what we know to be true. To seek truth in all its beautiful forms and develop a discipline of mind strong enough to resist the temptation not to listen to what we know to be true in order to avoid evil. While we might know what is good or evil, character is not inborn and is acquired. The author shows how our human souls are designed for two things. To understand and to love. When there is a defect in one, there is a defect in the other. He describes \\"love\\" as a \\"constant will to the true good of another person.\\"<br /><br />Chapter Four was especially interesting as he expounds on the beliefs of Thomas Aquinas, a thirteenth-century Dominican Monk who is regarded as the greatest of all medieval philosophers.  The beliefs of Aristotle, John Locke, C.S. Lewis and John Stuart Mill make this a fascinating read.<br /><br />There are discussions about \\"Why Government is Necessary?\\" and why we are born with human rights. Why a government that denies natural law is so terrible and why a state of liberty is not a state of license. He also gives the seven criteria for when a country can go to war and explains that for the first time in American history, political leaders committed themselves to following the principles of a just war during the War in the Gulf. The discussion on private property is enlightening and leads into more discussion about Tyrannical rulers and revolution, which is discussed earlier in a chapter on Human Law & Regime Design.<br /><br />You will find some horrifying ideas that are balanced with sanity, so beautiful you cannot help but desire within your very being to choose truth. This book will awaken within you all that you know to be true.<br /><br />The deepest part of you will recognize truth when you see it. Making the right decisions<br />once you awaken to the truth is the real challenge. After reading one of his books you will find yourself hungering to read everything he has written.<br /><br />While most modern secular thinkers reject the natural law and are constantly having discussions on such fundamental issues as morals, there does seem to be a desire to go back to the idea that there is a moral standard known by all. The Moral Sense by James Q. Wilson is a book the author also recommends. If you are new to the works of J. Budziszewski, I would recommend \\"The Revenge of Conscience\\" as the first book you read as it deals with moral neutrality, liberalism and conservatism.<br /><br />Everyday we are faced with paths that will lead us to a more enlightened human existence or a path that will cast a shadow over the laws written on our heart. This book will show the way to more enlightened thought and shows why our civilization is in an advanced state of decay.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Revieware discussions about \\"Why Government is Necessary?\\" and why we are born with human rights.

It is at those moments when a book like Siddhartha can be meaningful without being invasive. The journey of a Brahmin's son and his childhood friend asks more questions than it answers.<br /><br />What is the meaning to our existence and how do we find true joy? Siddhartha is outwardly content, yet in his heart there is no joy. This is not a matter of simply struggling over a current confusion, this is an internal struggle which seeks to destroy his very being, eating at his very life energy, consuming his waking hours. He is a seeker, insatiable, desiring his own sense of Nirvana.<br /><br />At first he seeks to become a Samana and deny himself all worldly possessions and pleasures. \\"Siddhartha had one single goal-to become empty, to become empty of thirst, desire, dreams, pleasure and sorrow-to let the Self die.\\"<br /><br />After living a life in which he denies himself all pleasure, he longs for a life filled with pleasure and is satiated to the point of feeling sickened by lust and greed. Finally he finds his way to a river. The most beautiful section of this book is when Siddhartha listens to what the river is telling him.<br /><br />\\"Have you learned from that secret from the river, that there is no such thing as time?\\"<br /><br />\\"Yes...That the river is everywhere at the same time, at the source and at the mouth, at the waterfall, at the ferry, at the current, in the ocean and in the mountains, everywhere, and that the present only exists for it, not the shadow of the past, nor the shadow of the future.\\"<br /><br />Siddhartha almost gives his life to the water in his despair. However, the river becomes a source of inner reflection for him when he realizes his awakening is his path to wisdom. Even as I finished the story I wondered if Siddhartha had found the inner peace, or if he had just made a pact with his soul not to contemplate the mystery of the universe any further.<br /><br />Even in the most difficult situations when God feels far away, He might just be letting us awaken to our own inner world. Waiting, loving us, waiting. Perhaps waiting for us to make the right decisions in life, to find our destiny.

This story grew inside her and was finally born in an ancient farmhouse where she typed in the depth of winter. Sharon pours the warmth of her very soul into the pages. This story will bathe you in balmy thoughts and entice you into its pages the way the ocean entices you to swim in its depths. She remembers what it feels like to be a child in the comforting safety of a mother's love or how it feels to embrace a moment in time, so thoughtfully, it always clings to your memory.<br /><br />Her intense power of observation enables her to set up situations, which bring out the characters deepest fears, sublime longings and internal tortures. She creates tension at the end of each chapter, propelling you forward to read the next exciting detail. Each chapter in the first section focuses on one of the three main characters.<br /><br />This rotation of chapters invites you to follow the lives of Nat, Saroj and Savitri who in the first section are like streams of water moving towards a river. The second and third sections are more like a waterfall in which moments of enlightenment flow through you suddenly, as you realize how these three characters' lives intertwine. Each life is richly textured with cultural details as they move from the innocence of childhood into an adult awareness. The character development is outstanding. As the story grows and changes, hope grows within you that the characters will find the happiness they deserve.<br /><br />The Blue Morpho butterfly on the cover seems to represent Saroj, who must struggle through countless battles of thought to finally shed the insulation of her old life so she can embrace her destiny. She at first spins protective silk thoughts around herself, trapping herself so she can grow her wings. She is living in British Guiana, South America, in the 60s. I love her free spirit when she emerges from her cocoon, her imagination, her beloved places.<br /><br />\\"...she also went there to escape to the seashore, to get a glimpse of the ocean, to run for miles along the Sea Wall, to wade, barefoot and curly-toed, into the foaming sheet of warm brown water when the tide rolled gently in and licked the beach. The ocean was freedom. Standing at its edge and gazing far out into the horizon, eastwards, she felt a deep, yearning ache that rose out of some unknown kernel within her, that reached out, far far out, to that distant horizon, to the unseen shores that lay beyond, and further, to the endlessness of the sky, to the endlessness of time.<br /><br />...the tower room was all windows, without shade. Open the glass panes and the wind sailed through, a cleansing, vigorous wind that swept away care and uprooted disquiet. Up here you felt tall, free, strong. Up here, nothing could touch you. It was a refuge from the heat of the day, a sanctuary from the pain of living. An escape....\\" pg. 47, 48<br /><br />Saroj tries to control her life and hurriedly rushes down paths as they are presented to her. She fights and wriggles free from her controlling father (an orthodox Hindu lawyer) only to see his true intentions years later. She finds a childhood friend named Trixie who seems to understand her rebellion. Trixie rescues her from the tapestry of a deeply rooted tradition.<br /><br />The men in this story seem more willing to follow tradition, to accept their fate. Nat is adopted by a doctor working in rural India (Madras State, 1947) and not only has the ability to heal, he later has the ability to water thirsty souls and women are drawn to him. He longs to find a woman who will invite him into her secret life. He realizes women are seeking spiritual unity and that true strength is gentle. Women long for a connection of the soul. He also wants to uncover the mystery of his own life.<br /><br />Savitri understands silence. She lives from the inside and knows that the man she loves is the other part of her soul. Forbidden fruit is irresistible to her, yet she also has the ability to love unconditionally. She is a servant (cook's daughter) of the Lindsays, an English family living in India. She falls in love with the master's son. Her story starts in Madras, India, in 1921. She and David observe one another from a distance, living separate lives, wanting to find some connection that threatens to dissolve them both into a sea of troubles. While the storms of their lives threaten to tear them apart forever, somehow they manage to find a few moments of absolute bliss.<br /><br />While Nat and Savitri's stories are essential to the plot, Saroj is definitely the main character who evolves through a process of choices and situations thrust upon her by life. Her exuberance for life is woven into thoughtful prose. You enter her world, one which she is trying to abandon. Her very soul desperately cries out not to be tied down to duty. She wants to make her own choices, especially when it comes to choosing a husband, her lover for life.<br /><br />Standing at the window of her mind, you will observe the most intimate of thoughts. She will capture your heart. Instead of embracing various moment at times, she dreads her fate, the impending doom. She is dramatic and horrified at the thought of being forced into marriage at a marriageable age. She knows that in life, there is one man who is worthy of her intelligence and beauty. Locked in the prison of her father's discontent, the depths of her passion give her mind buoyancy. She at times flies away on her thoughts.<br /><br />An impressive masterpiece of delicious thoughts. The prose will drip like mango juice into your thirsty soul. It will touch your life in a way no other story ever has.<br /><br />Exquisitely Meditative. A vivid exotic mystery to unravel in<br />the labyrinths and gardens of your mind.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewhe loves is the other part of her soul.

For some adventurers, the hunger for excitement for life itself is what spurs them on to new territories and challenges.<br /><br />\\"In 1963, scientists dug up 1,000-year-old Viking objects in Newfoundland, Canada.This suggests that Vikings-perhaps even \\"Lucky\\" Leif Eriksson-really did visit America five centuries before Christopher Columbus.\\" -pg. 7<br /><br />Adventurers include: Hannibal, Leif Eriksson, Marco Polo, Ibn Battuta, Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Hernan Cortes, Benvenuto Cellini, Miguel de Cerbantes, Moll Cutpurse, Claude Duval, Alexander Selkirk, Blackbeard, James Cook, Alexander von Humboldt, Lewis and Clark, Davy Crockett, Rene Caillie, Lakshmi Bai, Burke and Wills, Ned Kelly, Mary Kingsley, Amundsen and Scott, Manfred von Richthofen, Charles Lindbergh, Amelia Earhart, Thor Heyerdahl, Hillary and Tenzing, Yuri Gagarin and Armstrong and Aldrin.<br /><br />Some of the most interesting stories:<br /><br />Voyage around the Cape - where it is said Vasco da Gama threw the charts and navigational instruments into the sea and declared he did not need a navigator because God alone was the master and pilot. Days later, they rounded the Cape and turned northward, up Africa's east coast. Having stood at the top of Table Mountain and almost drowned in the ocean in Cape Town, I can say his adventure must have been truly harrowing. The ocean there is wild! After that vacation, we decided to head to safer waters.<br /><br />The Real Robinson Crusoe - \\"I am cast upon a horrible desolate island, void of all hope of recovery.\\" -Robinson Crusoe  He scanned the horizon for ships until he finally saw the mastheads of two British sailing ships. To his horror, the ship disappeared into the darkness, but he was finally rescued days later.<br /><br />An African Adventure - Where Mary feels sorry for a leopard and tries to release it. Once the leopard was freed it moved close to her and for a moment she was terrified. After commanding the leopard to go home, it obediently turned and slunk away. A hunter hiding in a tree thought she must be a goddess to command obedience from such a dangerous animal.<br /><br />The illustrations bring the adventures to life. Each story is filled with gripping accounts of danger, dramatic full-color illustrations and color photographs of people, places and objects that put the stories in historical context.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewa horrible desolate island, void of all hope of recovery.\\" -Robinson Crusoe   He scanned the horizon for ships until he finally saw the mastheads of two British sailing ships.

As a child, it did seem I would also remember everything except my pajamas. That is what happens to a giggly little girl who goes to her Grandpa's house for a sleepover.<br /><br />\\"First some Apples we can share with Bunny and my fuzzy Bear. They cry whenever I'm not home. I couldn't leave them all alone.\\"<br /><br />The A in Apples and B in Bunny are colorful letters. In fact, this book is an alphabet type story. There is also a cute cat that makes an appearance. Doing naughty things like walking away with puzzle pieces.<br /><br />Of course when it is time for bed, she starts to be a silly head and wants to hide under the bed or do headstands. By the time she starts looking for her pj's it is late and she is yawning. The last page ends with the little girl putting on her Grandpa's big pj's. Such a cute little book.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2002-03-23

Apparently what we had found was called a common puffball. Another interesting experiences with mushrooms was when I found them growing in carpet in the damp basement of a house in Seattle, WA. It was amazing, there in the carpet, these silly mushrooms had decided to grow in the dark basement without any sunlight. One wonders if they were aspiring to be a truffle from France.<br /><br />My most recent discovery was an amazing \\"Fly Amanita\\" (see picture on left in the middle of the book cover) a few years ago in October, which was so perfect and fresh, I ran back to my house to get my camera. They are the classic fairy-tale toadstool with an orange cap and smooth faintly grooved margin and white veil scales on the surface. Apparently it is poisonous if eaten in large quantities. Amanita muscaria is actually one of the best known of all fungus species. I sent a picture to Martha Stewart to ask her what type of toadstool it was. That was before I had this lovely book. Well, she sent me back the pictures and thanked me for the letter, but never told me what the species was. I reviewed her new cookbook anyway.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that these mushrooms have a close beneficial relationship with a host spruce tree. Below ground, there is a mycorrhizal partnership where the fungus grows a mantle around the tiniest tree roots and a net of hyphae in between the outer root cells. Nutrients are exchanged between the partners via complex chemical pathways.<br /><br />Most of the mushrooms and toadstools you will find are in wooded areas in the fall. Identification can be difficult. This book can be an aid to identifying various species. However it is strongly recommended that beginners take along an experienced forager if they are gathering mushrooms for eating. There are some edible species that look very similar to poisonous ones and the effects of eating a poisonous mushroom can lead to fatal liver damage or death. I would not be able to tell the difference between Agaricus Xanthoderma and Agaricus Arvensis. They are just too similar.<br /><br />The fungi features in this book are placed in one of 16 main sections, based on their most obvious visual characteristics. You will find the scientific family name and season in which the mushroom will appear at the top of each page. You can learn about the habitat and geographical distribution, similarities to other species and see cross-sections for useful details such as flesh color.<br /><br />From the delicate and almost flower like Umbrella Inky Cap to the spectacular Cinnabar Chanterelle, every mushroom you could imagine is listed here.<br /><br />While I'm not a member of a amateur mushroom hunting club, I have thought it would be rather fun. After all, I've already found the most beautiful Fly Amanita and after taking that picture, thought it would be amusing to go looking for more mushrooms to photograph. It is almost more fun to go take pictures, have them developed and then try to identify your recent find.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewtal liver damage or death.

Finally they haul the cheese in a wagon to ripen in Elder John's barn. To get the cheese to President Jefferson's New Year's Day party, they have to put it on a sleigh and take it to Hudson, New York. Finally it sails down the Hudson River and is then carted on a sleigh to Washington.<br /><br />Apparently, the cheese was served for years and someone said it lasted until 1805.<br /><br />Just by the way, cheddar curds can't be beat. Give me the curds<br />instead of the pressed cheese any day!<br /><br />Cute story for young cheese lovers.<br /><br />If you love cheese, look for Paula Lambert's Cheese Lover's Cookbook & Guide. She explains how cheese is made and even includes recipes.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2002-03-23

Salmon Starfish on a bed of green bean \\"seaweed\\" sounds a bit exotic for children, however one wonders if a child will grow up to be a master chef if fed a healthy diet of gourmet food as a child. ;)<br /><br />While this is written to amuse children and parents alike, I could not help thinking some of the ideas were too good just for kids. The cucumber flowers on the Cucumber and Cheese open sandwiches looked quite lovely for a summer tea as did the salad and cheese cut-out butterfly sandwiches.<br /><br />As a cook who once used to make alligators out of pickles to serve with sandwiches to amuse my clients (don't ask), I can say, this book has some cute ideas. The chocolate profiteroles & puff pastry mice looked good to me! You have to see the \\"sleeping cannelloni\\" where they have a blanket of cheese, mushroom faces and black olive boots.<br /><br />The first thing you will notice is that this book is filled with really healthy food! Sure, there are cookies and pastries, but for the most part the food is made from fresh ingredients like vegetables and chicken breast, etc.<br /><br />Annabel Karmel is a leading expert on cooking for children and also happens to be a Cordon Bleu chef. It shows! Her three children are her inspiration. They don't care if the food is healthy, they just want it to taste good. Annabel has combined \\"child appeal\\" with sound nutritional principles. Parents can give their children the best nutritional start to life and encourage their children not to be fussy eaters.<br /><br />After a brief introduction, you will want to take a look at the kitchen equipment you will want to have on hand. An electric food processor, hand blender, metal-mesh strainer and moulis will be pretty common in many kitchen, however, you might want to invest in these items when purchasing this book if you are cooking for very young children. When preparing baby food, you will need to blend purees and a food processor will come in very handy. Of course, you can use a mouli to make the puree as my mom was known to do in Africa, where I don't remember bottles of baby food being very common.<br /><br />There is also a section on Food Allergies & Intolerance.<br /><br />The book is divided up into:<br /><br />4-6 Months: A guide to successful weaning, with advice on introducing solids, and featuring a photographic gallery of first purees and 14 simple recipes.<br /><br />6-9 Months: Expert information on introducing new tastes and textures, followed by a gallery of more advanced purees and 27 recipes.<br /><br />9-12 Months: A discussion of developing dexterity and encouraging self-feeing, with a gallery of suitable new foods, including finger foods, and 17 recipes.<br /><br />12-18 Months - Explaining toddlers' changing dietary needs and the importance of integrating into family meals. A gallery of appealing foods is followed by 25 recipes.<br /><br />18 Months - 2 Years: Creative and sensible strategies for dealing with fussy eaters. The gallery shows quick-to-prepare foods for active toddlers selected from the 28 recipes.<br /><br />2-3 Years: Constructive tips on planning easy meals for younger children with a busy day, with a gallery showing perfect party foods and 25 creative recipes.<br /><br />3-5 Years: Suggestions for ways to encourage your child to follow a varied diet.

It was something akin to nostalgia. After reading this book, I have the strongest desire to get on a plane and go visit my aunt who still lives there.

Some of the best things in life appear when you are not even looking. Finding this book was one of those beautiful things that happens on a sunny afternoon  in your favorite bookstore when you are not really looking, just browsing around drinking a hot chai tea.<br /><br />\\"He who forgives ends the quarrel.\\" -African Proverb<br /><br />I was instantly intrigued with this beautiful book. The format is also very appealing and easy to read, with two columns of quotes on each page. The quotes are organized according to interesting and relevant topics. The detailed biographical Index not only gives the authors name and information, you can also find all the page numbers and topics for their quotes under their name.<br /><br />\\"Like a child in its cradle<br />I would that very gentle arms<br />Might rock my grieving spirit<br />And be as it were a kindly shelter<br />For my heart-a traveler lost<br />On a remote deserted road.\\"<br /><br />Nguyen Vy<br /><br />The best way to enjoy this book is to have a pen in hand and to mark each quote you enjoyed, because like a good cup of tea, you are going to want to enjoy reading these quotes again.

Instead of living to eat, we should actually be eating well to live well. The foods are shown in full-color pictures and each has it's own page. The key nutritional values, therapeutic properties, how much to eat, choosing and storing, cooking & eating and recipe page information is provided for each food.<br /><br />The strength of this book is in the health information that demystifies the scientific evidence as to what will promote health. Yes, there are some recipes and I tried the \\"Polish Carrot Cake.\\" The taste was more \\"healthy,\\" and tasted more like a Cliff Bar in many ways. If you like health bars, this could be a less expensive way to go!<br /><br />The ingredients included honey, yogurt and whole-wheat flour instead of sugar and all-purpose flour. The result is that you feel full eating only a small piece for breakfast. The cake also freezes well. I would say it tastes more like a carrot bread. You could take slices of this cake on a hike! I've been eating this for breakfast each day and already noticed that I don't feel as hungry before lunch.<br /><br />If you are looking to avoid fats and sugars, this book will show you the way to a healthier lifestyle.<br /><br />The Contents Include:<br /><br />The Balance of Health: Interesting discussions on Food as Medicine, The Basics of a Healthy Diet, What's in Food, Digestion and Absorption and Special Dietary Needs.<br /><br />Food Profiles: Twenty foods that have outstanding health benefits and details of their therapeutic properties.<br /><br />Good Foods: Thirty delicious foods with health-enhancing powers.<br /><br />Improving Your Health: Foods that help to relieve particular problems: respiratory system, eyes & mouth, digestive system, bones & joints, circulation & heart health, women's health, skin, the body's defenses, diabetic health, kidneys & urinary system and emotional health.<br /><br />The recipes are a collection featuring the 20 bonus and 30 good foods for better health. After a discussion on kitchen essentials for a healthy kitchen, you will find recipes for soups, appetizers, salads, main courses, side dishes, desserts, quick breads & cakes and salsas & dressings.<br /><br />Foods that are not featured in the Food Profiles section are mentioned in the \\"Directory of Other Valuable Foods\\" section. A chart with Vitamins & Minerals that are essential to life also shows the importance, effects of a shortage and the major source. The index is wonderful for finding information on foods you already love or ones you are considering adding to your diet.<br /><br />Recipes that looked tempting: Hot & Sour Soup, Asparagus with Parmesan and Nutmeg, Artichoke Heart Salad, Greek Fish Stew, Broccoli Stir-Fry, Dhal, Baked Ginger Bananas, Oat Bran Muffins and Pineapple Salsa.<br /><br />A guide to Optimum Nutrition.<br /><br />\\"The quest is not so much for extra years in our life, but for extra life in our years.\\" -Miriam Polunin<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review.

Herbs are the leaves of fresh or dried plants. Spices are the aromatic parts: buds, fruit, berries, roots or bark. Most spices thrive in tropical regions, while herbs can be grown in your own garden or indoors in a sunny place. Some herbs can also produce spices.<br /><br />If you think of the Coriander/Cilantro plant, cilantro is the herb and the seeds are known as coriander. This is why this book is so helpful as it explains the plants in detail. I didn't realize the root was also used in Thai curries. A recipe for Guacamole is included on the same two-page spread.<br /><br />Elizabeth Lambert Ortiz is an authority on herbs and spices and international cuisine. She created this sourcebook in order to guide the reader to information on more than 200 herbs, spices, essences, edible flowers and leaves, aromatics, vinegars, oils, teas, coffees and just about every seasoning a modern cook needs to produce flavorful foods.<br /><br />With 750 spectacular full-color photographs and 185 recipes you will learn how to create characteristic flavors that define cuisines of the world.<br /><br />The Contents Include:<br /><br />Growing and Harvesting Herbs<br />Drying and Preserving herbs<br />Edible Gifts<br /><br />Kitchen Herbs: Chives, Dill, Angelica, Chervil, Tarragon, Borage, Tansy, Coriander/Cilantro, Lemongrass, Fennel, Hyssop, Bay, Lovage, Lemon Balm, Mint, Bee Balm, Sweet Cicely, Basil, Marjoram, Oregano, Parsley, Burnet, Rosemary, Sorrel, Sage, Savory, Thyme and Lemon Verbena.<br /><br />Kitchen Spices: Galangal, Celery Seed, Annatto, Sassafras, Mustard, Chili, Paprika, Ajowan, Caraway, Spice Mixtures, Cassia, Cinnamon, Saffron, Cumin, Turmeric, Curry Powerders, Cardamom, cloves, Asafoetida, Star Anise, Juniper, Mace & Nutmeg, Nigella, Poppy Seeds, Allspice, Anise, Pepper, Sumac, Sesame Seeds,.

With that said:<br /><br />I made the Mango Cranberry Nut Crumble and loved it. I had to adapt the recipe because I could not find the same size can of mango slices the recipe called for. I also used light brown sugar instead of superfine sugar and it worked out very well.<br /><br />If you are completely new to cooking, you will enjoy how easy these recipes are to make. You may however become frustrated when they don't taste exactly the way you think they will after viewing the pictures. A little salt and pepper and a dash of this or that is going to make each recipe your own.<br /><br />You also may have to substitute an item because I noticed that just saying: \\"ground mixed spice\\" did not give me a clue as to which ground spice and I ended up using apple pie spice. They assume you can easily find pre-made custard, so no recipe was given for the custard to serve with the crumble. Most stores do have the Bird's custard powder now or you can order a lovely container of the most delicious custard from Protea Imports online. They specialize in English treats.<br /><br />Another strange thing I noticed was that there is a comment at the start of the book that says: \\"All eggs used in the recipes are medium size. All vegetables should be peeled unless the recipe says otherwise.\\" This could be easily missed by most cooks who are not likely to even read that page.<br /><br />The Contents include: Time Saving Ideas, Getting Stocked Up, Kitchen Equipment,<br />Soups, Snacks and Salads, Vegetarian Fare, Fish, Poultry, Meat and Desserts.<br /><br />The format is especially appealing and the photography superb! The result is a highly appealing book from an aesthetic perspective. All of the recipes are really easy to make and take very little effort.<br /><br />Some of the recipes that looked tempting included: Tingling Thai-Spiced Vegetables, Wicked Wild Fish Gumbo, Clever Cook's Roast Chicken Dinner and Lemon Caramel Strawberry Nests.<br /><br />Everything looks delish!<br /><br />~The Rebecca ReviewWild Fish Gumbo, Clever Cook's Roast Chicken Dinner and Lemon Caramel Strawberry Nests.<br /><br />Everything looks delish!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2002-01-26

Sigh...<br /><br />Voyages gives the reader a journey of sheer visual pleasure to 100 of the world's most exciting ports of call. These have been selected by the world's leading travel writers.<br /><br />Each destination is reviewed and rated according to: adventure, entertainment, romance, cuisine and shopping (very important aspect). Jay Clark fills in the details and has been traveling since the age of five. His articles have appeared in every major newspaper in America. The writing is flawless and captures each moment.<br /><br />\\"Every Time I Sail into port on a cruise ship, a surge of anticipation builds inside me.

I was fascinated by pictures of Elizabeth David's kitchen which is not at all what I expected.<br /><br />First you get to assess your needs. What is it you really want from your kitchen? There is an amazing kitchen layout on pg. 10 where the dining area, cooking zone and a fireplace all blend together to create a warm cozy setting. Who does not imagine a fire burning as you are kneading bread or icing cookies in the winter.<br /><br />Various questions are asked and you can check off a list to determine your most pertinent desires. The number of people you are going to cook for, how many meals you cook at home, the type of foods you use and how you shop will determine the type and amount of storage space you need in your kitchen.<br /><br />There is a special section that helps you envision how your kitchen will look with the use of graph paper. Of course there are plenty of computer programs. This is explained in detail in the \\"Plan Your Design\\" chapter. Useful Addresses on pg. 82 gives you not only the mailing address and phone number, they also include the website address. There is graph paper you can photocopy if you wish.<br /><br />Kitchen Elements is quite the chapter and you consider flooring, wall coverings, cabinet finishes, stoves, ovens and eating areas. I wasn't quite that enthusiastic about the unfitted kitchen plan. The Family Kitchen plan is more friendly, and it is simply the best way to cook and entertain all at once. Plus, it has a fireplace.<br /><br />Have fun planning your dream kitchen!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2002-01-14

The Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul I, II and II all made the list. Of course I don't keep up with these sorts of things on a consistent basis, so a book is always helpful.<br /><br />The \\"Who wants to be a Millionaire\\" board game also made the top of the board games list. That is one fun game! If you have a favorite actor, you can look up all their films and find out the year they were made.<br /><br />There are quite a few quiz questions that have multiple choice answers.

This book is basically filled with scene stills, portraits, candids and behind-the-scenes images from the movie sets. David Thomson gives his insight in interesting narrative next to each photograph.<br /><br />The photography is divided into main sections:<br /><br />1915-1929 Golden Age of Silents<br />1930s Studio System<br />1940s The Dream Turns Dark<br />1950s High Fever in the Atomic Age<br />1960s  Censorship Hangs Loose<br />1970s The Silver Age<br />1980s The Space Opera Begins<br />1990s The Cinema Goes Electronic<br />2000s The Future, The Meaning<br /><br />I can't say Hollywood has been the best influence on culture. In fact, one wonders if it has done more harm than good.  Eventually you learn how to weed out the good and the bad. Normally, you can tell what you are getting in the first 15 minutes of a movie or by doing research here at Amazon which really is quite educational in itself.<br /><br />If you are looking for ideas for movies you want to watch, I can't think of a better way to be introduced to classic movies. As you look through the pictures, many movies will strike you as interesting and soon you will be making a list of new fantasy adventures.<br /><br />This contains photographs from sweet as pie Shirley Temple films to Tom Cruises Mission: Impossible and Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />The photographs all come from the Kobal Collection, the largest and oldest privately owned movie photo archive in the world, with more than a million images on file.<br /><br />Impressive!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2002-01-14

You can hide your true feelings when talking to someone you care about. Written words can be gifts of the heart and the way you present them can make all the difference. The fact that you take the time to find a concrete way of expressing your feelings is what matters!<br /><br />You might be reluctant to send an e-mail or put pen to paper, however if you follow the steps in this book you will find it is easier than you think. The authors give examples of letters for every situation. These letters go beyond \\"polite\\" words and are more honest and genuine. They express goodwill or reveal deep feelings. They also communicate the importance and value of your relationship to the receiver.<br /><br />\\"Often, just the fact that a person puts time, effort, thought or originality into something to delight or help us makes a message wonderful.\\" pg. 9<br /><br />The authors show how you use five basic elements to make a message powerful, intimate, satisfying and meaningful. It doesn't matte if you want to express your feelings, give advice, forgive, answer important questions, thank someone or share a favorite memory. These five elements should be included in your letter.<br /><br />While this book might sound like it is an emotional roller coaster ride, there are quite a few really funny letters. I loved the story of a mother who writes down the sweet and funny things her children do. She intends to give these memories to her children. I know this was such a delight when my mother showed me her notes of what I said and did when I was very young. It truly will delight any child to know their parents cared enough to find the time to write down these memories. It also helps children remember important details of their lives.<br /><br />Another idea I really thought was wonderful was a letter an Aunt sent her nephew about all the wonderful books she had read that she thought he would enjoy. Of course she could have just reviewed them, yet she chose to specifically recommend books that had given her enjoyment, knowledge and comfort.<br /><br />Some of the letters helped bridge the distance between friends and family or helped to heal a hurt. These are real letters people wrote at a time in their lives when hurt, anger or misunderstanding left them feeling as if they were stuck on opposite sides of a tightly closed door.<br /><br />\\"Maybe the blur of our lives has left us hungry for tangible ways to hold onto what is and was-even as we move toward what will be.\\"  pg. 150<br /><br />So if you want to connect with the people you care most about, \\"From Me to You\\" will show you how to share your memories, thank people who have helped you in life, apologize to those you may have hurt, inspire friends and invite people to think of you with love and a smile.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewose to specifically recommend books that had given her enjoyment, knowledge and comfort.

She was inspired by the old rose garden at Great Maytham Hall in Kent, England, her second home.<br /><br />In this story, Mary Lennox is living in India when cholera takes the life of her parents. She then travels to England to live with her uncle at Misselthwaite Manor on the edge of the bleak Yorkshire moors.<br /><br />Mary is used to being waited on hand and foot and she soon starts to feel lonely and becomes very unhappy living in a manor filled with a maze of dark passageways and tapestry walls.<br /><br />Soon she ventures outside and finds the key to the hidden door of the locked garden which has been shut up for over ten years. Once Mary meets Dickon she tells him she has: \\"stolen a garden.\\"<br /><br />\\"When Mary entered the secret garden she found Dickon already kneeling on the grass working hard. \\"Oh, Dickon! Dickon!\\" She said. I'm so happy I can scarcely breathe.\\" They ran from one part of the garden to another and found so many wonders that they had to remind themselves that they must be quiet. There was every joy on earth in the secret garden that morning, and then came the most delightful surprise of all.

In this multifaceted manuscript, William Fox identifies and documents core values in a unique way. The Index is also extensive and notes have been made for further research. Dr. Fox is a member of the Society For Organizational And Industrial Psychology.<br /><br />\\"Above all, we value our freedom, but it cannot survive for long without self-restraint that is guided by shared values.\\" -pg. 24<br /><br />The author shows great attention to detail, a great capacity for thought and knowledge and gives the reader confidence he knows whereof he speaks. When I looked through the contents pages, I knew this was going to be an intellectually breathtaking read. The main chapters focus on:<br /><br />Why Certain Core Values are Essential to our Well-Being<br />The Compatibility of our Core Values with those of Various Religions<br />Why Our Core Values are being Subverted<br />How we Acquire Values<br />The Role of Values in Behavior<br />How to Nurture Core Values in Ourselves and Others<br />Core Values in Our Schools<br />The Need for Nurturing Core Values in Political Leadership<br />Core Values in the Administration of Justice<br />Core Values in Business<br /><br />In each chapter, William Fox presents his ideas along with historical facts, quotes and recent statistics. Not only does he present the conclusions, he presents a way to take the core values and weave them into society in a constructive manner.<br /><br />While some argue there are no legitimate behavioral absolutes and others argue there is a sacred source which provides absolute guidelines, the author says: \\"Ethical reality can be complex.\\" Life is filled with ethical dilemmas. Instead of \\"always\\" answering the questions, he does at times present the facts and lets the reader come to a conclusion.<br /><br />\\"It is simplistic to assume that doing what is right is merely the result of knowing what is right-various factors interact to cause ethical behavior. Among these are situational factors. They are potent, but not all-controlling. Mature logic and the strongly held values that comprise a healthy conscience and feelings of self-efficacy can negate or facilitate compliance with negative external pressures...\\" pg. 83<br /><br />The basic theme is how we can use the core values to make the future better. He takes a look at the core values from our founding fathers, why some people are predisposed at birth toward inappropriate behavior, why core values from various religions and cross-cultural sources are compatible and what we can do to enhance ethical behavior in business, politics, the welfare system, criminal-justice system and schools.<br /><br />Do you take duty, honesty, integrity and being responsible seriously? Can we live our life in a manner that is not harmful to others? The second chapter is was very interesting as it shows how core values in various religions compare with America's core values and how all religions are moving towards agreement in many areas. Maybe they are just becoming more apparent.<br /><br />I enjoyed the fully developed points, the new perspectives and solutions presented. There is hardly a page where I have not highlighted an important fact or a well thought out conclusion. This book documents some of the problems created by moral decline and then presents a way to reverse the situation.<br /><br />American Values in Decline, America's Real War by Daniel Lapin and The American Paradox by David G. Myers are all books that present real solutions for America. They show where we have been, where we are and where we all want to go!<br /><br />Towards a brighter future!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Revieware potent, but not all-controlling.

Cobb is a mystery writer who also loves to cook. She is an attorney who grew up in Tennessee and practiced geology, then law. Her first novel is Splendor Bay and she and her husband now live in Houston, Texas.<br /><br />She has dedicated this cookbook to Clara Nixon Dawson, Linnie Belle Snodderly, Martha Wilson, Edith Burkhart and Kathryne Cobb. In fact, this cookbook is inspired by dinner-table conversations. When Martha developed a \\"food fetish\\" and started to watch the Food Channel (how I can relate), she began practicing her new-found culinary skills. Martha then came across her mother's recipes.<br /><br />In the meantime, L.B. Cobb was researching her own family recipes. What resulted was 175 Southern and Southwestern dishes. She encourages each cook to experiment a bit and to make the recipes their own. Each recipe in the Index is followed by an abbreviation for one of the ladies who created or contributed the recipe. So, for Clara Dawson, you will see (CD).<br /><br />Some of the recipes include headnotes and some have secrets only Grandma would tell you. Little secrets like sifting the flour twice before making a cake or how to make a perfect pie crust.<br /><br />The recipes are divided into sections:<br /><br />Biscuits & Breads<br />Main Courses: Chicken, Other Poultry, Seafood and Meats.<br />Desserts: Cakes, Tarts & Patties, Pie, Cookies and Other Desserts.<br />Soups<br />Salads<br />Dressings & Sauces<br />Vegetable Side Dishes<br />Pickles & Relishes<br />Jams & Jellies<br />Beverages<br />A handy page of Measurements & Conversions is also included.<br /><br />One cookie I tasted this Christmas at my aunt's home is called: Cathedral Cookies. And, believe it or not, I found it in this cookbook! It is the same recipe. I was also thinking of making some Pecan Pralines since they are just delicious. The recipe is also so easy to make and is on pg. 53. Then my husband is always talking about tortilla soup and so I was very pleased to find a recipe.<br /><br />Other Recipes Include: Cilantro Dressing, Whipped Onion-Garlic Butter, Fried Tomatoes with Thyme and Garlic, Stuffed Mushrooms, Watermelon Rind Preserves and Pineapple-Cherry Jam.<br /><br />Delicious!<br /><br />~The Rebecca ReviewTomatoes with Thyme and Garlic, Stuffed Mushrooms, Watermelon Rind Preserves and Pineapple-Cherry Jam.

This is a journey to the core of who we are and what we really need. By understanding we are all born with deep, legitimate, God-given longings, we can then learn how to quench the thirst of the soul.<br /><br />If you think about what you want most, it would most likely be: To be wanted by someone, be of value to someone, be accepted just for who you are and be loved unconditionally. We often expect one person to fulfill all our needs, yet Verna believes not even a spouse should be expected to meet all our needs. That is where angels and friends come into the picture.<br /><br />\\"We need each other. We are to be continually reaching out to others-giving love to them and receiving love from them.\\" -pg. 32<br /><br />My aunt enjoyed reading this book and was kind enough to recommend it to me. I am quite thankful she did as it has given me insight into issues we rarely discuss, let alone acknowledge.<br /><br />While we can't avoid stress and suffering altogether no matter how much we wish we could, those times in our lives can lead us to opportunities to be more sensitive to others in the same circumstances later. The pain we feel will then make us keenly alert to the pain in others.<br /><br />Sometimes it if fine to also just say: Dear God, I can't take this anymore! And at that point you feel broken in spirit. Something beautiful happens after that moment. When we trust God with our struggles, our grief and even our hostile feelings, he is listening.<br /><br />\\"In looking away from God, humans create an emptiness and then go on searching on their own for something to fill that emptiness.\\" -pg. 71<br /><br />The highlights of this book are the steps you can take to reduce stress in your life. Sometimes it is as simple as making a right choice, no matter what.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2002-01-08

We have become almost completely dependant on these machines and we often have an emotional connection with cars that no other mechanical invention has ever inspired. Except when we are sitting in gridlock, even I have wondered when the heck we are going to get some cars that really fly. Now, then you are talking freedom!<br /><br />The 1959 Cadillac Convertible looked like it could quite possibly take off at any second. The fins were the ultimate design statement for the era. What I found fascinating is how the Mercedes A Class  is almost a modern version of the BMW Isetta. The shape is strikingly similar.<br /><br />Each car is displayed in all its glory and is show in various views. To the right of each double page you will find the Model, Production numbers, Body Styles, Construction, Engines, Power Output, Transmission, Suspension, Brake, Maxium Speed and A.F.C. information. And index provides an easy way for you to look up your favorite classic car.<br /><br />\\"If we stand back and consider the Jaguar E-Type, surely the world's most beautiful car, we see a silhouette of outstandingly fine balance, proportion, and harmony of line. But more than its tremendous physical presence, it possessed an unprecedented emotional magic, radiating messages of speed, sexuality, power, and beauty. In fact, appreciating the proportions of an elderly Jag is the nearest most of us have ever been to the criticism and consumption of art.\\" -Quentin Willson<br /><br />No wonders that was my favorite car in this book!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2002-01-07

You can literally hear his voice and see the change in his life in his writing.<br /><br />He goes from a person who literally felt he did not have the ability to really connect with other people at a deep level (he escapes by burying himself in books) to teaching classes on how to be confident. In the process he learns about his inner desires, how to gain what he really wants out of life and how to give what he has learned to the world in this amazing book.<br /><br />So much of what he said made complete sense. Especially the part where he notes how people who are living the lives of their dreams, are doing so by design. They have learned to release themselves from disempowered language  (try, should, etc.) and have embraced fast forward phrases (I absolutely can, I certainly will, It definitely will happen.) The reason it works is because confidence causes your dreams to come true. You set in motion a magical series of events that naturally will lead you to your goal.<br /><br />Today when my husband used the word: \\"try\\" in a sentence, alarms went off. Not only did I completely see how this book could change a life, it was already being put in action in my own mind as I asked him to say \\"will.\\" In that way, he \\"would\\" reach his goal and be more determined. Had I not read this book, I can't say I would have even blinked!<br /><br />\\"You realize that anything in your path that seems like an obstacle or a detour really is an opportunity in disguise to show your resourcefulness.\\" -pg. 6<br /><br />The author has based some of the material on Neuro-Liguistic Programming (NLP). This is the study of how language, both verbal and nonverbal, affects our minds.  First, he describes his own struggle with shyness and then dives right into how others can learn from his experience and learn to speak the language of confidence.<br /><br />Each chapter begins with an inspirational quote and bold headings direct you through the information in a lovely organized fashion. A \\"free offer\\" is included and you can not only subscribe to the free confidence 7-day e-course, you are also entitled to describe your biggest Confidence Challenge and receive a personal response from the author.

More familiar tales include: Gilgamesh, The Great Flood, The Tree of Life, The Sword in the Stone, The Holy Grail, Beowulf and The Fall of Icarus.<br /><br />You will enjoy reading the retellings that evoke a feeling of the original tales, and seeing the amazing full-color illustrations and color photographs that breathe new life into these delightful stories.<br /><br />A Celebration of our Infinite Imaginations.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-12-30

At least, I hope that is what is sleeping at the end of the bed. >^..^<    A book that is definitely: \\"Impressive Enough To Meow About!\\"    Human beings are drawn to cats  because they are all we are not  -self-contained, elegant in everything they do,  relaxed, assured, glad of company,   yet still possessing secret lives.     -Pam Brown    ~The Rebecca Review	2001-12-16

They are just too adorable. When my cat found a mouse \\"in the house\\" a few months ago, I immediately let the poor thing go back outside hoping it would run back to its home in the fields.<br /><br />Now in this story, a very mischievous mouse named Henrietta lives in a house and at times takes many long-distance expeditions in order to become an expert on cats and the cheeses of the world.<br /><br />On the first page she is already up to no good, knocking over the ink and running right through the ink, so here she starts to leave a trail of paw prints on each page.<br /><br />\\"On each page, in each room, I'll be doing my worst.\\" -Henrietta<br /><br />As you turn to the second page, suddenly she disappears, yet the paw prints tell exactly where she is, if you follow the right ones. The entire page is the garden room filled with potted bulbs, a wheelbarrow and watering can. Oh, and a few rather nibbled on apples.<br /><br />Next, the delightful kitchen shelves become a mouse playground. Cheese, jelly, chocolate mice and where did she go? She is hidden quite well! Still in the kitchen, we see all the makings for cake and cookies for the birthday party. Looks delicious. Then, onto the hallway to hide safely while the cat is asleep.<br /><br />While the birthday party is going on, little Henrietta has a feast of her own and is found nibbling on some cat cookies. Off to the playroom where she disappears almost entirely and then off to the bathroom to sail in a boat. By accident, she gets a bit of a bath. lol<br /><br />\\"On to the attic, the best is for last! No one comes up-I can hide in the past.\\" -Henrietta<br /><br />Finally, the next morning she collects the rest of the party leftovers to furnish her nest and then suddenly she sees paws at the door!<br /><br />\\"The cat seeks a mouse. I may have to move on-is there room in your house?\\" she says.<br /><br />I can also highly recommend: The Country Mouse in the Town House in which the little country mouse receives an invitation to visit the little city mouse and you just know they are going to have some \\"scampering\\" good times.<br /><br />Cute hide-and-seek books.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewvisit the little city mouse and you just know they are going to have some \\"scampering\\" good times.

The greatest loss is what dies within us while we live. In this story, we learn about a man who has waisted most of his life starving his soul.<br /><br />Andrew Sachs reads \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" so children can follow along or read the details as the story progresses. The tape recreates the atmosphere of the time in which the story is set and the pictures acquaint the listener with the characters.<br /><br />Scrooge values \\"only\\" money and has no time or love for any of the people in his life. It seems no one cares about him either. The spirit of Christmas is a contrast to his selfishness and lack of love, joy and care for others. His business partner Marley has passed onto the next life and Scrooge was his only friend.<br /><br />\\"The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shriveled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue.\\" pg. 11<br /><br />Not willing to make merry at Christmas, he heads to a melancholy dinner in a melancholy tavern where he reads the newspaper and then heads home to bed. When he arrives home, to his horror he sees Marley's face in place of the door knocker. In the house he sees Jacob Marley in chains and he explains how he is wearing the chains he forged in his life, link by link. He tells Scrooge he at least has time to escape this fate and that he will be haunted by three spirits.<br /><br />That night the Ghosts of Christmas Past, of Christmas Present and of Christmas Yet to Come appear to him. Through his journey he learns why people:<br /><br />1. Need to take time off from work and have some recreation.<br />2. Take time to love and have a family.<br />3. Decorate and dine on Christmas fare.<br />4. Feel the need to help those who are less fortunate.<br />5. Decided to change so they can live a more fulfilling life.<br /><br />The features in this book include lovely color pictures throughout and all the intricate details that make a story so much more alive. A special section all about the author tells of his life and why no one who ever met him ever forgot him. Scrooge fortunately lives to see a brighter day and learns to view the world in a positive way.<br /><br />A story to lift your spirits, and maybe even provide you<br />with some ideas for your New Year's resolutions.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewl about the author tells of his life and why no one who ever met him ever forgot him.

They are on the verge of proving astral projection is possible and believe they can set the spirit free to wander outside the body.<br /><br />Jim's obvious discontent with the situation is overly apparent and when he has to wait for Angie again he becomes incensed and decides these delaying tactics have occurred for the last time. Just as Jim bursts into the room, Angie disappears from under a helmet-like hair dryer.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Angie has apported in an experiment that should have only caused astral projection. Both Grottwold and Jim have absolutely no idea where she has taken off to, however it is revealed that she was concentrating on dragons. With a single heroic decision, Jim is thrust into a medieval world as he takes his seat to project his spirit in the same direction as Angie is thought to have gone.<br /><br />As fate would have it, he forgets to think about Angie and ends up thinking about dragons. This lands him in the body of a dragon and his first thought of wanting to tear Grottwold to shreds brings him to the awareness of his less than human self. Jim awakens to the reality that he is now a talking dragon who everyone knows as Gorbash.<br /><br />Overall, there is a subtle humor, which now and then catches you unawares. The conversational style changes at times and flows more into pictures painted with words so you really enter a medieval land filled with adventures and moments of brilliance.<br /><br />Angie's character is not at all fully developed in this story and I am hoping she will evolve more fully in the rest of the series. Once she disappears, we learn very little about her and only know she is trapped in the Loathly Tower, a place of pure evil. Jim has to fight his chivalrous urges to save her immediately and fears she may be in mortal danger. When he meets up with a magician, he is told not to worry about her until he can find companions to help save her.<br /><br />\\"Far ahead to the west, the sky was on fire with sunset. It lighted all the fens, the meres and the causeway with a red glow which lay bloodily on earth and grass and stunted trees; and it pooled just ahead, around a low hill, at a rise of a hundred feet or more above the seashore where, touched but uncolored by that same dying light there loomed over all, amongst great, tumbled boulders, the ruined, dark and shattered shell of a tower as black as jet.\\" pg. 231, a description of the Loathly Tower<br /><br />Gordon Dickson presents each character so you are very aware of their presence in the story and then once they have your heart, he puts them in mortal danger one after the other. Each character (besides Angie) has such a personality, you can literally hear their voice. Aragh the English wolf is so very independent and yet he ends up proving that beneath the growl and bite, there is a much more caring creature just waiting for the opportunity to show his ultimate loyalty.<br /><br />The romance is mild and is far from the main point of the story. If you are enchanted with the thought of what it would be like to be a dragon and fly above a medieval landscape, this will be less of a consideration. At some points in the plot, Jim/Gorbash looses his focus and just seems to enjoy being a dragon.<br /><br />There is never a moment when you wish Jim would turn back into his human form. Glimpses of dragon life are interwoven with modern thought and a touch of philosophy in such a creative way, Jim is never fully an animal and yet never fully human. He takes on the best of both worlds and approaches each challenge in a thoughtful manner.<br /><br />Thank you to my favorite dragon person for<br />sending me this exciting gift.

There is a photograph from 1926 showing the bridge covered with climbing plants.<br /><br />The Japanese Bridge at Giverny, 1924 is just one of the outstanding paintings in a series of works devoted to the bridge that preoccupied Monet during his final years.<br /><br />Monet loved his garden at Giverny with such a passion that one could say it bordered on obsession. Harmony in Green, The White Water Lilies, The Water Lily Pond are all explained in detail. There is even a picture of Monet photographed in his beloved garden in 1917.<br /><br />In every life there is beauty and sadness. The beauty of the water lilies contrasts with the pain Monet felt when he painted Camille on her death bed.<br /><br />When Monet's wife died, she not only left him without a companion, he then had small children depending on him. He spent most of his meager earnings on his wife's medical treatments and he was also deeply depressed and alone.<br /><br />This type of revealing information makes him so very human and the paintings then contain a certain depth when these secrets are revealed.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-12-01

Budziszewski's mind is so superior, I can only assume God delights in giving him insight in order to enlighten the reader.<br /><br />No, this is not a work you can hurriedly consume. You will want to slowly absorb and contemplate each idea as it is presented. It is not for anyone new to philosophy and is in fact the most complex book I have ever read that made complete sense.<br /><br />The desire to underline every word was a great temptation. The variety in thought is at times a complete cerebral challenge. Your desire to understand the author's thoughts will not allow you to only \\"briefly\\" consider them.<br /><br />My belief in a teacher who appears when you most desperately need one was reinforced even more when not only did this book come into my life, but I met someone who became almost an angel to me.<br /><br />Not only did my mind travel to places I did not know existed, I traveled to places I wanted to go, had never been and didn't know how to find.<br /><br />The Revenge of Conscience will answer questions that have been chained in the dungeons of your mind tormenting you until you find the answers. The topics discussed are relevant for today and will bring a greater understanding to those highly controversial subjects both conservatives and liberals debate in their daily existence. He approaches these subjects with sheer honesty, creativity and brilliance.<br /><br />Budziszewski questions why we would want to rape our own conscience and deny ourselves the pure pleasure of truth. He shows how as a human race, we have far too often suppressed our knowledge of right and wrong. Therefore, corrupting our conscience, causing moral neutrality and social collapse.<br /><br />He then presents a revealing look at how he thought as a nihilist, then logically shows his path to change. He holds a conversation with the deepest part of your soul in a similar way to how C.S. Lewis speaks truth you instantly recognize. This is not a book you will only want to read once. You may want to study it while having a dictionary and book like: The Story of Philosophy, close by.<br /><br />In this revelation that we do know the basics of right and wrong, the author also shows why we wish we didn't. He also presents why reason can be perverted by passion, why we pay a high price for our rationalizations and why both liberals and conservatives commit moral errors. This book could not have come into my life at a more appropriate time.<br /><br />\\"A great many modern people cling to the protection of views which are not merely false but incoherent; for instance, they dogmatically insist that truth cannot be known, all the while supposing that what they say is true. pg. 144<br /><br />I now want to read every book J.

The only thing better than reading a book you love, is having the book read to you by someone you love.<br /><br />We adore books, not only for the thoughts they contain, but for the thoughts we compose when we immerse our minds in them.

If you are looking for a work that covers art history, from medieval religious paintings to abstract expressionism, look no further. There are 1,000 paintings shown in their authentic beauty. 500 of the world's greatest artists are featured.<br /><br />Sister Wendy makes each piece of art an intellectual experience. She explains the paintings so you will never look at them again in the same way. How I wished she had been with me when I visited the Louvre a few years ago. Somehow, I felt I was missing some insight into the greatest art I would ever see. And by the way, the Mona Lisa's eyes did freak me out...they follow you!<br /><br />While watching a recent special on Claude Monet, I realized there was so much more to the art than just the scene being painted. How did the artist feel when he created the work? What emotions is he trying to convey to the viewer? In Sister Wendy's book: Love: Meditations on Love, she brought a new meaning to Camille on Her Deathbed, and oil on canvas by Claude Monet. Since then, I have been intrigued with her observations. My mother has a bed spread based on a painting by Claude Monet. I love the art of Renoir much more, but one day we will travel to Paris together and really enjoy going to museums. For now, this book and local galleries will have to do!<br /><br />If you are looking for in-depth information on each artist, you might however be a bit dissapointed. This book could not possibly hold that much information. What you will find is that you will gravitate to one artist or the other. In this way, this book is only the start of your journey. I only found one page on Renoir, but then discovered she has also written a book called: Sister Wendy's Impressionist masterpieces which now I must have!<br /><br />This is a book to be savored. If you can sneak in a few minutes each day to look at a few pages, you will really enrich your life. After seeing this book, you will want to find more of Wendy Beckets inspirational books.

As the pictures capture the loving relationship between parent and child, the lullabies provide a way for parents to provide warmth and comfort.<br /><br />Research has shown that children who are sung to early in life, will speak and read slightly earlier than other children who do not have this wonderful nurturing experience in their lives.<br /><br />As a child, I remember my mother's beautiful voice (she used to sing in the choir at her father's church) and would often fall asleep when my father read stories to me. I would ask him questions, just so he would keep on talking. The soothing sound of my parents voices made me feel that all was well in the world.<br /><br />The art in this book captures that feeling of safety and love. You can start to sing these songs to your baby and as they grow, they can look at the pictures.<br /><br />The art of Mary Cassatt is sure to leave an impression! A one page biography is included for your reading enjoyment.<br /><br />Another way to enjoy singing, is to sing together as a family at Christmas. I just have to remember not to sit next to my one brother, who always tells me jokes or sings the wrong words and has me laughing so much, I can hardly sing.<br /><br />Sometimes I wish I was little again. Just so I could hear my mother sing lullabies to me. Often she does greet me in a sing-song fashion, which is always entertaining.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-10-31

When I first looked through this book, I thought maybe they could have added some explanations to the artwork. Then, I realized that if they had, they would not be allowing the child to make up creative ideas about the art themselves.<br /><br />Each piece is simply accompanied by a word or sentence. \\"Young and Old\\" is next to Dignity and Impudence by Edwin Landseer. A picture of a large and small dog.<br /><br />Children Playing on the Beach by Mary Cassatt is explained by: \\"playing in the sand.\\"<br /><br />The simplicity of this book then becomes the beauty. Children will want to know more about the pictures and you can answer their questions and have a conversation about art.<br /><br />There are over 100 paintings reproduced in gorgeous colors. You can teach colors and words as well as art appreciation. It might also be amusing to try to teach them the names of the paintings.<br /><br />The art is divided up into sections. There is a note to parents and teachers. Then you can view art that focuses on:<br /><br />The Family<br />At Home<br />In the Garden<br />Pets<br />Animals on the Farm<br />Wild Animals<br />Birds<br />Fruit<br />Things we Do<br />Action Words<br />Counting<br />Colors<br />Shapes<br />Opposites<br />The Seasons<br />The Weather<br />By the Sea<br />Faces<br />The Five Senses<br />Six Way to Travel<br />Let's Go by Boat<br />A Time to Work, Play, Eat, Sleep<br />A Time for Peace<br /><br />The picture of fall is especially beautiful. While viewing this book, you might also want to play some classical music in the background.<br /><br />This book is just delightful. You might also enjoy \\"A Child's Book of Lullabies\\" featuring art by Mary Cassatt.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-10-31

This happened to my niece when I was first teaching her to read. One minute she only knew her alphabet, the next, she was reading three letter words.<br />These flash cards can be used at home in conjunction with a reading program at school. What you could do is start with the alphabet and use the cards with a green border to associate the alphabet with the sound in a word. Like....y in yellow or h in hen. Your child can get ahead at school if you are willing to spend some time teaching them at home when you can.<br />This set includes a step-by-step guide. First they show you how to help your child hear simple sounds like b in banana. Then they can start sounding out words like c-a-t.<br />This also covers short and long vowel sounds. To compliment this mini-program, you will want to pick up a Manuscript Formation Guide and possibly look into a book like: Leonard C. Duncan's How to Teach Phonics. It is nothing fancy, but has lots of extra words and you can make up some of your own 4 x 6 cards. Your child might also get involved in decorating them and you can make it into a fun coloring project.<br />Other Flashcards in this series: On the Farm, In the Home, Clothes, In the Garden. They are very colorful, durable and have beautiful pictures.	2001-10-30

The other day I was watching a show about the ocean and saw the most amazing thing. They were talking about \\"black smokers - strange chimneys that form on the ocean floor.\\" Later, in a discussion with a friend, I needed some extra information and this book provided me with the specifics.<br /><br />When it comes to looking up this type of information, search engines are useful to a point. However, I find having a book gives me more confidence that the information is really accurate and true. Although, I do have a real problem with evolution in these types of books. Apart from that, the information is wonderful.<br /><br />There are very colorful pictures. The Maple leaves turning from green to orange is shown with an explanation as to why this occurs. There are so many pictures in this book and the type is very easy to see.<br /><br />If you have children and they need a book to look up facts for their school projects, this is a nice, compact size children will feel comfortable using.<br /><br />The only question you will have when this book arrives is: \\"What do I look up first?\\"<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-10-30

Looking up words in this dictionary is much quicker than in a regular dictionary. Mostly, you will just see the word...without any definition.<br /><br />It is a great idea because sometimes I write a word and look at it and think it is the strangest looking word I have ever seen. Sometimes the word is correct and my mind is just playing tricks on me, and sometimes I really need this book!<br /><br />A few times there are some mini-definitions.<br /><br />Poor (lacking wealth)<br />Pore (of skin; to look or think intently)<br />Pour (liquid)<br /><br />Just to prevent any confusion. There are also a few alternative spellings for words and they are listed together for you to decide which one to use. Is it mediaeval or medieval?<br /><br />The section on \\"commonly confused words\\" was educational and I have had my share of trouble with: desert and dessert when writing a cookbook. Just when I think I will never make THAT mistake again...there I go again.<br /><br />To make this book even easier to read, they have indented words like: Exclaimed and Exclaiming under the word Exclaim.<br /><br />A definite must have for all writers.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-10-30

Owen Jones was born in 1809 and is a key figure in the history of British design. He was an architect and designer who taught in London during the 1850s.<br /><br />He traveled in Europe and the Near East, were he helped to bring back ideas to improve the quality of Western design. This collection is a result of his comprehensive analysis of patterns. The sumptuous illustrations are presented in these sections:<br /><br />Ornament of Savage Tribes<br /><br />Egyptian Ornament<br />Assyrian and Persian Ornament<br />Greek Ornament<br />Pompeian Ornament<br />Roman Ornament<br />Byzantine Ornament<br />Arabian Ornament<br />Turkish Ornament<br />Moresque Ornament from the Alhambra<br />Persian Ornament<br />Indian Ornament<br />Hindoo Ornament<br />Chinese Ornament<br />Celtic Ornament<br />Mediaeval Ornament<br />Renaissance Ornament<br />Elizabethan Ornament<br />Italian Ornament<br />Leaves and Flowers from Nature<br /><br />The original Preface to Owen Jones's original folio edition has been preserved and included. The general principles in the arrangement of form and color are listed so you can see which are advocated throughout this book.<br /><br />If you are interested in reading about over 2,350 classic patterns (color engravings representing a vast range of ornamental styles), this is the book for you! More than likely, you will gravitate to one form of the other and concentrate your reading efforts on those sections.<br /><br />The actual pictures are all numbered and the mediaeval section is especially beautiful.<br /><br />Iain Zaczek has contributed to the commentaries in this work. He is an art historian and has written on a wide variety of subjects. He is also the author of The Essential William Morris, The essential Art Deco, and the Art of Illuminated Manuscripts.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-10-30

I mean, the things going on in this castle...you just can never imagine.<br /><br />The Introduction shows the basics of the outside of the castle walls and roofing. Then the next section focuses on defense and siege. Who knew that sometimes castle commanders found uses for their trebuchets and provided the watching ladies with a preciesion bombardment of roses.<br /><br />The Garrison section shows how the Feudal system worked and where they kept the treasure chests.<br /><br />The Treadmill in the Building the Castle Section is not exactly one you might think of now. Children will enjoy this section, it has so many peope at work all over the castle.<br /><br />The Trades and Skills section shows people making pottery. There are candle makers, carpenters, plumbers, tailors and even a Hermit cell where the hermit could study and be religious, even if they didn't agree with the church.<br /><br />Living like a Lord and Food and Feasting, now those pages are quite good. Rules like: \\"Do not pick your teeth at the table with a knife,\\" sounds like a good one to me.<br /><br />Entertainment, livestock and produce, weapons and punishment are also covered.<br /><br />Very informative and entertaining.

While the Visual Encyclopedia of Science basically covers science, this encyclopedia covers so much more. You will find some similarities between the two books in the science section and that is to be expected.<br /><br />However, I could not believe how much information they have packed into this tiny book! If you want to know about the Earth, you can learn about volcanoes, earthquakes, the oceans, glaciers, climates and ecosystems.<br /><br />If you want to learn about specific states or countries, you can find all the statistics you could possibly want. I found things like: \\"France produces over 300 types of Cheese\\" very tasty information.<br /><br />Some of the fun items in this book include:<br /><br />A picture of the Mona Lisa<br />Movie Facts<br />The Olympic Games and where they took place since 1896 to 2000.<br />A Timeline of World History<br />Units of measurements<br />Transportation through the Ages<br />How your body fights Infection<br />Fossils<br />Galaxies...<br /><br />And so much more!<br /><br />Highly Recommended as a Fun Learning Experience.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-10-30

A glossary and index makes this quite useful. They also have so many beautiful pictures of castles, including the Bran Castle that inspired the Dracula legend.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book for children: Stephen Biesty's Cross-Section castle is pretty amazing as you can see inside a 14th-Century castle.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-10-30

Kittens change so much, although I wish they just stayed little!<br /><br />If you want to identify your cat, this is also a great place to start.

After you identify the cat you want to look up, find the name in the index and voila..there you are. A handy Glossary is available for you to look up words like necklace, outcross, pads, laces and feral.<br /><br />And, if you think this book is wonderful, wait until you see: The New Encyclopedia of the Cat by Dr. Bruce Fogle, that I rave on and on about to everyone I know.<br /><br />I recommend both for the serious cat lover!

Once the caterpillar hatches, she eats and eats and eats.<br /><br />As the caterpillar gets bigger and bigger, she sheds her skin until finally she looks for a sturdy leaf and hangs upside down. The outside skin turns hard and inside, she is turning into a beautiful creature. One day the chrysalis splits open and a new butterfly emerges to dry in the sunshine.<br /><br />On the last page, there is a picture word list and your child can sign and date the back cover to remind them of their accomplishment when they are able to completely read this book on their own.<br /><br />Educational!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-10-30

A healthy diet will help you to have a fuller life. As a second option, you can choose to take supplements in pill form.<br /><br />This book presents the source of the vitamin or mineral with the chemical name, preparations and RDA for adults. When you look up Vitamin B5 you will find a picture of dried apricots, you can also find this in peanuts, tahini paste, sesame seeds, pecans, walnuts, avocados, apples and dried figs. If you decide to go with the dried figs option, there is a delicious recipe in a book called Inter Courses that you will just love. I had never used dried figs in cooking before, but they are really good!<br /><br />What I really liked about this book is the detail for each mineral/vitamin. On the same two pages where I found the apricots and pictures of other delicious foods, I also found a list of symptoms for if you have a deficiency of pantothenic acid. Stress and alcohol and large quantities of tea and coffee can reduce the absorption of pantothenic acid. Taken with vitamin C, you can help to strengthen your skin and promote healing. This is essential, say after surgery.<br /><br />A wonderful and very helpful book you might want to keep someplace with your<br />recipe books. That way you can try to include as many of these wonderful foods into your diet as you can.<br /><br />There is a great section on \\"other supplements\\" which explains Herbal Remedies. Please consult your physician before taking any herbal supplements as they can not be mixed with certain prescriptions.<br /><br />For such a situation I recommend: Natural Health Magazine Instant Guide to Drug-Herb Interactions.

Maybe a cookbook that is not too complicated, but will take your cooking to the level of a chef? I found the recipes in this cookbook really made cooking quite fun and the colors, tastes and textures are also very exciting.<br /><br />I just finished making: \\"Pumpkin and Pancetta Risotto\\" and thought how wonderful this would be to serve in place of mashed potatoes at Thanksgiving. The creamy rice flavored with crispy pancetta, pumpkin treats and shallots is quite comforting, especially at this time of year. This dish is also so beautiful when you are making it and is perfect to make in October/November.<br /><br />If you do make this specific recipe, I recommend even adding some toasted pumpkin seeds as well. Just saut' dried pumpkin seeds in butter or make extra pancetta (saltier than bacon) and top each serving with more mascarpone. You could really make a meal of this recipe and just add a cup of hot apple cider.<br /><br />My other recommendations for Fall from this cookbook are:<br /><br />-Chocolate Heart of Darkness Cakes (Sounds sinful, don't they? ;)<br />-Pumpkin Ginger Cr'me Caramel on Spiced Pumpkin Cake<br />with Pecan Shorts and Toffeed Pecans<br />-Creamy Corn with Smoky Bacon Chanterelles, and Thyme<br />-Long-bone Short Ribs with Chinook merlot Gravy and Rosemary White Beans<br />-Sweet Butternut Soup with Thyme Cr'me Fraiche<br /><br />This cookbook is quite detailed and has many extras you won't find in other cookbooks. The Editors really make this very easy to use. There is a wonderful index as well as a list of recipes by book, so you could choose to look up 10 recipes by Tom Douglas if you found his cooking to be your style. The Index also has boldface numbers to indicate recipes with pictures.<br /><br />The contents include recipes for: hours d'ouevres, fish, chicken, pork, veal, beef, lamb, main dishes, vegetables, side dishes and desserts.<br /><br />Each year, the editors from Food & Wine search for the best recipes from the best cookbooks.

They were filled with life and you could find hermit crabs, tiny fish, beautiful starfish and sometimes a trapped octopus.<br />Life in a tide pool is quite beautiful and this shows false flowers, crabs, water weeds, sea spines, sea spines, velvet crabs, rock stars (well, OK, starfish) and sea lemons/slugs.<br />Beautiful Pictures and lots of information on the plants and animals. Recommended for children who love the beach!	2001-10-28

It portrays the earth in sumptuous detail and with such accuracy it is astounding.<br /><br />If one could ever be speechless about a book, this might be the one. The word: WOW comes to mind the minute you open this book. It is highly detailed and has more than 750 photographs, 150 diagrams and more than 80,000 geographical place names.<br /><br />Forget going to the library...just buy this book! You will find it to be extremely useful for researching countries. There is a section that shows all the countries of the world with their current statistics. You can look up the Official name, Formation date, Capital, Population, Total square miles/km, Languages, Religions, Ethnic mix, Government, Currency, Literacy rate and Calorie consumption (3,732 kilocalories in the United States as compared to 3,497 in Austria).<br /><br />The glossary helps to explain terms like Sea-floor spreading or Tombolo. The inside back cover has all the world's flags. The inside front cover has a key to map pages picture which is such a great feature.<br /><br />Lavish? You bet! I feel completely spoiled owning this HUGE ATLAS. The INDEX is extensive and the largest one I have ever seen in my life. We are talking page 218-353.<br /><br />If you love studying the world or have a relative who loves to spend time just dreaming about traveling the world, this makes a wonderful gift. The only thing better than this Atlas would be watching a video or actually traveling.<br /><br />Great Study Aid.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-10-28

While the Dorling Kindersley World Atlas is a much larger version, I prefer this one for looking up just a country or two. If you want a more detailed and almost encyclopedic treatment of the world, you could look up ISBN:078945620.<br />This size is much lighter and is easy for children to use. It is useful for school projects and you can look up each countries flag (and statistics)  or look up a country of interest in the easy-to-use Index.<br />The inside front and back covers have a &quot;key&quot; to the Map Pages. So, if you are looking up countries in the Middle East, you would look on page 98. That is a great feature.<br />Perfect to keep in the family TV room.	2001-10-28

Is the stress of life getting to you? With the visions of terror all around us these days, we need to balance our body and mind. Immunity is also a really big issue. Lately, I am taking something called B1-Bomber by Dr. Michael Pinkus. He calls it the Ultimate Stress Vitamin.<br /><br />I have always understood Vitamin B to be stress reducing, but after reading this book, I see it is so much more. It can speed the healing of wounds, improve immune function and prevent nerve damage. I was surprised to learn it should be taken to help alleviate carpal tunnel syndrome and ease muscle cramps.<br /><br />This book focuses on Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Pyridoxine, Biotin, Folic Acid and Cobalamin. You can easily find these natural in foods and if you have a balanced diet, that is the best way to get them into your system.<br /><br />There are also special doses for Acne, Asthma, Carpal Tunnel, Joint Diseases, Diabetes and a list of conditions. Each vitamin has a recommended dosage, deficiency symptoms, food sources and cautions. There is also a section on ADD that parents will want to read.<br /><br />They also include Alternative Health Strategies and a one-minute stress reducer exercise that really works. Otherwise, getting a massage is the best way to really destress. Of all the things I have tried, taking B-vitamins and getting a massage while listening to relaxing CD's can't be beat.<br /><br />Please consult your doctor before adding supplements into your diet.<br /><br />A nice compact little book that will help you improve your life.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-10-28

There are also ideas for cream decorations that are so easy to make, yet look so gourmet.<br />This book is divided into 9 sections: Super Soups, Making Stocks, Ingredients &amp; Preparation, Creamed &amp; Pureed Soups, Hearty Soups, Light Soups, Cold Soups, Short Cuts and Presentation.<br />This book is geared to new cooks and gives great advice on how to prepare the ingredients with step-by-step pictures.<br />Some of the recipes in this book for Fall:<br />Butternut Squash Soup<br />Pumpkin &amp; Apple Soup<br />Borscht<br />French Onion Soup<br />Hungarian Sour Cherry Soup<br />Most of the soups contain a short list of ingredients and could not be easier to make. You will also find information on how to freeze soups (my favorite thing to do so I always have a soup ready to heat up), use your microwave to speed up preparations or make garnishes or even piroshki to serve with soup.<br />No difficult cooking tricks...this book is just filled with easy-to-make treats!	2001-10-28

As children, my mother used to give us vitamin C constantly. I don't remember<br />a day as a child when I was not munching on some delicious vitamin C chewable vitamin. My mother swore this would cure just about anything...and it seems to have kept me alive this long!<br /><br />Vitamin C will help to block pollutants, enhance your immunity, repair bone damage, maintain hormone production and generally help you fight infection.<br /><br />Do I still take it as an adult? You bet! Along with Echinacea in the winter! Please do consult your physician before taking any medications. A Naturopath will be able to tell you what you need. Otherwise, this book is pretty good at explaining Vitamin C in detail.<br /><br />This book explains what Vitamin C is, where to get it naturally from food, why deficiencies can occur and how to treat various conditions with special doses.<br /><br />Handy Reference. Just keep drinking your Orange Juice! ;><br /><br />A good way to get Vitamin C naturally is to drink fruit smoothies in the morning. That way, you can blend papaya, pineapple, strawberries, kiwi, yogurt and orange juice and really get a good dose, plus most of your fruits for the day. See the Suzanne Somers cookbooks for more information or write me for my favorite recipe. There are also many, many books on Fruit Smoothies out there that are simply wonderful.<br /><br />The book: \\"Super Foods for Children\\" has delicious fruit drinks for children. In the summer, you can keep fruit frozen to make smoothies to beat the heat!<br /><br />Nice Compact Reference with information you can easily absorb!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-10-28

This is one of the cutest little books and it is just packed with information.<br />If there was just information on spices, it would not be as interesting. Here, they include wonderful recipes. First you get a &quot;Spice Know-How&quot; lesson to help you figure out what spices really are, how to dry-roast them and the best ways to store them.<br />The Spice Profiles section shows you say how to use saffron to bring out the most flavor or how to make chili oil. They also have info on paprika, cassia, cinnamon, turmeric, lemongrass (divine!) and cardamom.<br />Then for the recipes! You will find Far East, Indian, North African, Middle Eastern, European, American and Caribbean treats!<br />I have totally been looking for a Thai Shrimp Soup with Lemongrass recipe! No lies. There is was, just waiting for me to discover it. I have to mail order the lemon grass and it keeps very well in the freezer.

Noah thanks God for saving him from the flood and soon life on the ocean becomes very dull and the winds and rain stop.

Here he takes Myths beyond just story telling and explains over 50 remarkable myths and legends from around the world, using stunning works of art. There are 45 of the world's great painting that are brought to life with explanations.<br /><br />There are cave paintings, classic works of art, tribal sculptures and everything in between. You take a journey from Egypt to Japan. there is also a section on The Greek Gods. An Index is useful for locating your favorite characters.<br /><br />I was especially interested in the Epic of Gilgamesh as it has so many similarities with the Flood Story. Utnapishtim survives the great flood and builds a boat that then runs aground on Mount Nisir.<br /><br />Each painting is surrounded with text or images and even some quotes. My favorite piece of art is on page 64 (Odysseus and the Sirens by Herbert James Draper) and shows Odysseus and his Crew sailing back from the underworld (where ghosts, twittering like bats are held at bay). The picture shows the sirens (mermaids) trying to climb aboard the ship to lure Odysseus with their seductive voices.<br /><br />The Cosmic Serpent story tells of the Fon people in Africa and how the cosmic serpent was a god with two faces. They tell of how the first people were made of clay and water, much the same way as the people would prepare building materials for a house.<br /><br />One of the most beautiful books on myths I have ever seen. A MUST HAVE if you collect books on mythology and love art.<br /><br />The Illustrated Book of Fairy Tales by Neil Philip is also a favorite!<br />Illustrated Dictionary of Mythology by Philip Wilkinson<br />Signs & Symbols by Miranda Bruce-Mitford<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-10-25

The whimsically illustrated cards will inspire you to take up some new interests, realize your fantasies, stretch your limits or rediscover your joie de vivre.<br />The cards are dedicated to Lynn Gordon's sister Dale who lives her life to the fullest and with contagious vitality. Lynn encourages us to view the memories of childhood with a renewed interest. Visiting the circus as a grown-up will help you appreciate elements you were not aware of as a child.<br />I had to giggle at the &quot;Make a Wish&quot; one, because as a child I was forever asking my mom for pennies to toss in fountains. I always believed my wishes really would come true. Later in life you realize you don't always get what you want, but you always get what you need.<br />Some of the cards in this pack include: Speaking in Public (not something I enjoy), Asking a Stranger Out (can't, already married), Radical hair Make-Over (maybe), Writing the Great American Novel (working on that one), Milk a Cow (done that), Stay up All Night (Read a long book and that is very possible ;&gt;) and Swim in the Ocean (Um, Sharks! Maybe not!).<br />But then they have some really enjoyable ideas like: Sleeping out Under the Stars, Writing a Children's Book, Taking a Spontaneous Trip (my husband laughed at the thought of me not packing for days), Leaving a really Big Tip for a waitress (make her day), Get a Massage (you need it), Send a Love letter (leave the card about the house for your husband to see...hint!) and Volunteer for a Good Cause.<br />Geared for Girlfriends, bright and colorful. You could also send single cards in letters to friends who you think might need to get out and do something fun.

I still have the tiny apron I made as a child and ended up framing it because I wanted to keep it safe. You will want to read this book and then keep it in a safe place too!<br /><br />In \\"The Starlight Princess\\" the story is illustrated completely with embroidery. Belinda Downes is a world-renowned embroidery artist and you will want to also find \\"A Stitch in Rhyme\\" and \\"Every Little Angel's Handbook.\\"  She has always loved history and costume design and was very excited to illustrate this book and uses luxuriant fabrics and different threads and stitches. This is not cross stitch! The pages look like calico fabric.<br /><br />To say I am impressed with this book is an understatement. I am fascinated with the embroidery, all the delicate details woven through the pages, framing the story with exquisite detail.<br /><br />As a little girl I dreamed of being a princess. One time, I had my brother help me put two mattresses up on my bed and we put a pea under the bed to see if I could feel it. Since I couldn't, we declared that I must be a princess indeed. lol<br /><br />Well, that story is actually in this collection of eight fairy tales and is the first story. The Frog Princess, King Grizzlebeard, The Starlight Princess, The Sleeping Beauty, The Twelve Dancing Princesses, The Egg Prince and White-Bear-King Valemon are included in this collection.<br /><br />Annie Dalton's storytelling brings meaning to the embroidery. She also brings such humor to some of the stories.<br /><br />\\"There was once a princess so beautiful that any prince who saw her portrait instantly became desperate to marry her. Unfortunately, as soon as they actually met her these princes quickly changed their minds.\\"<br /><br />The story of the Egg Prince was completely new to me and is about Princess Lebou who can run faster than any warrior. She lives in Africa and helps to break a spell and release the prince from the egg. But as Annie says: \\"But in case things don't work out, she sensibly hangs on to those egg shells.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend this work of art! Simply one of the most<br />beautiful books you will ever see if you love embroidery.<br /><br />A review cannot do this book justice. You must see it to believe it!

With each piece of artwork, Sister Wendy shares her thoughts on how the symbols, facial expressions or scenes relate to love as we know it.<br /><br />Sister Wendy questions the art and wants us to decide if what we are seeing is really love or just an illusion. Is a bodily embrace love? Is giving flowers love?<br /><br />I think of all the things anyone has ever given to me, flowers are one of the most memorable. Who does not remember that first bunch of flowers? Yesterday, my husband came home with a dozen roses, which I was completely surprised by.<br /><br />To me, a bunch of flowers symbolizes the love my husband feels for me. Sister Wendy explains how in \\"Man Gives Woman Flowers\\" the grandfather clock in the picture symbolizes \\"time.\\" The woman holds back and the man is leaning forward, symbolizing, he wants this relationship more than she does. This is perhaps something you would easily figure out on your own when viewing the picture.<br /><br />However, in \\"The Arnolfini Marriage\\" there is a delightful pair of shoes that symbolizes much more. \\"The Cradle\\" is perhaps the most beautiful picture in the book and shows a mother's love.<br /><br />\\"Love is both infinitely rewarding and endlessly demanding. The two aspects are inseparable.\\"<br /><br />A beautiful book to give to someone you love.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-10-25

The author loves to go barefoot and as the mother of four grown children, she has tied more shoes than she can count. She is the author of several picture books including The Seasons Sewn: A Year in patchwork, which won the Carl Sandburg Award for Children's Literature. Nadine illustrates with such flair and will make you smile...even though she would rather have all the shoes in this book and not go barefoot.<br /><br />A little girl in pink pajamas awakens with the words: \\"Good morning, toes, Good morning, feet, tangled up between my sheets.\\" She then puts on bunny slippers and bounces around to the closet door. The puppy dog in the story actually brings her the slippers.<br /><br />The next page will make every little girl wish she had a closet filled with all these pretty shoes. Red high heels with bows, alligator sock shoes, fluffy orange slippers, boots and yellow sandals decorated with fruit. After clomping down the stairs in her polka dot red<br />high heels, she changes into something a bit more practical. Then the real fun starts.<br /><br />She leaps and skips and goes down a slide, swings and points her toes up high, jumps across a creek and then heads home for lunch. While her baby brother naps, she walks quietly in her red boots and heads outside to shuffle along in leaves.<br /><br />After taking off her shoes, she squishes her toes into muddy ooze and then dances in a puddle and cleans her feet off. She then takes a big bubble bath, dries her feet and snuggles between her sheets.<br /><br />Completely Adorable and perfect for bedtime reading.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-10-25

Fairy and Folk tales play an important role in developing a child's love of reading. Very young children love to experience classic nursery tales especially with such wonderful illustrations of mice, hens, cats and little brick cottages.<br />The Little Red Hen is a story I remember from childhood, but never heard the \\"end\\" of the story the way it is told here. In the story I remember, the little red hen had to do all the work and then ate what she made herself while everyone else went hungry. Or, at least that is the way I remember it.<br />This seems like two stories in one. One where the little red hen is teaching the lesson of hard work and the second of teaching that you have to be smart in all situations and be prepared.<br />In this story a cat, a rat and a red hen live together in a house. The cat and the rat refuse to help her with making the breakfast and so she says: \\"I'll do it myself.\\" Then, she eats up the breakfast she made. So, that part of the story was what I remember.<br />Then, a fox enters and is carrying a wide white sack, he catches little red hen and she escapes. She puts a stone in the sack and sews it back up. The fox drops the contents of the sack down the chimney and smashes the glass cooking pot to \\"smithereens.\\"<br />Cute story for very young children.	2001-10-25

Andrea Reeves is an eight-year-old girl who is trying to survive in her dysfunctional home and when she learns she is adopted, she tries to find her birth parents. She desperately wants her mother's attention and her father's protection. She receives neither. She tries to live in the present and survive the attacks from her brother and barely survives childhood.<br /><br />Her alcoholic mother is verbally abusive and her brother makes her feel completely vulnerable to the point that she has to lock herself in a room to protect herself from him. Her father doesn't seem to acknowledge this abuse and Andrea is in fear of her life.<br /><br />The author shows great powers of observation as she recounts many of the scenes from her past. This is really a work of fiction, but is written in a very realistic way. Encounters with those who seek to destroy Andrea's spirit tests her inner strength. While she almost gives in to drugs and alcohol herself, she manages to find more in life to cling to.<br /><br />From the Depths is based on a true story that is an adventure into learning how to survive in life when difficult situations arise. Julie Barnes' hope is that her story will touch lives in a spiritual way.<br /><br />There is a feeling that you know Andrea personally by the time you have read that last page. This is almost written in a stream of consciousness style. The events flow well from one scene to the other. It is as if the author is remembering her life in great detail. This story shows life from the perspective of an adopted child who felt that her childhood was much less than perfect.<br /><br />A note at the start of this novel was very meaningful at this time:<br /><br />\\"The world has not learned to forgive, though history continue to prove that it is necessary for peace....Faith is believing in that which we cannot see, as we bravely carry on in this imperfect world.\\" -Julie A.

Most recently, we have seen a surge of support for freedom with an increase in the display of the American Flag. This universally recognized symbol of freedom serves to unite Americans in a common goal. It speaks of those who died to give us freedom and gives us hope that as we see our flag flying, we are still free.<br /><br />Cultures around the world have chosen signs and symbols to represent various beliefs. For some, a red rose is the symbol of love and for others a snake is a symbol of evil. In China, a snake is a symbol of wisdom. Each country has a different interpretation.<br /><br />Miranda Bruce-Mitford has studied social anthropology  and as a writer, she has contributed to dictionaries and encyclopedias. Now she is often a guest lecturer on art tours in Southeast Asia.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book to explore the signs of symbols from East and West, The Illustrated Book of Signs & Symbols explores the origins in art, religion and folklore. The signs and symbols are grouped by category and a clear cross-referencing system helps the reader to find related signs and symbols.<br /><br />This book contains information on:<br /><br />Mythologies & Religions - Ancient Deities, Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Ancestor & Nature Spirits and Mythical Beasts.<br /><br />Nature: Sun & Moon, Earth & Sky, Precious Matter, Precious Stones, Gardens, Trees, Plants, Nature's Foods, Flowers, Sea Creatures, Insects, Reptiles & Amphibians, Mammals and Birds.<br /><br />People: Sex & Fertility, Human Body, Dance & Theatre, Magic & Charms, Musical Instruments, Love & Marriage, Clothing, Jewelry, Royalty, Tools and Weapons, Death & Mourning, Architecture and Everyday Objects.<br /><br />Symbol Systems: Picture Writing, Numbers, Shapes & Patterns, Color, Alchemy, Freemasonry, Divination, Astrology, Heraldic Emblems, International Signs and Symbolic Gestures.<br /><br />An Index makes looking up your favorite symbols very convenient. You will find something you will just want to know! I was especially interested in the \\"Rose Window\\" and wondered what it represented.<br /><br />\\"The rose window, so named because of its petal like shapes of glass, represents both human aspiration for wholeness and coherence and the realization of those same desires.

As I embark on the delightful journey of purchasing a new kitten, my interests have become rather obsessive in the \\"which cat do I want to bring home\\" department. Do I want a pedigree, mixed breed, cute kitten or mature cat. I think I decided on the beautiful, new kitten option!<br /><br />So, how do I keep a new cat healthy, happy and welcome a new \\"baby\\" into the family with another cat's approval. How can I understand problems and overcome any potential problems. One idea is to put vanilla extract on each cats nose, that seemed to work very well the last time.<br /><br />Steve Duno has authored 11 books and is an animal behaviorist and freelance writer. He has also written: No Kitty! and Show Biz Tricks for Cats. He is well qualified to write about \\"The Fabulous Feline,\\" \\"Cat Basics,\\" \\"Problems in Paradise\\" and \\"The Wilder World of Cats.\\"<br /><br />Part One discusses why cats are so popular and gives the fundamentals of feline physiology and psychology, breed information, how to choose a cat and how to establish a good feline perspective and know what cat aficionados are talking about.<br /><br />Part Two shows you how to feed, groom and keep your new kitty happy and well adjusted. The \\"Cat Basics\\" section was especially of interest to me as I learned how to bring a new cat home and keep things calm.<br /><br />\\"A good way to help ease the cat or kitten into the home is to offer it a treat or two. Doing so will make a great first impression.\\" -pg. 99<br /><br />\\"Cat Meets Cat\\" on pg. 105 tells how to keep the cat in a separate room with the door closed for at least a day or two. That way, the resident cat will know a new animal is in the house, but will not be able to confront it directly. Giving the new cat items with the old cats scent on them was also an excellent idea!<br /><br />Part Three introduced you to preventive care and gives a complete primer on the most common cat maladies and their treatments. There is a short discussion on how to deal with the passing of a beloved pet which was very helpful for me as I lost my older cat on Friday the 13th. I have since been rather worried about our \\"little\\" cat who seems to be grieving and seemed to be a bit depressed. Their advice was not to immediately go out and get a new cat. They advise taking some time off. That is very good advice.<br /><br />Part Four delves into Cat Breeding and the Wider World of Cats. You will be intrigued with how you can teach your cat new tricks. Our cat learned to fetch like a dog. Really! The top of a milk bottle (the jug variety) is very entertaining for a cat. You can throw it and teach them to bring it back to you. This takes a bit of time, but once they learn...it is very amusing. The section on \\"teaching your cat to come when called\\" can really be true. You can develop a bond between you and your pet and also train a cat to act a bit like a dog. This book will teach you how.<br /><br />One of the unique features (that I adore) is the Web site address information blocks throughout the book. You will also see icons and trivia or definition boxes to give you fun facts or the definition of an unfamiliar word. The colorful headings, cartoons and adorable cat pictures make this book a joy to read.<br /><br />An Essential Guide to Cat Care, I would not want to be without.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewtments.

The answer is simply: Yes.<br /><br />Do you remember your first rejection letter from a publisher? Do you remember the second, third and fourth? I sure do! However, I threw them all away a long time ago and decided to get on with my life and self-publish.<br /><br />Sometimes the walls built around traditional publishing houses are just not worth trying to climb over. Especially when the walls are covered with thorny climbing rose bushes, ouch! When your book is like your true love, you really can get your heart broken when an editor rejects your manuscript. If they do write and say they actually looked at it, do throw a party! ;><br /><br />The freedom you have when you make the decision to just publish your book yourself is beyond description. Finally, you have control over how your book will look and what it will contain. You get to decide! With all this \\"power\\" you need all the information you can get so you can make all those important decisions. There are only two books you need and this is one of them!<br /><br />I once attended a class on the \\"inside story of publishing\\" and after asking one question and getting the cold shoulder (for my obvious naivety at the time), I conveniently forgot to attend the second class. Now, if Penny C. Sansevieri had been the teacher, I would have made it to the second class! She actually does offer \\"Get Published Today\\" workshops through The Learning Annex and has been featured on talk radio. She is a feature writer for Readers & Writers Magazine.<br /><br />Her writing is entertaining in that you hardly feel it is an effort to read her book. Once I started reading, I could not put this book down. She feeds your desire to live to see the day you get published. She offers tantalizing tidbits of information we are all craving, but have no idea where to find. Penny also serves up a wonderful sense of humor in her writing. She has \\"been there!\\" Through her encounters with other writers, she has also learned from their experiences.<br /><br />The first section introduces you to the possibilities. What are your dreams? Are you ready to be an author and what will that mean? By the third chapter you will start to see the beauty and originality this book contains. First, each publisher featured was chosen after meeting a set of standards the author felt were essential. The online publisher had to have your best interests at heart. Each publisher is explored in detail and you will know what they offer and why. There are charts showing the package prices, distribution outlets, retail book prices, your rights, royalties, author discounts, hard/soft cover book options and the cancellation policy. This author did her research!<br /><br />What does it take to produce a successful press release?<br />What is a media kit?<br />How do I get my book sold in a Book Club or a Catalog?<br />Where do I go to get my book reviewed?<br />How can I get the media to notice my book?<br /><br />Should I consider Niche Marketing?<br /><br />Throughout the book you will find answers to your questions, inspirational quotes, marketing tips and notes from authors. The pages of addresses, names and e-mail addresses is information you can really put to work.<br /><br />While Penny advises you to start working on your Web site after your book is in production, may I say that you might want to start working on it now! Having a Web site ready to take orders the day your book is published sounds like a good plan to me and so that is where I have started! By having a Web site, people will start finding you and last week I was invited to co-host a radio show just because the host found my site! I asked her if I could learn how to breath again and then get back to her. ;> It was quite a shock to have such a request even before I have my book published.<br /><br />If you are tired of trying to climb over the walls into the publishing fortress, you might be better off building your own castle. ;> Dare to dream! And when you do finish your castle, make sure you wave at the editor in the publishing fortress who rejected your manuscript. lol Wait, no...send them a fresh copy instead. You never know, they might see the beauty after you have done all the work to get it published. It has happened!<br /><br />\\"We are the trendsetters for the future.

While children may not have a hard time reading this book, I did...so, it is not for parents to read to their children if you have trouble with a very small font. That way my only disappointment. The size of the actual book is very convenient and would be easy for a child to hold. The font is smaller then most adult Bibles.<br /><br />The illustrations are wonderful, the stories inspirational and retold in language that is clear and yet retains the original \\"poetry\\" of the Bible.<br /><br />\\"So it is that we must make the most of what God gives us, and then we will be prepared to enter the kingdom of Heaven.\\" -pg. 255, The Parable of the Talents<br /><br />An index and a listing of \\"who's who\\" makes this more useful as a text. There are quotations from the King James Version sprinkled through the book. Color photographs of animals, plants and people puts the stories into context. All the pictures are explained, making reading this particular Bible a complete learning experience.<br /><br />The stories are retold by Selina Hastings and an Introduction to the Bible explains that the Bible is a collection of books written by different people. Eric Thomas has even illustrated the Contents section. His artwork complements the style of Selina's writing.<br /><br />Children love the stories of the Bible and I remember my first children's Bible very well. A belief in God is very comforting through life and a Children's Bible helps children to understand who God is and will increase their love for others.<br /><br />Through my own studies as a child, I learned that God does love us, even when it seems he is nowhere to be found. The trust I have in God and my belief stems from learning about God and understanding his purpose in my life at an early age.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-09-13

World Religions gives insights into the world's main religions and offers a deeper appreciation for the belief you have chosen as your own.<br /><br />Through the pages, the author looks at the beliefs and practices of many different religions from the ancient Egyptians to the faiths practiced today.<br /><br />I have so enjoyed John Bowker's books and he has given me so insights into the religions of the world. He was the dean of Trinity College, Cambridge from 1984 to 1991. He is the author of many books, including The Meanings of Death and The Complete Bible Handbook.<br /><br />With the knowledge presented, you can learn about the central leaders and their teachings, examine the similarities and differences and discover the main beliefs behind each faith.<br /><br />The chapters include:<br /><br />What is Religion? - An explanation of what it means to be religious.<br /><br />Ancient Religions - Why have most cultures had a religion?<br /><br />Hinduism<br />Jainism<br />Buddhism<br />Sikhism<br />Chinese Religions<br />Japanese Religions<br />Judaism<br />Christianity<br />Islam<br />Native Religions<br /><br />The Golden Rule - How this rule exists in all religions in some form or the other.<br /><br />Religious Timeline and Maps - Six pages, one with a very helpful timeline that shows when the religion came to be and how it evolved over time.<br /><br />Further Reading - A page of books organized according to the religion they explain.<br /><br />\\"What you do not want done to you, do not do to others.\\" -Confucius, is found in every religion in some form or the other!<br /><br />The belief in a higher power is found in every culture and seems almost essential to our existence. Why do we \\"want\\" to believe in a God? Why do we choose one religion over the other? Here you can explore your choice and see the choices of others.<br /><br />A beautiful journey.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-09-13

Julie Downing discovered her desire to illustrate children's books when she was studying at The Rhode Island School of Design. Her characters have believable personalities and the page of art on the first page of The Little Mermaid is ethereal.<br /><br />Mary Hoffman has written more than 70 books for children and has great powers of observation to bring humor to all her stories and retellings. She lives in Oxfordshire, England, and has three daughters who were brought up on a healthy diet of myths and legends of which she and her husband have a extensive collection. Her goal in writing this book was to chose the best-loved and most well-known fairy tales from European tradition.<br /><br />The stories in this collection strive to show the consequences of greed, pride and vanity. They also tell how love comes from a kind heart. These are the stories you will remember forever because they are so classic. They also teach that good is rewarded and selfishness is punished. Storytelling has played a role in developing character in children for a long, long time.

The way when you add water it gets so well, difficult to stir. So, why does it do this?<br /><br />Aha...so, cornstarch never really dissolves and that is why it forms tiny solid pieces suspended in the water. That is called a colloid. The harder you press them, the firmer they feel, but when you leave them alone..they drip. When mixing cornstarch in water, you will find this to be SO true. However, if you add enough water, you win. ;><br /><br />So what fun will the kids be having?<br /><br />Captain Cook - Eggs science (making meringues), Making Butter<br />Manic Mixtures - Cornstarch fun...lots of messy \\"goo\\"<br />Double Bubble Trouble - Making huge bubbles<br />Tower of Strength - Sugar Cement<br />Moldy Stuff - Yup..Mold!<br />Sour Power - Lemons as natural batteries<br />Fizzical Reactions - Volcanic eruptions..watch out kitchen!<br />Acid Tests - Get the kids to enjoy cleaning the silver...too funny.<br />Sinking Feeling - An explanation of lava lamps<br />Chopping Mad - Coloring celery, etc.<br />On the Move - Making a water wheel<br />Hot and Cold - Making Ice cream, hey finally something you can really eat!<br />Farming Crystals - Crystals from salts<br />Wet, Wet, Wet - Steam, liquid, ice<br />Under Pressure - Siphoning, etc.<br />Creating Currents - Electric charges, balloons<br />Hard and Soft - Boiling eggs, melting chocolate, toasting bread<br />Light Fantastic - Make a fake rainbow<br />Making Sense - Five senses, picture of what we taste: bitter, sweet, sour, salty<br />Seeing Sound - Sound waves and making your own drum<br />Hearing Things - Make some fun earphones<br /><br />Each experiment has a bold heading, followed by plenty of pictures. The ingredients<br />are not listed in order, but are listed in the instructions. I would have liked to see them listed, but there are quite a few experiments on each page, so you can pick one. Most don't have that many ingredients and more than likely, you will have the ingredients<br />for these recipes or can easily obtain them at the grocery store.<br /><br />You might want to keep this book in the kitchen so kids can play while you are cooking, soon they will want to be in the kitchen more when they find out how much fun it really is to \\"play\\" in the kitchen.

After hours spent online and reading, my shoulders sure could use a good massage, so...do you think I can maybe leave this book about the house...like maybe right on the couch so my husband will get the hint. ;><br /><br />There is nothing like a good massage...absolutely nothing so relaxing I have ever experienced. It is like entering a magical place that helps you just drift away to soothing completeness. Like you have returned to the safety of the womb. When \\"aromatherapy\\" is introduced into the process...you relax even more.<br /><br />In America, people seem so busy and only in the last few years did I find out about massage. After a car accident that left me in pain, I started a journey into recovery under the guidance of a great massage practitioner.<br /><br />Massage is an ancient practice that is just re-entering our awareness. Modern research is now actually confirming the power of touch and massage.<br /><br />In this book, Clare Maxwell-Hudson tries to integrate many of the techniques she has discovered over the years. She has researched massage through the ages in the library of the British Museum and then she was able to travel in America, Afghanistan, New Zealand,. Zanzibar, Turkey, Hungary and Thailand. There she learned everything she could. She explains the \\"mesmeric stokes\\" just above the body...that to me, make me feel as if I am floating off the massage table.<br /><br />Areas covered include:<br /><br />Preparing to Massage<br />Learning to Massage<br />Hand Exercises<br />Choosing & Blending Oils<br /><br />A Gallery of Strokes: stroking, crossing, kneading, pressures, percussion, vibrations.<br />Self-Massage<br /><br />Massage Master Classes: Swedish, On-site, manual Lymphatic Drainage, Chinese, Indian, Thai, Eastern Head Massage, Shiatsu, Reflexology, Sarawak, Turkish Baths Massage, Moroccan Massage<br /><br />Massage to Beautify: Natural Face Lift, Anit-Cellulite, Hydrotherapy<br /><br />Pregnancy, Babies & Children: Massage for Pregnancy, During Labor, After Childbirth, Baby Massage, Massage for Children<br /><br />Massage for Health: Sports, Cramps, Aching Feet, Sprains, Strains, Stress, Insomnia, Headaches, Abdominal Complaints, Back Pain, Joint Conditions, Massage & the Elderly, Massage & Illness, Massage in a Hospital, The Anatomy.<br /><br />An incredible amount of research is evidenced by the \\"Research & Bibliography.\\" It is just amazing how much information is packed into one book! A handy Index also guides you to your main interests. There are full-color discreet pictures throughout to show you exactly how to give a massage. This is a really \\"personal\\" book as I am pretty sure Clare Maxwell-Hudson is pictured giving all the massages throughout the book.<br /><br />I found this at her site: \\"Clare-Maxwell-Hudson is considered to be the most interesting and practical authority and writer on massage alive today and has achieved international recognition for her contribution to the health sciences.\\"<br /><br />You might also enjoy: The Ultimate Illustrated Guide to Massage, The Natural Beauty Book, The Aromatherapy Massage Book, Massage and the Original Swedish Movements.<br /><br />If everyone gave and received a massage a day......the world \\"might\\" know peace!<br />Who knows. ;> I think we would all be at least healthier. There are treatments for over 30 ailments in this book. Now...who ever thought of a Turkish Massage with Soap Suds, that was sort of funny!<br /><br />\\"Let me travel the world to its very end, to many lands, that I might find someone who can soothe and revive me with their hands.\\" -Ibn Batuta, Arabian traveler in the 14th Century<br /><br />You will also enjoy the quotes sprinkled here and there. All the massage steps are numbered and are adjacent to the pictures.<br /><br />Massage is relaxing for the giver and the receiver. I highly recommend the Kama Sutra massage oils, found in drugstores these days. Also look for Sweet Almond oil and you can mix in essential oils. The Kama Sutra \\"pleasure garden\\" is so exotic! There is a gift set of about 5 oils that you just MUST find! You might find them by doing a search here at Amazon, because once I found them at a Z-shop.<br /><br />Music Recommendations:<br /><br />Steven Halpern CD's - as many as you can afford! ;><br /><br />Setting: Include candles and maybe a mini-desk fountain.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewmazon, because once I found them at a Z-shop.

Denis Diderot said that freedom has no meaning. Jean-Jacques Rousseau said that man was born free and everywhere he is in chains. He also believed man was naturally good. Immanuel Kant seems to disagree and says that out of the crooked timber of humanity no straight thing can ever be made.<br /><br />When people start to talk like this, they are beginning to think philosophically. They embark on a journey of thought that opens the mind and allows us to see the mind of another. You will find a soul mate philosopher within the pages for sure. How you think could in fact be linked to the thoughts of a philosopher whose views are presented here.<br /><br />\\"Philosophy begins in wonder.\\" -Plato<br /><br />The Story of Philosophy will entice your mind into reading the entire work! Not, however in one sitting, but as the need arises. First, I wanted to see if I would actually use this book in discussions...and sure enough, within a few days I had already discussed humanism at a discussion board. It was helpful to know how humanism has evolved from the philosophy of Epicurus. As in: \\"Is he (God) willing to prevent evil, but not able?\\" or \\"Is he both able and willing?\\" .....then \\"Whence then is evil?\\" They note that the to us now, Epicureanism is very similar to the liberal humanism of the 20th century.<br /><br />Art is a highlight of Bryan Magee's work and spaces out some rather deep concepts. This is not light reading, but rather aimed towards those willing to spend the time to discover the record of philosophy through the ages.<br /><br />First The Greeks and their World chapter presents the views of Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, The Cynics, The Sceptics, The Epicureans and The Stoics. Christianity and Philosophy is followed by a chapter on The Beginnings of Modern Science.<br /><br />The thoughts of Isaac Newton, Machiavelli, Francis Bacon, Saint Augustine, Boethius, Thomas Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Burke, Voltaire, Diderot, Rousseau, Kant, Schopenhauer, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, Rusell and Bergson and others....are found in this work.<br /><br />Quotes are sprinkled throughout and many of the pictures have an information block to explain how they relate to the discussion.<br /><br />A fascinating look at how we have evolved as thinkers. As I always have said: When you find truth, you will know it for what it is. This work contains truth AND ideas that are false. It is for you to decide what you will believe! ;><br /><br />Professor Bryan Magee was educated at Oxford University, England. he took a degree in History and Philosophy. he left his academic life to become an independent writer, critic and broadcaster. He has also authored: Confessions of a Philosopher, Men of Ideas and The Great Philosophers.<br /><br />You might also enjoy: The story of Christianity by Michael Collins & Matthew A.

A unique list of illustrations is followed by \\"At First Brush,\\" which helps you to dive right in to subjects such as: Spelling and punctuation, organization and dating (A list of plays and dates, with revision noted).<br /><br />The second section is called: The Quotable and the Notable. This area is a larger section devoted to famous phrases. Each phrase is followed by a small paragraph to give explanations and background for say...how Shakespeare wanted the actor to express the phrases. These sections are filled with tidbits worth reading and also help to \\"set the stage\\" or point to where the phrase is used in the play.<br /><br />\\"King Lear has cut a deal with the two more flattering of his three daughters: he will turn power over to them as long as he can keep the name and respect due to a king......\\" pg. 131<br /><br />\\"How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is<br />To have a thankless child!\\" then makes more<br />sense after we understand that his \\"snakelike daughters<br />represent a quality he feels all women possess.\\"<br /><br />The section on Household Words explains common and uncommon words coined by Shakespeare. Here the author lists a partial list of words for which Shakespeare is said to be the first authority according to the Oxford English Dictionary. \\"well-read\\" is in this list. ;><br /><br />Faux Shakespeare is a list of phrases often misattributed to Shakespeare. So, who really said: \\"Fool's Paradise?\\" It is interesting how \\"I wold not be in a flis paradyce.\\" turns up in Love's Labor's Lost and Romeo and Juliet.<br /><br />Good Enough to Call Your Own is a list of titles borrowed from Shakespeare and many a catchy phrase has turned into a title.<br /><br />An Index of Words and Phrases and an Index of Characters by Play will make it easy to find phrases and set them in their original context.<br /><br />Another favorite: Shakespeare's Insults by Wayne F.

P.B Bears World of Words is a first word book, an activity book and a story book. The \\"story\\" is divided into 10 chapters. They include: Getting Dressed, In the Bathroom, In the Playroom, In the Backyard, In the Countryside, At the Seashore, In the Town, At the Playground, In the Kitchen and At Bedtime.<br /><br />Each picture is packed with details, activity questions can be used as a starting point for using the pictures as a leaning experience. Children will also develop their observations skills and will enjoy matching objects in the borders to those in the main pictures. This book almost reminds me of a story someone told me as a child where you knocked on a door and when it opened the room was filled with everything imaginable.<br /><br />Each double page spread is filled with items in a border and then in the middle, a picture of P.B. Bear in a fun scene. The first scene shows P.B. Bear in the middle of a room and he has to decide what color clothes he is going to wear. An umbrella is in the border, but there is also one on the floor in the main scene. \\"I have an idea for an adventure,\\" says P.B. Bear. \\"But I've got a lot to do first.\\" He then goes into the bathroom and brushes his teeth. \\"How many different brushes can you see?\\" This page will teach counting.<br /><br />P.B Bear continues to tell the story of what he will do next, moving into the playroom to find a hot air type balloon. he then goes out to the backyard and we see birds, butterflies, lettuce, daffodils and ants. As the balloon drifts above the countryside, a scene of animals and farm houses appears. The balloon travels towards the seashore and happens to land at the beach. There, P.B. Bear and his friends try to match up shapes with items at the seashore.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they have to leave the beach and head for the bustling street in the city.

However, on a second look I could see the benefit of grouping items together and putting many items on one page. You can teach many items that relate to other items you will find in your home or in the world as you travel.<br /><br />This is a visual journey for children that includes 800 brilliantly colorful pictures. Even the inside covers are \\"covered\\" with pictures. For the young child, you can start with the familiar items around the home like a lamp, a vase, a telephone, bed, toothpaste and highchair.<br /><br />The section on clothes teaches all the basics...then onto the toys. That will most likely be one of the favorite areas in this book. Cooking and baking might encourage more adventure in the kitchen. Maybe using this book to introduce a child to the names of kitchen essentials will get them interested in making something delicious.<br /><br />Other sections include: Food to eat, Fruit, vegetables, In the workshop, Flowers and plants, Weather, and Seasons and times. Then onto: On the farm, In the countryside (love the meadow picture!), Big Animals, Small animals, Baby animals, Birds. The theme changes constantly and next you will see hot-air balloons and everything that flies in the sky.<br /><br />Children who live in the city will love: In the sea, At the seaside, Noises, Animal noises (you have to love the mouse on this page!). Children in the country will love: In the city, Buildings, Building machines, Shopping (yummy markets and bookstores). In the jobs people do, children are dressed up in each of the main job descriptions.<br /><br />\\"Me and My Body\\" is a section to explain the names of the mouth, back, eyelashes, teeth..etc. Things we do such as crying, touching, eating, throwing a ball, hiding, laughing are all pictured with the word of the activity. Shapes and patters lists the main shapes at the top of the page and then you can find the patterns and shapes in what you see in the pictures.<br /><br />For instance, the red square looks like the windows and the star looks like the starfish. The counting section is especially tasty with all sorts of candies to count.<br /><br />Then, the next page opens and you see hills, deserts, a waterfall, a river, a volcano and much more. Each word has a picture and each picture is a delightful look at the world around us. To easily find a word your child is learning...just use the handy index to look up words like store, toothbrush, jaguar, cyclist or even beach.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review, the red square looks like the windows and the star looks like the starfish.

My first question is: \\"How does Barbie stay so skinny eating all this delicious food?\\" On the other hand, who cares...just pass me the brownies. Can I say, Barbie does look cute in an apron as well. Children love to learn how to cook. It is only when we get to be adults that we find out it is a bit of work. Not too much, but it does take more effort and your mom and dad are not there to pick up after you. I just hate that!!!!<br /><br />So, what is Barbie cooking? You will find recipes for all her favorite foods. Simple step-by-step photographs show you how to make fruity freezies. They are great for the summer and you could make them now. This is a really fun cookbook even a \\"girl-at-heart woman\\" can enjoy. Remember making those chocolate cakes and eating them as fast as you made them in your \\"light bulb\\" based oven? Well, here you are using a real oven and kids sure have grown up!<br /><br />I would advise adult supervision around the stove, but my mother let me start cooking at a very early age. I am sure she was nearby, but I was so intrigued with cooking...I just remember my poor dad scrubbing burnt pans...(Until I learned how to watch what I was doing and not leave things on the stove while I was outside playing. Hey, I was only 7) The recipes include: A Fruity Feast, Sunshine Breakfast, Mini Muffins, Sandwich Stacks, Aprinana Cake, Chocolate Cookies, Fuity Freezies, Lemon Cooler, Super Shakes, Rainbow Fruit Snack Sticks, Cute Cookies (and they are cute!), Birthday Cakes complete with butterflies (Martha would be proud of Barbie), Chocolate Dipped Fruit, Mini Pizzas, Burger Bites, Dippy Chicken (Thai Chicken with peanut dip), Perfect Pasta with tomato sauce, Stuffed Baked Potatoes, Nacho Nibbles, Super Sundaes, Brownies and Two Minute Treats (popcorn, banana sandwiches, salad, celery with fillings, apple boats with cheese sails).<br /><br />Barbies appear on each recipe and tell you why you \\"just must\\" try their recipes. \\"Here are two ideas for a fabulously fruity brunchtime treat.\\" says Barbie. She then gives pictures of all the ingredients with their names and then shows step-by-step phographs of a real kid helping her cook.

I would much rather have someone else give the presentation, to be quite honest. So, I am giving this book to my husband. I thought the information in the book was practical and it enourages preparation. There is a section on how to reduce your fears of speaking in public.<br />Knowing your audience, dealing with logistics, knowing your location, clarifying objectives, finding material, structuring material, writing a presentation, using audio-visual aids, rehearsing, preparing yourself and enhancing your body image are all good points. The avoiding bad habits section was especially good. I mean, if you stand in front of the baord, who can see it? If you slouch, it looks unprofessional.<br />It all sounds so complicated...can't we just all head for the beach. ;&gt; But seriously, this is a fun book filled with basic information for those who have to make presentations to keep others informed about business decisions.	2001-08-25

The next time we went to the park, flowers had grown everywhere. My niece was overjoyed and kept saying her wish had come true. Finally she told me she had wished that the next time she visited the park, the entire park would be filled with flowers.<br /><br />Sam and Jo have a field they play in, yet today they can't think of any more fun games to play. In The Dandelion Wish, dandelions fill an entire field as Sam and Jo whisper a secret wish as they try to blow all the dandelion seeds in one breath.<br /><br />Each illustrated page is filled with dandelion seeds in the most creative way. \\"My granny says you can make a wish if you blow all the seeds in one breath.\\" -Sam \\"But do wishes come true?\\" -Jo After making their wish, they run to the gate and see balloons and a grand parade.<br /><br />It seems a circus has come to town. Sam and Jo just know their wish has come true and get to see a puppet show, eat popcorn, soar in a silver spaceship and bounce on a trampoline. As their parents carry them home under the summer moon, you see a crocodile creeping down the lane following the pirate ship.<br /><br />Early the next day they run to the dandelion field expecting the carnival to still be there, but it is gone. \\"Just then a breeze danced over the field....\\" The children hurry to make a wish because a dandelion wish will always come true.<br /><br />Joan Cockcroft has also illustrated The Little Sea pony by Helen Cresswell and A Flag for Grandma by Sally Grindley. Sandra Ann Horn's first book was Tattybogle and she is also the author of: Kofi and the Butterflies.<br /><br />Children will be fascinated by the possibility of their own wishes coming true.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-08-25

As a teenager I was intrigued by these types of books. This is a similar book and I would recommend it to teenagers who are leaning about body care and skin-care regimens. Mary Quant has created a step-by-step photographic journey to show how to apply all the essentials and make the most of natural features. There are self-analysis charts, detailed questionnaires (to identify skin type, face shape, and coloring), and paint-box palettes of eye shadows, lip colors and nail polishes.<br /><br />A gallery of looks is presented from the natural everyday look to glowing evening glamour. You might even find some wonderful hairstyle ideas while learning about makeup. Active Aqua was intriguing since I never think about wearing makeup when swimming. Understanding your skin is a section to determine skin type. The characteristics of different skin types is essential to determine which beauty products you will buy. I can recommend the Onzedirect.com products because they are the best basic products I have ever used and seem to keep my skin the most clear. They have a unique hair mud mask, a face mud mask and a peeling mask I totally love.<br /><br />They don't really mention brands but give an overview of the types of products to use. I can also recommend Proactiv cleansing scrub and daily oil control for teenage and adult skin. Darcy (drying lotion) products also are wonderful for teenage and oily-prone adult skin as they have sulphur masks, etc. They recommend a medicated liquid cleanser but don't give the product names. While some say to stay with one brand, eventually you learn what your skin likes best and you stick with the products.<br /><br />A section on how to analyze your face shape is helpful for learning how to apply makeup effectively. If you look in a mirror and take lipstick and outline your face as you see it in the mirror, that is helpful. This book is geared for all races, so no matter what your skin color, you will find ideas.<br /><br />The section on skin care helps to prepare the \\"canvas\\" so to speak and you can learn how to steam your face and use some fresh herbs in the water so you can also get in a touch of aromatherapy. You can then learn to give yourself a facial massage.<br /><br />The actual makeup lessons are easy to follow. First you decide which foundation type you want to use. Then you learn how to conceal undereye circles or correct blotchiness with green base. Applying blush can be a bit tricky....blend, blend....blend. Shading and Highlighting adds a whole new dimension to your look. You can lift your cheekbones or soften a heavy jaw. Applying Eyeshadow teaches the basics of eye foundation (I never remember to use) and then how to apply shadows with all the special brushes.<br /><br />Achieving the look is a fun way to see what you want your eyes to look like before applying the eyeshadows. Then onto lips. Can I say something? Burt Bees lip balm. It is the best thing I have ever found and works even in very dry climates. They also have Baby products you will want to use for yourself as they all smell like honey scented with flowers! Starting with just some basic cosmetics and then adding to your collection is good advice. Buy one lipstick and try it out first. You might be allergic to it and it might make your lips peel, etc.<br /><br />Then, onto nails, If you have not discovered Nailtiques yet, you must try the formula for your nails. It is a coat of protein and I use it as a nail base. Estee Lauder nail polish is the best I have found, but if you find something that will \\"really\\" last a week...do write me. One of the best places to find makeup base is at your local \\"Acne\\" clinic. See what they have in regards to custom makeup they can blend to your exact skin tone. It also won't clog your pores! Very important. If you can find it...look for silk face powder.... What they don't really mention is that makeup can get old and you do have to toss it. So, Great Lash by Maybelline is a good choice and isnot too expensive. Their eyeshadows also come in Expert Eye kits that have 8 colors each. They are fun because you can really play with all the shading.<br /><br />The body-care program chapter will make you want to check into a spa. There is nothing like a good body scrub (they show how to slough off dull surface cells) or massage. Issues like exercise, relaxation techniques, diet and sun protection give a good basis for body care.<br /><br />~The Rebecca ReviewExpert Eye kits that have 8 colors each.

The focus of ice skating today is definately more for entertainment, however natural ice rinks form in countries with exceptionally cold winter weather and you can skate outdoors for exercise.<br /><br />In Toronto and Canada, large areas are flooded during the winter months to make rinks and skating is one of the most popular sports in Canada now. Some of the first World Championships were held in outdoor rinks and for me, ice skating outdoors is ideal. I dream of skating down a frozen lake and did skate as a child on a frozen lake once.<br /><br />My holiday dreams for the winter are now focusing on a place with an outdoor rink. I say all this to say: Introducing a child to ice skating can give them much pleasure later in life. My parents would drop my brother and I off at the ice rink and we never wanted to leave. My brother taught me to skate backwards which I was very proud of!<br /><br />This is a sport the whole family can enjoy if parents can find the time to take their children for this fun activity. In this wonderful introduction to skating, children will learn what they will need to be comfortable and warm. I didn't realize an ice-dance blade was different from a free-skating blade. Now, that is information I could have used as a child.<br /><br />A Warming up section shows children how to stretch to prevent injuries. If you remember your first steps onto the ice, the next section will be very valuable. What happens if your child falls in the middle of the ice rink? If no one is nearby...the picture they show is fine, but if skaters are whizzing by...I would tell children to keep their fingers folded in as they try to get back up. Sometimes you can get knocked back over just as you are getting up, has happened. ;><br /><br />This section shows children how to step out onto the ice, how to fall safely, do dips and how to scull. Skating forwards is the basics, but they go into Crossovers, the snowplow, stopping by using a T-stop and a hockey stop. Skating backwards and not falling is exhilirating!<br /><br />The step-by-step intructions are all illustrated by real skaters. How to place your weight and on what leg is very important for balance. Did you know that edges are the foundation of ice skating? This is what allows skaters to skate curves and circles. Once the forward and backward skating has been mastered, you can move on to turns and then to jumping on ice. I would recommend ice skating classes for sure, however this book will allow the skater to read all about what they are learning in class. It seems to me it would be difficult to learn to do jumps from a book and I don't recommend it.<br /><br />They do say: \\"Seek professional coaching before you attempt any of the moves.\\" A glossary gives insight into the language of ice skating. You can look up a sit spin or a waltz hold or even a bunny hop. All I have to say is...why am I here writing a review when I could be skating. ;> I have my eye on a 3-way convertible skate by Hypno (Fila Manufacturer) that has ice blades, inline skates and a boot that detaches. It looks perfect for outdoor sports when you want to put on your shoes and then go outside. You just snap on the wheels or ice blades. If anyone has them, write me and tell me if they are comfortable.<br /><br />Enjoy this book, it is so informative and will really get you or your children out on the ice! There is nothing cuter than \\"mini-skaters\\" with their parents out on the ice. My dad used to skate with us as children. I do miss all those fun times, but that must be why we have children so we can relive our own childhood through the eyes of a child.

Some people I have met online say there is really no need for parents to read up on childcare...but I disagree. From the moment a child is born, they are learning. As a parent, you become their teacher, playmate and counselor. From the very start you need...information...information...and more...information.<br /><br />This is a practical guide to help parents of babies and young children understand and develop their child's unique abilities. Dr. Stopppard explains how children achieve each milestone and includes a stage-by-stage guide for parents. You will find ideas for games, activities and play that will help parents to be their child's first teacher.<br /><br />The homemade fun section looked especially fun with clay, soap bubbles, modeling dough, finger pain, pasta jewelry, vegetable printers, rainy day beach , edible finger pain for babies, baby play dough and more.<br /><br />The seven sections include:<br /><br />Parent as Teacher (Skills that encourage learning, rearing helpful children, using discipline positively, communicating successfully with your child)<br /><br />The Normal Course of Development (Understanding the stages, charting development, mental development, locomotion, sociability, personality, speech)<br /><br />Factors Affecting Development (health, happiness, parental attitudes, gender, personality, empathy, vulnerability, stress), Simple Tests (taste, hearing, verbal skills, intelligence, observation, perception, vision)<br /><br />Tools for Learning (providing a stimulating environment, choosing toys, using household items to make toys, home-made fun, the computer, television and video, books and reading, toys for various ages up to 7 years)<br /><br />The Special Child (The gifted child, under-achieving child, autistic child, child who stutters, child with learning disorder, sight-impaired child, physically disabled child)<br /><br />Your Child and School (Choosing a nursery, starting Primary School, The changing relationship between you and your child)<br /><br />The special chapter on Locomotion is very interesting. You can see what a child should be doing by a certain age and what you can do to help. Some of these ideas will come naturally to parents, but others were new ideas I had not yet seen. The handy index makes this book easy to use and you can look up age groups very easily.<br /><br />I love the colorful illustrations and easy-to-find age groups.

I used this dictionary to look up a word on about the third day I owned it. I was delightfully surprised to find pictures! There are over 4,500 color images to give instant visual definitions and they help to bring unfamiliar items to life and they add a deeper understanding of the words.<br /><br />600 illustrated feature panels also provide in-depth information on topics such as: technology, natural history, art and music. There are also hundreds of new words and phrases from voice mail to sport utility vehicle which gives an up-to-date appeal to this book.<br /><br />This might just be the most authoritative and accessible illustrated dictionary of American English available today. With 187,000 definitions and entries and an easy-to-use thumb index...it is the only dictionary I will be using at home when I don't want to go look up a word online.<br /><br />This work represents the collaboration between DK and Oxford. Oxford has published dictionaries for over 150 years. DK is well known for their visually stunning books.<br /><br />The pictures really help to give your eyes a break from an overwhelming number of words and definitions. I especially liked the picture of the ocelot on page 565. On page 132 they have listed many of the main cat breeds with pictures.<br /><br />I could not resist looking up: condescending...to see if it really didn't say what it meant. Only because the reviewer before me said it seemed to convey a different meaning. I guess maybe they only read Condescend. You decide after reading the definition....<br /><br />Condescend: Behave as if one is on equal terms with (an inferior), while maintaining an attitude of superiority. or Condescending: Patronizing.<br /><br />The Reference Section includes a Political Map of the World, A Physical map of the World, Countries of the World and their flags, The Night Sky, Measurements, the Periodic Table, Time Periods, Wedding Anniversaries, Birthstones, Time Zones, States of the US, Presidents of the US, Books of the Bible, The Living World (classification system), The Animal Kingdom (classification of the animal kingdom) and a section on Grammar and Style.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewication system), The Animal Kingdom (classification of the animal kingdom) and a section on Grammar and Style.     ~The Rebecca Review	2001-08-22

The rhyming split pages helped her recognize new words simply by changing a single letter as she turned each page. They then wrote Jen the Hen, Mig the Pig, Tog the Dog and Zug the Bug.<br />These stories are filled with rhyming humor and have been compared to Dr. Seuss, which is why I think I like them so much. For the first time, the five books have been brought together in a &quot;starter pack&quot; so your child can start on their road to reading.<br />The books are really hilarious and will make your children laugh out loud. Pat the Cat is my absolute favorite. He says: &quot;Every cat should wear a hat.&quot; on the cover and then you open the book and find the last page has his picture and the word PAT. Then on all the shorter pages, you have c, f, m, h, b, r, s and n and line up with the AT so each page makes a different word as in cat, fat, mat, hat, bat, rat, sat, Nat.<br />The story is silly and starts with: &quot;Do you know Pat the cat? Your child can then sound out the word C-A-T. Turn the page and you will find a very fat cat saying: &quot;Fat, I'm not Fat!&quot; Two little caterpillars comment on everything on each page.<br />All sorts or animals including Nat the Rat and Tat the Bat climb into his hat. Then Pat tries to get into his hat and the caterpillars have something to say.<br />Jen the Hen teaches children how to send a letter to a friend. Mig the Pig likes to wear a bright wig and also eats &quot;fig&quot; pie. Tog the Dog likes to Jog and so he gets into all sorts of trouble on his run through the pages. Very creative!<br />Zug the Bug goes fishing with a dog names Pug and then they glug down milk from a jug. The slug is quite the character in this book and the two caterpillars are just hilarious.<br />This set will teach children that reading is fun and they will soon be asking to read more books.

I have never seen such a lavishly illustrated book on flower arranging. Over 2,000 photographs will inspire you to arrange your own flowers.<br /><br />There are hundreds of ideas for using fresh and dried flowers. The step-by-step sequences make the techniques clear and simple. When you start arranging flowers, you quickly find out you need an \\"essential kit\\" in order to complete even a basic flower arrangement. This is where \\"Practical Techniques\\" comes into play.<br /><br />You will want to buy a glue gun, floral wires, pruning knife, florist's scissors, etc. All the essential supplies are listed with pictures. This book is filled with pictures! The first chapter discusses Flowers In Civilization and shows flowers in history and art.<br /><br />Elements of Design is a visual guide to flower colors and the pages are filled with piles of wonderful petals in every color. I loved the Container Shapes section. There are two sections, with one further into the book.<br /><br />This book is SO INCREDIBLE! .....Shall I continue..?<br /><br />Then, we get to Inspiration. You will find page after page after page of mini-floral displays with the page number so you can learn how to make the arrangement with precise instructions. There are arrangements in this book you would not even imagine in your wildest floral dreams.<br /><br />For instance, on page 96 there is an underwater floral arrangement.

Then, OH MY..I happen upon page 212 and there is a hanging upside down Christmas Tree dangling dangerously from the ceiling. I am not sure I approve!

If a bear wanted to find out his/her family history, this would be the encyclopedia to buy. Being a teddy bear is still very in vogue. This is a fascinating way to find out why we love teddy bears and why they appeal to collectors all over the world.<br /><br />You can read about all the best-loved bears, from the original \\"teddy\\" to \\"Winnie-the-Pooh. The latest collectibles such as Beanie Bear and the Millennium Bears are also included. Pauline Cockril is the internationally recognized expert on the history of the teddy bear. She is also a regular contributor to Teddy Bear Times.<br /><br />If you see a teddy bear and instantly want to buy it...this book IS for you. Also look for The Ultimate Teddy Bear Book which is considered to be the bible of arctophily (bear collecting) and is used by collectors, dealers and toy shops around the world.<br /><br />The first bear listed was made in 1902 and was an experimental Steiff bear. The bears are listed all the way up to the year 2000. If you think you have seen it all...wait until you see the Pink Dino, a Swiss bear with characteristic elongated designs that I think looks more like a monkey. I much prefer the 1991 Pam Howells bear that has a lace collar, shaggy golden mohair plush \\"fur\\" and a cute hat trimmed with fabric roses. The Australian Teddy bear on pg. 137 looks somewhat like a koala bear for some reason. :)<br /><br />I know a place where a lady has bears sitting everywhere in her Bed & Breakfast. You just want to take one of the bears home with you. In each room, she also has a \\"resident\\" bear that sits on the fluffy down-comforter covered bed. The whole place is like one big teddy bear picnic. I bet she knows about this book!<br /><br />It is just unbearable not to own more bears. I must go shopping since I gave away most of my teddies when they had a teddy bear drive for kids. It was sad to say goodbye to some of them, but I know they are now happily living with a child who loves them. I do think it is time to start collecting again!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewbecca Review	2001-08-22

Her mother says she has to wait and see if she likes the class first and then they will think about buying new shoes.<br /><br />When her best friend finds a pair of silver shoes, Molly is a bit jealous.<br /><br />\\"Can I wear your silver shoes, Gran?\\" Molly always asked. Clickety-clakety went the heels as Molly danced. She felt just like a grown-up lady.<br /><br />Molly finds a pair of shoes just like her grandmother has and wears them from morning to night. When she asks her father for a pair of her own shoes, he tells her:<br /><br />\\"Special things you want very much often come at special times.\\"<br /><br />This almost made me cry, since my own father secretly bought me a bike one time and hid it for me until my birthday. I had NO idea, except I did wonder what the special tape was for. He decorated the bike for me to make it extra special. The only thing I missed was him walking me to school.<br /><br />Molly is equally excited when she gets her gift of silver shoes and then she feels like a real dancer. A cute story with a happy ending.<br /><br />I doubt there is a little girl who won't relate to the story. The expressions on the children's faces are so real!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-08-17

This inborn fascination with faces continues as we grow up and become fascinated with the face of the one we love.<br /><br />Brian Bates brings his experience in psychology and biology to this beautifully bound collection. He has taught imagination techniques for actors, including face and mask work and has directed plays at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London.<br /><br />This book is a journey of self-discovery. It explores the social and psychological aspects of the face. It is sometimes said, you never forget a face, but can forget a name. That has often been true for me. Why is it that I can remember a face so well?<br /><br />We all have seven universally recognized facial expression: anger, fear, happiness, sadness, disgust, surprise and contempt. But we can make up to 7,000 discrete expressions. This work explores beauty in the eye of the beholder versus a universal agreement on which faces are beautiful. The area of sexual attraction and the naked truth behind facial features is interesting for many reasons.<br /><br />On a bright yellow page the index lists origins, identity, expressions, beauty, vanity and fame. The pages are visually stunning. With colored pages and black writing contrasting with white pages and pictures. The pictures of two individuals from birth to middle age showed how we change over time.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the \\"Expressions\\" chapter. Lady Diana's Eyes told the tale of her life as she moved from innocence to unhappiness. Did you know that the natural smile and the \\"masking/fake smile\\" uses different muscles to produce a similar effect. I tried this and it is an interesting experiment. The natural smile seems to use more muscles and includes my eyes feeling more brightened. When I try to produce a fake smile, I feel my face is in fact not quite as alive.<br /><br />Then, onto what really matters: Kissing. ;~} A few pages on that and suddenly you turn the page and start to yawn...literally. Just the picture of a yawn is contagious. Why? I yawn again and find it difficult to look at the picture and not keep yawning! After yawning three times, I turn the page!<br /><br />The chapter on beauty includes many famous faces. Julia Roberts, Calista Flockhart, Sophia Loren...they can be found here smiling. This chapter also shows that people who are beautiful are not always happier than everyone else. There are some very revealing pictures of a woman, before and after plastic surgery!<br /><br />Vanity is a revealing chapter with a beautiful painting of the Greek myth of Narcissus, where a young man was so enamored with his own face, he falls in love with his own reflection.<br /><br />By the time you reach the last pages, you will know an incredible amount about the human face.

The Snow Queen is one of the longest tales and one of his best known. He would listen to folk and fairy tales as a child and when he grew up, he wrote some of these stories in his own words.<br /><br />Anderson began writing The Snow Queen on December 5, 1844 and it was published sixteen days later in book form! His fairy tales made him famous and the stories have been translated into more than 100 languages and some have been made into films, like the Little Mermaid.<br /><br />Nilesh Mistry is one of my favorite illustrators. He was born in Bombay and moved to London, England in 1975. His books include The Illustrated Book of Fairy Tales and Aladdin. I simply want to own every book he illustrates!<br /><br />In the story of The Snow Queen, you will find illustrations and photography that shows the settings of the original book. This classic is again brought to life, yet never so beautifully as with Nilesh Mistry's art. Kai is whirled away by the icily beautiful Snow Queen. His playmate Gerda sets out to find him and encounters many adventures in his quest. This is a story I remember very well, yet I had to imagine the pictures in my own mind as a child.<br /><br />In this book, she looks hauntingly similar to how I pictured her as a child. \\"The driver stood up, in a coat and hat of purest snow. She was a woman, tall and glittering. She was the Snow Queen.\\"<br /><br />The story begins with a story about the Devil who laughed at his own cleverness. He creates a mirror that sets people against one another by making people see the ugly side of things. If a splinter of glass from the mirror ever entered a person's eye, their heart would become a lump of solid ice. (quite a lesson there to be sure!)<br /><br />When the \\"imps\\" decide to take the mirror up to the angels and try to make fun of them, it falls and shatteres into a hundred pieces. When \\"Kai\\" finds a grain of glass in his heart his entire attitude to life is changed. \\"Keep away from me!\\" he screeches at his friend Gerda.<br /><br />Then one day he falls off his sled and sees the Snow Queen. She kisses him with her cold lips on his forehead and she takes him away through a cloud of darkness up into the sky. When Kai doesn't come home, Gerda goes looking for him. She sings to the river and drifts in a boat down a river to find Kai.<br /><br />Gerda is a contrast to Kai and is loving and kind. Only when a spell is broken is evil defeated. After the story a page of where the event takes place helps make the story more interesting. Finally, we can explore the real and imaginary world of The Snow Queen.<br /><br />Even as an adult, I am fascinated by fairy tales. They appeal to the child in us all and to something deep inside of us that knows, good will triumph over evil, in the end.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewrom me!\\" he screeches at his friend Gerda.

Colors and Shapes are slightly hidden, but are equally easy to remove and replace.<br /><br />In the first delightful book, each double page contains the number and picture of the items a child will enjoy learning about. Three puppies, seven peppers (sure to encourage cooking) and 12 finger puppets are all pictured on sturdy mini-pages. The second ABC book gives a picture for each letter in the alphabet. A great start to reading.<br /><br />The color and shapes books had the cutest picture of heart sunglasses showing the heart shape in the upper left corner and a picture of red rimmed glasses. Each shape has two pictures. There are lots of different shapes in this first-concept board book. The Color book shows items in a child's world. Look for the cute tiger cub with \\"stripes\\" or the black shoes and white bunny.<br /><br />Essential Concepts could not be presented in a cuter way.

When the last book had been filled, my exercise routine tapered off and then fizzled. Was having a book around to record cardio exercise, strength training, stretching, a rating, how many sets, the reps and the weights used giving me the motivation I needed? Or was it how guilty I felt about not exercising and having to write down...ahh...nothing that day the real problem.<br /><br />So, when my husband gave me the evil eye and said I was sitting around reading too many books, I bought another one. Ideally the plan is to buy one book every 23 weeks so you have a fresh one ready to go at the end of week 24. So, the first thing to do is to write in \\"order new book\\" under week 23, so you never forget and end up getting out of your normal workout routine.<br /><br />Do you remember writing a diary? Well, if you exercise...this will be one you don't mind having everyone read. It is like writing a review of yourself, of your goals and your accomplishments. The benefits of keeping a training diary is so you can feel guilty when you don't, see when you did well and find out what on earth you did last week that helped you to lose a few pounds. Something you might want to repeat!<br /><br />Suzanne Schlosberg believes this book will get you results. There are designated spaces to record your goals for the next six months and more specific objectives for each individual week an then day.<br /><br />\\"It is hard for anyone-accomplished athlete or complete novice-to stay motivated without a mission. Research confirms the importance of setting concrete workout goals.\\" -pg.8<br /><br />This edition differs from the first log I owned in that now there is a space for daily nutrition notes (like if you are on the Suzanne Somers' diet). There are training tips based on current research and a batch of fun sports slang and inspirational quotes. There is a new question-and-answer format and a resources section on page 157 of essential books to help supplement the information presented. A section on how to use the log is very helpful. Suzanne also has a delightful sense of humor. Her writing flows casually through the pages, making you feel that she is almost your personal trainer.<br /><br />So, what will you be recording? First...your goals for the next six months. This is called the Big Picture. On the Workout diary page, may I suggest a \\"before\\" picture. There is just enough space for an \\"after\\" picture on the last page. That way, you can look back on your achievements and realize how much you changed. At the start of each week, you identify your mission. The Cardio section lets you record say: Bike, 15 minutes, felt energized! The Strength Training area has room for: Chest Press wt. 80, sets. 3, reps 10.  May I suggest Karen Voight's book: Precision Training for Body & Mind...to help you out on this area. She describes the workout moves so well and in pictures. This book doesn't go into detail about any specific sport, but is your log to record all those activities.<br /><br />Finally, you give yourself a daily rating on a scale of 1-5. Hey, that is like giving yourself a daily \\"body\\" review. I can do this...I can do this...<br /><br />Do you know how to measure your heart rate? And what is your target zone? Will I burn more fat if I exercise at a slow pace? How often should I check my heart rate? What are the most effective cardio machines? How long will it take to see results? Does the order of my routine matter? Should I hire a trainer. How can I keep from getting injured? Suzanne tells all.<br /><br />The next two chapters explain strength training with a picture of all the muscles of the body (and labels) so you can easily learn the main muscles so you can understand that the lat pulldown is a back exercise. A special chapter on \\"fueling up\\" leads you to the path of enlightenment on how many calories to eat a day, what vitamin supplements to take, how much water to drink and if it is a bad idea to eat before a workout.<br /><br />Essentialinformation takes up the first third of the book and it helps to read this information again and again throughout the six months. The workout diary follows and is a beautifully set out with a plum \\"day\\" title and then lines for your diary and blocks of gray under wt. sets reps. At the top of the right hand page there is a training tip or sports speak (for the adventurous) for the week. On the top left hand pages following the first page of each week, there is a inspirational quote.<br /><br />This might just be the motivation you need. I know it worked the last time I had this book and I am ready to get back to a real exercise routine again. I looked around at some sites where you could log in your workouts, but it seems that if you turn on the computer, you are never going to get to that workout, so this book is a better solution. If you leave it on your kitchen counter...open to the next workout day....who knows what might happen.<br /><br />Monday will be the start of a new fitness adventure!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviews information again and again throughout the six months.

This will become a very useful tool that will serve you well in the future.<br /><br />When we moved from a townhouse to our first real home, we had no idea how much there was to keep track of.

Then, as you go screaming and kicking...you will get to list your \\"Important Personal Papers\\" and where you keep them. Hopefully in a fire proof safe.<br /><br />There is a page for a small picture of the house and grounds.<br /><br />The page on Finance Information borders on obsessive, but hey...you might need this information one day. The Warranties page is like a dream. Suddenly this book started to make sense to me. You list your purchase date and expiration date of the warranty.<br /><br />So, now that you are all settled in...what's next? Building and remodeling tips are followed by areas to write in information about your House Exterior (siding, trim, storm doors, windows, landscape gardening, side yard, back yard, pond, greenhouse, window boxes, container shrubs, gazebo (hello!

Then you can step indoors and list everything about the floor coverings, ceiling finish, curtains, blinds, wallpaper, ceiling fans, parlor, kitchen, breakfast nook, dining room, wall shelves, furniture, family room, mud room, hallway, stairway (room to put in info about three if you have a mansion), laundry room, bedroom number 1, 2, 3, 4 and then bathrooms.

It is the best culinary read I have had in a long time! Not since I read Kitchen, have I enjoyed a book quite so much.<br /><br />Upon opening the first page, I realized the quotes were organized in a pleasing fashion. An Invitation to Dine, The Guest List, The Menu, Food, Wisdom and Politics were served up in a very appetizing way. The real secret is that you are about to dine on words, words and more words. Each dripping with wit and creativity. Some are so amusing, you might catch yourself laughing out loud. Rodney Dangerfield's quote is just about the funniest quote I have ever read.<br /><br />I had to do a double take on something Julia Child said, and when I read \\"Many's the long night I've dreamed of cheese-toasted mostly. -Robert Louis Stevenson...I started to get a bit hungry and honestly thought about making a grilled cheese sandwich. Some quotes started to make me a bit nostalgic and others made me contemplate life and how food centers us, comforts us or may even enlighten us. It is amazing how a quote about food can sometimes shed light on other areas of life to the extent of making you start collecting these quotes religiously! I did find quite a few quotes I had already discovered, but never have found them all in one book!<br /><br />The quaint size of this volume is similar to your favorite novel. It is also as intriguing and once I started to read one quote, I was baited into reading another and another, until I finally had read the last quote and had to climb back out of bed to write this review. I would have happily stayed in bed if I had magically found a second volume.<br /><br />My first review hardly did this book justice and since I had only read a few cooking quotes, how was I to know the depths of this book?<br /><br />I do have to disagree with Moliere though, who said: \\"I live on good soup, not on fine words.\\" To that I say...more words please! I agreed with everything Emeril Lagasse says and loved finding quotes by Oscar Wilde, William Shakespeare, Henry David Thoreau, Adelle Davis, Lord Byron, Saki, Confucius and Mark Twain.<br /><br />If you have an hour, these quotes you will devour! The Quotable Cook is the most digestible serving of quotes ever published. When do we have the pleasure of dining on a second book? I am already starving!<br /><br />Here is one quote I would love to see in the second book:<br /><br />People give food meaning. It's easy to trivialize, because food is everywhere. But love of food is love of life. ~Barbara Haber, the curator of books at the Radcliffe Institute's Schlesinger Library. They house one of the largest culinary collections.<br /><br />~The Rebecca ReviewI live on good soup, not on fine words.\\" To that I say...more words please!

The book is filled with a color photo collection of cut and uncut stones, exquisite pieces of jewelry and exotic sculptures. Some photos show gems in their natural state and you will just be amazed at how they can be polished and cut to perfection.<br />An introduction entices you into reading about how gem minerals form, then the author delves into gemstones in history, why they are called gemstones, crystal structure, reflection and refraction, color and then cutting and polishing. Some stones are given special attention. There are full pages for diamond, ruby, sapphire, emerald, aquamarine, opal, amethyst, citrine, agate, jasper, tourmaline, topaz, peridot, zircon, garnet, chrysoberyl, spinel, jade, turquoise, lapis lazuli, moonstone, and labradorite stones.<br />Since attractive rocks and minerals have the potential for being any ornament, some softer materials are ideal for carving. There is a section that shows rare and curious gemstones I had never seen before. Who knew that fossilized wood could also be carved and polished. A two-page map shows where gem deposits are found. The country name is followed by the gems found in that region.<br />A grandmother may wear the birthstones of her grandchildren all in one ring or mothers may wear a necklace. One of the most beautiful rings I have seen had a diamond, emerald, amethyst and ruby and it secretly spells out &quot;dear.&quot; I am in love with Moonstones for some reason. The clear ones are so amazing and can be worn as a necklace. They are said to be bits of moonbeams.<br />Here is a wonderful quote about Gemstones:<br />The rational person accepts that sapphire, September's birthstone, is an aluminum oxide crystal colored by traces of iron, titanium, vanadium, or chrome. But peering into the gem, you can just as well imagine, as did the ancient Persians, that it is a chip off the precious pedestal on which the earth balances, whose dancing reflections create the multifarious colors of the sky. They command your gaze. They escort you into the depths and facets of their crystalline and ordered universe. Gems-to-be are spewed from volcanoes and tossed up by ocean waves. Or they rest quietly in sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rock, waiting to be unleashed by water, wind, or the pickax of a miner. -Suzanne Winckler<br />This book might encourage greed.<br />I only want one of each! Is that too much to ask for? ;)e dancing reflections create the multifarious colors of the sky. They command your gaze.

I have been making some recipes for years without even considering that all along, James Beard could have in fact brought them to our awareness. It is equally amazing how many of these recipes made their way over to Africa.<br /><br />My grandmother purchased one of the first copies and I now have the pleasure of owning it. This truly is a cookbook you will want to read over time. Reading the entire cookbook could be  quite daunting were the recipes and notes not so delightful to read!<br /><br />Each chapter begins with a note from James Beard and continues in a sort of cook's diary style with many recipes on one page. You will find recipes for cocktail food, salads, soups, eggs, cheese, fish, shellfish, poultry, game, beef, veal, lamb, pork, ham, bacon, sauces, vegetables, grains, pasta, beans, lentils, pies, pastries, cakes, cookies, puddings, ice cream, dessert sauces, fruit, bread, sandwiches, pickles, preserves and candy.<br /><br />If you didn't grow up in America, you will find this cookbook all the more fascinating. You can literally read this cookbook like a novel. I found it fun to sit outside and just start reading it from the beginning, skipping over recipes I didn't find interesting and being amazed at how many recipes I was familiar with and had actually made at some point in my life.<br /><br />A recipe will often start just so casually, you forget you are reading a cookbook, then suddenly you are reading the instructions and the recipe ingredients are listed on the right or left. This is written in a very personal style and you can truly hear the voice of James Beard in his writing.<br /><br />If you read a few pages of this book a day, you will find that within a year, you will know so much more about cooking. I also think it is handy to have to look up various aspects of cooking. I can hardly do this book justice by reviewing it, you just have to see it to believe it! I did especially enjoy reading about the 1-2-3-4 cake and finding a recipe for Crullers. I had lost my recipe quite a while back and didn't know where to find another one. You will also enjoy finding many recipes using saffron.<br /><br />I can almost bet my cooking teacher in high school had this book on her shelf, it does look a bit familiar now that I look at it closely. It is also incredible how much cooking has changed in 20 years, and how much it has stayed the same.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewe it!

I am working up the courage to make the Italian Cr&egrave;me Cake, which really is not that hard to make, but has a few layers. The Coffee &Eacute;clairs are also to die for and are filled with coffee ice cream. You will also find the recipe for French Silk Pie on pg. 279. I made the Pumpkin Cake roll and loved it. You could make it for a party in October. If you want to impress your guests to no end, do take a look at the Almond Raspberry Torte. It is called a \\"showstopper\\" for a good reason. It will also serve 16 people.<br /><br />I won this cookbook but would have bought it if I had seen it in a store. The cover is red, white and blue with that delicious picture of a shortcake with raspberries, strawberries, blackberries and blueberries playing in whip cream. Who could resist?<br /><br />Better Homes and Gardens has a recipe contest all the time and you can enter your recipes, well one day I decided to enter a contest and actually won something!

You will also love the section on the growing array of dairy products, exotic fruit, cheese and chocolate.<br /><br />A source for cookware, specialty food and produce is also included and I am eager to find out more about some of the fun UK sources I had never heard of, like Mermaid's Cookware.<br /><br />Have you ever dreamed of making Cheesecake with Greek Yogurt, Honey and Pistachios? When you see the picture, you will want to make it. There is also a recipe for Melting Chocolate Puddings that are those \\"molten\\" chocolate cakes you find in restaurants.

There are quite a few smoked fish recipes to try.<br /><br />There are also many recipes with International flair. Egg and Lentil Curry with Coconut and Pickled Lime is just one of the selections.

There are majestic mountains, the rain forests and shimmering coast lines. There are farmlands that provide bountiful crops. Washington produces delicious juicy apples, cherries, peaches, pears and plums. You can ski in the mountains or find a warm beach, walk in a field of lavender or visit a beautiful waterfall. You can live in the rainy part or you can live where the sun always seems to shine. You can live happily in either place because the food is so good.<br /><br />The peaches are the best I have ever tasted. The cherries are divine. Fresh corn, onions and strawberries make living in Washington a true pleasure. Yes, you sometimes have to travel to farmer's markets to find the really fresh produce, but it is so worth it. We make a trek to find peaches a few times a year and look for fresh corn every single year for as long as we can find it.<br /><br />Along with the recipes you will also find some fun facts. There are a few sketches here and there, but the recipes are the feature. You will find recipes for Appetizers, Breakfasts, Soups & Chowders, Salads, Main Dishes, Northwest Seafood, Side Dishes, Breads, Desserts and Beverages.<br /><br />Swedish Pancakes are a favorite recipe, Spiced Waffles and Granola from a Bed & Breakfast in La Conner also looks delicious. Baked Herb-Garden Salmon is a recipe from Graham Kerr used by permission. My mother loves coconut prawns and she will be delighted that I finally found a recipe.<br /><br />Now, I am not sure if I am seeing things, but there is a recipe for Northwest Fair Scones, could it really be the same recipe? You can get them at fairs and festivals in the Pacific Northwest and they are often served at the Puyallup fair. You can buy a scone mix, but here is a recipe to try.<br /><br />Other fun recipes include: It's a Chocolate Pizza, Grand Marnier Souffl&eacute; from Canlis Restaurant in Seattle, Strawberry Pie, Rhubarb Cake and The Ultimate Caramel Apple.<br /><br />Look for fun hints and facts here and there. It is not surprising to read that Washington is the world leader in the production of the raspberry. My grandmother grew them easily in her back yard.A list of Environmental tips to promote cleaning with environmentally friendly products covers just about every cleaning need.

At Christmas time she would make tins full of different types of cookies. The variety seemed endless. This was one of my favorite books in her cookbook collection.<br />All kinds of cookies have made their way into this book. Drop, Bar, sliced, shaped, cutout and no-fuss cookies are all invited into cookie heaven.<br />One reason I especially like this book is that they have a special section called: \\"Helpful Cookie Hints.\\" It helps you keep your home-baked cookies fresh and they give the ABC's of cookie storing, sending and gift giving.<br />Banana Nut Cookies, Pumpkin Cookies, Coconut Macaroons, cake brownies, Double Almond Cookies and the more traditional shortbread recipes look divine. There is a cherry variation for the shortbread recipe.<br />I have also been looking for a good recipe for molded cookies. You often find the molds, but there is no recipe with many of them. The recipe for \\"whole wheat critters\\" is a cookie made with whole wheat flour and is quite good.<br />As a child, my mother helped us make \\"sugar bells.\\" I wish she had let us make the \\"cookie pops\\" those are adorable. I think some of these recipes might be in the Better Homes and Gardens New Cookbook because I remember making some of the as a child.<br />This cookbook was originally $... so it has kept its value since 1990. The cover is tan with cookies almost falling off the cover. There are so many of them! The pinwheels and chocolate cookies with mint filling look especially tempting.<br />~TheRebeccaReview.com	2001-06-24

Linnea jokes and says: \\"This is not really a \\"Swedish cook book,\\" and explains that it is a reflection of her roots. Both her parents immigrated to the United States from Sweden. Her mother was a wonderful cook and this is a collection of her mother's recipes. She grew up with Cardamom Coffee Bread and has fond memories of her mother making cookies. Through the years she collected quite a selection of good recipes and added her own touches here and there. Some recipes are from friends and family.<br /><br />The recipes you will find are in 15 chapters. Appetizers & Beverages, Yeast Breads, Quick Breads, Breakfast & Brunch, Cakes & Frostings, Cookies, Desserts & Pies, Meat, Chicken, Fish, Pasta, Salads & Dressings, Soups and Vegetables. There is also a chapter on Miscellaneous and Equivalents & Substitutions.<br /><br />There are no color pictures, but a few cute sketches here and there. You will find a recipe for Swedish Fruit Bread, Swedish Yeast Twists, Swedish Pancakes, Swedish Cardamom Apple Cake, etc. All interspersed with other favorites.<br /><br />My grandmother made notes in this cookbook where she would change a recipe here or there. It looks like she used the recipe for Butter Cream Frosting and there might be a small typo in that recipe because she crossed out 1/2 cup milk and wrote in 1 to 2 tablespoons, which makes a lot more sense. I also have a feeling that some of my late grandmother's cooking secrets are hiding in the pages of this cookbook. Page 99 with a recipe for Chocolate-Banana-Cream Pie is a bit worn out. She also wrote in to add 1/4 teaspoon salt. I will sometimes use salted butter when using a recipe for a chocolate item as it is true, a bit of salt helps bring out the flavor of chocolate.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-06-24

In the Spring, enjoy Irish Tea, Tea with Shakespeare or May Day Tea.<br /><br />When Summer arrives, Tea in the Rose Garden, 1850's Summer Tea or Sunflower Tea sounds very appropriate. In the fall, Tea at the Ballet, Kentucky Harvest Tea and tea with Monet include recipes for Pavlova, Cream puff swans and Pear Tart. Music selections are also recommended, The Four Seasons being one of my favorites.<br /><br />Drawing on an eclectic mix of culinary traditions, the tea menu for each season is based on a central idea and seasonal fruits and vegetables are used to their best advantage. Art is also exhibited in the tea room making each season an occasion for celebrating art. A picture of a painting sets the mood for the each season. The authors have a great love for the arts and tea and to them life is art. In each area of their lives, they try to be artists, even when preparing a pot of tea.<br /><br />If you enjoy sipping tea in a serene setting surrounded by beautiful art, fresh flowers, delightful foods and great music, you will relate well to this cookbook. If you want to create this peaceful setting, your will find many ideas to inspire you.<br /><br />An Angelic Tea features Cinnamon tea, Orange Tea Bread, Christmas Ribbon Sandwiches, Angel Biscuits with Country Ham Spread, Angels on Horseback, Cranberry Scones with Orange Date Spread, Angel Sugar Cookies and White Fruit Cake which can be served in the Winter.

They were served with butter, cream and jam just like scones.), Chocolate Tea Bread, Shrimp Boats, Blackberry Sorbet, Cherry tarts and Onion Tart.<br /><br />Each recipes has a fun-to-read header and sets a mood for your own cooking adventure. When you drink a cup of tea, you may find yourself thinking about everything that is right with the world and find tea time a way to escape from the everyday world.

A real deal if you love cheese, as this includes beautiful pictures of the cheese making process.<br /><br />Do you love to eat cheese curds? We go out of our way to find a local cheese factory where we can buy them. They have a lighter texture and pg. 8 explains how the curds are pressed into blocks. No wonder....this ruins the wonderful texture of curds. If one had the choice, one might only eat cheese curds. My paternal grandmother, God bless her soul for introducing me to cheese curds, used to freeze a block of cheddar cheese and then break it apart for us. It is a wonderful childhood memory as we also ate grapes and other delicious foods at her home.<br /><br />While there are more selections than ever in the world of cheese, you will find a gallery of famous cheeses. Gorgonzola, Roquefort, Stilton, American Blues, French Blues, Scandinavian Blues (Danish is a personal favorite), Brie, Camembert, Soft-Ripened, Cheddar and Cheddar's English cousins are set out in style. Recently I found a \\"Green\\" cheese and see it is featured as a Sage Derby.

The title \\"Phoenix Rising\\" comes from the story told by many cultures. The Phoenix bird is a symbol of hope and immortality. Through the ages, it has meant many things to many religions and cultures.<br /><br />In ancient mythology is it associated with a bird that lives in Arabia, near a cool well. Every morning the sun god was said to stop his chariot to listen to the bird sing. The splendid red and gold plumage has also given it the name of \\"The Fire Bird.\\" Only one Phoenix bird is said to exist at a time. When the bird felt its death was near (every 500 or more years), it would build a nest of incense (cinnamon, spikenard and myrrh) twigs. This was then ignited by the sun and fanned by its own wings. A new Phoenix bird then rises up from the ashes.<br /><br />To Anthony Schwarz, the birds anguish and rebirth were symbolic of how we can be vulnerable in depression, heal and then rise again to the next challenge. The crucial message of his work is that out of the depths of despair, you can emerge stronger than before.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this work for the \\"very human\\" aspect. This is a personal journey from depression to recovery. Anthony chose to see depression as a blessing when he walked on this earth. By writing about his own illness he was able to heal and the writing helped to stabilize him.<br /><br />After suffering a nervous breakdown and going into a deep depression, he experienced the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. In his manic stages he alienated others from his life. He was finally diagnosed with bi-polar disorder and he studied, tracked and recorded his own mental roller coaster. He now reveals a step-by-step program to regain control of your life. He wanted to give hope to those who have depression or manic depression. By merging the twelve steps of Alcoholics Anonymous with holistic health habits, he came up with a program for recovery.<br /><br />While this book is not based on any specific religion, some religions did play a role in his life. He frequently refers to a \\"Higher Power\\" which one can conclude is God to him. He also states numerous times that his alternate lifestyle caused him depression as it conflicted with his religious upbringing. Still, I feel that there are many points that can be taken and applied to anyone's life, no matter what religion they believe in.<br /><br />After reading the book, you can refer to a summary at the end to put the plan into action. I felt the book was written in a loving manner and the purpose was to help others see that they are not alone in their depression. The twelve keys explain how Anthony was able to beat depression. His ideas in regards to the 12 steps are very practical and people who are not depressed are perhaps already applying many of these principles. The author still thinks you should work with your doctor and that medication can work, yet by reading this work, you will come to realize that it takes a change in your thoughts and actions to really lift yourself from depression. Most psychologists would agree with this from what I have read.<br /><br />Anthony referred to stages in his life when his depression worsened. If you look closely, they are related in part to changes in his life. I think many times depression is a way for us to go through a hard time in our life and realize we need to care for ourselves and focus on our spiritual self. Sorrow is in fact our greatest teacher.<br /><br />This work will be helpful for many to recognize there is help for depression. It is rare to find a book about depression written from a personal perspective. Normally, I have read books by experts who have more than likely never been depressed. For those who are seeking a real-life story, this will be quite a journey. If you know someone who is depressed and you want to understand them and how they think, this would be an excellent starting point.<br /><br />I can also recommend Wisdom of the Ages by Wayne Dyer, The Land of I Can by Susan L. Gilbert, The Herbal Drugstore by Linda B. White, M.D. and Yes, You Can by Sam Deep and Lyle Sussman.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewou Can by Sam Deep and Lyle Sussman.     ~The Rebecca Review	2001-06-21

In the first book: The Prayer of Jabez, Dr. Bruce H. Wilkinson explains how we can have an abundant life by knowing how to pray to God. In this second book of the BreakThrough Series, he takes the verses in John 15 and explores the four levels of \\"fruit bearing\\" in order to show you how God works in your life to answer your prayer.<br /><br />This is the message Jesus gave to his disciples on the night he was betrayed. As he was about to defeat sin, he was explaining how his followers could also defeat sin and live an abundant life.<br /><br />\\"The disciples knew grapes like an Englishman knows tea.\\" pg. 59<br /><br />So, it is no wonder the story of vines would have made complete sense to the disciples and be perhaps a bit of a secret to those of us who have never been taught how to grow grapes. Dr. Wilkinson brings the story alive as he tells of how the disciples followed Jesus to a vineyard. There he teaches them about how he is the true vine and his father is the vinedresser/husbandman (gardener). The fruit God desires of us is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. When God works through you, others will see these qualities in your life and want to know who God is and perhaps become Christians themselves.<br /><br />When a Christian does not bear any fruit, it is often thought that perhaps they are not a Christian after all. Jesus says that if a branch does not bear fruit he takes it away. Dr. Wilkinson delves into the Greek translation to bring more understanding to the words used. He brings a new meaning to the word \\"airo\\" and explains how it could mean \\"take up\\" instead of \\"cut off.\\" This was enlightening in many regards and is an explanation of this verse as I have never heard it before. You will never read John 15 in the same way again! I recommend this book for pages 34-35 alone. There are also three main secrets of the vine that are revealed in this book.<br /><br />The Bible has such beautiful messages for our souls and Dr. Wilkinson expands on that beauty and helps us to have a deeper understanding.

While he recommends you pray the exact prayer, I can't see any reason why you could not put it into your own words.<br /><br />So, is it selfish to ask God to bless us? Is God still a God of miracles, can he still change lives? \\"When was the last time God worked through you in such a way that you knew beyond doubt God had done it?\\" pg. 16 Do you want to pray so that God will answer your prayers?<br /><br />Through anecdotes and verses, the author unfolds a mystery. This is a story of how a prayer can change your life and how it changed Bruce H. Wilkinson's life on a daily basis. You will find that you can apply the principles in this book immediately to your own prayer life.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the story of Jabez, look for a prayer journal, a devotional, a bible study, a book for teens and a gift edition due out this year. An audio version read by the author is also now available. They are all based on the prayer of Jabez. The second book in the series is Secrets of The Vine. Also look for: 30 Days To Experiencing Spiritual Breakthroughs by the same author.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-06-18

Since our lives are filled with so many challenges, we sometimes just need a break in our day to nurture our souls. This book is filled with humorous stories and thoughtful messages to inspire and encourage you as you strive to become who God intends you to be.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed reading the quote at the beginning of each devotional. Each message is linked to a pithy quotation and also verses from the Bible. They are very easy-to-read and the stories will make you think. You will find the stories will help you in your daily journey in life.<br /><br />The issues of marriage, being content, wisdom, important decisions, character, success and various real-life issues are spoken of in such a friendly tone. You will just want to keep reading, but this is meant more for daily devotionals. You might be tempted to read more than one each day. Don't worry, I won't tell on you ;).<br /><br />Here are two favorite quotes:<br /><br />Our children are like mirrors-they reflect our attitudes in life.  The best way to get the last word is to apologize.<br /><br />If you enjoyed reading this book, I can also recommend the BreakThrough Series by Dr. Bruce H. Wilkinson. The Prayer of Jabez and Secrets of The Vine are wonderful devotionals which will bring you into a deeper understanding of prayer and your purpose here on this earth as a Christian.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-06-18

Not only will your child gain essential coordination skills but they will be giggling themselves silly in some of the rhymes. Round and Round the Garden is perfect for baby, as is Slowly, Slowly. Who doesn't remember This Little Pig Went to Market. I can remember giggling myself silly as a child because my feet were so ticklish.<br />Itsy-bitsy Spider is one of my all-time favorite rhymes. Pat-a-cake is a rhyme no child should miss. I would recommend this book to mothers with very young children.<br />There is music between the rhymes on the tape and the English accents are delightful to listen to. The step-by-step pictures encourage playfulness and interaction between child and parent. There are many fun games mothers can play to entertain a baby. The pictures are also delightful, so the book can be used for reading at a later stage.<br />If you love this book/tape set, look for Action Rhymes which is much more active and children will love the tape. I can also recommend Nursery Rhymes by Debi Gliori.<br />If you are careful when opening this tape set, you can use the plastic cover to store the tape and book together!<br />TheRebeccaReview.com	2001-06-15

Michael van Straten is a well-known medicine practitioner in the UK and is a practicing naturopath and nutritional consultant. Barbara Griggs has been studying and writing about complementary medicine for the past 25 years and is the health editor of Country Living magazine.<br /><br />In this collection, you will find weekly menu plans for every stage of childhood, from conception to the teenage years.

There is a comprehensive guide to 130 top ingredients that form the building blocks of healthy eating for children. Vegetables, fruits, dairy products, grains, nuts and seeds, meats, fish, herbs and oils are then used in delicious recipes.<br /><br />They do say that butter is better than margarine...ok, they get 5 stars just for that comment! I also appreciated the extra section on \\"Danger Foods.\\" These are foods which used to be occasional treats but have now become part of our children's everyday eating. The authors explain why these foods are not healthy and in detail! I guess some of the items they discuss are not good for adults either.<br /><br />Some recipes serve 4-6, while others serve 1 or 2. If you are at home cooking for your children, you will not have to make another meal for yourself. Overall, a very well organized book with some wonderful information for special food problems.

I could really just leave this cookbook open on page 212-213 because the pictures is so beautiful and would inspire anyone to make Savarin.<br /><br />It is a pity they don't have a picture here of this book. It is quite visually pleasing. Henrietta Green reclaims some of the unbridled joy of preparing luscious cuisine from fresh, full-flavored ingredients and it shows in the photography and watercolor sketches. The headnotes are also interesting to read and I would say this is a cookbook collectors find. This is one of those coffee table cookbooks you will want to drag into the kitchen as you are inspired.<br /><br />This is a rediscovery of the rich, true flavors of nature's bounty. Henrietta Green's true passion for food is shown by her delightful anecdotes from her countryside travels. While the poultry and game section may sound a bit exotic to some, you might even start to mail-order a few items so you can try some of the recipes.<br /><br />The Pickles, Preserves and Sauces chapter is very unique and boasts a selection of wonderful sauces and jams. The basic recipes will be a new cooks dream. You can learn how to roast a chicken or make a basic pie pastry. The desserts include hard-to-find recipes for Tarte Tatin, Pears in a Brioche, Clafoutis and Black Currant Sorbet. A recipe for Lavender Ice Cream got my attention. In the winter, there will be many soups to try.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-06-15

You will immediately recognize songs like The Wheels on the Bus or Row, Row, Row Your Boat, but have you heard of Peter Hammers or I Hear Thunder? I have fun memories of teaching: Six Little Ducks and cutting out little duck visuals in college until late in the night. This book brought back memories of teaching and really will encourage learning.<br />The book/tape set is nice because children can learn the songs before they can even read. Later, they can read the book and teach their friends the fun rhymes. Children will especially enjoy: She'll Be Coming Round the Mountain. Down by the Station sounded very familiar and I was wondering if my mother might have had fun singing this to me when I was a young child. I thought I heard her voice in the song, well, in the back of my mind while it was playing.<br />Nice English flavor and accents. The rhymes encourage playfulness and silliness. Oh, to be a kid again! Children are comforted by music and there is no reason you couldn't sing some of these songs to a baby. Some of them are quite funny because the singers improvise a bit. I really don't remember the ending to Row, Row, Row Your Boat and here it has three verses.<br />The pictures show how to act out the rhymes so this not only becomes an exercise manual for kids ;), it also serves as a babysitter.<br />You might also enjoy Nursery Rhymes by Debi Gliori and Playtime Rhymes (a similar book/tape set).<br />~TheRebeccaReview.com	2001-06-15

I have done the same thing and you will be amazed at how fast a book can be created. She encourages all cooks to do the same.<br /><br />Most of the recipes can be made quite easily and are not too long. The new cook will enjoy learning how to make fluffy rice with chicken broth or make a spice crumb cake, sure to get her husbands attention.<br /><br />I also found a recipe for \\"You-Can-Eat-It\\" dough. Kids can make fun creations and not be in danger if they eat the dough.<br /><br />Recently, I have seen some of these recipes come back into fashion.

You will feel like you just met your cooking soul mate! Patricia is a historian and if you are in love with how a recipe was created and where it originated, you will enjoy the headnotes and will enjoy trying the recipes. Then you can entertain your guests with the tale of how the dish came to be.<br /><br />This book contains recipes for breads, sandwiches, soups, salads, salad dressings,. seafood, meats, poultry, supper dishes, side dishes, sauces., candy, cookies, cakes, pies and beverages.<br /><br />The last recipe my late grandmother ever taught me was Chicken Divan. I had no idea where she would have learned the recipe, but found three or four handwritten cards with various recipes on them. I figured she must have adapted the recipe over a few years to come up with the perfect recipe.<br /><br />I was pleased to find more information about the Chicken Divan recipe in Rare Bits. I know it is one of the tastiest dishes, but had no idea that it takes its name from the long-gone New York restaurant, the Divan Parisienne. She also gives the origin of the word divan and gives a recipe for Chicken Divan that uses a Hollandaise Sauce. She also tells why they call it Hollandaise! We use canned soup for convenience, however it was fun to read how it was originally made.<br /><br />Patricia has really outdone herself. The headers are really paragraphs and sometimes take up pages and pages, which is just delicious to read and savor. There are recipes in this book I have never seen before. Anzacs, Hussar's Kisses, Hamantaschen? There is also a gourmet quality about many of the recipes. You will find Babas Au Rhum and Charlotte Russe hanging out with a recipe for Sloppy Joes, all in the same book. There is great variety in the recipes, just as there is in the cultures they originated in. A recipe for Heaven & Earth caught my attention, how about Angels on Horseback.<br /><br />You will find out where mom's recipe for Beef Stroganoff (Russian, but she also tells some info you won't find anywhere else.) originated or how to make a Shirley Temple drink. Since I had never eaten a Manhattan Clam Chowder, I didn't realize you just don't add tomatoes to the cream clam chowder, it is a completely different recipe. Patricia also gives the variation so you can make both the New England and Manhattan version.<br /><br />If you are looking for a recipe for Pavlova, you will find it here. I had just made the recipe and was reading that Anna Pavlova was famous for her performance in The Dying Swan so we made swan meringues. Patricia gave me more info and explained why this meringue dessert was such a hit in Australia. There is so much to learn, but what a delicious way to learn it. Who knew the Chinese gooseberry (kiwifruit) was originally called mihoutao or monkey peach and that the seeds came from China. She also gives information on how the name was changed. That name change information is also in the Purple Kiwi Cookbook, written by Karen Caplan. Her mother, Frieda, actually named the Chinese gooseberry, a kiwifruit!<br /><br />If you are a cookbook collector, enjoy food history or want to find some unique recipes, this is the book for you. No color pictures, but you will be reading this like a novel! The cover is pretty, they should put up a picture.<br /><br />If you love this book, look for books by Sharon Tyler Herbst. Her Food Lover's Companion now has more cooking terms than ever. Also look for The Cambridge World History of Food which comes in two volumes.

Karen Caplan loves the produce she sells at Frieda's and this cookbook grew out of a need to fulfill recipe requests from her clients. Fresh produce is Karen's passion and she started working part-time in the company at a young age. Her mother, Frieda Caplan, first introduced kiwifruit to America and inspired Karen to carry on her families tradition of introducing new delicacies. Part of her job includes traveling to exotic locations around the globe to get the scoop on the next new product.<br /><br />\\"I get so excited talking to the growers. In Thailand recently, there were all these fruits I had never seen before.\\" -Karen Caplan<br /><br />While this cookbook is also a journey to discover how to use exotic fruits and vegetables, you will find many recipes like Chicken Wraps with Cilantro and Avocado which contains ingredients we are all familiar with. Marlene Brown helped to develop the recipes and has been creating recipes for Frieda's since 1982. Dr. Nancy Berkoff is a certified chef and also assisted in the writing of this cookbook. The recipes will be loved by adventurous home cooks and chefs alike.<br /><br />You will also recognize the more common celery root, cilantro, elephant garlic, fennel, ginger, horseradish, leeks, mangoes, pearl onions, purple potatoes, shallots and spaghetti squash that are appearing in so many stores lately. If you walk into your local grocery store, more than likely Frieda's produce will be there. If you visit Frieda's Web site you can see where the produce is being sold in your state.<br /><br />The book design is beautiful and fresh pleasant purple, an almost pumpkin orange and kiwi green colors are found throughout the cookbook. Each recipe heading is in purple and there are various notes in little boxes to give you information about the selections being incorporated into each dish. Headnotes give a tip on recipe usage, explains the texture or a gives a unique serving idea. Beautiful color pictures fill many of the pages and you have to see the lime mousse with the horned melons on page 63! The mousse looks so creamy and you could serve it in the summer.<br /><br />The Purple Kiwi Cookbook is organized alphabetically so you can easily find recipes for your favorite produce. You can find recipes for anything from Asian Pears to Wood Ear Mushrooms. This is a collection of over 100 favorite creations inspired by the produce sold at Frieda's. You will especially enjoy the full-color visual glossary to look up what a \\"tamarillo\\" looks like. Every item used in this cookbook has its own description, usage information and storage hints. Food writers will also love the detailed descriptions. You will finally know what \\"cipolline\\" onions look like.<br /><br />If you have \\"foodie\\" friends, they will love these recipes and you are sure to impress them by knowing what to do with kumquats! My advice is to put the whole kumquat in your mouth and chew fast, but Karen has a few good ideas and who would have thought you could put them in a dressing? The recipes just tempt you to try these fascinating fruits and vegetables. Who ever thought of Cactus Pear Sauce over waffles? How about Passion Fruit Sorbet you can make even if you don't own an ice cream maker? Have you been wondering what to do with blood oranges or thought that lychees looked rather fun? I can't wait to try the Chile-Roasted Edamame.<br /><br />My passion lately is lemongrass (which can be kept in your freezer), so when I found out this book had recipes for lemongrass, I got a bit excited. You just don't find that many recipes except in Thai cookbooks and then they are normally very spicy. Karen includes a delicious \\"Light Lemon Hollandaise\\" which would even make Julia Child proud. You mix all the ingredients in the blender and then cook it for just a few minutes in a saucepan.<br /><br />Well, once you taste this sauce you will start thinking about what you want to serve it with. I fried some floured cod (cut into 1-inch by 1 1/2-inch pieces) with some lemon pepper in a bit of butter. Then, I fried up a basil leaf right in the pan next to the cod. A piece of lemongrass also sizzled in the pan and then for a final presentation I set each piece of fish on a spoonful of the Lemongrass Hollandaise sauce on a medium size plate and topped it with a fried basil leaf. To garnish: a piece of lemon, a fresh basil leaf, a few cut stalks of the fried lemon grass in a fan shape and of course a slice of unpeeled kiwi in Frieda Caplan's honor! Wow, I had created a new recipe just from one idea of using lemon grass in hollandaise sauce. That is what this book will do. It will inspire you to be adventurous.<br /><br />So why is this cookbook called the \\"Purple\\" Kiwi Cookbook? Well, I will keep that a secret and let you find out from Karen Caplan when she tells you her wonderful family history at the beginning of this cookbook. Karen also recalls how her mother would return from work with the wonderful aroma of mangoes and citrus fruit and she jokingly calls this \\"eau de mango-papaya-pineapple-grapefruit.\\". Little did Karen know at the time that this would become the sweet scent of success. The best life sure does come from doing what you love and it shows in this new cookbook!<br /><br />Well, get ready for a journey into the flavors of the exotic produce Frieda's has been introducing into American cuisine for years.

Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Barefoot and Carefree in the Kitchen	Have you ever noticed that when you go to a party where everyone is hanging out in the kitchen, those parties are the most fun? Well, Ina encourages guests to participate in the last minute food preparation. She puts on fun music and takes a more relaxed approach.<br /><br />Ina Garten decided she would rather cook because it was her true love and left her job as a budget analyst in the White House in 1978 to follow her dream of opening a specialty food store. She now owns The Barefoot Contessa in East Hampton, N.Y. Over the past 23 years, this has become a culinary destination. It is now a 3,000 square foot market where 20 cooks prepare the food and another 20 people help customers in the store. The scent of rosemary and fresh French bread dances in the air. They prepare fresh salads and dinners according to what's in season. In this book, you will find many of the good ideas and delicious foods that you can find in the store.<br /><br />After years of her customers asking for her recipes, she finally revealed some of her secrets in her first book: \\"The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook.\\" I was very impressed with Ina's first book and gave her book as gifts to friends. This book is equally beautiful and James Merrell has done a wonderful job photographing all the food styled by Rori Spinelli.<br /><br />When you open this cookbook, you will feel like you are entering Ina Garten's world. The lush color picture of her home with the door left open is so wonderful and you feel like you could just walk inside and smell freshly baked chocolate chip cookies and take one right off the plate!<br /><br />So, where will you find Ina when she is hosting a party? You might find her whipping up Tropical Smoothies (page 39) and chatting with a friend in the kitchen. Someone might be helping to cook the scrambled eggs with asparagus (page 34) while another guest is cutting the Sour Cream Coffee Cake (page 37). These are all recipes in the Sunday Breakfast section.<br /><br />Was I impressed by her new cookbook? Yes. She has organized it so well and I love the party themes by season. Each recipe has a refreshing header and sometimes gives a variation for the recipe. The parties are divided into Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. They include a Sunday Breakfast, Pizza Party, Jewish Holiday, Academy Awards, Canoe Trip, Lunch in the Garden, Happy Birthday, Outdoor Grill, Football Party, Autumn Dinner, NOT Thanksgiving, Afternoon Tea, New Year's day, Snow Day, Valentine's Dinner and Fireside Dinner Parties.<br /><br />The Index is also well organized. The book design is superb and is all a cookbook author could wish for. Except for a few recipes, the entire recipe is on one page and you don't have to turn the page to read the directions in most cases. The instructions are not numbered. A space between various instructions gives you the idea that you are onto a new step, so they are easy to follow. Her recipes are not difficult to make. Most of the dishes can be prepared in advance.<br /><br />I also love her writing style. When you read her notes, you feel as if she is talking to you and you are sitting out on the deck with a glass of lemonade. Each party begins with a page telling you something funny about a party. \\"I'll never forget the worst party I ever gave.\\".....pg. 33 Ina also shares her wisdom from years of catering and planning parties. Some of the things she writes in this book are just laugh out loud funny! She is so daring and has been catering parties professionally for more than twenty years. I mean, why not serve dinner in the study by the fireplace! I love her creativity.<br /><br />\\"Drag the table out on the porch and set big platters of cut melons, papayas and long stemmed strawberries down the middle. Put out baskets of fresh bread and coffeecake. Have hot coffee in thermoses out where people can help themselves. The food will be the decoration.\\" - Ina Garten<br /><br />I can truly say that every recipe in this book looks just divine.I made the chicken chili recipe today, but in half the quantity. The ingredients included chicken breast that you bake while the onions, tomatoes and bell peppers simmer on the stove top. You just toss in the diced baked chicken and then in a few minutes, dinner is ready. You may use green bell peppers in place of the more expensive red and yellow bell peppers. I also used Mexican-style canned tomatoes since I had those on hand. You can also make the recipe even if you don't have a food processor. Just use a kitchen shears to cut up the tomatoes right in the cans. A 6-quart pot works well and someone might want to include more pan/pot sizes in a future printing, especially for new cooks.<br /><br />Now, I am thinking that to really have a real Barefoot Contessa Party, you might want to order her great coffee, the Contessa Blend. It was invented over twenty years ago and is a blend of coffee with cinnamon. While you are ordering the coffee from her site, I dare you to resist ordering some double-chocolate brownies.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewe ingredients included chicken breast that you bake while the onions, tomatoes and bell peppers simmer on the stove top.

If you want to make a friend very happy, you could buy them both books and wrap them up for a wonderful gift.<br /><br />While this cookbook is equally comfortable on the coffee table as it will be in the kitchen, I can tell you the recipes are wonderful. While it won't stay on the coffee table for long - you will want to read it from cover to cover.<br /><br />I always love the fact that a cookbook has so much life energy poured into it. You will love both cookbooks. I just finished making the chicken chili in her second book: Barefoot Contessa Parties.<br /><br />We have another winner! So, don't miss out on her second cookbook. I highly recommend both cookbooks.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-06-01

Jyl Steinback is a personal trainer who tries to make everything she cooks as healthy as possible. She explains how you can get the most energy out of the foods you eat. By using substitutes she still is able to enjoy her favorite foods without all the fat.<br /><br />When making chocolate cake, she uses applesauce, nonfat cream cheese, skim milk and nonfat vanilla yogurt and an egg substitute. To make Guacamole, she uses asparagus, green peas, tomatoes, salsa, onion powder, cilantro, nonfat mayo, lime juice, garlic powder, Tabasco sauce and ground red pepper and pepper to taste. You do have to have a food processor to make some of the recipes.<br /><br />There is also a chapter for one-dish meals that busy parents will enjoy using. For dinner you might enjoy a soy milkshake, a salmon burger or chicken strips and oven baked potato casserole. Each recipe has the nutritional analysis per serving.<br /><br />Jyl makes use of meat substitute and other soy products. If you love soy products, you will enjoy this book even more. I think the soy just takes on the flavors of all the other ingredients.<br /><br />Do you want your kids to eat healthier but have given up on getting them to eat their veggies? The author also gives hints on how to get children to eat their vegetables! She gets her kids to eat healthy foods by making yummy low-fat and fat-free dips for vegetables and I know that gets my husband to eat fresh vegetables as well ;>. She puts out the vegetables when her kids are the most hungry, like after school. For adults, this time is right after work.<br /><br />Jyl Steinback also advises parents to eat with their children and to actually sit down to a family meal. This encourages a higher intake of fruits, vegetables and fiber. It also helps children to eat more slowly and engage in conversation. She gets her kids involved in planning the meals and respects her children's ability to determine when they have had enough food to eat. She doesn't make them clean their plates, but gives them a well-balanced and varied diet. She says that when dealing with picky eaters, it can take up to 10 or more exposures to the food before they will decide to take a bite.<br /><br />Jyl also takes a look at the myths and the facts of healthy eating. She explains how unprocessed foods don't always make them more healthy. Canned, dried and frozen food can also be high in nutritional value. Canned vegetables might sometimes be more nutritious because they are packed at the peak of freshness.<br /><br />This is her eighth cookbook!

When you think of \\"slow cooking\\" you might imagine a full day of cooking, yet really with slow cooking, you can get out of the kitchen for most of the cooking time. The most delightful thing about slow cooking is that you don't have to worry about burning something on the stove top and you can hardly ruin a meal even if you let it cook way over the suggested cooking times.<br /><br />Evenings are fun times to use the slow cooker to make a stock. Often in the past, I found the cooker invaluable for making chicken stock while I was happily sleeping. With Lora's new book, I finally learned how to make a delicious vegetable stock. She recommends roasting the vegetables first and this adds more intensity to the stock. You can roast the vegetables, then toss everything into the slow cooker and then head off to bed while the cooker does all the work.<br /><br />You will find recipes for chicken and vegetable stocks in the pantry chapter. I highly recommend you make these stocks for the recipes. A powdered or base stock does not do the recipes justice. If you are vegetarian, you will enjoy the fact that you can substitute a vegetable stock for the chicken stock in many of the recipes.<br /><br />One thing I noticed with some of the recipes was the times seemed a bit short. I would take the times that say \\"2 hours\\" with a pinch of salt. I doubled those times and the recipe worked much better. I also found you could leave the stock on high heat all night and let it go way over the recommended 6 hours. I left the vegetable stock in the cooker for 10 hours and it was even more flavorful.<br /><br />Before you start a recipe, check to see if you have to make another recipe first! If you need to make a recipe for \\"Duxelles\\" before making the stuffed mushrooms, Lora gives you the page number. You don't have to stand in your kitchen staring at the page and wondering where you are going to find duxelles (dook-SEHL). You simply turn to page eleven and see that in fact, you are only making a thick paste used to flavor sauces, soups and other mixtures. It is just mushrooms and shallots and Lora shows you how to make this paste in the slow cooker.<br /><br />Many of the recipes are gourmet, but that is what makes cooking fun. Lora used to work in a French restaurant and it shows! There is also a definite Italian flair to many of the recipes. In the recipe calling for \\"cipollinis\\" you will have to look for the bulbs of the grape hyacinth and they are used in Italian cuisine. You could substitute pearl onions. I also found it difficult to find baby zucchini where I lived so I just used regular sized zucchini and cooked the soup a bit longer.<br /><br />While this book is written for cooking at home, you will feel a bit like a chef when using a hand-held immersion blender to transform vegetables and stock into a satiny smooth soup right in the cooker.<br /><br />If you have never tasted a homemade soup, you owe it to yourself to pull out that slow cooker. It is very satisfying to make homemade soup and it is so delicious. Most of the recipes in this book say to season to taste. You add the salt and pepper at the end. In a way, I wish she had given a basic measure of the salt and pepper, but if you are trying to cook with less salt, you will like the fact that you can add just enough for your own taste.<br /><br />Many recipes include a \\"Variation\\" or a \\"Note.\\" If you can't find herbes de Provence, Lora shows you how to make it yourself. Lora also includes fun headnotes so you feel that you know her better. \\"I wandered into an Indian grocery store in my neighborhood and perused the shelves for an ingredient I hadn't tried before. Tamarind paste caught my eye.....\\" and so this is how the recipe for Tamarind Sweet Potatoes came into existence.<br /><br />You will especially like the design of this book. It has a beautiful blue cover and the binding will last a long time. The index is well organized, although it is easy to find anything you are looking for just by flipping through the 200 pages. There is not a color picture to be found, yet that does not seem to detract from the book. I like the artsy style of the layout with a light gray border at the top of each page and a slow cooker design element running through the book. You will find recipes for appetizers, soups, vegetables, meat, poultry, fish, pasta, breads, grains and desserts.<br /><br />Using smoked Gouda cheese in the Smoky Stuffed Chicken Breasts might give your mother's slow cooker a bit of a shock but it sounds delicious to me! Your slow cooker might just become indispensable! I am really looking forward to making the Vanilla Ice Cream recipe in which you make the base in the slow cooker in order to infuse the cream and sugar with vanilla essence from a vanilla bean.<br /><br />Tonight I am serving the Cream of Zucchini Soup that is quite good with a sprinkling of paprika and a few toasted pumpkin seeds. I added 1 teaspoon of seasoning salt to the soup. You might prefer more or less salt. I just took a taste and the flavor is just superb. The color is an almost mustard yellow and the texture is smooth and creamy.<br /><br />While you are making the soup, you could also make some bread in your bread machine. After all, Lora is famous for her bread baking skills.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewture to be found, yet that does not seem to detract from the book.

If you are looking for a book which has space for your own recipes and pockets to hold clippings and photos, this might be the book for you. Each chapter starts with an essay by the author and then continues with vintage photos and food quotes.<br /><br />It reminds me of a photo album (in style) and it is really a special journal in which you can keep your family's favorite recipes. You might want to consider having your relatives write some of the recipes in their own handwriting.<br /><br />Don't wait to start collecting your family recipes. I started collecting them when I was about 7 and now have 395 recipes I use all the time. We all remember those delicious meals, but reproducing them in our own kitchens is the real trick. If you can collect the recipes and spend time with your family learning to make their favorite dishes, you will never regret it.<br /><br />There is something wonderful about cooking with family and passing on your favorite recipes to those you love.<br /><br />\\"One certainly cannot learn the technical details of cookery entirely from books; but if the cooks, celebrated and obscure, of the past had believed that written recipes were unnecessary, we should now be in a sad plight indeed.\\" -Elizabeth David, French Provincial Cooking (1960)<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-05-23

In this collection of stories and poems, the fascinating traditions and customs of Christmas are revealed on single-page features. Each story is accompanied by fascinating information on a page illustrated with colorful photographs from around the world. These pages give insights into various traditions and aspects of the Christmas holiday. Why do we have Christmas trees? Do you know who Santa Claus really is?<br /><br />Anne Yvonne Gilbert has illustrated the stories in such delightful detail. She began as a freelance illustrator in 1978 and has since published illustrated books on both sides of the Atlantic for most major publishers. Many pieces of her prize-winning original artwork reside in private collections, including one owned by England's Princess Margaret.<br /><br />This is a collection of traditional favorites by Charles Dickens, Louisa May Allcott, Hans Christian Andersen, and Clement C. Moore. Modern classics are also included. Each story has been chosen to illustrate a Christmas theme.<br /><br />The stories include: The Cherry Tree Carol, The Little Fir Tree, A Merry Christmas, Really, Truly, Reilly, The Christmas Cherries, Christmas Dinner at the Cratchits, The Twelve Days of Christmas, The Cat on the Dovrefell, The Holly and the Ivy, There's Snow on the Fields, A Christmas Story, A Visit from Saint Nicholas and Baboushka.<br /><br />A Merry Christmas is a story about Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy who's father is away fighting in the Civil War. They have no presents to look forward to at Christmastime. Their mother promises them they will have a surprise waiting for them under their pillows when they awake. A Christmas Story is one told by gypsy mothers on the night of Christmas. A Visit from St. Nicholas is actually the traditional \\"Night before Christmas\\" poem made popular by Clement Clark Moore.<br /><br />Baboushka is a story of a woman who goes searching for the Christ Child and is looking still. She was too busy looking for toys and cleaning them and doesn't go with the three kings to see the Christ Child. Perhaps there is a great lesson in this story as God seeks our hearts, not our outward display of gifts.

With this guide in hand, you can finally take charge and manage your career. Discover your key career objectives and personal goals and then navigate the job market to land the right job. Ken Lawson will show you how to develop options, make choices and maximize your strengths through identifying your values, skills and personal qualities.<br /><br />Ken Lawson is a counselor, coach and educator who works with individuals and groups in a variety of career management roles. He discusses how you can manage your career, find out what you are really good at, move from one job to another, develop a career action plan, take charge of a job search, present yourself in the best light and how to network for career vitality.<br /><br />Throughout the book you will find little extras. These are fun boxes of trivia, a definition of an term, a Web site address or a fun character pointing out a very important point, a complete no-no, a technical detail or whispering the inside scoop to you.<br /><br />If you want success and satisfaction from your career, Ken advises you to put yourself in command of your life. He empowers you by helping you to paint your own career canvas. When you go to a party, are you proud of your answer to: \\"So, what do you do?\\"<br /><br />Are you more interested in objects, information, concepts or people? This question can lead you into a job which consists of arranging items (perhaps this could be a secretary who is organizing files) or coaching (where you are helping people on a more personal level to improve their lives through your own life skills). They are quite different types of jobs and your interests will show you how you will fit into one of the four basic categories of interest.<br /><br />Once you have taken inventory of your interests and skills, you can then determine your own personal style. Are you dependable, detail-minded, frank, fair-minded? Are you an extrovert or an introvert? You can actually determine your personality type as well. Once you know who you are and what you want to do, Ken takes you to the next step. Gearing up for your job search.<br /><br />The all important resume is discussed in detail. What do you put in a resume? What should you NEVER put in a resume?<br /><br />If you still want to do more research (this book is comprehensive), you can look for some of the books in the resource section. There is also a list of Web sites you can visit that look very helpful. A simple glossary and index, make your life easier and help you save time.

They work worldwide with children's charities and grassroots organizations to raise the importance of parenting.<br /><br />While many books focus on diapers, feeding and childhood illnesses, this is a funny and serious book which inspires parents to realize how to nurture their children. This is a book by parents for parents. The authors feel that parents and other suitable resource people are the best equipped to decide how to raise children.<br /><br />The ideas and methods described in this book are suggestions and options offered from the lives and experiences of other parents. Readers should use their own good judgment in deciding if these ideas are well suited for their family. The book is written so that it reads smoothly. They use the word \\"them\\" instead of he/she.<br /><br />There are also plenty of funny cartoons and a special \\"Father's Diary\\" is scattered in excerpts throughout the book. The humor is hilarious and you just have to laugh when you read the funny question and answer section on pregnancy.<br /><br />Q: \\"What is the most common pregnancy craving?\\"<br /><br />A: For men to be the ones who get pregnant.<br /><br />There are over 30 activity pages with practical things you can do in order to help your child at each stage of growth. True life stories will show you how other parents survived and conquered the daily challenges of family life during each stage. The five stages of early childhood include: pregnancy, babe-in-arms, mobile baby, toddlers, pre-school children.<br /><br />If you are just trying to decide when to have a baby (as I am! eternally) or trying to figure out how you can help your relationship stay strong through the process of having children, you will want to read this book.<br /><br />How do you teach a child about the feelings of others? How do you handle being a single parent? Can bath time, car time and shopping time REALLY be fun? How can you teach good behavior without using fear or physical punishment?<br /><br />I guess the quote on the first page of this book is quite an emotional statement if you are just dreaming about the possibility of having a baby. I thought it was one of the most beautiful quotes about children I have read so far.<br /><br />I think all men should read what Steve has written here: \\"By the time your children are raised, you may be five times the man you would have been if you'd stayed childless.\\" There is something very emotional about imagining the man you love is holding your child. Perhaps it is the sense of overwhelming love, but it always makes me feel a bit teary eyed. I think this book will do that to you. It is so real and down-to-earth in its approach.<br /><br />The first chapter deals with the issues I am facing and an issue many people are facing at this very moment. \\"Are we ready for a baby?\\" They have this \\"Mixed-feelings\\" exercise which tells you to \\"pretend you are already pregnant.\\" Do you enjoy being child-free or do you really want to bring a child into your life? I think fear is a main problem because it is such a huge responsibility. So, you can take: \\"The Ready or Not Test!\\"<br /><br />In the \\"Birth Experience\\" chapter you get to read about real-life experiences. The three stages of discipline goes to the heart of discipline. A special section also helps your child to build motor skills and prepare for school. There is also a beautiful poem at the end of the book you might want to frame. A list of useful addresses and a great index makes this book practical and easy-to-use, even for the busy parent.<br /><br />The pictures are so real to life, they will make you smile. All those baby pictures...sigh...now my clock is ticking again!!!! I know you will feel a connection to this book, whether you have children or are just thinking about becoming a parent. I have recently also reviewed many books by Dr. Miriam Stoppard (see my other reviews) which I just think are excellent but didn't create the same \\"I want to have a baby\\" response this book will.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewaby\\" response this book will.     ~The Rebecca Review	2001-05-15

He becomes completely absorbed in his cooking and his love of food is very contagious.<br /><br />In Ainsley Harriott's Gourmet Express, you will enjoy the tastiest of fast foods. There are six chapters to show how fast food can be made at any time of the day. The \\"Snack Attack\\" chapter includes delicious Celtic Samosas, a Hot Crispy Cajun Chicken Sandwich and even a recipe on how to make Nori-rolled Sushi.<br /><br />After learning to do the \\"pan swivel\\" from his show, in which you swirl items around in the pan while looking most confident :)...I thought I would try some of Ainsley Harriott's recipes. That one technique where he swirls the food around in the pan has been very helpful for me when I make my turkey meatball recipe. It helps to brown all the sides of the meatballs evenly. Who would have known.<br /><br />Well, I tried the \\"Parisian Mustard Sausage Rolls\\" which were just smashing. Now, I did have to use Crescent roll dough, which did work quite well and I used breakfast pork sausage links. We served the rolls with eggs and orange juice for breakfast.<br /><br />I find that when cooking from a cookbook by a chef, you can adapt the recipes slightly to your own taste. I left out the Dijon mustard and they were still very good. While this recipe was in the \\"Snack Attack\\" chapter, they work very well to add a gourmet flair to a breakfast plate. I will also keep this recipe in mind for a brunch.<br /><br />I am looking forward to making Butternut Squash Spiced Soup, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Lightning Lamb Dhansak (great picture!), Baconeese, Citrus Couscous, Golden Raisin Salad and Banana Raita. Each recipe has a nice bold heading and the text is easy to read.

If you want to treat yourself with herbs, but still want to be able to see your regular doctor and take prescriptions or even just take aspirin...then read this book to take the safest approach.<br /><br />When you take both drugs and herbs, there are two rules of thumb. One, don't mix medicines and supplements that have opposing actions. And two, don't take them if they have similar actions. Until now, this could be a confusing problem to solve. Which drugs can you take with which herbs and which ones could be dangerous when taken together?<br /><br />This is truly an \\"instant guide.\\" It features 150 of the most common drugs and they are organized by generic names. The herbs you should avoid are highlighted and there is an explanation of why a contraindication could occur. The common brand names are also listed and to find out what their generic name is, you just look in the index.<br /><br />There is plenty of good advice as well to help you maintain better health. When discussing Tetracycline, they say not to mix it with goldenseal or Oregon grape because they could interfere with the absorption of the tetracycline. They also suggest taking a mixture of lactobacillus, acidophilus, bifidobacterium, bifidum and saccharomyces boulardii to help your good bacteria in your system.<br /><br />So, say you are about to take Advil and you are taking herbs. What do you do? Well, nothing because they say there are no known herbal interactions. Well, that could save you a headache for sure! They do say not to mix alcohol with ibuprofen as ibuprofen can irritate your stomach already and this could make it worse.<br /><br />This book is small enough to keep with your herbal remedies and you will find it to be very useful. I have already learned so much and this book could save your life.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-05-08

The floating garden picture with beautiful pink water lilies was about as much as a gardener could handle for inspiration. The pictures of the nine waterlies were amazingly beautiful.

My favorite part of this guide is the Notre-Dame cathedral which was commissioned by Bishop de Sully in 1159. Being inside the cathedral is amazing. We lit a candle and then went outside and just gazed at the architecture. The South rose window and the Flying buttresses make this a unique site.<br /><br />Like all the guides, information on how to use the guide and maps to show where the areas are located make the guide very useful. After viewing the maps, you can learn about the way of life and why the food is so celebrated. A lovely pictorial guide shows a classic French menu. If you are interested in artists, then you can see an overview of all the famous artists from France.<br /><br />Architecture is discussed in great detail and is helpful for analyzing cathedrals. A complete \\"France Through The Year\\" guide will help you to plan your vacation to avoid or enjoy the festivities. An extensive history section follows and then you will see street guides, the Musee de Louvre (don't miss this it is magnificent and there is a food court close by which is equally impressive. You can spend a whole day wandering about looking at art alone.). The Eiffel Tower is explained in detail and if you don't go to the top, then you will miss a spectacular photo opportunity.<br /><br />You could literally spend weeks traveling around in France and never see it all. This book will make you wish you lived there! Since you will need places to stay, there is a complete list for lodging in all price ranges.<br /><br />If you are heading to France, I would recommend taking a tour or two in Paris and then keeping a day or so just to wander about and have a more leisurely time. The tours were great fun, but I also enjoyed just driving around in Provence to find quaint little towns and gaze out at the Mediterranean sea at my leisure. Being in Paris was quite fun, but I don't recommend driving there. It is pretty wild. It is much easier to drive around in the countryside and find a fun town when you least expect it. With this guide you can find secret little places like Cassis which I loved.<br /><br />You won't regret this guide or visiting France. If you have returned from a visit, this will revive all those wonderful memories.

How do you handle hostility in the office? The sections on body language were right on. You will see pictures of various poses which will \\"betray\\" you.

This is the type of information you will find and it is very practical. While some managers may already know this information from personal experience, I simply can't imagine anyone would know everything in this comprehensive manual.

Well, a picture of a ziggurat is about as close as you will get to the real thing. Each picture has text which explains the items.

If you want to know the history of the region, that is also included. You will find information on Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Religious holidays are fully explained and this makes this book invaluable for writers as well.<br /><br />You can visually take a walk called the Via Dolorosa, which is said to be the path Jesus took from where he was tried to Calvary. Countless pilgrims walk the route.<br /><br />If you are heading to the Holy Land, there is also a section of what to buy. I would personally look for the beautiful Armenian Ceramics and the Bedouin fabrics. I already order the Dead sea products from a company called ONZE and I see that this book also explains the vast range of creams, soaps and salts available. It is the best skincare line I have ever personally used and is good for use in dry climates.<br /><br />This book has it all and is visually stunning. Now I truly do want to visit the Holy Land.

You will find out how many books there are in the Bible, why Jonah was swallowed by a whale, why Noah built his Ark, where God gave Moses the Ten Commandments, who witnessed Jesus' Ascension to heaven and who first learned about Jesus' birth.<br /><br />Do you know which animal is mentioned the most often in the Bible? Who dreamed of a ladder ascending to heaven? All your questions will be answered in a special section called: Answers. This book challenges you to answer the questions and gives three answers. You choose the correct one. That makes this book very fun.<br /><br />The questions are numbered so it is easy to look up the answers in the answer section. This is challenging for children and adults alike, but is for ages 9-12. I think children have all the fun books! That is why I enjoy reviewing them. If you are a kid at heart or want to give a special gift to a child in your life, this will help them test their knowledge of the Bible.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-05-06

Anne Frank lived a secret life with her family. She had to hide from the Nazis and she wrote her experiences in a diary. This is written for ages 4-8, however I would recommend it for ages 6-8. This story has more complex sentence structure, information boxes an alphabetical glossary and a comprehensive index.<br /><br />When Otto gave Anne a red and light-green checked notebook with a metal lock, she never imagined the impact she would have on the world by writing her thoughts down.  This is in a story format with snippets from the actual diary.<br /><br />There is a picture of the place Anne hid and a picture of Anne Frank. This book just brings her story to life for young children. When people think of Anne, they think of her courage, her sense of humor and her hopes for the future.<br /><br />The actual diary was first published in America in 1952 as Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl. Anne dreamed of becoming one of the most famous authors in the world. I just wish she had lived to realize her dream.<br /><br />For me, Anne Frank is symbolic of everything that is right about life and everything that is wrong about war. Thankfully Miep Gies kept Anne's diary which sadly, she had hoped to return to Anne. I think this book will help younger children gain a new appreciation for the lives they have and realize that not all children were as lucky to live the life they live.<br /><br />Inspirational and sad, all at the same time. I have also reviewed the movie called: The Diary of Anne Frank (1959) which shows the beauty of the her spirit in the midst of an evil and ugly war.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-05-06

America has been having a love affair with baseball for over 100 years. Reading this book is a way to relive the nation's collective memory of baseball through its best and worst moments.<br /><br />Readers will be guided through the highlights of the game and will see over 400 stunning photographs from the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum photo archives. This hall of Fame is a not-for-profit educational institution dedicated to fostering an appreciation of the historical development of baseball. Over 350,000 people travel to Cooperstown, NY each year to enjoy the museums exhibits and special events.<br /><br />Nolan Ryan played for 27 seasons in the Major leagues and he was inducted to the Hall of Fame in 1999. He has written a foreword filled with his memories of the game.<br /><br />\\"I consider myself one of the lucky ones. I've spent most of my adult life making a living doing something I love.\\" -Nolan Ryan<br /><br />The text tells of little-known details and legendary records.<br /><br />All I have to say is...\\"Do men look good in baseball uniforms or what?\\" Now, if my grandmother sees this book, she will steal it from me. We enjoy going to Mariner games on occasion, but if there is a game you can bet she is listening to the radio while she is cooking in the kitchen, will be found sitting in front of the TV, or is at the game.<br /><br />I can't think of a better gift for a friend or relative who wants to reminisce over the classic moment in baseball. You can learn more about \\"The Curse of the Bambino,\\" World Series games from 1903-1999,\\" \\"The youngest Major League ballplayer,\\" and \\"\\"The House that Ruth Built.\\"<br /><br />This is the definitive story of baseball and is told in a way no other book has told the story before. This is a chronicle of baseball's greatest conquests and defeats, its triumphs, heartaches and joys.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-05-06

It is amazing how you can live in a country and never see it all. This book made me quite homesick since South Africa was my home for 12 years. My parents moved there when I was just seven and I did not return to America until I was getting ready to attend college.<br /><br />I can truly say, South Africa is perhaps one of the most beautiful countries in the world. The land seems to burst with color, the scent of the earth is intoxicating, the animal life is vibrant and the sunsets....are well...magnificent. This book brings South Africa to life in all her glory. Upon opening this book you will find a map of all the regions. I lived near Johannesburg for most of my life, but we also traveled to Durban and the Cape for vacations in the summer. December in South Africa is quite warm and is holiday season. Each year we would travel down to Durban on our annual pilgrimage to the beach. Oh, the beaches. What can I say? I cannot say enough about them. The sand is hot, the breezes are warm and the water can be dangerous to play in, yet the swimming there is the best I have ever experienced. You can feel the power of the earth so much more fully in Africa. The earth captures your heart.<br /><br />The plant life is also displayed in this book. Namaqualand with its dwarf shrubs and daisy-like pink vygie blossoms are presented so beautifully. South African Architecture is so beautiful and I remember being mesmerized by the paintings on the walls as we would drive by the thatch covered houses. Cape Dutch, Georgian and Victorian Architecture is also shown. The History of South Africa and the story of the Apartheid years is interesting for those who would like to read up on the background of this country.<br /><br />If you go to South Africa, you will not want to miss Table Mountain, The Garden Route, Namaqualand, the Cango Caves, Durban, Gold Reef City, Pretoria (where I used to buy great curry powder and now buy it online) and The National Parks (where we rolled down the window and scared my mom half out of her mind because lions were close by).<br /><br />If you want to know where to stay, there is a whole list of places. The index is extensive. I would recommend a tour. With this book, you can find out which places you would most like to visit.<br /><br />If you are heading to South Africa, I am very jealous and I must say...I was on lucky person to have been able to live there for 12 years! This book made me terribly homesick for my childhood home. When my father first went to Africa he fell in love with the country and returned years later with us tagging along. I thank him for giving us this amazing opportunity to experience a completely different culture. This book will also put to bed the myths that South Africa is a backwards country. It is very modern and is extremely beautiful.<br /><br />Sigh.....I really miss living there. It is a good thing I found a company that sells all the great food products we used to buy there online called Protea Imports. It still doesn't make up for fresh fruit off the tree in your backyard, or a walk in the veld or a swim the warm ocean. You won't regret buying this book or visiting South Africa. I hope to one day show my husband this land that I love. I think he needs to take me on a vacation!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewlf out of her mind because lions were close by).

This one is packed with full-color photographs and hundreds of terms and historical facts. The comprehensive Index, Appendix and Glossary also direct you to the illustrations you are looking for.<br /><br />In this book you will learn about the origins of the game, the Diamond, the rules, bats and balls, baseball gloves, uniforms, catcher's gear, fielding positions and techniques, batting, pitching, baserunning, managers and coaches, umpires, ballparks, keeping score, statistics, The American League, The National League, The World Series, The Baseball Hall of Fame, Baseball Cards (very important), youth baseball, softball games and baseball around the world.<br /><br />Author James Buckley, Jr., is a veteran sportswriter.

The following pages show the lives of children growing up in Egypt, Greece, China, the Roman Empire, Viking Norway, Mali Empire, a Spanish Castle, Renaissance Italy, Aztec Mexico, Moghul India, Tokugawa Japan, an Australian Desert, France, Industrial Britain, the American Plains, and 1920s America.<br /><br />A fun Timeline puts the book in perspective and a glossary explains words like Aboriginal, Castle, Legionaries, Samuri, Shogun, Tea ceremony and Fjord.<br /><br />Children will see the pictures, learn about the life of a child and discover how their life is so different today. This book was produced after consulting history experts and offers a fresh approach to history for young readers. The authors have degrees in history and education. Together they have written over 25 books for children on a wide range of subjects.<br /><br />Simply fascinating and educational. Children will just love this book because it shows history in such a creative way.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-05-05

Have you ever solved a problem in your life through a dream or woken up and had the desire to go back to sleep to finish a dream. If you have a vivid dream world you will enjoy this unique approach to unraveling your dreams and learning from them.<br /><br />Symbols will often appear in our dreams. In this book, a comprehensive thesaurus provides thousands of symbols and their meanings. Dreams will often have a major theme and unique illustrations show how selected dreams progress.<br /><br />Julia and Derek Parker are best-selling authors and are recognized experts in the field of dream interpretation. In this book, they explain the mechanics of sleep and dreaming and explain how to deal with the problem of nightmares. There is advice on how to create your own personal dream notebook.<br /><br />The nonsensical plots and characters in our dreams often can become more rational and sensible and comment on our problems and difficulties in life. The history of dreams is an interesting chapter and is well illustrated. The Mechanics of sleep tells of how we fall into a cycle of sleep. During sleep, we experience NREM an REM sleep and people need each type of sleep for various reasons.<br /><br />So, if you have had a dream in which you saw mammals, reptiles, winged creatures, fish, fire, water, earth, air, weather, trees, flowers or plants this book seeks to tell you why. There are a variety of dreams which are interpreted throughout the book.<br /><br />There is so much in this book, it is hard to even list all the dreams or symbols. What I was the most interested in was dreams of flying. Apparently they are extremely common. One time in a dream, I thought I had flown into the night sky. So, I went to page 147 to see why. They say that in life if you are trying to \\"rise above\\" something or trying to achieve a position or have high ambitions, that could be the reason.<br /><br />What I loved even more than the actual interpretation was the Thesaurus in which you can look up the images you see in your dreams. I can't wait to go dream something so I can look up my dreams again. I think this should be by everyone's bedside so when they wake, they can look up the meaning of their dreams. If you have dreamed it, I bet it is in this complete compilation of dream meanings.<br /><br />A fascinating subject and a look into the private world of dreams.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewan't wait to go dream something so I can look up my dreams again.

I remember my father reading the story about the trilobites when I was very young and when he saw the fossil in Russia, he remembered the story and brought it home for me. There is a picture on page 21.<br /><br />While I don't believe in evolution (and this book begins with that theory), this book is still extremely valuable for all the information it contains and the pictures are amazing. The fact that someone had to organize all these details is mind boggling in itself.<br /><br />Smithsonian Timelines of the Ancient World offers a new perspective on the past and provides a unique view of our developing world. It spans from the origins of life to the emergence of civilizations up to AD 1500. This book is richly illustrated and shows artifacts of each time period and region. Many of the artifacts come from the collections of the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. The photos of many items have never been published before.<br /><br />This is a Millennium Classic Limited Edition Collectable. The silver cover makes this a perfect coffee table book. It is not a book you just put away and forget about, yet you will feel spoiled owning it. You can look up any region of the world at any period and discover what people ate or how they used local materials to construct shelters and temple-pyramids. The pivotal developments of technology from the fashioning of stone tools, to the introduction of navigational equipment is shown in detail.<br /><br />If you want to know about the art of classical Greece, or how the Incas lived in the Andes, you can find it all in one concise collection of knowledge. There are more than 50 large-scale visual time charts, 1600 photographs and 100 specially commissioned maps.<br /><br />I present to you a book produced under the expert guidance of eminent archaeologists, anthropologists, prehistorians and paleontologists from around the world.

If there is one story in history that conjures up romance, valiant knights and visions of a golden age of valor, this story is the one.<br /><br />The author, Rosalind Kerven has written and edited several highly acclaimed collections of myths and legends from all over the world. She trained as an anthropologist and her writing reflects an understanding of various cultures. With an expert storyteller's skill, she retells the original Celtic and medieval legends to show the rise to power of a boy who was decreed by fate to be the King of Britain.<br /><br />Tudor Humphries was trained in London as a theater costume and set designer. When he graduated, he decided to concentrate on children's book illustration. His illustrations evoke all the magic and romance of King Arthur's story.<br /><br />Photographs and paintings help to reveal Arthur's real identity and the religion and chivalry of his court. On the contents page we find all the main characters pictured in a sort of photo gallery. Then, the story of the sword in the stone, miraculous powers, the gift of Excalibur, the Knights of the Round Table, the Knights of King Arthur, evil enchantments, the Holy Grail, the end of the Fellowship, the last battle and the once and future king are revealed.<br /><br />Even with all this detail, the figure of King Arthur is shrouded in mystery. It is impossible to prove he ever existed. Some historians believe he was a great warrior who lived in the late 5th century. The key events in the story are shown on two pages complete with a map of Britain in the 5th century.<br /><br />Painters, poets, composers and moviemakers have been inspired and intrigued by this legend. Most recently, I enjoyed watching the 1995 movie First Knight. My other favorite is the movie Camelot from the year I was born in 1967.<br /><br />Was Merlin really a Druid? Did Celtic noblewomen participate in politics and would Guinevere have been expected to play an important role in governing the kingdom? Did you know that the lady of Shalott died of grief because she loved Lancelot, but he refused her love? These are just a few of the details you will find in this book.<br /><br />This book makes it possible for children to enjoy reading about the details behind the Arthurian legend while also being able to read a full story. The use of photography with narrative illustration will captivate children just as the story of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table have fascinated generations of eager listeners.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewgrief because she loved Lancelot, but he refused her love?

Being an avid advocate of ancient wisdom, I immediately felt a connection with Wayne Dyer. I first saw his videos on Public Television. His relaxed manner and deep wise voice immediately had my attention. When I heard about his new book: Wisdom of the Ages, I knew this was a book I would want to own.<br /><br />Ancient wisdom is fascinating to me. It can teach us as much as it taught our ancestors so long ago. When I find a quote or a poem I feel a connection to, I collect it like a treasure. You know that you are learning something wise, something which is lost in the hurried twenty-first century.<br /><br />Wayne Dyer has captured the wisdom from sixty great teachers. They come from various backgrounds, cultures and religions, yet their writings hold truth. These are the writings of highly imaginative, productive and perceptive individuals. If you appreciate poetry, quotes, and prose selections which inspire; you will thrive for sixty days as your soul grows in a new garden of awareness.<br /><br />The words from our ancestral scholars hold keys to our own spiritual advancement. Wayne takes each portion of writing and unfolds the cocoon for us. He sets the butterflies of truth free to circle in our minds as we gaze on their beauty. He puts each piece of wisdom in the context of our lives today and gives a practical application.<br /><br />These short essays will speak to your heart. Each section begins with a selection and the explanation follows. Wayne Dyer is a natural teacher who so effortlessly draws on his own collected wisdom and the experiences in his life that most fully represent his new lesson. He challenges the reader to make his book a two-month project in which you read one section a day and try to apply the principles you have absorbed.<br /><br />As you read this great work, you will feel as though you have entered a unity of consciousness with the writers. Their world suddenly becomes yours, their lessons become a gift of enlightenment. Can pain in our lives help us to accent to a higher plane of acceptance? Can someone really make you unhappy without your consent? Can we turn anger over a situation in life into a peaceful and fulfilling solution? What are the six mistakes we all make?<br /><br />Here you will learn how to stop giving your precious energy to things you don't believe in, how to find a quite place, or how to become more aware of that feeling of peace you so desire. While I don't believe I am God, I do believe God can show his love through us and his son can live in us. The voices I heard through the words of the sixty writers did not conflict with my own beliefs. They reinforced some of the wisdom I knew to be truth and taught me more about who I want to be. I have just taken the first few steps in the long journey into eternity.<br /><br />If enlightenment means an immersion in and a surrounding of peace, you might just find it by applying the principles in this book.<br /><br />A Sample Poem included in Wisdom of the Ages:<br /><br />Lives of great men all remind us<br /><br />We can make our lives sublime,<br /><br />And, departing, leave behind us<br /><br />Footprints on the sands of time.<br /><br />-Henry Wadsworth Longfellow<br /><br />You will also find the works of Pythagoras and Blaise Pascal, Buddha, Lao-tzu, Confucius, Patanjali, Marcus Tullius Cicero, Jesus of Nazareth, Epictetus, Omar Khayyam, St. Francis of Assisi, Jalaluddin Rumi, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Sir Edward Dyer, William Shakespeare, John Donne, John Milton, Kahlil Gibran, John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley, William Blake, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Hentry David Thoreau, Chief Seattle, Oren Lyons, Rudyard Kipling, Robert Frost, Mother Teresa, Lewis Carroll and many, many more wise teachers.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewour lives help us to accent to a higher plane of acceptance?

Can you be relaxed and focused throughout an entire exercise routine? Do you take care of yourself, eat the right food, exercise on a regular basis but still fail to see the results you desire? If you want to improve your performance, your body can only take you to a certain point. Beyond that point, the mind and body must work together in harmony to produce superior results. Clinical studies have proven this to be true.<br /><br />Tom Seabourne has written Mind/Body Fitness to show you how to integrate the techniques and wisdom of eastern disciplines (Martial Arts and Yoga) with western methods (visualization and stress-reduction.)<br /><br />\\"The secret to success in martial arts, sports, fitness, and even life is mindfulness.\\" -Tom Seabourne<br /><br />This book will guide you into easy-to-learn relaxation and meditation skills you can practice anytime and anywhere. You will enjoy learning how to increase your focus, confidence and health using Tom Seabournes' techniques. He also includes dietary tips to optimize your mental and physical effectiveness. The easy-to-use checklist with strategies on mindfulness, goal setting and time management also make this book highly practical.<br /><br />With a background in sports and martial arts, Tom Seabourne will show you that \\"mindfulness is not inborn.\\" It is however, available to everyone.<br /><br />One idea really stuck out in my mind. Tom explains how when we encounter a problem, we can 1. Become a Solution. 2. Go Away. or 3. Change. He is so right when he says that the more we focus on something the more you will become it.<br /><br />This book will be a great motivation for your own progress and you will find a new perspective you won't find in most fitness books.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-04-30

His broken home life and abusive father only teaches him about the chaotic side of life. He finds an escape through art, yet his talents are not recognized until Grandmother Dahlen helps to give him confidence through her compassionate influence.<br /><br />A Song of Healing is a story that shows how an insightful teacher can make a difference in a young adult's life. Mr. Spencer is based on a non-fictional character named David Spencer (an award winning teacher) who made this book possible through his unique view of life. In Mr. Spencer's class, Robert finds a safe environment where he can be himself. He also finds friends who understand him and grows spiritually as he takes strength from his new found acceptance and applies it to the incredible challenges he faces.<br /><br />Chris Duschik also based this hopeful story on his own teaching experiences and observations. I recommend this book to young adults who may perhaps feel their artistic nature is not understood by others. As many seek to find answers to the education problems in our country, the answer may be found in knowing that we are all individuals with the potential to make schools a more peaceful place for children to thrive. If we can encourage love instead of hate, perhaps there is hope for peace instead of violence.<br /><br />A Song of Healing emphasizes the importance of human connections and shows how everyone has a song inside of them waiting to be sung. When we appreciate the differences of those around us, perhaps then we can too can sing our most beautiful songs and help to heal the world around us.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-04-26

When you shake this \\"book style\\" play pack, you can hear the musical rattle inside. The rattle helps a baby to acquire a mature grip which later will help in writing. In fact, this \\"book\\" opens up to reveal a number of fun activities for you and your baby. The three foam toys are covered in various materials. The surface, color, shape and sound of each block will fascinate and amuse. The Music tape (Mozart Beethoven, Handel, Vivaldi and Bach) will help to stimulate the part of your baby's brain that is responsible for math, logic, concentration and speech.<br /><br />There is a cute wall banner which will help your newborn baby to stimulate recognition and memory. It is not something your child could play with as it is just made out of paper and could easily tear. It is just a very small item and could be put up on the wall so you could point to images of a cat or pig and say the sound each animal makes. The mobile is easy to assemble and must also be kept out of the babies reach. If placed 8-10 inches above the crib, it will help to stimulate vision from birth.<br /><br />I turned over a smiley face on a piece of cardboard and found myself, well..looking at me :). It is a mirror you can hold above our baby's face so she can study her reflection and begin to develop a sense of self. Because various types of play will encourage your child to develop in different ways, there is a set of \\"48 game cards.\\" Each card encourages all aspects of a baby's development. Every card shows a fun activity. Fun and familiar rhymes like \\"This little Piggy\\" are fun and help a child to be more aware of their feet.<br /><br />The included \\"Baby's Skill Book\\" is just wonderful as it presents hundreds of easy ways to encourage your baby's month-by-month progress throughout the first year. A \\"golden hour\\" time clock shows the games and activities that will be particularly good at various stages of development.

This is my favorite Dr. Miriam Stoppard book because it is wonderfully organized and has plenty of great photographs and colorful blocks of information. The charts on everything from \\"What diagnostic tests are,\\" to \\"What to look out for as your child develops,\\" make this book the most practical book I have seen.<br /><br />If I had to buy one book for a new parent, this would be it. I love all of Dr. Stoppard's books, but this one is truly a book for mom and dad. This is also a book that focuses on the needs of the parents as well as the needs of the baby. The first-time parents concerns are examined and Dr. Miriam deals with every aspect from preparing for pregnancy to bonding with the baby as a family. The father's role in the childcare is also discussed in more detail. This takes a look at how parenthood will change your life and it offers constructive help on keeping your relationship alive.<br /><br />This book includes information on the needs of working women, house husbands and single parents. You will learn how to be a caregiver, supporter and teacher, as well as a loving partner. What I love most about this book is that it focuses on the \\"decision to become a parent.\\" This is much more than just deciding to have a baby. This is about bringing a child into the world and about creating an entire new person.<br /><br />The process of pregnancy is also fascinating. You will want to check this section throughout your pregnancy. Issues during pregnancy are discussed in great detail. On many of the pages you will also find a block that gives information about how fathers can take an active role.<br /><br />There is a section on \\"Sex and Parenthood\\" which gives some sage advice if you don't want to immediately become pregnant again. A section is devoted to PPD (Postpartum Depression) and explains why this happens and how to deal with it. The best part of this book is the large charts which show the development of your new child. It focuses in on \\"mind, mobility, coordination, social skills and speech.\\" In this way, you can keep track of how your child is developing and the beauty of these charts is that there is a whole section on \\"How You Can Help.\\"<br /><br />This book shows you what it is really like to have a baby!

Titanic 1912 (Dear America Series)	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Please mail this letter to my mother....	Margaret Ann Brady is a working class girl who finds herself traveling in first class. My niece Samantha introduced me to this book and as she says: \\"This is a book anyone can enjoy, adults or children.\\"<br /><br />The diary starts on March 28, 1912 at the St. Abernathy's Orphanage for Girls in London, England. Margaret's writing is filled with a wonderful English flavor and is very descriptive. This is a secret look into her life as she prepares for her trip and sails away on the Titanic.<br /><br />While on the Titanic, she has her own private writing desk, so she continues to write about her journey and about Robert, who it seems she came to care for. Perhaps the most poignant scene in this beautifully written diary is the scene in which Robert gives a letter to Margaret to mail to his mother.<br /><br />When Margaret sees the Titanic she says it was bigger than seemed humanly possible and smelled of fresh paint. She didn't know what to expect, but the sight of the Titanic took her breath away. What seems like just a few pages later, Margaret spills hot chocolate as the ship leaves a smear of red paint at the base of the iceberg.<br /><br />Through this book you can relive all the emotions Margaret felt as she entered the magical world of traveling on the Titanic. She even says she never wanted to leave and enjoyed reading books from the ship's library. Her story shows courage in contrast with despair. It shows the darkness of the night, tells of the sounds of people crying out for help and then of the rescue on the Carpathia. It is no wonder she never set foot on a another ship again.<br /><br />This book also includes a time line from 1898 to July 1986. It has pictures of the Titanic and the iceberg.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this book, look for: \\"A Journey to the New World,\\" \\"The Winter of Red Snow,\\" \\"A Picture of Freedom,\\" \\"I Thought My Soul would Rise and Fly,\\" \\"West to a Land Of Plenty.\\"<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-04-15

Lewis<br /><br />I was very young, when one of my favorite teachers started reading \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe,\\" which is the first book I read in the series. I was so dissapointed when the teacher read right up to the part about getting through the wardrobe and then stopped. She never got around to finishing the story...but later I did.<br /><br />This is a story of four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie, who are sent into the country to live with Professor Kirke because of the air-raids on wartime London. On their first morning, the weather is awful, so they play indoors.<br /><br />\\"What's that noise?\\" said Lucy suddenly. It was a far larger house than she had ever been in before and the thought of all those long passages and rows of doors leading into empty rooms was beginning to make her feel a little creepy. --The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe<br /><br />Lucy finds a \\"wardrobe\\" with a door hidden in the back. Because The wardrobe is actually a magical door to Narnia and she enters a snowy magical world filled with talking animals. I was just fascinated when the teacher read this: ... And then she saw that there was a light ahead of her; not a few inches away from where the back of the wardrobe ought to have been, but a long way off. Something cold and soft was falling on her. A moment later she found that she was standing in the middle of a wood at night-time with snow under her feet and snowflakes falling through the air ...<br /><br />The Magician's Nephew is my second favorite book. Voyage of the Dawn Treader is perhaps the most memorable because of all delicious imagery and talk of the sea. I loved Reepicheep the Valiant Mouse, he was so cute but so brave.<br /><br />There are tales of magic books, sea adventures and someone naughty turns into a scary dragon (great lesson). To find out if they stay a dragon you have to read the books and I won't spoil the ending for you. All I can tell you is that when you start reading these books time won't stand still as it does when these children jump into a picture and start an adventure aboard the Dawn Treader. These books are nothing short of magical. The imagination of Lewis is so powerful that the numerous images become a part of you and you remember them forever. Through the books, C.S. Lewis weaves the morals and beliefs children need to learn. Aslan, the Lion, has great significance.<br /><br />I will always thank the teacher who introduced these books to me, wherever she may be!<br /><br />This set is of high quality and the pictures are now in color! I could not imagine not reading The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe first. That just makes the stories so magical from the very start.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewt when you start reading these books time won't stand still as it does when these children jump into a picture and start an adventure aboard the Dawn Treader.

When I think of Oprah, I think of \\"awareness.\\" Her presence on earth is to bring us all to the awareness of our potential. If you want to know more about her life, Janet Lowe will take you on a journey through Oprah's life. Within a few hours you will see Oprah in a whole new light.<br /><br />What I find most fascinating about Oprah is her love of reading and quotes. Those are things I can relate to well. Now it seems, I have been collecting \\"Oprah quotes!\\" Throughout this book you will find Oprah's wisdom presented in an organized fashion in sections so they relate well to the topic.<br /><br />Oprah speaks from a background of adversity. The events of her life have changed her, yet she has decided to take charge of her destiny and become a positive influence. Her background is almost shocking when you think of who she has become. The contrast is sharp and it is very apparent that she drew on an inner strength.<br /><br />The book begins with details of Oprah's roots in Mississippi and her educational background. There is a discussion of \\"Harpo\\" and how she deals with her fame and fortune. Her generosity is impressive and her efforts for children's rights are commendable.<br /><br />There are some things in life money can never replace. I was saddened by some aspects of her life and see how her own sorrow, abuse and lack of a loving relationship with her own parents early in life influenced her. Some of the best things in life are free. Money helps, but I don't think it heals the longing we all have for love.<br /><br />Oprah's love of reading has encouraged others to delve into knowledge and better themselves. She also enjoys writing in a \\"gratitude\\" journal. Janet Lowe brings out the positive and negative aspects of Oprah's life. With more than 22 million American viewers hanging on her every word, she continues to have the instinctive knack of feeding their desire to find meaning in life.<br /><br />Oprah started me reviewing because after seeing Gary Zukav on her show, I wanted to know more about the books she was talking about and knew others would also want to know more. I thought maybe I could help others see what was in his books.<br /><br />Oprah sent me on a journey to delve into the minds of our time. A journey of discovery I have just started on!

These stories capture the imagination and reach the soul.<br /><br />\\"A Christmas Dozen\\" is a compilation of the most-requested stories since 1972. After many readings, eager listeners requested printed copies. They wanted to share the profound message of unconditional love with their friends and family. What a wonderful stocking stuffer this is for children and adults alike.<br /><br />These stories were written for reading out loud, but are equally enjoyable to read while curled up on the couch with a cup of hot chocolate. The first story captured my heart so quickly, I was surprised. In \\"Christmas 1944\\" you will feel \\"shivers\\" as you realize there are two enemies staring at one another in the night. Then, the actions of the two soldiers will evoke a deep sense of compassion as you realize that we are all just souls that want to live in peace.<br /><br />In \\"A Christmas Dozen,\\" also the name of a story in the book, a black Labrador named \\"Otis\\" is left behind in the snow and meets a cat who is about to have kittens.

Then, take another step to \\"Pouvez-vous parler plus lentement, s'il vous plait?\\"<br /><br />This was like stepping back to French class in the days of high school. The book is divided up into sections. You can learn useful everyday phrases, colloquialisms, the days, months, seasons, and numbers. Then go on to learn staying in hotels or ordering when eating out. There is a handy menu guide. It is easy to keep the phrase book in your purse or pocket, it is that small.

It is surrounded by a garden filled with uncommon, scarce plants and flowers emitting even rarer fragrances.<br /><br />While on my first trip to France I was only a teenager, my second trip was the year after I got married.

According to Dr. Edward Bach, they can help us deal with the negative emotions which are believed to be the cause of disease. Dr. Bach abandoned orthodox medicine to become a pioneer in the field of flower remedies.<br /><br />Jeremy Harwood presents the theory and practice of the 38 Bach flower remedies with a jargon-free approach. He takes each remedy and briefly describes the use to give emotional and physical relief. Each plant is displayed in color and adds so much to the understanding of how plants help us to heal.<br /><br />\\"It is not the disease that is of importance, it is the patient, the way in which he or she is affected, which is our true guide to healing.\\" Dr. Edward Bach<br /><br />Flower remedies promote a positive outlook on life. Fear, uncertainty, lack of interest, loneliness, over-sensitivity, despair and anxiety have a negative affect.<br /><br />A remedy for \\"fear\\" is called Mimulus. This can help people who are afraid of social contact and will help people confront their worries and anxieties. Mimulus is described in detail. To take any of the remedies, it is recommended that two drops of the tincture is to be used in a glass of water. You can then sip the water four times a day.

While living in Africa we would often rescue frogs from our pool. Sometimes eggs had already been laid and the eggs were wrapped in a clear jelly. In the stream near our home we would collect tadpoles and take them home to show mom. Sometimes we found what we thought were miniature frogs. They were just baby frogs and we were sent back to the stream to release them so they could grow up and be productive insect hunters.<br /><br />Yes, there is a certain wonder in watching animals grow up in the wild and that is how it should be in an ideal world. This same wonder can be transmitted through books with stunning photographs.<br /><br />Eyewitness Readers are designed in conjunction with leading literary experts. The engaging easy-to-read stories are accompanied by photographs which show every detail in full color and with great clarity. DK is known for this great quality. This book is level one and is for children who are just beginning to read.<br /><br />Level one contains picture dictionary boxes, word repetition, limited vocabulary and simple sentences. Children can begin to read at the early age of three, but some don't learn to read until they are 8.<br /><br />Learning to read by the phonics method allows children to start reading earlier and before children will be able to read this book they will need to know phonics.

Children are naturally curious. That is how they learn. By asking questions, they find their way through the world of endless information. This book gives answers for children in four age groups. This includes age 2-4, 4-6, 6-8 and 8-11.<br /><br />While many parents will find this book a bit controversial, I think once they read the contents for what it is, it will in fact help them to decide what they want to tell a child and when. It is my understanding that this is a guide for parents to help them answer questions, so that is my word of caution to parents.<br /><br />Each parent will have to decide what they want to tell a child or what they don't want to tell them. I do not advise this book for reading with a child. It is way too detailed for the earlier ages. Plus, don't you want your child to think you really know all this information and look up to you with great awe. I am joking, but really some of the information presented was a bit much to tell a child.<br /><br />The sections on sex are very graphic and tell all. Now that you are all pulling out your credit cards.....shall I go on? Well on a more serious note, do I want my children to know the mechanics of sex if I want them to abstain until they are married. Then on the other hand, do I want my child to be prepared to fight off a molester? Yes! So, what do I tell a child at a young age so they are safe. That is the trick question and this book will help parents to know what to tell a child and at what age. This book deals with very difficult issues, ones that even adults don't want to deal with, like divorce.<br /><br />It is sad that children can't grow up in a perfect world and what is a parent to do when their child comes home with questions about life as they know it. In this day and age, children sometimes have to learn \\"survival skills.\\" Subjects like drugs and alcohol are things you have to discuss with a child in order to protect them from getting physically harmed. Dr. Miriam Stoppard has a very open policy. She believes in keeping the lines of communication open between the parent and child from a very early age. She believes this helps to prevent the typical teenage withdrawal.<br /><br />Some of the questions included are:<br /><br />Where did I come from? Does the baby grow inside you? How does the baby get out? What is sex? (then a bunch of sexual questions I will let you discover on your own) Why can't I take my clothes off? What happens when you die? Why do some babies die? Who is God? What is Religion? Where did Mommy/Daddy go? What's a divorce? Why am I adopted? Why can't I make friends? Why do I have to go to school? Why is my skin color different? Why can't she walk? Do I have to eat meat? Why can't I talk to strangers? What is a bully? What does violence mean? What is alcohol? Why is smoking bad for you? What are drugs?<br /><br />As you can see these are issues children have to deal with. I can't think of a subject this book doesn't cover. While the guidelines are practical, use your own moral standards to decide how much you will tell your child. The age chart is helpful, yet I recommend this book with a word of caution. Dr. Miriam Stoppard says this: \\"To no child is my whole answer necessary. Pick and choose; discard and invent; reject and create.\\" I can heartily  agree with that advice and in that way this book can become very useful as a tool for parents to use to help a child understand the world around them.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewin keeping the lines of communication open between the parent and child from a very early age.

When they start asking questions about what happens to the food they eat you will know it is time to buy them this book. The book has two punch holes in the top which can be used to hang this book up on the wall. This book can be opened and unfolded by a child and does have that potential for use while the child is seated on the floor.<br /><br />I recommend helping a child hang this in their room, but don't leave it up at night. It could be quite scary to see a skeleton hanging on the wall in the middle of the night!<br /><br />Children will enjoy learning about the bones in the body, the brain and nerves, the digestive system and the muscular structure. There are plenty of fun details printed all around the pull-out and the pop-up portions look durable.<br /><br />Younger children will need to be taught how to unfold this book as the potential for tearing even the durable paper is a possibility.

I think that was a wise choice and the author was very aware of the fear children have of loosing a parent.<br /><br />There is safety information in this book which explains how the disaster did help prevent deaths in the future.

Writing them is a true art and Robert Louis Stevenson is able to perfect this art by remembering his own childhood. These poems were written between 1881 and 1884.<br /><br />This is a selection from the most popular collection of poems about childhood in the English language. Each poem is accompanied by evocative paintings, which are as vibrant as the words in each poem.<br /><br />The paintings are impressions of color and light and show children and a few animals on beautiful canvases of cities, gardens, meadows and seas. The poems are about flying kites, cows which give cream to enjoy with apple-tart, flowers where fairies live, children sitting in the warm sun, children on a swing, children playing with toy boats and children playing in gardens who will never grow up as they are frozen in time in the beautiful pictures. Here is an example of part of the first poem in the book.<br /><br />THE WIND<br /><br />I saw you toss the kites on high<br />And blow the birds about the sky;<br />And all around I heard you pass,<br />Like ladies skirts across the grass-<br /><br />What lovely poems to share with a child.

If you are thinking about purchasing a new pet, you will find fun advice on how to select and care for a new kitten. Both pedigree and nonpedigree cats are featured in full color and with great creativity.<br /><br />Recent breeding programs have produced new breeds like the lilac longhair. Classic longhair, Persian longhairs, Marmalades, Tortoiseshell and Tabby cats are also featured.<br /><br />While this book is mostly about breeds of cats, there is some historical information to meow about. This book just \\"scratches\\" the surface. I also recommend the book called \\"CAT\\" by Juliet Clutton-Brock.<br /><br />\\"Birman cats are said to be descended from cats that once guarded a sacred temple in Burma. They first came to Europe in 1919, when two Birman cats were given to Major Gordon Russell in France by priests he had helped escape from Tibet.\\" pg. 22<br /><br />A section on \\"Caring for Kittens\\" will be useful to show children how to brush cats to remove tangles, make sure to give cats water and not milk, how to keep a litter box clean, what toys kittens will enjoy and how to make a comfy bed for your cat.<br /><br />The things I find cats love the most are toys which you can hang from a string and move across the floor so they can \\"hunt\\" the item. They also love catnip and that can be used to encourage them to use a scratching post instead of sharpening their claws on furniture. Look for a scratching post with a place to hide catnip. The ones I found attach to the wall and have a small tray in the top you can fill with catnip.<br /><br />Just remember, when you buy a cat...they think they own you. They will give you tons of love if you treat them well and with respect. If you teach children to treat a kitten gently, you will be teaching them respect for all animals.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2001-02-19

This book is filled with practical techniques to show you how to influence behavior and build positive interpersonal relationships in the workplace.<br /><br />Through an understanding of why people behave in certain ways, you can use practical techniques to resolve conflicts and build a committed, motivated team.<br /><br />\\"Natural instinctive behavior is not always appropriate in the workplace.\\" pg. 6<br /><br />Robert Heller shows how people adopt instinctive modes of behavior. This includes: reacting emotionally, avoiding risks, fighting under threat, spreading gossip, competing for status, dwelling on past successes, feeling more comfortable in small groups, drawing conclusions and fragmenting into small warring groups.<br /><br />In order to encourage cooperation, Robert suggests that appropriate behavior must be followed. This includes: establishing facts, taking risks, encouraging non-combative relationships, insisting on detailed analysis before judgment, practicing total open communication, recognizing achievement not status, learning from mistakes and choosing to work in cooperative groups.<br /><br />Robert Heller is a leading authority on management consulting. He shows how people have higher needs, such as pride in work. People want to feel valued. This book will show managers how to help employees build confidence, communicate clearly and achieve their potential.

Recently I wrote a short story for a friend and it amused her to no end, yet she said the ending was somewhat surprising to her. I wondered if I had in fact left something out of the story, which would have otherwise prepared her for such a harsh ending.<br /><br />I had never written a story before, let alone developed a plot. I had also never thought about how emotionally fulfilling a story would need to be, so I was a great candidate for reading this excellent guide. I simply sat down and wrote the story one night on a whim. I saw the story playing in my head and simply wrote down what I saw. It was fascinating since I had never experienced anything like that before. I mostly write recipes and this was new territory for me.<br /><br />Since I review popular novels and movies, I have noticed a deeper truth running through them. After watching \\"The Big Country\\" I noticed a theme of \\"pride\\" running through the entire movie. Everything in the movie revolved around the fight between two very selfish men. Most books which also capture my attention have a definite theme running through them.<br /><br />Since I read \\"A Story is a Promise,\\" I realized how true it really is. When reading \\"Kitchen\\" by Banana Yoshimoto, I felt cheated by the ending. Something was missing......\\"Had I really spent that much time reading, only to feel a sense of anger at the ending?\\" While I was addicted to reading the entire book, nothing prepared me for the ending, which seemed to drift off into nothing. Had the promise been broken?<br /><br />That is the problem with many stories written without an underlying purpose. Bill Johnson explores this in depth. This is the best book I have read on understanding the most difficult of all arts: writing! To create a dramatic engaging story takes and understanding of the underlying principles. Authors of the most popular works have tapped into this deeper understanding. They have fulfilled the promise to the reader.<br /><br />Bill Johnson knows why human's need stories. That is something many of us have most likely never really considered. Why do we love a great story? Is there something within us that wants to escape? Or do stories help us survive when we can't think of any other way to explain our lives? Do the stories we tell ourselves give us a sense of belonging?<br /><br />\\"Take away a person's sense of place in the world, and you'll have an unhappy person.\\" -Bill Johnson<br /><br />This book is a highly intellectual look at how to fulfill the promise to your readers. It is written in a more conversational style. Bill took his nagging feeling that there was more to a story than just the plot and turned his quest for answers into a book which can help you write that next novel or screenplay.<br /><br />You will discover how a story function like a promise, learn to develop dynamic characters and be more aware of the role of ideas in a story line. The role of conflict in storytelling, writing that first dramatic sentence and developing a plot are all discussed. By reading this book you will in fact be taking a fascinating journey to the heart of storytelling. This book will fulfill the promise of making you a better writer! :)<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewg many of us have most likely never really considered. Why do we love a great story?

And it makes me feel good to think that there are at least a few people out there who like a little history with their dinner. -Michael Hastings, discussing the site called Food Books.<br /><br />While this extravagant two-volume work may seem overwhelming, scientific and highly intellectual, it is a true researchers dream reference. I was almost overwhelmed by the sheer volume of condensed knowledge. I had to work up the courage to casually page through the two volumes for over a week. You can hardly hold and read one book while standing. The books are reference size and quite heavy.<br /><br />Once you open the first volume you will realize the incredible amount of work which went into this compilation. Not only did 160 scholars prepare over 200 entries, it was edited by an army of highly qualified professionals. It is in fact a collection of original essays.<br /><br />If you have a thirst for knowledge and a hunger for tantalizing tidbits, this set will satisfy your appetite. I recommend glancing through the book to become aware of its properties and then taking time each day to read about one specific food. Otherwise, it will be too overwhelming. I found the story of sago, cacao, chickens, coffee and onions interesting, yet I had read many of the history details in other works. What I have never seen was all the additional information provided in such detail, it is exhaustive.<br /><br />The author makes an excellent point by explaining how central food is to history. Without food there would be no life and therefore no history. The information on never before heard of delicacies and staples will delight you. You can learn about food from all over the world. Volume Two has an A-Z quick reference from page 1713-1886. You can look up anything from Australian blue squash to zula nuts. I will still have to go back and read about cinsault, damiana, lecheguilla, sea holly, tansy, viognier, and wampi.<br /><br />To further your knowledge of the Latin names, there is a nice index. For further research...which I doubt is needed...you can see the sources consulted. The contents pages are found in both volumes for ease of use.<br /><br />The index takes up the greater part of a fourth of the second book. You can easily find various foods on the contents page or look for every single mention of a food in the Index.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewge 1713-1886.

From the deliciously entertaining text to the tantalizing recipes, you will be seduced into reading this cookbook. There are 85 couple-tested recipes, humorous notes to make you smile and even suggestions for music selections with dinner.<br /><br />Chocolate, asparagus, chiles, coffee, basil, grapes, strawberries, honey, artichokes, black beans, oysters, rosemary, edible flowers, pine nuts, avocados and figs are all displayed on the body in a tasteful way. Yes, the models are only wearing food!<br /><br />The comments by couples who tested the recipes are perhaps the most personal part of the book. The words melt into the pages so easily and effortlessly. The sumptuous collection of recipes are erotic, inspirational and enticing. The recipes may encourage a playful, erotic, sensual or romantic response.<br /><br />The \\"chocolate fig bundles\\" recipe looked tempting, so I set out to make them. The satiny sheets of phyllo pastry smothered in butter told me one thing, these were going to be heavenly. I filled figs with the almond/chocolate mixture and wrapped them up snuggly in the pastry. They only took 13 minutes to bake.<br /><br />To serve these heady treats, I piped the whip cream into five little hearts all around the two dinner plates. I used sliced almonds mixed with more grated chocolate, confectioners' sugar and colored sugar to sprinkle over the whipped cream. The pastries were set in the middle of the hearts and served while still warm. I also drizzled these pastries with a little honey. My husband didn't leave a crumb!<br /><br />For those interested in taking things a bit further than cooking, there is a section on recommended reading, advice on selecting aromatherapy candles, sources for edible massage oils and information on how to make specific stages of any relationship into a reason to cook up something satisfying. If you are still hungering for more information, you can explore the list of books and food Web sites included for your pleasure.<br /><br />You will want to try the \\"chocolate hazelnut truffles,\\" asparagus frittata,\\" \\"honey-peppered salmon,\\" \\"espresso cream,\\" \\"grilled scallops with basil and lavender essence,\\" \\"grape sorbet,\\" and \\"Cornish hens with strawberry glaze.\\"<br /><br />After reading this cookbook, I seriously doubt that you will ever view the grocery store in the same way. As you walk down the coffee isle, you will inhale the intoxicating aromatic coffee bean aroma deeply with your eyes closed. Intercourses will make you more aware of the sensual pleasures of food. Purchase this book for the one you love, for those you know are in love and for those you want to fall in love. All I have to say is: \\"Yes, Yes, Yes.....buy this book and share it with someone you love!\\" This is a book for the kitchen, coffee table and for reading in bed, preferably with someone you love.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewlnut truffles,\\" asparagus frittata,\\" \\"honey-peppered salmon,\\" \\"espresso cream,\\" \\"grilled scallops with basil and lavender essence,\\" \\"grape sorbet,\\" and \\"Cornish hens with strawberry glaze.\\"    After reading this cookbook, I seriously doubt that you will ever view the grocery store in the same way.

2158397:US	50199793	R16U7HT411B0CC	0375411518	554495076	Julia's Kitchen Wisdom: Essential Techniques and Recipes from a Lifetime of Cooking	Books	5	207	222	N	Y	Lovingly penned recipes, from a lifetime of cooking!	After 40 years of cooking with fellow chefs and friends, Julia Child has developed a refined method for cooking her master recipes. In this cute little cookbook, she has also included variations to many of the recipes to show us all how creative cooking can be, yet how essential it is to follow the basic cooking truths. Julia was born in Pasadena, California. She then moved to Paris with her husband Paul and studied at the Cordon Bleu. After writing her first cookbook \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking,\\" in 1961, she appeared on many public television cooking shows.<br /><br />Judith Jones can be credited for discovering Julia Child, she is the best editor Julia Child could have ever found. She is very wise and once wrote me a nice letter to explain why my instructions in my own cookbook were too truncated. She loves the cookbooks she edits to have a personality and an easy flowing writing style. I took her advice very seriously and she has in fact improved my writing by her one small comment. It is with that said, that I can say that her influence on this book has only made Julia's writing even more wonderful.<br /><br />I love the fact that Julia gives her editor so much credit in the Acknowledgments section. Without great editors, most cookbooks would never make it to the publishing stage. David Nussbaum was also very influential in the writing of this particular cookbook as he was with \\"Julia and Jacques Cooking at Home.\\" He helped to gather information needed for this book from Julia's books and shows. He also spent time with Julia in Judith Jones's Vermont kitchen, working out the details of some recipes.<br /><br />The book I am reviewing is only 127 pages, but there is also a 288 page large print edition which I applaud Julia for considering and publishing. In both books, Julia presents soups, sauces, salads, dressings, vegetables, meats, poultry, fish, eggs, breads, crepes, tarts, cakes and cookies. The index is delightfully easy to use and I love the headings, e.g., Almond(s) is in a different color than the list following it. In that way, you can find the basic categories of Apples, Crab, Soup, Cookies, etc.<br /><br />When you read the text in this cookbook, you will almost feel that Julia Child is reading to you. I can hear her voice and that is what makes this book so wonderful. Each chapter begins with a fun note (or what you might call a headnote) from Julia. The first chapter is \\"Soups and Two Mother Sauces.\\" There is a recipe for \\"Leek and Potato Soup.\\" Julia explains the master recipe and then gives variations of \\"Onion and Potato Soup,\\" \\"Cream of Leek and Potato,\\" and \\"Watercress Soup.\\" What you will learn from this book is \\"techniques.\\" This allows you to create your own recipes. In cooking there are certain proven cooking methods and that is what I believe Julia is trying to show you. You learn to make a white sauce and a hollandaise sauce in the first chapter. The style of the master recipes is similar throughout the book. Each one has a nice heading of a different color, ingredients are listed in the order they will be used and the instructions are easy-to-read, yet do not have numbers. The Variations for the recipes are in a paragraph style, but also have nice headings in a different color. Each page has two columns of text.<br /><br />In the second chapter, you will enjoy learning to make a \\"Basic Vinaigrette Dressing.\\" The variations sound just delicious and there is also advice in a small block which explains how to keep your vinaigrette fresh for several days. Throughout the book you will find little blocks of text with a pink background. These must be some of Julia's secrets. This is a book you will want to read and absorb.<br /><br />In the third chapter, Julia has charts for blanching and boiling vegetables. She says: \\"When you serve fine, fresh green vegetables, you want them to show off their color.\\" She gives some sage advice on how to accomplish this. The chapter on \\"Meats, Poultry and Fish\\" is an introduction into saut&eacute;ing, broiling, roasting, stewing, braising, poaching and steaming.<br /><br />Then, onto French Omelets and dreamy souffl&eacute;s. You will enjoy learning how to make molded dessert custards or as we know them to be, \\"Caramel Custards\\". She makes a \\"Classic Custard Sauce,\\" a \\"Pastry Cream\\" and finishes the chapter on eggs with a \\"Classic Chocolate Mousse.\\"<br /><br />Julia Child knows that you could just use a ready-made pie shell, but thinks it is a shame if you can't make one yourself. With that, I can agree. So, in her Bread Chapter, she not only explains how to make basic bread dough, she shows us how to make an all-purpose pie dough. \\"Cakes and Cookies\\" follow this chapter. This will soon become one of your favorite chapters. Now, there is one thing you will want to know when making Julia's recipes. She uses a different method for measuring flour than I do. She sifts the flour into the cups and then sweeps off the excess. That will be key to your success where noted. I personally only use that method when making pie crusts, because I create my recipes by the dip and sweep method, which is the lazy way! You will notice that in her directions, she will say 1/2 cup cake flour (sifted and measured as per the box on page 97.) I was delighted to find a recipe for \\"Cat's Tongues.\\" While I had heard of these finger-shaped sugar cookies, I had no idea what they tasted like.<br /><br />I recommend this book to new cooks, especially because these are the master recipes I learned when I was learning to cook as a teenager in cooking class. For experienced cooks, you will enjoy the variations.

After visiting the Herb Farm quite a few times, I was very excited to hear that Jerry Traunfeld was writing an Herbfarm Cookbook. I waited patiently for what seemed like years, and finally the wait paid off. Jerry Traunfeld is the Executive Chef at the Herbfarm Restaurant, which has actually changed locations since the publication of this book. Jerry still relies on herb-inspired menus and has penned one of the most useful books about cooking with culinary herbs. This is the book you will turn to for inspiration and for a whole new world of fresh herb flavors.<br /><br />Most of us are content to use dried herbs until we discover fresh herbs. The bonus in Jerry's new book is that he also explains the growing process. You will love the charts of Latin herb names, real-life herb names, family life cycles, heights, pruning requirements and special growing requirements. I loved the in-depth information on angelica, anise, hyssop, basil, bay, chervil, cilantro, dill, fennel, lavender, lemon balm, lemon verbena, lovage, marjoram, mint, oregano, parsley, rosemary, sage, savory, scented geraniums, sorrel, sweet cicely, tarragon and thyme.<br /><br />To find these wonderful plants, all you have to do is order seeds or plants from the sources on page 434. You will also see an address for the Herb Farm which was founded by Lola and Bill Zimmerman. Their son Ron Zimmerman and his wife Carrie first had the idea to start a world-class restaurant. Jerry Traunfeld helped to make their dream a reality.<br /><br />If you do start to grow your own herbs, you might be wondering what to do with so many fresh herbs when you take them into the kitchen. With The Herbfarm Cookbook, you will find yourself enchanted by recipes for soups, salads, pastas, vegetables, poultry, fish, meats, breads, desserts, sauces, chutneys and vinegars. Information on how to make candied flowers adds a fun creative touch to an already extraordinary compilation.<br /><br />The first recipe I tried was the Lavender Shortbread on page 288. The recipe is simply butter, lavender, sugar and flour. The taste...much more complex. If you love lavender half as much as I do, you will love Jerry Traunfeld's new cookbook. He makes the best lavender cookies and is also under lavender's spell as he includes many recipes using the intoxicating purple flowers.<br /><br />I made the dough simply by grinding the lavender into the sugar and then creamed it with the butter. I used a wooden spoon to stir in the flour. The whole experience of grinding lavender into sugar with a mortar and pestle is seductively primal. The scent of the lavender is almost intoxicating even when using dried lavender. A heady scent of warm lavender will fill your whole kitchen as the cookies are baking. Sometimes cooking is more fun if you use just a wooden spoon and a bowl to make cookies. Making lavender cookies should be more romantic and old fashioned.<br /><br />\\"I'm addicted to it.\\" --Jerry Traunfeld, admitting his addiction to Lavender. He continues by saying: \\"I find it nearly impossible to walk by a lavender plant in full bloom without bending over to pick a stem, roll it around in my fingers, and inhale the heady scent.\\"<br /><br />The cookies may also be packaged and given as gifts. I use a round biscuit cutter with a curly edge. It gives the cookies a nice shortbread look. The dough seems suited for a cookie mold, which would be very pretty. I found the recipe is also good with chopped pecans pressed into the top of the cookies before baking them. Now, dipping them in chocolate makes them even better! You can also use the recipe without the lavender or substitute anise seeds or lemon thyme for the lavender buds.<br /><br />Lavender seems to almost have a savory flavor which was in a way quite surprising, given you would expect a flower to have a more sweet flavor. I was pleased to find a recipe for \\"Potatoes with Lavender and Rosemary.\\"  Page 396-398 also contains information on how to grow and cook with lavender.<br /><br />This cookbook is filled with 200 herb-inspired recipes. You could serve the \\"Coriander-Orange Scones\\" for breakfast. \\"Tomato and Fennel Soup,\\" Pumpkin and Shrimp Bisque\\" and \\"Herbed Clam Chowder\\" are delicious examples of the soups in the first chapter. Green Goddess Grilled Chicken salad contains creamy avocados, garlic and a mesclun mix (young salad mix). If you are looking for a great basic \\"Fresh Egg Pasta\\" recipe, Jerry supplies one on page 99. You can then toss your freshly made pasta in the \\"Classic Basil Pesto.\\" Say goodbye to boring vegetable side dishes and say Hello! to \\"Snap Peas with Mint and Chervil\\" or \\"Grilled Marjoram-Scented Corn.\\"<br /><br />For a taste of the Northwest, there are recipes for Salmon Fillets. The one with tarragon looks especially tempting. For dinner, you might want to try the \\"Rosemary Gilled Chicken.\\" Rosemary is a classic herb to pair with roast chicken. Just when you think you have made pork every way you can imagine, you will find a \\"Maple-and-Herb brined Pork Roast.\\" The \\"Lemon Verbena Ice Cream\\" looks just yummy.<br /><br />As I sip a cup of peppermint tea, I salute you Jerry Traunfeld. Thank you for the gift of your knowledge. I hope your cookbook will be the most sought after cookbook in the year 2001. Your book had found a permanent place of honor in my kitchen! It is not often that you find a chef whose writing is as delicious as their cooking! There are 11 beautiful color pictures in this book, but the true beauty of this cookbook is in the writing. Jerry has translated his excitement for life and cooking into delicious prose. This is a true book collectors dream cookbook. If you love to cook with fresh herbs, you will love it even more!

2168543:US	50199793	RP5QXQTH7NFJ2	0609607502	150226186	The Martha Stewart Living Cookbook	Books	5	20	27	N	Y	An Eclectic Collection of Martha's Favorites	I was quite excited to see this new cookbook. As I paged through all 592 pages, I was pleased to see a recipe for \\"Moroccan Preserved Lemons,\\" \\"Tzatziki,\\" (a cucumber sauce), \\"Pistachio-Honey Torrone,\\" and \\"French Almond Nougat.\\" Those are not recipes you will find just anywhere. Many collectors will enjoy this cookbook for the tantalizing tidbits of information in the headnotes alone.<br /><br />The beauty of this cookbook is that it takes basic foods like \\"Macaroni and Cheese\\" and gives them a more gourmet taste. This can be a great inspiration to cooks who need some new ideas. The recipe titles of \\"Tarragon Limeade\\" and \\"Orange Pekoe Lemonade\\" had my full attention. I want to know how these recipes taste, the titles are so tantalizing.<br /><br />This cookbook begins with page after page of food photographs to show you what some of the recipes will look like. The \\"Fresh Apricot Almond Tart\\" picture looks like the perfect summer dessert, the \\"Coconut Layer Cake\\" has me running to the kitchen to see if I still had a bag of coconut in the freezer. When you see the picture of the Caramel Bourbon Vanilla Sauce, you will long for a warm apple crumble to drizzle it over.<br /><br />Martha has divided her book into logical chapters. You start with a few pages on Basic Kitchen Helps and then dive right into Hor D'Oeuvres, Breakfast, Breads, Soups, Salads, Vegetables, Potatoes, Pasta, Rice and Grains, Meat, Poultry, Fish and Shellfish, Vegetarian Main Courses, Desserts, Pies and Tarts, Cookies and Candy, Drinks and finally, Salsas, Sauces, Dips and More.<br /><br />In some of the recipes, Martha uses ingredients, which may not be familiar, however...just like in her magazine, she does not leave you stranded. The last section of the book includes a Sources Section.<br /><br />If you ever think a negative review won't sell a book, let me tell you, I bought this book because of a negative review. Yes, it is true. Sometimes that will sell a book even faster. Well, one of my fellow reviewers complained about the Macaroni and Cheese recipe being bland. So, being a investigator at heart, I had to know if it was true. After trying the recipe, I have a few theories about Martha's Recipes and the philosophy, which she perhaps might use in creating them.<br /><br />After receiving this book I did see that the type was a bit smaller, but it is not smaller than most cookbooks out there. I prefer a 15-point size myself, but hardly any cookbooks cater to my desire for a larger print, so I am going to publish one myself! What I did love was the nice bold headings on the recipes, the little hints and tips and \\"did you know\\" blocks of information sprinkled throughout the pages.<br /><br />When I read that someone did not like the Macaroni and Cheese 101 recipe, I had to try it. Then I read: \\"This is quite possibly the most popular recipe we have ever created.\\" page 244. Wow, now I really had to try it. So, we headed off to the store to pick up 18 ounces of sharp white cheddar cheese and 5 ounces of Pecorino Romano cheese. Most macaroni and cheese recipes are better with sharp cheeses.<br /><br />As I was making the recipe, I noticed a chef like quality to her cooking, but her directions needed a revamp. Not only should you start boiling the water before you start the cheese sauce, the noodles should be cooking during the other preparation steps. The recipe parts should also be divided. Had there been a heading \\"Topping\\" and \\"Cheese Sauce\\" that would have been nice. I also didn't like having the butter and cheese divided in the instructions but not in the actual ingredient listing.<br /><br />When making the dish, I could feel that something might be amiss in the cheese sauce, there was way too much milk for the flour and butter. 1 cup milk to 2 tablespoons flour and 2 tablespoons butter is more traditional for a cheese sauce.  Martha's recipe calls for 8 tablespoons flour to 6 tablespoons unsalted butter and 5 1/2 cups milk. That leaves the sauce in arather soupy state as most recipes would only call for 4 cups milk. Then she recommended that the noodles be cooked strangely. It is hard to cook them the way she did, so I just cooked them until they were done. That must be the key...to undercook them so they absorb more of the sauce. The instructions read: \\"Cook the macaroni until the outside of the pasta is cooked and the inside is underdone, 2 to 3 minutes.\\" page 244.<br /><br />What I DID LOVE about the final result...was the topping. The cheese and bread cubes in butter was SO tasty. It was quite a lot better than just dried breadcrumbs. What did I serve it with? Lemon Pepper chicken that I found at my local store. Very tasty! They fried up fast and then you could add a green veggie if you wanted.<br /><br />Well, I will continue to test more recipes. I found the Mac recipe good when I sprinkled it with freshly ground black Tellicherry peppercorns and then sprinkled it with Fleur de Sel. Now, those two things can make anything a bit better! Yes, it was more bland, but I think Martha expects you to season it to taste. The nutmeg flavor was quite good. The sauce was not as creamy, but I think if you undercooked the noodles, it would solve all problems.<br /><br />I recommend this book to cooks who want some new inspiration in the kitchen. For those who are just starting to cook, you will enjoy many of the recipes, but remember to season them to taste. There is also a good reason Martha might say something, so even if it seems to go against what you are used to, try the new instructions and I bet the recipe will work.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewlk.

The flavor of cheese can be buttery, rich, pungent, sharp, salty or delicate. Cheese is made from nutritious milk. The type of milk adds subtleties to each cheese and makes it unique. I enjoy Mozzarella made from buffalo milk. While I am hardly a Turophile (A connoisseur of cheese), I may soon become one after reading this book. \\"Tyro\\" is Greek for Cheese and \\"-phile\\" means \\"lover of.\\"<br /><br />If you are a border-line Turophile or are just curious about cheese, I recommend this book very highly. This is so much more than a cookbook. It is a love affair with cheese! There is a concise overview of cheesemaking, a collection of over 150 eclectic cheese-based recipes and a comprehensive list of sources for your favorite cheeses.<br /><br />After working in a specialty store, I decided to try a different cheese as often as I could. I learned to love smoked Gouda, creamy Havarti with dill, Pecorino Romano from sheep's milk, blue-veined Roquefort in salad dressing, Provolone in an Italian salad, Ricotta in lasagna, and lately Mascarpone in Tiramisu. In \\"The Cheese Lover's Cookbook and Guide,\\" Paula Lambert provides many unique recipes using Mascarpone, but how is Marscarpone made? Believe it or not, there is a recipe on page 73.<br /><br />Does your mind crave explanations for how cheese is made? Do you wonder about how cheese was invented? Will Paula tell you? Yes, and she will also lead you through your own discovery of cheese making<br /><br />Finally, you will know the secrets of Cr&egrave;me Fraîche and discover how easy it is to make homemade cottage cheese. Yes, Paula Lambert is ambitious and creative. She has the heart of an artist, the soul of a chef and the spirit of a cheese artisan. \\"The Cheese Lover's Cookbook and Guide\\" is truly filled with a passion for cooking with cheese.<br /><br />Paula Lambert also loves to travel. After spending five years in Perugia, she learned to love fresh mozzarella. Her search to learn how to make fresh mozzarella resulted in the founding of \\"The Mozzarella Company,\\" a cheese factory in Dallas, Texas. With the guidance of a cheese professor, Paula immersed herself in the cheesemaking process and went on to produce thirty-five different types of cheese. These cheeses are now distributed to restaurants, gourmet stores and directly to individuals throughout the United States.<br /><br />Paula Lambert has become a renowned cheese maker. Her cheeses have earned over seventy awards for superior cheese flavor and consistency. In order to perfect traditional cheesemaking techniques, Paula traveled to many countries. Her enthusiasm shows how fascinating the art of cheesemaking can be.<br /><br />I loved her section on Cheese Classification. She divides cheese into over 15 categories and illustrates them with common and exotic cheese varieties. Did you know that Mozzarella is classified as a Pasta Filata Cheese? I didn't either.<br /><br />Paula also includes a nutritional breakdown for many cheeses, a cheese-buying guide, a list for substituting cheese by type, a list for selecting cheese by flavor and finally a list for selecting cheeses by country of origin. She includes a helpful section on mail order cheese sources, complete with Web site information, which is very thoughtful.<br /><br />There are also many international cheeses you will want to try. No longer will the cheese section be a daunting place. You will go to the store with a new confidence and walk right past Velveeta Ville. You may find yourself asking for Boursin from France (a cheese flavored with herbs and garlic), Cambozola or maybe even Liederkranz. You will know the difference between a ripened aged cheese and an unripened fresh cheese. You will know how to select the freshest cheese and how to store them. When they are just little piece of leftover cheese, they can start a new life as a wonderful \\"fromage fort.\\" (Cheese with garlic, cream, herbs and pepper.)<br /><br />Most cooks agree: If you find one memorable recipe ina new cookbook, it is worth the price. In this cookbook, you will find so many recipes you will love! The picture of the Ricotta Pancakes with Banana-Pecan Syrup may just inspire you enough to make it the first recipe you want to try. I made them and they are delicate and almost cake-like. The heavenly sauce is a combination of pecans and bananas saut&eacute;ed in butter with maple syrup. I used real maple syrup.<br /><br />Most of the recipes are influenced by a prominent culture or are influenced by \\"fusion\\" cooking. The \\"Cheddar Cheese Grits with Roasted Garlic\\" is definitely Southern.\\" The \\"Risotto with Asparagus and Parmigiano\\" reminds me of Italy. The \\"Ultimate Cheese Omelet\\" is very French. Since Paula lives in Texas, she also has a flair for using local ingredients. \\"Southwestern Chile-Cheese Corn Bread\\" is an example. Paula's recipes have a touch of sophistication and are easy-to-make gourmet treats.<br /><br />Each recipe is presented on its own page, or two. You hardly ever have to turn a page to complete a recipe. The headings are bold, the headnotes are interesting, and the instructions start with a few words in a gold text, which is quite pretty. Paula's writing style is easy-to-read and her precise instructions are very helpful. The hints on decorating are wonderfully unique. I loved the dragonflies made from bell peppers on the \\"Savory Herbed Cheesecake.\\" These are the types of recipes you will want to add to your kitchen repertoire. The 16 full-color photo illustrations will inspire you to go shopping for cheese.<br /><br />Some of the recipes are modernized classics. \\"Bacon, Egg and Cheddar Scones,\\" \\"Apple Pie with Cheddar Crust\\" and \\"Grilled Shrimp and Smoked Mozzarella Pizza\\" are good examples. Many are perfect for entertaining. \\"Baked Brie with Mushrooms, Walnuts, and Dried Cranberries,\\" will be spectacular. There are soups for winter and salads for summer. I just made the Bed & Breakfast style \\"Bacon, Egg and Cheddar Scones.\\" They will have you saying: \\"More Cheese Please!\\" This is truly a dreamy cookbook for all cheese lovers.

When the Grinch looks down on Whoville from his cold cave, his heart is just as cold. He hates Christmas and plots against the happy people of Whoville. He imagines how much fun they will have on Christmas day and the thought disturbs him to no end.<br /><br />His plan is to steal all their Christmas presents, take all their food and basically steal Christmas from them. So, while all the Whoville residents are asleep, he dresses in a Santa suit, has his dog \\"Max\\" pull his sled,  and climbs down their chimneys. With an empty sack in hand, he steals all their presents and Christmas meals.<br /><br />In one house, a little Who wakes up and asks: \\"Why are you taking our Christmas tree? Why?\\" The Grinch lies and says he is taking it in for repairs. The little Who happily goes back to bed, unaware, that in the morning everything will be gone. In fact, the evil Grinch does not even leave a crumb big enough for a Who mouse. (The Who mice are very cute!)<br /><br />As the Grinch stands at the top of a mountain and starts to push his heavy load over a cliff, he suddenly hears the whole town singing. Even his ice cold heart starts to melt as he realizes that even his evil intentions could not stop Christmas from occurring.<br /><br />This is an amusing story which also tells us that there is more to Christmas than presents.  As the Grinch joins the feast, he gets to carve the roast beast. (I thought that was funny! A play on roast beef.) Dr. Suess' rhyming stories are eternally amusing and even make adults smile.<br /><br />Now, the funniest story in connection with this story in my life happened in college. Two guy friends taped their reading of this book, complete with little Who's high pitched voice. They then gave us the tape to listen to. Not only was this very creative, we had a good laugh over it every Christmas thereafter. I wish I still had that tape!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2000-11-23

It is about<br />two inches thick, the size of your hand, and is covered in a classic<br />black cover. This is one stylish little package. The book feels good<br />in your hands. If you saw it on a coffee table you would reach out for<br />it instinctively.<br /><br />\\"The Book of Answers\\" is a book of<br />mystery, you are instantly intrigued when you see its unique size and<br />the first thing you will think will be: \\"What is that book<br />about!\\" I first saw this book sitting on a shelf. I was one of<br />the last people to a book signing party. They were just putting the<br />books away, when I became intrigued. I walked over and found the last<br />Autographed copy...as if it was waiting for me.<br /><br />I opened the book<br />and saw a few words on each page. What I didn't realize was that I had<br />to ask a question first, and then open the book! Fortunately Carol<br />Bolt was there to save me and explained how the book worked. Carol<br />Bolt is one of the nicest authors I have ever met. She is just as fun<br />to talk to as her book is to read.<br /><br />As soon as I knew the secret of<br />how to play with this new toy for my brain, I was laughing out<br />loud. Carol explained that it has the intrigue of a magic eight ball,<br />but unlike the magic ball, this book has so many more answers.<br /><br />This<br />is the most amusing book I have ever found. It brings out the<br />mischievous kid or the thoughtful adult. In me, it brought out both<br />and the \\"little question box I used to be.\\" Now, if only my<br />father had owned one of these books when I was a child.<br /><br />You supply<br />all the questions, and then you can find one answer printed in capital<br />letters on each page. There are no page numbers so you can't<br />cheat. The only way you could try to cheat is to look up the answer<br />again. You will find that even that will not always work. Now, I will<br />say, this book told me the best answers anyone could have ever given<br />me. So much so, that I could feel chills going down my spine. It will<br />scare you when the answer is so near to the truth.<br /><br />The instructions<br />are on the back of the cover on a removable sticker and are also in<br />the front of the book. You place your hand on the cover, reflect on a<br />question, and then when it feels right you choose a page and read the<br />answer.<br /><br />Now you should be careful what you ask! The answer might<br />be: \\"Get it in writing,\\" \\"You'll have to<br />compromise,\\" \\"Keep an open mind,\\" \\"Watch and see<br />what happens,\\" \\"Only do it once,\\" etc.<br /><br />My husband<br />asked: \\"Will I make more money at my new job.\\" The answer:<br />\\"In a year from now, it won't matter!\\" Now that leads to<br />another question! Why?<br /><br />The idea for \\"The Book of Answers\\"<br />came from the advice her parents gave to her while she was growing<br />up. She told me it holds \\"all the answers to her life.\\" Now,<br />that convinced me to buy it! You will instantly recognize this as a<br />book of wisdom. Carol first self-published 130 copies of her book in<br />February 1998. She then easily found a publisher. This is why I have<br />the belief that life is a journey. Sometimes you have to follow your<br />own path to success!<br /><br />When I asked the book: Will we have a new president soon? The answer was: \\"It is Certain.\\" I cheated and<br />asked the same question again...to my astonishment...I found the same<br />answer! Apparently, that answer is in the front and the back of the<br />book. Now, what is the chance of that happening?  (Back to the book)<br />\\"The chance will not come again soon.\\"<br /><br />I will be<br />introducing this book to my family this Christmas. Oh what fun we are<br />all going to have! What a way to top off a year of finding great<br />books. Now this one is going to the top of my favorites list! You can<br />also really give this bookto anyone!<br /><br />Carol's second book, \\"The Literary Book of Answers,\\" contains all the solutions and answers you need from famous works of literature.

Lewis leads all the Christian religions to common ground. This book is in fact a defense of the beliefs common to all Christians at all times. Originally, these ideas were contained in three separate books. Prior to 1943 they were only heard as informal radio broadcasts. This is why you will see colloquialisms used and the conversational style of the writing.<br /><br />When you read C. S. Lewis' work, you can hear his voice. Sometimes I forget I am reading. Like a friend with a cup of coffee in hand, he sits across from us. He then leads us up a ladder of logical thinking. He starts on the lowest step and gives us confidence to climb the next step. He guides us through an incredible thought process to a conclusion, which is perhaps so logical it becomes irrevocable truth.<br /><br />If you were to fall off a real ladder, your body would simply be obeying the laws of Gravity. He brilliantly explains how there is an eternal Law of Human Nature. This is the law of how mankind \\"ought\\" to behave in order to maintain a safe and happy society where everyone plays fair. Unfortunately, we all know how our society has failed to practice this law in all aspects of life.<br /><br />If you want a definition for this law it can only be \\"morals.\\" A word from which many reel, as if a light was shining brightly in their eyes. To others: it is a light by which they see the path they walk through life. C. S. Lewis divides morality into three main sections: the actions, reasons behind the actions and why man was created. When you realize that different beliefs about the universe can make us behave differently; you can then make some compelling arguments in favor of Christianity.<br /><br />C. S. Lewis was an atheist (as was my father once and his writing reminds me of a conversation with my father for some reason, perhaps they came to some of the same conclusions) who later became a Christian. He is perhaps one of the most qualified individuals to discuss a universe at war, for the idea of atheism and Christianity could not be more diametrically opposed.<br /><br />\\"Good and evil both increase at compound interest. That is why the little decisions you and I make every day are of such infinite importance.\\" --C. S. Lewis<br /><br />Like a voice from the grave (he passed away in 1963), C. S. Lewis speaks as if this message was for the year 2000. I read this work 53 years after it was written and the truths are still eternal. Good and Evil are perhaps the oldest concept we know of. I found it interesting when he pointed out that without good, evil would not exist. That good allows evil to occur. For example: selfishness is undesirable, while unselfishness is desirable. The basis for this is founded in some deep religious beliefs. He explains how this all relates to the moral laws of nature.<br /><br />I enjoyed his discussion of the Theological Virtues (Faith/Hope/Charity) and the Cardinal (pivotal) Virtues (Prudence/Temperance/Justice/Fortitude). His chapter on the issue of \\"Pride\\" (the most evil of all vices) also shows how \\"power\\" is what pride wants.<br /><br />\\"There is nothing that makes a man feel more superior to others as being able to move them about like toy soldiers.\\"  --C. S. Lewis<br /><br />Through this book, you will gain a greater understanding of what holds us all together, what makes us responsible to one another. You may even conclude that those who find morals threatening, may in fact be the largest threat to a civilized society. If we all had morals we would simply have a safer environment to thrive and be happy in. It is simply the way you look at it.<br /><br />Mere Christianity is one of the most thought provoking books I have ever read to date! If you are at all interested in the logical basis for Christianity, this book goes to the depths of thought and reveals the essence of the beliefs behind the beliefs. This book becomes perfume, which completely seduces your soul.<br /><br />For Christians, it will be a reminder of the truth you hold dear and a reminder of our eternal life. For those who love the Narnia Chronicles, page 146 gives you an insight into the \\"time factor.\\" (The children in the story can leave the material world and when they return, time never changes.)<br /><br />One of my favorite quotes from Mere Christianity:<br /><br />\\" When it (Christianity) tells you to feed the hungry it does not give you a lesson in cookery.\\"  --C. S. Lewis, page 79<br /><br />On page 87 you will also find a beautiful passage. It is my all-time favorite passage to explain LIFE! It is a must read.<br /><br />This book will put your brain in gear and send you on a drive to enlightenment. I intend to read every one of Lewis' books. His work is deep, yet understandable.

Optimist: One who believes things are so bad they're bound to get better. -Jerry Tucker (1941-)<br /><br />When someone says they are depressed...what does that mean? Does life feel like it isn't worth living? Why would someone feel this way? Perhaps you have to look at the difference between happiness and joy. Not depression and Joy! Since happiness is usually defined as something which happens due to a \\"happy\\" event in our lives, Joy is more stable and in a way is a \\"choice to be happy.\\" Just being happy now and then leaves gaps for depression to sneak into your life.<br /><br />This is why cognitive therapy makes so much sense to me. If a depressed individual is actually chemically depressed, SAM-e is now on the market in America and doesn't have any of the side effects of the usual antidepressants. You have to deal with the chemical depression first. How can you think straight when you feel miserable.<br /><br />I think anyone can be on the verge of depression, often one negative though can throw you over the edge. Perhaps this book can work as a gate to keep you up on the cliff and save you from falling over into depression or can help you climb back to the top where you will feel stable and in control.<br /><br />I had one experience in my life which threw me over the cliff. To climb back up to the top, I had to change my thinking. To realize that life is worth living no matter what is going on in your life, is what brought me to a place of Joy. I believe having a religious belief system also is a great comfort to many people, as depression is often caused from a feeling of not belonging or feeling disconnected...perhaps without a purpose. A belief in a higher power is very soothing to your soul.<br /><br />Dr. David D. Burns, M.D., offers some interesting insights, which become extremely helpful. While it is difficult to always look at life in a positive way, it can be done. It is more a decision. This decision then puts you on the path to Joy.<br /><br />Most of the people I talk to daily are going through one of the 10 things on Dr. David's Cognitive Distortion list. Their thoughts have created a change in their mood, they feel sad over thinking someone has betrayed them, or they are anxious because they feel other people are thinking badly of them or are giving them negative feedback. The way they get themselves out of this thought process is to start to think logically and talk themselves out of the depression. Many are not actually depressed yet, but are speeding to the edge! Their thoughts are propelling them forward so fast that if they don't change course, it  will happen. I find it much easier to start thinking positively and deal with life that way, than to try to climb out of depression.<br /><br />I think you will find this Cognitive Distortion list intersting:<br /><br />1. All-or-nothing Thinking: You see things in black-and-white categories. If your performance falls short of perfect, you see yourself as a total failure. 2. Overgeneralization: You see a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat. 3. Mental Filter: You pick out a single negative detail and dwell on it exclusively so that your vision of all reality becomes darkened. 4. Disqualifying the Positive: You reject positive experiences by insisting they don't count. This allows you to continue to maintain a negative belief that is contradicted by your everyday experiences. 5. Jumping to Conclusions: You make a negative interpretation even though there are no definite facts that convincingly support your conclusion. 6. Magnification or Minimization: You exaggerate the importance of things or you inappropriately shrink things until they appear insignificant. 7. Emotional Reasoning: You assume that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are. You believe it so it must be true. 8.  Should Statements: You try to motivate yourself with things you expect of yourself. The emotional consequence is guilt. When you direct these \\"should statements\\" towards others, the result is also anger, frustration and resentment. 9. Labeling and Mislabeling: This is an extreme form of overgeneralization. Instead of describing the error,you attach a negative label to yourself. You think of yourself as a loser instead of just admitting you made a mistake. 10. Personalization: You see yourself as the cause of some negative external event which you were not primarily responsible for.<br /><br />I think even people who are not depressed can think this way. My two favorite quotes on this subject are:<br /><br />You are today where your thoughts have brought you; you will be tomorrow where your thoughts take you.  -James Lane Allen<br /><br />When we think of balancing our lives, we think of work, family and relationships. But we cannot balance these until we find an internal balance of who we are and what we want out of life. -Anne Wilson Schef, Ph.D.<br /><br />So, don't wait to find the help, all the knowledge in the universe is in books. It may be difficult to decide to change your thinking and take responsibility for each thought, but the rewards are so great. You can do this! I also highly recommend looking up the SAM-e book I reviewed. It has some very practical steps to follow and some great ideas.

I was happy to know that the word \\"whom\\" is almost out of fashion. I was however not pleased to see the author encouraging people to say \\"died\\" instead of \\"passed away.\\" One feels heartless, the other seems to be respectful. While the reality is that someone has died, why use such a harsh word in regards to a loved one.<br /><br />This book is at times witty and at times terse.  Patricia T. O'Conner has no patience for abbreviations used online. She doesn't want people using \\"CUL\\" for (see you later) and demands more responsibility with the English language.<br /><br />Does \\"Somebody forgot to pay their bill.\\" sound correct to you? How about: \\"In the past, I have waked much later.\\" According to this book \\"woken\\" is obsolete, so the second sentence is apparently correct even though it sounds wrong. I vote for \\"woken\\" because it sounds better.<br /><br />Chapter 5 (Verbal Abuse) is quite the hefty chapter. I was happy to see I'm using most of the words correctly. This is a section on the \\"most commonly mauled words and phrases.\\"<br /><br />Should you ever use \\"But\\" or \\"And\\" at the beginning of a sentence? Then there is a limerick to help you remember how to use they're, their, there and theirs.

These dreams soon turn into a series of nightmares as Abigail finds out that her husband Fred was a bit vague about how finished the house really was.

Lewis    I was very young, when one of my favorite teachers started reading \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe,\\" which is the first book I read in the series. I was so dissapointed when the teacher read right up to the part about getting through the wardrobe and then stopped. She never got around to finishing the story...but later I did.    This is a story of four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie, who are sent into the country to live with Professor Kirke because of the air-raids on wartime London. On their first morning, the weather is awful, so they play indoors.      \\"What's that noise?\\" said Lucy suddenly. It was a far larger house than she had ever been in before and the thought of all those long passages and rows of doors leading into empty rooms was beginning to make her feel a little creepy.  --The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe    Lucy finds a \\"wardrobe\\" with a door hidden in the back.  Because I lived overseas at the time I knew what a \\"wardrobe\\" was and actually had one in my own bedroom. The wardrobe is actually a magical door to Narnia and she enters a snowy magical world filled with talking animals.  I was just fascinated when the teacher read this: ... And then she saw that there was a light ahead of her; not a few inches away from where the back of the wardrobe ought to have been, but a long way off. Something cold and soft was falling on her. A moment later she found that she was standing in the middle of a wood at night-time with snow under her feet and snowflakes falling through the air ...     This is the order I read them in, but my friends here at Amazon recommended I read them in the new order:    1. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe  2. Prince Caspian  3. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader  4. The Silver Chair  5. The Horse and His Boy  6. The Magician's Nephew  7. The Last Battle    The Magician's Nephew is my second favorite book. Voyage of theDawn Treader is perhaps the most memorable because of all delicious imagery and talk of the sea. I loved Reepicheep the Valiant Mouse, he was so cute but so brave.      There are tales of magic books, sea adventures and someone naughty turns into a scary dragon (great lesson). To find out if they stay a dragon you have to read the books and I won't spoil the ending for you. All I can tell you is that when you start reading these books time won't stand still as it does when these children jump into a picture and start an adventure aboard the Dawn Treader. These books are nothing short of magical. The imagination of Lewis is so powerful that the numerous images become a part of you and you remember them forever. Through the books, C.S. Lewis weaves the morals and beliefs children need to learn. Aslan, the Lion, has great significance.     I love ships and sailing and intend to learn more when I have time.

The vulnerability of hearing loss is being replaced with the confidence of new discoveries and the promise of exciting advances in hearing technology. David G. Myers takes us through his journey to the silent world. He has lived through the panic of searching for a replacement battery for his hearing aid and responded to words that were never spoken. Later he realized what he had misunderstood or laughed at what he thought he had heard.<br /><br />Like a comedy of \\"ears,\\" he recounts the humorous and sad \\"errors\\" in his life due to hearing loss and takes us through a myriad of experiences with various hearing aids. Many of these accounts are laugh out loud funny, while others tell of a world where words are garbled, sentences lack clarity, and the sound of his own voice sounded strange and hauntingly distorted.<br /><br />Many in the silent world compensate with sign language, learn to read lips, or use computer technology to communicate effectively. The denial of the hearing impaired also points to the fact that it can at times be embarrassing. In his journal-style writings, David draws on his own experiences and explains the dread he feels when he must ask for a sentence to be repeated. He tells of the isolation he feels when he must mimic others laughing around him even though he didn't hear the punch line, or how he is determined to see his life from different eyes than his mother saw her own silent life.<br /><br />You will be amazed at the patience and love his wife shows as she finally convinces David to seek out an audiologist. Through a great love for each other, they manage to maintain an optimistic outlook, show immense patience, and stay emotionally connected. Together they offer sage advice on how friends and family can encourage hard of hearing relatives and friends to seek treatment.<br /><br />In the first part of this book, I laughed. In the middle, I felt well informed. The ending left me hopeful. I was pleased to see a comprehensive resource guide for further study. David is well known for cutting the facts down to size and for explaining them in a way that makes you feel enlightened, or at least very well informed. You will learn how sound travels from the ear to the brain, see a picture of the hearing mechanism, find out what 16 thousand hair cells are doing inside the cochlea, and finally wonder where your biology teacher was and why she never taught you this! (pages 120-128)<br /><br />\\"Why not do today's kids a huge favor and make information about hearing an essential part of their health education curriculum? Listening to loud music can have devastating repercussions.\\"  --David G. Myers<br /><br />After reading \\"The American Paradox: Spiritual Hunger in an Age of Plenty,\\" also by David Myers, I believe his writings should be in every library, home and school. He has the amazing ability to discover what America needs to hear. Through his writings, he has inspired me in my own life's journey and always leaves me with a sense of hope for the future. If you know someone who is dealing with this issue, I could not recommend this book any more highly. Not only will his words inspire empathy, you will gain a higher appreciation for your own \\"hearing.\\" I loved all the Web site information and thought it would be perfect for further study.<br /><br />You will be amazed at how many medical conditions cause hearing loss and realize how hard it would be if you had to choose between being deaf or blind. While my little cat was dozing off next to me and purring contentedly, I closed my eyes, so I could focus in on a sound David can't hear. I was also listening to a CD and while my eyes were closed, I still felt very connected to the world.<br /><br />Then, I opened my eyes and closed my ears with my fingers. I closed out the music, I closed out the cat purring, I even closed out the sound of the TV downstairs. When I focused on how it would feel not to be able to hear I became more aware of what it would be like tolive in a glass jar with the lid sealed on tight. The longer I resisted hearing, the more closed in I felt. Yet, I still could not decide which I would choose if I had to. Fortunately, with the new advances in science, many will be able to find great help in the future, and perhaps hearing loss will be a problem of the past.<br /><br />\\"A Quiet World\\" is a book which will bring awareness to a growing problem in our society. It will help anyone become more sensitive to hearing loss issues.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewresisted hearing, the more closed in I felt.

Images appear from nowhere, flat surfaces become three-dimensional, and pictures with paradoxes become peculiarly perplexing. This is a true amusement park for the mind.<br /><br />The lavishly produced collection of 150 color and black and white pictures are displayed in four galleries. Each gallery is followed by a page containing the explanations for the illusions. Under each picture, there is a short description of how to enjoy the illusion or a description of how to make the illusion work.<br /><br />On page 78, I found a purple and white Figure/Ground illusion. When you focus on the white images, you see kitchen tools. When you focus on the purple image, you also see kitchen tools. The picture of the cherry pie is also amusing. First you see a pie minus a piece, then you see just a piece of pie in the pie plate. The picture of the \\"Impossible Triangle\\" took me about 3 minutes to figure out. I really had to think on that one and many of the images do stimulate thinking. When I did figure it out, it was enlightening. For some reason the calculation on page 37 worked for me the first time.<br /><br />The \\"Heart Afterimage\\" was fun. You have to steadily stare at a black dot in the middle of a green heart surrounded by a yellow heart. Then, when you look on a white page, you see a red heart. The \\"Folded Chess Set\\" is so amusing, your eyes cannot keep the image in one place. The chessboard keeps moving back and forth and you feel like you are going to get dizzy if you keep looking at it.<br /><br />Now, I must admit....I cheated on a few of the illusions and still haven't figured out the one on page 115. There are plenty of scientific reasons to explain why the illusions work. You can look up the images by number at the end of each gallery chapter.<br /><br />As a child I was introduced to a small book of illusions and since then I have been fascinated with optical effects and visual perception. Vision science is now one of the most exciting areas being researched. Al Seckel is one of the world's leading authorities on illusions and designs interactive illusion and perception galleries for science museums. He is currently working in the Division of Computational and Neuronal Systems at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.<br /><br />This book will amuse and intrigue you. It will delight your mind and make you laugh as the answer to a puzzling picture suddenly pops out and surprises you. The images are unusual and you will have to take out a ruler and measure the tabletops on page 10. Then you still won't believe they are the same size! On page 3 you will see yellow dots, but as you look around the page, they start to blink. I saw black dots in the middle of the yellow dots. This made them appear to be blinking, but there are no real black dots.<br /><br />Welcome to \\"The Creative Intelligence of Vision.\\" You are going to love this collection of visual puzzles and enigmatic designs. Keep this on your coffee table to amuse all your friends. This is a true classic study of illusions.<br /><br />\\"Whilst part of what we perceive comes through our senses from the object before us, another part (and it may be the larger part) always comes out of our own mind.\\" --William James<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewareas being researched.

That was over three years ago and since then my family has enjoyed chocolate fudge, chocolate covered cherries, truffles, etc. This was the first candy making book I ever purchased and the pictures were the inspiration that got me into the kitchen. I highly recommend this book if you are just learning about candy making. It will teach you the basics of temperature which is essential to the quality of the candies you create. The only problem with this book: You will want to make every single treat!  In the back of this book you will also find a list of suppliers. I now order the best chocolate in the world!

While my poem was for children, it was chosen as a part of the Tides of Memory collection as it has images of water and rain.<br /><br />If you have ever seen your first work in print, you will know the feeling of finally getting something published. After finding the page on which they printed my poem, I started to read some of the other beautiful poems and was very impressed.<br /><br />The poems in this book are carefully selected and were all entered in a competition this February for a $10,000 prize. In celebration of all the poets, they also published poems in various editions.  This is a hardbound volume and the paper is fine-milled so it will last for generations. It is a perfect addition to any library or can be given as a thoughtful gift. I sent a copy to my editor who has been an immense support to me over the past three years.<br /><br />As I read the poems in this collection, I came to realize that the poems where a collection of human experience: sorrow, happiness, etc.  These poems are written by people who are living life as we know it.  These writings are an externalization of internal thoughts and are a powerful way to transfer thoughts and emotions.  Many of the artists have tried to share ideas which touched their lives, this is their voice.<br /><br />There are many poems about love or unrequited love.  Some poems paint images of nature as in \\"Autumn Leaves.\\"  There is a poem called \\"Washdays\\" which was written by a poet who lived in Africa.  I could relate to the smell of the soap as we used the same soap when I lived there.  I could smell the Sunlight soap as I read the poem.<br /><br />The poems about dreams, night, games, sunshine, mothers, sharing, truth, angels, flowers, summer, time, age, memories, learning, magical moments, rebirth of the soul, misunderstandings, life's journey, marriage, childhood, birth, frustrations, sorrow, guilt, cats, death, prayers, tranquility, whispers, butterflies, optimism, human rights and treasures are all so true to life.<br /><br />Here is a poem from \\"Tides of Memory.\\"<br /><br />Ocean<br /><br />Hear the oceans as it gently whispers in your ear,<br />As it softly touches your face,<br />So calm and peaceful.<br />Stand there and soak it all in.<br />Watch as the waves crash,<br />As the salty air blows in your hair.<br />It will be there for all eternity,<br />Whispering in someone's ear,<br />Blowing in someone's hair.<br /><br />Melissa Ursry<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewayers, tranquility, whispers, butterflies, optimism, human rights and treasures are all so true to life.

High in the Swiss Alps, three children are playing on the grassy slopes. Annette and Lucien are neighbors and live in Swiss chalets. Lucien is just thirteen and when Annette acts angrily towards him, he takes it out on her young brother Danny. After holding a kitten over a cliff, he drops the kitten (which lands a few feet below on a ledge) and Danny goes after it.<br /><br />When Danny can't be found, Annette goes looking for Lucien who thinks Danny is dead. Lucien is beside himself with guilt and turns to an old woodcarver for encouragement.  He learns to carve little wooden animals which he then intends to give to Danny. Annette is quite mean and destroys his woodwork and spreads gossip about him at school.<br /><br />The charm of this story is the lessons the children learn.  Will Annette learn to forgive or will bitterness consume her?  This story has a sad beginning and an uplifting ending.  The story has some surprises and we also find out who the old woodcarver really is.  Both he and Lucien tell each other their secrets and in doing so, help to heal the lives of three families.  There is also a movie distributed by Institute in Basic Life Principles which I would also recommend for children. As you read you can imagine the bell-jingling horses and sleighs in the winter.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2000-10-16

Herbs are in fact the best alternatives to over-the-counter medications and they have fewer side effect.<br /><br />I love the fact that regular kitchen herbs and spices can be very beneficial, so I try to add them into the foods I love when appropriate.  In this book you will find out which ordinary kitchen spices you can use for health benefits.<br /><br />So, which herbs work better than drugs?  Well, I love Echinacea for cold season.  They also recommend \\"astragalus\\" which is a herb.  It boosts your body's resistance to cold, flu and other viruses.  Studies have proven that it has antiviral and antibacterial properties.  Unlike Echinacea, you can take astragalus everyday.  Echinacea is for seasonal use and this book does have some warnings you will want to read.<br /><br />You will also find out:<br /><br />Which herbs kill viruses that antibiotics don't! Which wildflower can stop excruciating migraines! (Feverfew tincture/not dried leaves) How to improve your vision. (Bilberries) How to recover from the flu in half the time. (Elderberries) Which kitchen spice you can use for inflammation. (Turmeric) Which herb relieves menopausal symptoms. (Black Cohosh) How to relieve arthritis pain. (Boswellia, Stinging Nettle and Evening Primrose) How to unclog your arteries. How to grow your own medicinal herbs. How to heal your child's earaches. To lift your spirits. (Try lavender- my favorite) How to naturally deal with diabetes! (Fenugreek)<br /><br />Once you find which herbs you need, you can also look for tea in your health store or buy bottles of the specific herb.  You can also find herbs to treat varicose veins, halt macular degeneration, and cure gout with cherries.  You will also read why you should not take Tums for calcium.  Some interesting information on \\"chocolate,\\" and more information than I can list.  This book will help you to solve over 100 health problems.

Have you ever noticed how your mood is instantly elevated when you inhale the scent of a rose deeply and with purpose. The world seems like a better place instantly. Rose oil has a frequency of around 320 MHz.  Flowers are beautiful on their own and can lift your mood with their fragrance or with their petals blowing in the breeze in nature.<br /><br />So, what other secrets do flowers conceal?  Apparently, they can help us to change our emotional state.  The scent of roses is said to dispel anger, or so I have read!  In this book, flowers are celebrated as natural healers which can help us return to a healthful state.<br /><br />Our emotions can at times manifest themselves as a health issue and greatly affect our bodies. Dr. Edward Bach (1897-1936) believed that physical illness was a manifestation of emotional imbalance. He believed we can heal and balance the body with nontoxic methods.<br /><br />Some of the remedies include:<br /><br />ASPEN - For fear or anxiety IMPATIENS - For impatience, irritability and nervousness. MUSTARD - Severe depression WILLOW - For neutralizing resentment and bitterness VERVIAN - For tension and hyperactivity or overachieving STAR OF BETHLEHEM - For mental shock<br /><br />There are also remedies you can take for sensitivity, disappointment, muscular cramps, skin rashes, recurrent ailments, critical attitudes and bad dreams.<br /><br />Look into other health remedies like Arnica for injuries, Pulsatilla for nasal problems, Cantharis for cystitis, Chamomile tea for a restful sleep and Gelsemium for flu symptoms.  Look for a homeopathic brand called: Oscillococcinum for symptoms of the flu in the winter.  The theory is that a infinitesimal amount of a plant substance can stimulate the body's healing defenses.<br /><br />The closer you can match your symptom to the remedy, the more effective it will be for you.  I suggest reading other homeopathy books along with this one.

While the Mediterranean climate can give the impression of sea, sun, and fun.....Clifford Wright makes us aware that the climate can be ferocious. He also brings out the realities of the basic struggle for survival, what people ate in the past, and how government, agriculture, and religion determined what people ate.<br /><br />I enjoyed the delicious descriptions of gardens, stories behind the recipes, vivid descriptions of Medieval life, and the historical aspects of cuisine.  Yes, I did feel overwhelmed with information.  If at birth we tried to imagine our entire life, we would be equally overwhelmed.  So, I suggest taking this book by the spoonful.  Even though I love to read an entire book in one sitting, this book was not one you could devour in one sitting.  For the cook who's mind longs for cultural information and the historical background of food, this book contains a variety of interesting ideas and historical facts.<br /><br />\\"The story told in this book is a complex one because the lives of people are complex.\\" --Clifford A. Wright<br /><br />This is a story of the birth of the celebrated cuisines of the Mediterranean.  I have sat at an outdoor restaurant next to the Mediterranean and selected a freshly caught fish which the chef then cooked to perfection.  I have never tasted fish so well prepared.  Perhaps this is why I could relate to some of the recipes.<br /><br />\\"This book is a history with recipes.\\" --Clifford A. Wright<br /><br />The goal of the authors writing was not to overwhelm, but to give the reader a memory of why a food came into existence.<br /><br />\\"All cuisine is a reflection of the society from which it emanates.\\" --Clifford A. Wright<br /><br />So, with that said.....To say this is a cookbook is an understatement.  It is a history book with recipes to illustrate the historical data.  You will learn:<br /><br />The history of the fork<br /><br />That \\"minestrone\\" means \\"big soup\\"<br /><br />How to preserve lemons<br /><br />That peaches were introduced to Europe from Persia<br /><br />When Tiramisu was invented (but I could not find a recipe)<br /><br />Clifford A. Wright first sets the stage, then explores the relationship between the geography of the Mediterranean and the populations interactions with the environment.  Then he shows the importance of trade and how it caused cuisines to develop.<br /><br />\\"A cuisine exists when people are eating not simply to fuel up or sustain themselves but because they are emotionally and intellectually relating to culinary creations in the same way they might relate to a work of art.\\" --Clifford A. Wright<br /><br />In order to appreciate this monumental work, I found it helpful to see the book from the authors perspective.  From the first chapter, I realized the author felt that certain cultures had not been given credit for their accomplishments and contributions to Mediterranean cuisine.  He definitely promotes the significance of Arabic civilizations and also makes a comparison of the Muslim chefs in ninth century Baghdad to the chefs in France.<br /><br />Humanism, Feudalism, Capitalism, Crusades, agricultural revolution, ship building, and peasants versus aristocracy is discussed.  With such an array of interesting information one could be distracted from the recipes.  Each recipe does begin with some interesting information, while most of the historical aspects are written before or after the recipes in each chapter.  Here are the recipes I found to be interesting:  Gyro's, Baba Ghannuj, Scrambled Eggs with Asparagus and Shrimp, Lemonade, Shish Kebabs, Pesto and Shrimp Risotto.<br /><br />While I believe American food as we know it today is the best food we can find from everywhere....I didn't agree that Americans don't have a cuisine.  I mean, what are hamburgers?  I am sorry....but I could not help myself on that one!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewcould not find a recipe)    Clifford A.

David Essel is equally talented at hosting his radio program and developing a positive rapport with a live audience in a class type setting. His upbeat and optimistic attitude gives his lectures a fun, vibrant, and entertaining feel.<br /><br />David Essel has a great way of including the audience and they respond well to his jokes, spontaneous laughter and ability to catch them unawares at times. He keeps the audience laughing and you will enjoy his humor, while also becoming more aware of your inner world.<br /><br />This lesson is divided into four sections. David first teaches us how to have an open mind to new possibilities.  Through his own experiences he was able to accept the limitations of certain medications and tried something new, it worked!  We also learn how to accept ourselves, follow our own path in life and to take risks to further our own success.<br /><br />To hear David's enthusiasm, you would never expect to hear the stories of his own depression.  This tells me he is a man who has grown a great deal in his life.  He has learned how to bring happiness into his life. While he discusses St. John's Wort and other herbs, I suggest trying the newest cure for depression: SAM-e. It doesn't have any side effects.  St. John's Wort can cause sun sensitivity.<br /><br />Through the lessons presented, you will learn how to use natural remedies to heal the mind and body, learn to be vulnerable and say what you need to say, and develop a joyful perspective in your own life. David shows that a man can expose his emotional side.  After all, he wrote \\"Phoenix Soul,\\" a book of deep thoughtful poems and he is into sports and working out.<br /><br />He explains how we should not be trapped by who we think we are, but rather we should see the possibility of expanding ourselves and become a more interesting person through discovering our hidden talents.

There is also a recipe for Lavender Heart Cookies which Jerry Traunfeld has also helped to make famous.

Sometimes we have the image of \\"Stars\\" living the perfect life.  We imagine them having been born into the perfect family at the perfect time.  We sometimes forget that they too are human and have to deal with conflicts in their own lives.<br /><br />Suzanne Somers tackles these everyday worries, doubts and conflicts.  She gives practical answers and advice on how to find joy in your life, turn obstacles into opportunities, learn from mistakes, resolve conflicts with family, realize dreams, and appreciate yourself so that others will too.  While many may see her as perfect, she is human just like the rest of us and has a beautiful spirit.  Through the pain she felt growing up with an alcoholic father, she learned lessons and realized that she could use the negative aspects of her life to teach her about herself.  Suzanne acknowledges that the negatives in life are just as essential for growth as the good experiences.<br /><br />She penned her thoughts on life in 365 daily meditations which I actually read in one sitting.  Once you start reading and see all the lovely quotes, you will want to find more of them.  At least I am that way and usually read a book in one sitting.  This book was not designed to be absorbed all in one sitting, but when I review I like to get a feel for the entire book.  I would suggest that you do only read one meditation and one thought a day.  In that way you can apply the wisdom in this book to your life.  Another way you could use this book is to read it completely and make notes as to what you want to change in your life.  You will see that you have already learned so many life lessons just from being alive and listening to your soul.<br /><br />Each of the meditations are followed by a spiritual affirmation.  In each meditation she discusses something in life, gives examples from her past, reveals a secret or tells a story of an experience which changed her thinking.  Through her words you will notice a love for life and a spirit filled with love.<br /><br />An example of a \\"Thought For The Day\\":<br /><br />\\"Today I will do something kind and generous for another human being - not to hear their praise and thanks but just because it feels good to do so.\\"<br /><br />While reading, I had a pen and paper to write down some of the wonderful quotes.  I have noticed how people who enjoy life collect quotes.  The small, yet profound sentences can truly take hold of your life and will change it for the better.<br /><br />\\"Evolving is ourselves in motion, growing and learning.  As this happens, we become better, more compassionate, forgiving, understanding, tolerant, patient, and mutually respectful of all living things.\\" --Suzanne Somers<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewions are followed by a spiritual affirmation.

Steve Chandler's calming voice guides you through 100 ways to motivate yourself.  While listening, grab a pen and paper and write down ideas which will change your life and help you literally reinvent yourself.<br /><br />Throughout the tape, the \\"owner\\" and \\"victim\\" are compared.  By the end of the tape you will realize which person lives within you.<br /><br />Victims think power is beyond their control.  Their core belief is that life is unfair.  Owners are happy, not easily discouraged and say \\"I want,\\" not \\"I should.\\"<br /><br />I felt that the lessons where extremely practical and bring awareness to issues we all deal with on a daily basis.  If \\"thinking\\" is the \\"soul talking to itself,\\" then I can see why we can motivate ourselves through \\"internal talk,\\" or thinking the right positive thoughts.<br /><br />Steven's method is to help us learn the words to say to ourselves.  He believes victims are victims of their own defeated thinking.  What they watch, read and listen to  can make them happy or sad.  You literally have to reprogram your mind.<br /><br />Once you have done this and come to see the human spirit as a fire that needs to be lit daily, you can finally learn how to invite happiness into your life on a daily basis, no matter what the circumstances.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2000-10-04

While I purchased this book thinking it would help me learn about planting tulip bulbs, I didn't find any planting information.  What I did find was still equally enjoyable.  I learned that my favorite flower once grew wild in central Asia. I also found a creative idea for a \\"Tulip Ice Bowl.\\"  There is a short history of tulips and Chris Mead's photography captures the free, optomistic and swaying in the breeze life of the tulip.<br /><br />If you are looking for a house warming gift, this would be so well received with a bunch of fresh tulips.

He encourages management to lift up the human spirit and to create a more harmonious work environment, therefore creating a people-oriented and inspirational place for ideas to thrive and businesses to succeed.<br /><br />He compares the Autocratic and Democratic management styles.  In the Autocratic world, the boss has a sharp voice, speaks in a commanding way, asserts his/her power, demands cooperation, imposes ideas, criticizes, punishes and has sole responsibility of the group.  The Democratic way to run a business puts the \\"boss\\" in a different light altogether.  He now becomes the \\"leader,\\" with a friendly voice, he uses his/her influence in positive ways, wins cooperation, tells what he/she would like to have done, sells ideas, guides, encourages, acknowledges achievement, helps employees solve problems, discusses ideas, and shares responsibility with his team players/employees.  One of the main problems in business is an impersonal approach to dealing with people.<br /><br />Norman Jones calls this ...\\"Spirit Killing.\\"  It is one of the reasons so many people are dissatisfied with their work environments and turn to drugs or alcohol to stop the \\"mental pain.\\"  Spirit Killers include:  distrust, ridicule, resentment, retaliation, alienation, harassment, deceit, humiliation, stress, tension, fear, sarcasm, belittlement and embarrassment.<br /><br />These \\"Spirit Killers\\" produce demotivation, apathy and insecurity.  Not exactly the ideal environment for a healthy productive company.  Instead Norman Jones encourages institutions to create self-motivation through: trust, promoting self-esteem, giving employees a sense of belongingness, helping employees obtain job satisfaction, providing a means of recognizing accomplishments, and actually treating employees in a caring manner by listening and showing a genuine concern.  When managers learn to listen to their employees the company can grow.  Too often, their is a \\"top-down\\" philosophy in which all employees are dependent on their ideas from the top.  This stifles creativity.  Most companies which have our respect not only listen to their employees, they listen to their customers.  Amazon.com is one of those companies.  They answer every single e-mail from their customers in a very prompt and courteous manner.<br /><br />\\"Today's top-down management wants highly energetic, conscientious people, but fails to see how it deprives these people of fulfillment of psychological needs that could stoke the energy.\\"  page 34<br /><br />Since we all have a natural inclination to strive for achievement and need to feel job satisfaction, Norman believes America is hungry for business leaders who not only inspire us to be better human beings, but also encourage us to be internally motivated to meet company goals and be more successful in our jobs.<br /><br />\\"When people believe they are helping a company or organization, their self-esteem blossoms.\\" page 19<br /><br />Unfortunately,  modern day businesses use the threat of expendability to attempt to gain optimum productivity and in the process destroy the human spirit.  Like a row of dominoes tumbling over, Norman Jones knocks over old ideas of management and shows the way with new principles and creative solutions.  He focuses on how business has neglected the research available to them.  He sees this as the cause of many problems.<br /><br />In order to see America's work centers enter a new era of high energy, thriving and productivity in the years to come, the leaders, parents, teachers and even government will need to evaluate their approach to the current dehumanized workplace.  Norman believes our country's success will depend on creating a productive arena where the thoughts, feelings and ideas of employees can be expressed.  To do this managers must know how to nurture \\"good attitudes.\\"<br /><br />An example ofa poor motivational statement which is all to common:<br /><br />\\"Your report was a good one, but we need them faster and more often.\\"<br /><br />An example of a good internal motivational statement:<br /><br />\\"You can sure be proud of that report; it took a lot of work.\\"<br /><br />It was also enlightening to compare two letters written by a manager to a difficult employee.  In the first letter the use of \\"I\\" permeated the letter and caused it to seem demanding and arrogant.  In the \\"improved letter,\\" the use of \\"we\\" helped the employee to see they were an integral part of the company.  In the first letter, they were expendable.<br /><br />While the main focus of this book is business, a few chapters are devoted to family and the school system.  I believe your religious beliefs determine how you raise your children in most cases.  Norman Jones did not write this book from a religious standpoint and his book focuses on research.<br /><br />This book may just be the perfect gift to give to your boss this Christmas.  You may just be giving yourself a great work environment in the coming year.  After all those \\"memos\\" you have to read, the least your boss can do is read an inspiring book!  If you are interested in Psychology you will enjoy that aspect.  If you are in management you will love the insights on how you can drive your business forward for optimal success.  Your employees might even vote you as their favorite boss of all time.  After all, who do we love the most in life?

2267845:US	50199793	R3TVSW29BYIKIF	0060932244	814341775	Saving Childhood: Protecting Our Children from the National Assault on Innocence	Books	5	59	63	N	Y	Promoting security and a sense of wonder!	Controversy is deliciously entertaining, violence is shocking and sensual content is titillating.....for most adults.  But what is this doing to our children?  The Media has so permeated our lives that it seems there is no way to protect \\"childhood innocence.\\"<br /><br />\\"Saving Childhood\\" offers parents hope and practical tips on how to encourage security, a sense of wonder and optimism in the life of a child.  This book will empower parents and give them hope for the future.<br /><br />The first part of the book has been written to make parents aware of the realities of the situation and explains the \\"Assault\\" on innocence.  The second part is the \\"Defense.\\" Michael and Diane explain that the Assault is coming from Media, Schools, Peers and Parents.  They show how statistics have proved that the problems in our society are getting worse at a rapid pace and back this up with scientific evidence.  They also explain many points with examples from the raising of their own three children.<br /><br />The Medveds explain how we live in a land where sex education has failed to reduce teenage pregnancy, children feel guilty for existing, parents push their children to grow up too fast, children have a lack of moral values, and parents have taken a passive role.<br /><br />So who is educating our children?  It seems an inadequate school system and the TV!<br /><br />Television is well known for programs which contain high levels of violence.  I have long been a believer that TV violence causes aggression.  Michael and Diane prove this point and I found it interesting to read about how the crime rates increased soon after the introduction of TV into various towns.<br /><br />I grew up in South Africa for most of my childhood and remember very few people having TV's in the early years.  TV was apparently banned until 1975.  In fact, my father never purchased a TV and so I grew up basically TV-free!  Perhaps that is why I can still enjoy a movie like \\"Runaway Bride.\\"  Most of my friends are so jaded, they can't appreciate movies which I find to be very enjoyable.  In fact, most movies are new to me.<br /><br />The Medveds also show how TV promotes impatience, self-pity, superficiality and gives us all a harsh view of the world.  With all this negativity, how are we balancing our lives and promoting a positive view of the world?<br /><br />There are now three books I consider \\"essential reading\\" for every American:  \\"America's Real War,\\" \\"The American Paradox,\\" and \\"Saving Childhood.\\"  These three books are brilliantly conceived works which explain America's present predicament and give excellent solutions.  After reading all three books, I am now convinced of our nations need for:<br /><br />1.  Responsibility to a Higher Power. (90 percent of Americans believe in God) 2.  Renewed respect for life and authority. 3.  The teaching of personal responsibility, patriotism and honesty. 4.  Parents that stay together and live what they teach. 5.  The teaching of moral values. 6.  The reading of inspiring books instead of a diet of negative TV reinforcement. 7.  A revamp of our Education System. 8.  Holding our Media responsible for programming. 9.  Teaching a sense of gratitude for life. 10.  An all-out effort to protect the remaining innocence of our children.<br /><br />In order to promote the efforts of parents, Michael and Diane devote chapter seven, eight and nine to explain how parents can promote \\"security,\\" \\"a sense of wonder,\\" and \\"optimism\\" in the lives of their children.<br /><br />\\"Childhood is perhaps the only phase of life when innocence can flourish.  But to allow this, parents and others responsible for children's minds need to construct a protective shelter against the painful and frightening facets of life.  They need to stand guard at its door, to let the harsher truths of reality gradually unfold for the child, in a way and at a pace that allows the child to maintain a positive outlook.  Honoring innocence is incompatible with assuming that the earlier children grasp all the worst aspects of the world, the better prepared they'll be to handle them.\\" -- \\"Saving Childhood\\" page 195<br /><br />To this I add one of my favorite poems for children:<br /><br />May tree and plant and shrub be soundless through the night and stars and moon be dimmed to shut out all the light.  So when you sleep in peace, no bird will move in flight, and angles guard your sleep.  Goodnight, my love goodnight. ~James Neill Northe<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewbetter prepared they'll be to handle them.\\" -- \\"Saving Childhood\\" page 195    To this I add one of my favorite poems for children:    May tree and plant and shrub be soundless through the night and stars and moon be dimmed to shut out all the light.

If I had to choose two main books which discuss publishing a cookbook, this would be one of them.  The Recipe Writer's Handbook by Barbara Gibbs Ostmann would be the second book.  While these books will cover most of the details, you will also need about 10 reference books.  I have reviewed most of them.<br /><br />Barbara focuses on the technical details of writing the actual recipes, while Marilyn focuses on the publishing and marketing aspects.  Writing AND publishing a cookbook could be compared to surviving Mr. Everest, but I think it can be done!<br /><br />Marilyn explains how you should first decide who you are writing for.  Then you can focus on your audience and provide what they want.  She warns her readers of all the hard work, yet she also knows cooks would not take the time unless they believed it was a worthwhile project.<br /><br />Throughout this book, Marilyn is right on target. The resource section is your door to the publishing world.  You can choose which doors you want to open and how far you want to pursue your dream.  The list of newspaper and magazine book review editors will make you wish your book was published and ready to ship out the door.<br /><br />You truly won't find all this information anywhere else.  There is a complete section on book design, list of publishers, copyright and ISBN information and even sources for obtaining a bar code.  She also explains promotion, advertising, sending out review copies and filling orders.  Her information goes way beyond simply writing the book.  This takes you to the next level.<br /><br />I also found it helpful to select a cookbook that you absolutely love!  That way you have a reference for spellings and can back up your use of \\"chile\\" instead of \\"chilie.\\"  \\"The Best Recipe\\" by Christopher Kimball is an excellent choice.  Any of the cookbooks I have reviewed are also the best resources I have found for the technical details of recipe writing.  You will develop your own style and then your editor will have fun making you change everything!  Keep your voice!  Don't let anyone take that away from you.<br /><br />Choose one of the most recent cookbooks and check current cooking magazines and food dictionaries for the best spellings and word usage.  Don't rely on a spell checker on your computer.  Most of the time it won't recognize words like Fleur de Sel or Tellicherry peppercorns.<br /><br />So, think of writing a cookbook as a journey.  It may take you a few years to complete your project.  There are certain things you may never experience if you don't write your own book.  It is magical, mind expanding, fun, and finally exhilarating when you realize it is almost ready to publish.  Just keep on working and soon you will have a document that is ready to publish.<br /><br />As Irena Chalmers once said: \\"The next best thing to publishing your own book, is to imply that you are just about to.\\"<br /><br />Print more or allow this book to be reprinted in a POD format at iuniverse or booksurge!

I loved reading this book because it was packed with information on the foods we love.  More than 9,000 scientific studies have proven beyond doubt that food is our best medicine.  This book shows which foods are the most healing.  In nature animals know which foods to nibble on to get well, with this book...we will too!<br /><br />I think the best way to use this book is to completely read it cover to cover and write down every food you think you need.  Then, try to incorporate those foods into your diet.  Studies have identified 107 of the most powerful healing foods, spices and herbs.  There are some compounds which just cannot be absorbed by the human bloodsteam unless they are eaten in a food.  Taking ellagic acid (a cancer fighter) in a pill form doesn't work.  It is essential to eat strawberries or other berries in order to obtain ellagic acid.  After reading this book you will look at a stawberry pie in a new way.<br /><br />\\"Let food be your medicine, and let medicine be your food.\\" --Hippocrates, 400 B.C.<br /><br />This book also gives helpful hints on how to select produce and keep it fresh.  There is also some great information on how to prepare fruits and vegetables.<br /><br />You will find great life saving information:<br /><br />Eating cherries helps to prevent cancer, \\"perillyl alcohol\\" blocks the formation of a variety of cancers and contain a compound called quercetin.  This neutralizes cancer-causing agents in the body.  It also shields your DNA against cancer.<br /><br />Eating red grapefruits will give you more \\"lycopene\\" which helps protect against heart disease.  Ruby Red and Star Ruby are great choices.<br /><br />\\"Diet has the distinction of being the only major determinant of health that is completely under your control.\\" --Andrew Weil, M.D.<br /><br />The recipes are easy to make and there are plenty of them.  There are also plenty of great pictures to get you to the store!  Blueberries anyone...<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2000-09-23

Each step of the way is documented in 151 Inspirational reflections.<br /><br />These poems and streams of thought mirror David's pain, frustrations, challenges, loneliness, joy, loss, growth, expectations, fear, and desire for answers and personal fulfillment.<br /><br />His words are at times a guide to awareness (Spectators In Our Life), at times a story of his past experiences (My Experience with You), and then often a revelation of a secret in life (The Key to Life).<br /><br />The book is divided into three sections. At the beginning of each section, David gives us an insight into the meaning of each chapter.<br /><br />Within \\"Searching\\" we find writings to encourage using personal experiences as a powerful tool to increase learning from awareness. This collection reveals the inner conflicts of the soul. \\"Growing\\" explains the concept of becoming more aware in order to grow as a person. In \\"Loving\\" we are encouraged to love unconditionally and to take the risk of loving. In this last section there is some delicious imagery and we are encouraged to seek out our inner child.<br /><br />I loved \\"Loving You, Loving Me,\\" a beautiful yet profound poem/lesson in how when we love others we are in fact giving ourselves the gift of love.<br /><br />Through his words, he also addresses issues of self-hate, hiding our true feelings, judging others, understanding differences, hope for the future, healing, loss, patience, renewal, acceptance, respect, friendship, caring, trust in a higher power and the interconnectedness of all life.<br /><br />The title \\"Phoenix Soul\\" comes from the story told by many cultures. \\"Phoenix is the Greek word for dark red or purple. The Phoenix bird is a symbol of hope and immortality. Through the ages it has meant many things to many religions and cultures. In ancient mythology is it associated with a bird which lives in Arabia, near a cool well.<br /><br />Every morning the sun god was said to stop his chariot to listen to the bird sing. The splendid red and gold plumage has also given it the name of \\"The Fire Bird.\\" Only one Phoenix bird is said to exist at a time.<br /><br />When the bird felt its death was near (every 500 or more years), it would build a nest of incense (cinnamon, spikenard and myrrh) twigs. This was then ignited by the sun and fanned by its own wings. A new Phoenix bird then rises up from the ashes. \\"The Phoenix Bird\\" by Hans Christian Andersen in 1850 is well worth a read and tells a similar story.<br /><br />To David, the bird's anguish and rebirth are symbolic of how we can be vulnerable, heal and rise again to the next challenge. The crucial message of his work is that out of the depths of despair can emerge a new life, a life stronger than before.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewod was said to stop his chariot to listen to the bird sing.

The story of how they gave up so much of their life was  also never told to her.<br /><br />\\"Most often, history is written by the  takers in the world, not by those who are taken from.\\" --Maggie  Davis<br /><br />She has not written this book to erase the wrongs, but to help the  healing.<br /><br />\\"Peace is more than the absence of war - it is a desire  for life.\\" --Maggie Davis<br /><br />Maggie invites her readers to journey with  her to look at life through Native eyes.  Through her writing she explains  the path of the Native peoples and how their lives changed from the days of  Columbus.  I could relate to this book because I sometimes wish we could  all leave the stressful lives we lead and go back to a simpler life.<br /><br />Each chapter begins with a verbal image of a setting in Native life.  You imagine you are the person she is describing.  In this way you can  empathize.<br /><br />\\"You are living in this land a thousand years ago.  The  source of what you use, you see in everything around you.  Your medicine  comes from plants and trees and flowers.  Your food is what you have  gathered or hunted or grown.  You breath fresh air.  You drink pure water.  Silence is your friend.  Always, you prize your visions and your dreams.  When you plant, you sing songs.  You read the weather in the sky and in the  trees and in the sounds that animals are making.  The sun gives you warmth.  And warmth comes from the fire you fuel with branches that you find  beneath the trees.  You make tools from bone or from wood or bone or  antler.  You build shelters--you make clothes--from other gifts of Earth  you see around you.  Your music is the rush of waterfalls.  It is the  crackling of your cookfire, the sounds of flutes and rattles and drums, and  your own voice singing.  Everywhere you turn, you see beauty.  Everything  you notice is important to your life.  You walk gently on Earth and live in  balance.

It is a book  which explains what Native and non-Native people have been to one another  in this country.      \\"In it, I put what I wish I'd known when I was  young.\\" --Maggie Davis    ~The Rebecca Review	2000-09-19

One of the unique qualities of Maggie's  writing is that she seems to be speaking directly to your own soul.  When I  read one of her books, I feel as though I just spent hours with a wise  friend.  One who takes me into her world of remembrances, collected wisdom,  favorite quotes and stories about her life.<br /><br />On this visit, she begins  with 40 questions.  This is the beginning of your path of self-discovery,  or as I found out, a remembrance of discovery.  My answers to her questions  flowed easily, because at 33, I finally know who I am.  Answering her  questions will be eternally revealing for anyone!<br /><br />Do we as women believe  in our own power?  Do we treat ourselves and other well?  Are we kidding  ourselves in any area of our lives? Can we take risks and forget our age?  How do we discover who we are?  Have we learned from the choices we made?  Good or Bad?<br /><br />e.g. Question 3:  Can you name something you swore you'd  never want to do (or be able to do) that you are doing now?<br /><br />In this way  Maggie becomes a guide along the path of awareness.  As in each of her  books, she appears as a friend and asks you to take a journey to self  discovery.  Each of her books are unique in concept, but all contain a  piece of her soul.  In \\"Choices\\" she has the most important  concepts listed at the beginning of each chapter.  Then she expands on  those ideas.<br /><br />\\"Now gradually, my life choices have evolved to the  point where they work well for me as well as reflect my willingness to take  responsibility for my life.  Smaller choices have brought me, finally to  those larger ones and these larger choices hour by hour, where I am  going.\\" --Maggie Davis<br /><br />Maggie explains how she was not always happy,  but now accepts and makes a conscious choice to nurture her inner child.  I  think many women who have been through a traumatic divorce or who lost  their soul mate will relate well to this book.  I also noticed that because  I went through a great loss in my life, I have also learned so many of the  same \\"survival techniques.\\"<br /><br />If you have never met anyone who  sees life the way Maggie does, you owe it to yourself to read her thoughts.  I am always pleased to meet people who have learned from life.  She also  says what we feel, have thought and want to think.<br /><br />I loved her idea of  making a place in our minds where we can always be at peace.  I have a  cabin in my mind with an herb garden, skylights and a window facing the  mountains.  There is also (oddly) a tower with a winding staircase leading  up to it.  I sometimes leave the windows open and lean out of the window  with my elbows on the well-worn window sill so I can feel the rain on my  face and the salty breeze whipping through my hair.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewelate well to this book.

When Maggie's pen touches paper, inspiration blooms and grows in  your own heart.  You feel a sense of kinship when you read her books.  It  is as if you were destined to read them from the beginning of  time.<br /><br />Perhaps the author gained her inspiration from her surroundings in  East Blue Hill Maine.  She is living my dream!  She writes in her cabin in  the woods, which is surrounded by wild flowers.<br /><br />Before you even begin  reading Maggie's words you will be captivated by Cara Raymaker's joyful and  detailed expression of the words.  I truly hope to see more of her art in  children's and inspirational books.<br /><br />\\"Flowers help us feel better,  we know.  Anywhere's home where the flowers grow.\\" --Maggie Davis<br /><br />I  love Maggie's sing-song poetry and her writing in this book reminds me of  the way a child sees the world.<br /><br />\\"One day when I was young and  walking with a friend, a field dry as straw bloomed with flowers.\\"  To  me,  this represented how we can walk through life and create happiness  where there was none, or make life better and make someone smile.  Perhaps  I see this in her writing because she has devoted her life to caring for  others and has brought a smile to my face with her writing.  She knows that  when we reach out to others we receive happiness in return.  No one can  tell you how to get to the path where you will see the flowers growing, you  just have to look inside your own heart, and then you will know how to make  the flowers bloom.<br /><br />\\"Find one work in your life that never bores you.  Make sure the work is joy for you to do.  Then do this work, no matter  what.  It is your gift to the world.  It is your blessing to  yourself.\\" -- Dr. Edward Bach<br /><br />In this work, she is celebrating  nature and the life of Dr. Edward Bach.  The Dr Edward Bach Healing Trust  is a Registered Charity formed in 1989 to help the elderly, the poor and  others. It makes donations to good causes and to those working in difficult  circumstances to help others.  He believed that the mind and emotions  create bodily conditions for disease to manifest itself.  He also created  Bach Flower Remedies based on the belief that flowers have healing  properties.  The flowers are still prepared by infusion methods and are  used to help remove negative emotions that can impede overall health.  Here  is a quote from \\"Heal Thyself\\" written by Dr. Edward Bach in  1931:<br /><br />\\"The real primary diseases of man are such defects as pride,  cruelty, hate, self-love, ignorance, instability and greed; and each of  these, if considered, will be found to be adverse to Unity. Such defects as  these are the real diseases (using the word in the modern sense), and it is  a continuation and persistence in such defects after we have reached that  stage of development when we know them to be wrong, which precipitates in  the body the injurious results which we know as illness.......But yet there  is no cause for depression. The prevention and cure of disease can be found  by discovering the wrong within ourselves and eradicating this fault by the  earnest development of the virtue which will destroy it; not by fighting  the wrong, but by bringing in such a flood of its opposing virtue that it  will be swept from our natures.\\"<br /><br />I was very pleased when I learned  that the essential oil of roses can remove anger.  It is also interesting  that men will sometimes give women flowers when woman are angry at them.  Could this have some deeper message?  I could completely relate to this  book as I take Echinacea and believe we can heal our bodies with plants and  also prevent disease.<br /><br />When I read the first few words of this book, I  remembered a day my nieces and I once went to a favorite park.  On the  first visit we had walked in the dry grass.  On the second visit, Ashley  ran into the park and exclaimed with delight: \\"It happened, it  happened, my wish came true.\\"  \\"What wish,\\" I asked.  \\"I wished that the next time I came to this park it would be filled  with flowers.\\"  Ashley got her wish and now I will give her this book.  She knows the flowers can bring happiness with their faces turned to the  sun and their petals fluttering in the breeze.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewish,\\" I asked.   \\"I wished that the next time I came to this park it would be filled  with flowers.\\"  Ashley got her wish and now I will give her this book.

Stories  have been the best way to explain every idea since the beginning of time.<br /><br />I have also reviewed Gary Zukav's The Seat of the Soul in detail and  reading that review may be helpful in understanding the premise behind Soul  Stories. In The Seat of the Soul he explains his basic beliefs and goes  into detail about authentic empowerment and how to reach beyond our five  senses to become a multisensory person. Throughout Soul Stories, he also  promotes the belief that the Universe is alive. To me, this is the presence  of God in our lives.<br /><br />Gary discusses intuition, forms of reasoning, the  earth school, emotional awareness, responsible choice, harmony,  cooperation, sharing, reverence for life, forgiveness, love, trust,  marriage, children, kindness and inner richness. It is not surprising that  he also includes some health advice, our souls do live in our bodies, so  why not create a perfect environment for the soul? We are individual souls  sent to earth to fulfill a task or to learn a lesson, which will benefit us  in the next life.<br /><br />Yes, I agree that you make your own future through  making daily choices and when you have an \\"intention\\" you can  create a good or bad experience. This book is a blending of Eastern  religions with a generous helping of real experiences and a pinch of  Christianity. I recommend that if you purchase this book and take this soul  journey that you turn on your intuition, logic and perception. Be aware  that although there are many truths in many religions, the ultimate truth  comes from God. To know truth you must first know God.<br /><br />Gary has done an  excellent job in raising awareness of the need to nurture our souls,  however he has combined many religions into one book. It is up to us to  find our own way on this journey. God created our souls; and therefore he  can lead us on the path to Truth. If you are searching to find out what  Gary Zukav believes, then this book is very enlightening in that regard.<br /><br />I think his best idea is to view life as a school and that we are here  to learn. I also appreciate his encouragement to make the best decision in  each moment of our lives. He has changed my life in that regard! I hope you  will continue to find truth and meaning in your own life.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewthen this book is very enlightening in that regard.

Her words flow like a calming river, bathing our souls in caring  consciousness.  This book will teach you deeply and remind you we are all  human.  Maggie helps us hear the thoughts of the ill and dying.  She takes  us by the hand and leads us into their world.  How do you handle a parents  death, a friends illness, the loss of a pet?  What do you say to a friend  experiencing a loss?  How do you feel about your own aging?  These are  issues we will all have to face in our life.<br /><br />Her words inspire us to  move beyond courtesy and kindness and realize empathy.  She evokes this  feeling through a montage of anecdotes, meditations, stories from her own  life, collected quotes, eternal wisdom and rivers of thoughts which run  deeply over the rocky river beds of life.<br /><br />The philosophy is to see the  beauty and interconnectedness of all life.  The goal is to strive to think,  speak and act from what we see.  Maggie has been listening to her own heart  and the concerns of others for years.  She has absorbed this knowledge and  wants to pass it on to us in a way that affirms the best a human can be.  She reminds us:  \\"...any life we care for well can remind us of all we  are capable of giving.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend this \\"drink for the  soul\\" to nurses, doctors, hospice volunteers, families caring for  their loved ones, and everyone who feels disconnected and wants to start  learning how to care for others.  How beautiful the world would be if we  could all know what Maggie knows in her heart.  How caring of her to share  her knowledge with us.<br /><br />By reading this book you will realize how the  smallest deed can have a positive effect in your own neighborhood.  If you  nourish yourself with the attitude of compassion, at the same time you will  leave attitudes of worry, self-doubt, blame, fear, resentment and pettiness  to die without your care.  Maggie started Neighborcare to provide  hands-on-care, plant care, pet care, help with errands, meal preparation,  housekeeping, help with outside chores and help with transportation to  medical appointments.<br /><br />Her vision for the future is to encourage others  to serve the ill, dying, injured and heartsick.  She applauds volunteer  efforts and I believe she is going to succeed in bringing awareness to  caring with this thoughtful book from her heart.<br /><br />The lessons presented  in \\"Caring in Remembered Ways\\" are your guides to compassion.  Along the journey of collected thoughts you may not see the words through  you own tears.  This is when you will most clearly see the needs of your  own soul and the needs of fellow souls traveling with you in life.

If the \\"Cat in the Hat\\" had been  found under the Christmas tree, even he could not have created this much  chaos!

Stephen Cartwright's illustrations make the 100 words come to life.  Each word has a picture.  Then, the magic of this book is that those pictures  are incorporated into a picture which takes up the top 2/3rds of two open  pages.  Not only can the child associate the picture with a word, they can  associate the pictures with objects in the scenes straight out of family  life.<br /><br />At the beginning of the book, Betty Root (a language consultant)  explains how the process of learning starts at a very early age.  Once  children are able to recognize objects, they also need to see them in  pictures.  She notes how children will make many associations of words and  objects even before they start talking.<br /><br />The first words are  \\"Daddy, Mommy, boy, girl, baby, dog and cat.\\"  The last page has  words like \\"Sweater, table and window.\\"  Most of the words are  all in a row at the base of two open pages.  The scenes from family life  above, all contain a picture of a yellow duck. The duck is hidden so well  in some places, even I had to really look for it.<br /><br />This book is also  available in French, German and Spanish.

The Better Homes and Gardens New Cook Book is hardly new in my family. At  least not the copy I recently found!  My mother has a great nack for saving  just about everything.  When I partially removed the old red fabric tape  holding the cover together, I found the words \\"Meredith Press  O1.\\"  The red and white gingham cover also has three pictures: a pot,  a pan and a gravy server.<br /><br />I know for a fact, my mother has had this  cookbook since I was born.  My grandmother also has about every edition  ever published, all well worn!  I am finally convinced that \\"The  Better Homes and Gardens Cook Book\\" is perhaps almost completely  responsible for my families love of cooking.<br /><br />Our beloved cookbook is so  well worn, the edges of all the pages are a lovely crinkled beige.  The  yellow tabbed pages have clear tape over the well-worn tabs and the poultry  chapter has barely survived.  (We raised chickens in Africa!  This book was  there!)<br /><br />I was more than pleased to hear about the 1930-2000 Limited  Edition!  We still make the Herb Stuffing and Ambrosia. I also just  realized that my father must have found the idea for cheese-filled bacon  wrapped frankfurters from Better Homes and Gardens.  Dad!  And I thought he  made that recipe up!  It looks like men were reading cookbooks in the 60's  or maybe that dish was a popular one.<br /><br />Do you remember Praline or  Seven-Minute Frosting?  The Swedish Pancakes and Banana-nut Bread recipes  are all splattered with stains of unknown origin.  (I am guessing eggs,  milk, butter?)  All my new cookbooks are now on a stand, far out of reach  of buttery fingers!  But then again, if my mother had not let me use this  cookbook at a young age (without much supervision - therefore the stains of  unknown origin), who knows if I would have developed such a fascination for  kitchen lore, cooking and culinary culture.  Many of my family memories are  also connected to recipes in many editions of this book.<br /><br />If you are  looking for a cookbook to inspire generations of cooks, you should consider  this book seriously.

With recipes like, \\"Fantasy Fossils\\" and \\"Sand Castle Clay,\\" I  agree.<br /><br />Some of my favorite memories had direct connections to art  projects.  Children enjoy creating quality projects they can be proud of. More than anything, this book will give your children a desire to explore,  create, learn and experiment with many different kitchen ingredients.<br /><br />What a great way to introduce a child to cooking.  Many of the  ingredients include:  Flour, salt, gelatin, vinegar, food coloring, coffee, oil, oatmeal, lemon juice, peanut butter, cornstarch and eggs.  Kids can even eat some of the things they make.<br /><br />The rest of the concoctions contain simple ingredients you already have on hand, or a quick trip to the local craft store will do the trick.  A large table, old T-shirt's and a big washable table cloth are my recommendations! Then have some fun and  spend some quality time with your favorite kids.

The series of Chicken Soup books has held my attention since their first publication.  Perhaps this is one of the most important books in the  series.  The stories will also help everyone realize that life is a  journey.  The words will inspire you to dream, to be more positive, and to  realize you are not alone.<br /><br />When you purchase this book, think of it as  a life enriching tool.  The topics of love, friendship, family, attitude,  perspective, death, dreams, obstacles, choices, tough stuff and eclectic  wisdom are discussed in stories, poems and passages.<br /><br />The stories are  short enough so you could read one a day.  There are also funny cartoons,  poems and plenty of \\"kid\\" wisdom.  I give this book my highest  recommendation.  I think even adults should read some of the stories in  this book.  The poem a child wrote about her father is something every  parent should read.<br /><br />I was also impressed with the health advice and  section on making the right choices.  The positive lessons you can learn  from this book will last a lifetime.  My favorite poem was on page 293, it  truly holds the wisdom of a child.  We have so much to learn from children,  if we will take the time to listen.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2000-08-22

When my friend Mini sent me this gift, I wanted to immediately loose  myself in the pages.  I kept thinking it was truly a book I would want to  read all in one sitting.  I wanted to curl up on a couch and have my two  cats sleeping at my feet.  How right I was.<br /><br />Once I started reading, (my  husband sound asleep upstairs, cats sleeping at my feet, and the house  deathly quiet except for the quiet humming of the refrigerator), I was  immediately drawn into Mikage Sakurai's world.<br /><br />Banana Yoshimoto uses  luscious descriptions of food and kitchens.  She describes people and  places with such poignancy, you truly feel connected to them.  Her thoughts  burst onto each page with such honesty, you cannot help but fall in love  with her innocent, charming writing style.<br /><br />There are life and death  issues in \\"Kitchen,\\" we can all relate to.  Her evocative writing  will fill you with nostalgia for some of the cooking spaces you have  perhaps left behind.  Mostly I love my grandmother's kitchen best.  The  familiar creak of the oven door, the scooting sound of the chairs as we sit  for a cup of tea, and the racks of cookbooks patiently waiting on the  shelves.<br /><br />To imagine this kitchen without my grandmother, is to imagine  the entire house without a soul, without love, and without peace.  When we  almost lost my grandmother once to a heart attack, I stood in her kitchen  and felt the emptiness.  I was not ready to loose her, and I believe I  never will be.<br /><br />This is the emotion Mikage feels as she sleeps on the  floor in her grandmother's kitchen.  After loosing her grandmother, Mikage  is lost, lonely and depressed.  Her soul longs for the comfort of another  soul who can understand her torment.  She feels as though death surrounds  her and she cannot escape.<br /><br />For a time she finds happiness with Yuichi,  who knew her grandmother well.  He is living with his mother Eriko.  Mikage  goes to live with them until she can learn to handle her emotions.<br /><br />Yuichi's girlfriend is not impressed, even though the relationship is  purely platonic on the surface.  Deep within their souls they are soon to  become twins, bearing the scars of a common life experience.<br /><br />Banana  Yoshimoto's writing is fresh, real and casts a spell on the reader.  I  would have preferred the book to end on page 105.  She does truly seize  hold of your heart and I wanted the book to either end or I wanted one more  chapter in place of Moonlight Shadow.  I found the second book did not  belong with the beautiful yet somewhat unfinished story of Yuichi and  Mikage.  I think you will agree. In fact, I suggest that when you get to  page 105, you close the book and come back later to read the second story.<br /><br /> I find her writing to be most inspirational when she has fully  developed her characters.  In the future, I hope she will write one story  per book and make them as memorable as Kitchen.  To truly appreciate this  book, you must love food and kitchens, that is the magic.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewgirlfriend is not impressed, even though the relationship is  purely platonic on the surface.

While you may ask why anyone would want to read a book about \\"The Flood,\\" to me the possibility of one day actually being able to see the remains of the ark for myself has always intrigued me.<br /><br />Some believe the event to be a myth or legend. Alfred M. Rehwinkel explains how nearly every nation and tribe in the entire human race has a flood myth. The peoples of Egypt, Mexico, America, India, Pacific Islands, Asia, Australia and Africa all have a story to tell. It seems to deny the existence of a flood rejects the most ancient and most sacred traditions of universal humanity.<br /><br />One of the most fascinating discoveries is also recorded in this book. The great Gilgamesh Epic was found in the ruins of the Assurbanipal library in Nineveh. The narrative bears a striking resemblance to the writings of Moses in Genesis. It was in fact written centuries before.<br /><br />According to the author, there are many reasons modern man has rejected the possibility of a flood. Many scholars do however believe it to be the greatest catastrophe in the history of the earth.<br /><br />Alfred M. Rehwinkel goes into great detail and shows how the ark was in fact quite capable of holding a great number of animals. He explains how many of the animals at the time could be found in the vicinity and that the climate, animal and plant life, where vastly different in Noah's time.<br /><br />He answers the following questions in detail:<br /><br />1. Where did all the water come from? 2. When did \\"The Flood\\" begin? 3. What was the population of the earth before \\"The Flood.\\" 4. Why was there a flood and why was Noah saved?<br /><br />He also goes on to show how the earth would have in fact been a virtual paradise with a warm climate and food for all. In his opinion, the earth was rich with resources and most likely sustained a great number of people. He also believes they had reached a high level of civilized culture. He basis his opinions on archeological discoveries.<br /><br />A diagram on page 10 also explains how if the earth was perpendicular to the plane of its orbit, there would have been no change in the seasons. The seasons may in fact be a result of the earth tilting 23 1/2 degrees at the time of the flood.<br /><br />If you are interested in archeology, you will enjoy reading about the fossil remains and how many different species were found all in one location in mass graves. This goes against modern geology, which is based on a system of biological evolution. (Oh, by the way, I have a Trilobite fossil my father brought me from Russia.)<br /><br />This book does in fact succeed in bringing to our attention, the most outstanding evidence for a universal flood from a geological and archaeological standpoint. The most fascinating part of this intellectual work was the story of a Russian aviator named Mr. Vladimar Roskivitsky.

Every other one of us will suffer from some form of depression at some time.  It can wreck  relationships, take away your joy, and can be a terrible way to suffer in  silence.<br /><br />Depression in fact stems from a combination of chemical  imbalances and environmental factors.  SAM-e is a safe, over-the-counter,  natural supplement that promises to help you beat depression quickly,  easily, and safely.<br /><br />SAM-e is not a drug, herb or a vitamin.  It is a  substance already present in our bodies.  By restoring this substance to an  optimal level, you can see dramatic improvements in your mood.<br /><br />Modern  prescription antidepressants are harsh drugs, which can have intolerable  side effects.  The author shows how clinical trials have shown SAM-e to  have fewer side effects than a placebo (sugar pill).  The positive results  will also only take a few days to appear.<br /><br />If you want to try a program  to get out of the depression cycle, you can try a number of things.  These  ideas are a combination of what I have learned and are also the basic ideas  sprinkled throughout this book.<br /><br />1.  Make a commitment to being happy.  2.  Take the bad feelings and tell yourself you don't want to feel this way.  3.  Replace the negative thoughts about the past with happy ones about the  future. (Hope)  4.  Exercise and take your vitamins.  5.  Find an activity  that makes you feel good and keeps your mind busy.  6.  Give something back  to your community.  Volunteer, help a child learn to read or cook a meal  for a friend.  7.  Be in control!  Decide what you are going to do about a  problem instead of complaining about it.  8.  Focus on the good in your  life instead of depressing issues and negative thoughts.  9.  Eat the right  foods!  Cooking can be very therapeutic.  10.  Get a pet!  How can you be  sad with a puppy or kitten bounding about the house!  11.  Join a group,  church or club.  Get involved with positive, happy people.  Avoid negative,  depressing people who do not support you emotionally.  Soon those people  will learn to be more positive if they want a piece of your time.  12.  Take 200 - 400mg SAM-e a day.  (GNC brand it the best and you can take up  to 800mg if needed)  13.  Practice relaxation techniques such as Yoga.  14.  Go for a massage.  15.  Try light therapy if you have SAD.  16.  Nurture  your Spirit, that is how you will find true Joy.<br /><br />It is a very good idea  to read this entire book.  About ten percent of depressed individuals  should not treat themselves and should be under a doctor's supervision.  There does however seem to be help for postpartum and postmenopausal  depression as well.<br /><br />If you are taking St. John's wort, you may want to  switch over to SAM-e.  St. John wort causes photosensitivity and therefore  has a side effect.<br /><br />If you feel any of the following symptoms, this book  may hold the secret to a cure:<br /><br />1.  Feeling empty.  2.  Feeling sad.  3.  Negative thoughts about the past, present and future.  4.  Feeling tense  and nervous.  5.  Loss of interest in life.  6.  Feeling guilty or  worthless.  7.  Difficulty concentrating.  8.  Sleep problems.  9.  Change  in appetite or lack of hunger.  10.  Feeling sluggish.  11.  Suicidal  thoughts - seek professional help immediately!<br /><br />This book is filled with  information on a variety of antidepressants and the reasons why they may be  harmful.  In my opinion, why take something with side effects, when you can  take something which is natural and is already something your body uses on  a daily basis.  I say, take this along with your daily vitamins, it could  change your whole outlook on life.  It is an expensive supplement, but you  happiness is priceless.  Please do consult your doctor before going on this  program, especially if you have other health concerns.<br /><br />An effort made  for the happiness of others liftsus above ourselves. --Lydia M.

My first thought was, why could we not just  dilute the vinegar and drink it, or as I have seen lately, swallow apple  cider vinegar pills.<br /><br />After trying to drink diluted vinegar, I found  that pills might be better.  In fact, you may just want to use the vinegar  in salad dressings.  Maybe you could mix it with a fruit juice and a little  stevia sweetener, either way, I did not find it to be very enjoyable to  drink. Now if you can drink pickle juice, you might not mind it at  all!<br /><br />You will find numerous suggestions for using apple cider vinegar.  According to how much time you want to spend, there is a three-day,  seven-day and four-week diet plan.<br /><br />There is some helpful information  about vinegar.  Acetic acid is the enemy of all bacteria and the book  claims it will help to detoxify the kidneys and bladder.  It is said to  help re-balance the metabolism of the body and reduce fateful cravings for  fattening foods.  You can take the self-test to see if you should use this  diet.<br /><br />One point I noticed to be interesting was that they said you  should avoid sugar, yet they allowed the dieters quite a lot of alcohol  consumption.  I realized why the breakfast menu seems strange to some.  In  Europe, people do eat bread, cheese and meats for breakfast.  An example of  a breakfast menu suggested in this book would include:  kiwi fruit, sheep  cheese, olives, egg, and tofu sausages.  Eating whole grain cereals is  highly recommended.<br /><br />There are a few pages of exercise and relaxation  techniques.  I found the diet would be hard to follow unless you wrote out  a diet plan on a sheet of paper and researched it more.  I think the main  emphasis was on adding more acetic acid to your diet.  You could easily do  this by making a salad with an apple cider vinegar dressing.  If you do  choose to buy this book, look for other books containing recipes using  apple cider vinegar.  I think the author is encouraging a lifestyle change  and has not necessarily written a book of recipes.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewider vinegar.

Most great children's books also seem to appeal to adults.  In fact, I  believe we all still have a place inside of us filled with child-like  wonder, a love for life, and the need to discover something new each day.<br /><br />E.B. White appeals to the playful, mischievous side of our natures.  He  also takes the side of the children and farm animals, making the story  irresistible to children.  Fern, the little farm girl in the story, knows  all the animals and even tells her mother what they say.  Every animal has  a unique and interesting personality.  You may know some of these  personalities in real life: the encourager, the pessimist, the optimist,  and even the depressed.<br /><br />The setting is a beautiful farm situated near  the woods.  One day a litter of piglets brings happiness and anger to  Fern's life.  When she realizes her father's intention to kill the runt  pig, she is horrified.  After physically trying to take the ax away from  her father, she finally convinces him to allow her to raise the pig.<br /><br />Fern affectionately calls him Wilbur and soon he is quite spoiled.  He  is not exactly overjoyed when he sold to Fern's uncle, Mr. Homer L.  Zuckerman.  While living in his new home, he sees Fern less.  Lonely and  tearful, he turns to the other animals for friendship.<br /><br />One day he meets  a goose, she encourages him to break free and nurture his playful side.  After being out of the pen for just a short time, everyone on the farm is  rushing about trying to get him back into the pen.  The illustrations on  these pages are quite amusing.<br /><br />Since Wilbur is too young to know the  difference, he chooses to go back to the pen, even though the goose  encourages him to run for the woods.<br /><br />On his return, the other animals are  rather mean to him.  Even the old sheep tells him he will be dead by  Christmas.  Fortunately, he has already made his acquaintance with a  delicate voiced spider named Charlotte.  She vows to save him from his  terrible fate.<br /><br />What happens next is nothing short of a miracle.  You will  see what a good friend even a spider can be.  This is a story about love,  friendship and how to enjoy the simple things in life.  The end of the  story also shows how Wilbur repays Charlotte's friendship.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviews already made his acquaintance with a  delicate voiced spider named Charlotte.

The original \\"Poky Little Puppy (Little Golden Storybook)\\" is  the best-selling children's hardcover book of all time according to the  Time Almanac 2000.  This was a classic tale about a curious little puppy  who loved to explore the outdoors.  This theme is used in \\"The Poky  Little Puppy's Counting Book.\\"<br /><br />I like the sturdy shape book as it  had thick pages and the pages are in the shape of the puppy.  On the  front cover, you see the adorable puppy.  When you turn the book over, you  see a butterfly sitting on his tail.<br /><br />In this story, Poky goes for a  walk and sees 10 interesting things.  As you can imagine with a counting  book, each page reveals an increasing number of items.  There are  caterpillars, baby birds, kittens, turtles, frogs, honeybees, strawberries,  ladybugs and fireflies.  On the last two pages, all the animals, bugs and  plants reappear in lines so you can encourage counting.<br /><br />If you are  looking for books which are on the list of best-selling children's books,  look for \\"The Tale of Peter Rabbit (2nd),\\" \\"Scuffy the  Tugboat (5th),\\" \\"Green Eggs and Ham (7th),\\" and \\"The  Cat in the Hat (8th).\\"  These are the classics we all remember well.

Richard Scarry books are delightful and teach children about life and  language.  This particular book is one of the most interesting ways to  teach children over 2,500 words.<br /><br />On the inside cover all the animals  introduce themselves.  There are cats, mice, pigs, bears, chickens and just  about every animal you can think of.  These entertaining animals appear on  various pages and help to tell the story of words.<br /><br />The words are  organized according to the alphabet just as in an adult dictionary.  Most  of the words are used in a sentence and they all have illustrations.  Some  of the items are combined into one large picture.  When \\"Ali Cat\\"  is coloring on one page, each crayon and the color is displayed on the  page.  The words: colors, colored, coloring  are also typed next to the  original word \\"color.\\"  In this way you can use all the words in  sentences to teach your children even more word usage.<br /><br />Yes, there are  plenty of silly things to make children laugh. I found the artwork very  amusing in some places.  There are so many pictures, you cannot possibly  see everything in one, two, or even three readings.  This is a book your  child will enjoy for years.  I would like to see a reprint of this classic  children's dictionary.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2000-08-18

She has beautifully illustrated a story of a little girl who's  dream comes true.  On the front cover, a silver cat charm is worn on a  silver chain by \\"the little girl.\\"  This charm is real and can be  removed.<br /><br />My nieces have two adorable kittens and we all love cats, so we  enjoy reading books about cats, cats and more cats.  I found this book was  an excellent way to teach young girls the responsibility of taking care of  a cat or kittens.<br /><br />\\"The little girl\\" in the story is given the  responsibility of looking after her neighbours cat.  Soon she learns that  cats don't come when called.  She has to develop a certain degree of  patience in order to wait for the silver tabby named Clover to learn to  like her.  She discovers that cats love to chase things and soon she and  Clover are the best of friends.<br /><br />At the end of the story, \\"the little  girl\\" finds that her patience pays off.

Garis was one of the first  books I remember reading (or having read to me).  Uncle Wiggily Longears is  a \\"rabbit gentleman.\\"  He has a kind heart, goes on interesting  adventures and teaches children life lessons.<br /><br />I have the 1955 edition,  complete with a green cloth cover.  I will never part with it, even though  it has scribble marks in it.  It is in fact the copy I had when I was about  seven years old and has been to Africa and back.<br /><br />My favorite story is  \\"Uncle Wiggly and the Apple Dumpling.\\"  While I had never tasted  one as a child, I sure wanted to!  It looked delicious.  It is no wonder I  was intrigued when one of my mother's friends made such a dessert.  Years  later I wrote to her and requested the recipe.  I also love the little  poems at the end of each story.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book with  old-fashioned warmth, line drawings, full-page color pictures and animals  that take on human personalities, this is a book you will treasure.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2000-08-18

Rainy Day Projects for Kids is an elaborate and creative work by Petra Boase.  These projects will keep children occupied for hours at a time.  It  is unlikely they will complete many of them without your help, then again  10-12 year olds would easily complete some of them.  The book is mostly for  children 9-12, but I know a few \\"grown ups\\" who would not mind  making some of these fun projects.<br /><br />There is an easy to make jigsaw  puzzle which utilizes wrapping paper and cardboard.  The origami water  bombs may be best made \\"outside,\\" and the egg painting project  would be perfect for Easter.<br /><br />This book will appeal to a child's natural  curiosity, creativity, and inclination towards just having fun.  I also  cannot imagine any parent buying this book and not wanting to help with the  projects.<br /><br />Some of the easier projects include a painted rock paper  weight and a peanut butter pine cone with birdseed.  More advanced projects  include a miniature garden paradise and an \\"Air Football\\"  (Soccer) floor game.  This is pictured on the front cover on the upper  left.<br /><br />Amazingly, you can actually eat some of your projects.  There are  cookies, jolly orange gelatin boats, chocolate apples, pizza faces and  potato porcupines.  These would be great recipes to introduce children to  cooking.  Look for all the books by this author, they are sure to be  winners.  You will find plenty of ideas for the next birthday party.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2000-08-18

She made a decision to be all she could be.  Her strength comes from her mother and the values she learned as a child.  I  found it sad that her father could not have been more influential in her  life.  She was fortunate however,  to be surrounded by loving family  members who stood by her when times got rough.<br /><br />Her views of men are  mixed and come from her own experiences with her father and other men who  had disappointed her in the past.  Her mother, \\"Shirley,\\" is definitely her  hero.  I think her mother explains it beautifully:  \\"You may have been born  in the ghetto, but the ghetto's not born in you. \\"  Star definitely has  reached for the best in life and will not let anyone tell her she can not  get whatever her heart desires.<br /><br />This book is truly \\"the dictionary  that defines\\" Star Jones.  By the time you have finished this book you will  know what she stands for and what she allows to slide.  On the other hand,  there are some issues where she presents both sides and leaves you to  decide.<br /><br />She has definitely overcome obstacles, for which we must  applaud her.  As she says: \\"The key is to learn from your mistakes and work  to never repeat them.\\"  She has plan A as her ideal, but plan B will have  to do if she cannot have the fairy tale version.  This seems to be how she  balances her intellectual and romantic sides.<br /><br />There are places where I  laughed out loud, especially the part where she described some of the cooks  at their church socials.  Something I had not thought of was an issue she  discussed about television programming and especially an issue on  \\"Friends.\\"<br /><br />She does not shy away from her religious beliefs and openly  states:  \\"I have a relationship with God, but I'm not just a Christian.\\"  She doesn't see the single most important aspect of her life as off-limits  and knows that we each find God in our own way.  She also explains how she  knows God exists and gives him thanks for her position in life.<br /><br />There are  statements of truth (which I have taken the liberty of highlighting) within  the stories about her life as a lawyer, her medical emergency, her deep  friendships and her life on \\"The View.\\"  We soon learn that her family has  had a great impact on her life and that friends and family are what her  life is about.  She is a friend first, a lawyer and a television  personality second.  She also loves Paris (a trait I admire as I too love  Paris and Provence).<br /><br />It is humorous to see her take the networks and  talking heads to task.  I think she is voicing what many people are  intimidated to say.  The people of America are tired of being told what to  believe.  \\"Just give me the facts and let me decide.\\"<br /><br />I don't know if  she supports any causes because she doesn't discuss them.  I am sure she  probably does and doesn't want to use undue influence.  She definitely does  like to shop, which some of us can appreciate.  I think women everywhere  will be able to relate to her.  She has a cute note to all the little girls  in the world at the end of the book.  I think that if you ever became her  friend in real life, she would be a true one.

There are  statements of truth (which I have taken the liberty of highlighting) within  the stories about her life as a lawyer, her medical emergency, her deep  friendships and her life on \\"The View.\\"  We soon learn that her family has  had a great impact on her life and that friends and family are what her  life is about.  She is a friend first, a lawyer and a television  personality second.    She also loves Paris (a trait I admire as I too love  Paris and Provence).     It is humorous to see her take the networks and  talking heads to task.  I think she is voicing what many people are  intimidated to say.  The people of America are tired of being told what to  believe.  \\"Just give me the facts and let me decide.\\"      I don't know if  she supports any causes because she doesn't discuss them.  I am sure she  probably does and doesn't want to use undue influence.  She definitely does  like to shop, which some of us can appreciate.  I think women everywhere  will be able to relate to her.  She has a cute note to all the little girls  in the world at the end of the book.  I think that if you ever became her  friend in real life, she would be a true one.

This is an information-lovers resource for everything from outer space to cyberspace....from the past to the present...from global trends to local elections.<br /><br />Within these pages you will find the most comprehensive  up-to-the-minute facts, statistics, dates and information.  If you have  never read all four verses of The Star-Spangled Banner or read the history  of its origin, this book is worth buying for that alone.  If you want to be  dazzled by fascinating statistics or simply read a summary of world  history, this is the best edition I have ever read.<br /><br />No, you cannot absorb  this book in one, two, three or even 100 readings.  This is also the  perfect resource for a writer, or it could simply be read for 15 minutes at  a time.  The type is rather small in this edition;  I would like to see a  larger print version.<br /><br />Within these pages you will also find maps of the  world, a first aid section for crossword puzzlers, a broad overview of  history, an overview of the religions of the world, and even a section on  life-saving skills.<br /><br />My favorite section is the extensive chapter about  the countries of the world.  I can just about bet that no one ever took the  time in school to teach you the geography, governments and histories of  Egypt, Bolivia and Kenya.<br /><br />If you are a U.S. citizen but went to school  overseas, you will appreciate the complete copy of The Constitution of the  United States of America, The Declaration of Independence, and Lincoln's  Gettysburg Address.<br /><br />The chapter on States reveals the latest information  available from the U.S. Census Bureau and gives the details of each state  flower, nickname, capital, population and motto.  This book is simply  encyclopedic, eye opening and mind expanding.<br /><br />I recommend this exhaustive  collection to everyone interested in increasing their knowledge base, to  parents who want to help their children with homework, to the sports fan  who relishes sport statistics and to every American who wants to be well  informed and knowledgeable on a potpourri of interesting details.<br /><br />I was  pleased to see a complete Internet resource guide and a U.S. metric cooking  conversion guide.  The Index is also conveniently placed in the front  section of the book.<br /><br />The only problem with this book is that it is so  appealing to your natural curiosity that once you start reading it....you may  not want to put it down!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewbe well  informed and knowledgeable on a potpourri of interesting details.

Myers book \\"The American Paradox\\" in your hands, is truly to be holding the solution to America's problems.  This is perhaps the most enlightening book you will ever read in this decade.  The  sheer fortitude that it took to sort through the facts and figures between  the 1960's and 1990's and come to these brilliant conclusions is nothing  short of extraordinary.<br /><br />Never has there been a more appropriate time to  analyze our culture.  This is a time of true spiritual hunger.  If you  want the reality of the situation you will find it here.  Both  self-described liberals and self-described conservatives will agree:  There  is no avoiding this deluge of facts.  Perhaps now we can all have a common  goal.<br /><br />\\"The American Paradox\\" offers a sober appraisal of this  present predicament and (finally!) gives a vision of hope for the future.  We soon learn that the problems are many:<br /><br />1.  The divorce rate has  doubled and women and children are impacted the most. 2.  The teen suicide  rate has tripled. 3.  Marriages may start with euphoria, but many end in  separation, anguish and divorce. 4.  Most cohabitations break up before  marriage. 5.  Material wealth is at record levels, yet happiness has  diminished. 6.  We have replaced communal activities with TV and Web  surfing. 7.  We have placed a lower value on self-sacrifice, sexual  restraint and moral obligation. 8.  We have educated our children, while  overlooking the need to teach them character. 9.  The media gives false  images of reality, which in turn have affected our  children's  thoughts and actions.  10. The pursuit of pleasure may in fact be  amplifying misery.<br /><br />We are also reminded that Gandhi once said that seven  social sins could destroy a nation.  I have the feeling we have committed  far more.  It seems we need to embrace principles which will enable us to  realize \\"The New American Dream.\\" This is a dream in which we encourage  marriage, initiative, basic liberties, close relationships, empathy,  self-discipline, character development, civility, fidelity, spiritual  awareness, love for our fellow man, and a shared commitment to moral  truth.<br /><br />David Myers has set out the intellectual facts and figures with  insight and fairness.  There are no sides to take, but rather you will  experience a feeling of enlightenment, hope and a new sense of  determination.  To me it is clear that we need to reexamine our social  policies, make the media more responsible, and decide to change ourselves.  Above all, we should protect our freedom by becoming personally responsible  and making our marriages and families the top priorities in our lives.  It  is really up to us to decide our future.  Often prevention is easier than  the cure.  Building character takes time and effort, but the rewards are  immense.<br /><br />Finally, I found a book my husband and I could read and  discuss at length.  What he said to me made perfect sense.  When he plays  softball everyone on the team has individual responsibilities yet they work  as a collective whole to win the game.  To me collectivism to its extreme  is the political principle of centralized social and economic control,  especially of all means of production.  Individualism to its extreme is the  belief that all actions are determined by, or at least take place for, the  benefit of the individual, not of society as a whole.  Individualism to its  extreme could be said to be anarchy (a theory that regards the absence of  all direct or coercive government as a political ideal and that proposes  the cooperative and voluntary association of individuals and groups as the  principal mode of organized society).<br /><br />In my opinion, we need a basic  set of rules to follow so we can respect one another.  If we do not strike  out as individuals we would simply be robots waiting for instructions.  Clearly, there has to be a balance between personal responsibility and the  responsibility we have to others.  If we were all doing the job we were  sent here to earth to do would not this world be a beautiful peaceful  place?  It is a delicate balance and somehow we have tipped the scale in  the wrong direction.  David's book tells us what has tipped this scale and  takes us through a brilliant thought process to offer the solutions.<br /><br />Pope John Paul III said it with wisdom:  \\"To educate without a value  system based on truth is to abandon young people to moral confusion,  personal insecurity, and easy manipulation.  No country, not even the most  powerful, can endure if it deprives its own children of this essential  good.\\"<br /><br />We must teach our children to read, to comprehend truth and to  analyze what they are being told.  Teach your children to think about  issues which surround them now and in the future when they grow up they  will thank you for it.  I cannot thank my own parents enough for giving me  security in my own beliefs and for giving me a head start in reading at a  very young age.  It is abundantly clear to me that America's parents will  determine the future of our country.  David G. Myers has built upon this  thought, which I know many have wanted to voice but did not have a  platform.  I quote from his book:<br /><br />\\"We cannot expect our schools alone to  restore the moral infrastructure.  Character is nurtured by families and  supportive neighbors, churches, kin, and child-friendly media.\\"<br /><br />This  vital guide will illuminate the dark path we are on.  Hopefully, we will  see the fork in the road and take the path to \\"The New American Dream.\\"<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewe all doing the job we were  sent here to earth to do would not this world be a beautiful peaceful  place?

My husband and I spent a wonderful two days in July 2000 staying in \\"The Cabin.\\"  at the Guest House Cottages on Whidbey Island.  We found this romantic spot in this book.  There are so many wonderful places  in this book, so I will tell you about the place we stayed to give you an  idea of the quality of the listings presented in this great resource.<br /><br />We stayed in the cutest log cabin you have ever seen, pictures at my  site.  A complimentary continental breakfast was set up for us on arrival.  We loved having our own kitchen and a grocery store nearby so we could pick  up needed supplies for a picnic at the beach.  There was a beautiful pool  where you could lay out in the sun.  In the winter you would be sipping hot  chocolate by one of the beautiful fireplaces in your cabin.  The cabins  were off the road in the woods and have queen or king-size featherbeds.  The floors, walls and ceilings were all wood.  They have river-rock  fireplaces or wood-burning stoves, skylights and antique furnishings.  The  one we stayed in had beautiful stained-glass windows.  They really went  out of their way to make our stay as romantic as possible.  Once you have  your key, the cabin is all yours.  It is your own private getaway.  If you  are running late they even offer to leave the key out for you when you  arrive.<br /><br />There was a private deck complete with barbecue and two chairs  so you could sit and look out over the pond inhabited by African geese.  The surroundings were lush and green and we saw lots of the cutest bunnies.<br /><br />We also visited a lavender field and brought home a little lavender  plant. If you do visit these same cottages, don't forget to visit Deception  Pass.  In fact, plan to stay at least two days, there are plenty of  activities, including hiking and sailing.<br /><br />I can truly say that without  this book, we would most likely have never known about this secret  hideaway.  So, between you and me....don't tell too many people!  This is a  great place.  Only tell your best friends or buy them this book.  I also  recommend this book as a wedding present.<br /><br />The pages are filled with  pictures of each getaway and the general prices are also listed for your  convenience.

Sandra Kuck and Lisa Guest have created the perfect shower gift for every new mom.  Sandra Kuck's paintings are incredibly detailed and show the magical world of children and their mothers.  This book has a Victorian  beauty and the poems, passages and quotes are truly meaningful.<br /><br />Sandra  Kuck is an award-winning artist who has won the \\"Artist of the  Year\\" six times.  Lisa Guest writes and edits from her Southern  California home so she can spend time with her own two children, Stephen  and Sarah.  Here is an example:<br /><br />My Little Miracle<br /><br />How can I love so  intensely someone I barely know? Someone who has said not a word and shared  not a thought, someone who has yet to see a page of the calendar turn.....  I wait for a glimmer of recognition in those shining eyes.... I look for a  hint of a smile as I hold you close.... Through the night, I check your  cradle, looking for the rising and falling of your chest and straining to  hear your soft breaths... How can I love so intensely someone I barely  know?  I didn't know it was possible -- until there was you, my little  miracle, my little mystery.<br /><br />While this book is only 32 pages long, I  could not think of a more appropriate gift for a new mom.  No, I don't have  my own children yet, but I have done my fair share of babysitting and have  a new second cousin who has reminded me how much we can  love and how  surprised we are that we can bond with another soul just by holding a baby  for less than 15 minutes!

If you remember Thumbelina, The Nightingale, The Ugly Duckling or The Princess and the Pea, they are all here in a wonderful collection of stories written by Hans Christian Anderson.  Unlike the Brothers Grimm, who  collected and recorded popular tales, Hans Christian Anderson wrote his own  \\"folk\\" tales, which also contain Danish history and foreign  literature.<br /><br />Not all of his stories end well, yet this is a side of life  children should learn about so they can be aware of it later in life.  Your  child might be horrified to learn that not everything ends up quite as  magical as it would in a Disney movie.  My favorite tale has always been  \\"The Little Mermaid.\\"  She wanted to be something she was not meant to be  and for me that is a lesson of how we should be who we really are.  She  actually ends up not marrying the prince.  I quote:<br /><br />The little mermaid  lifted up glorified eyes towards the sun, and felt them, for the first  time, filling with tears.  On the ship, in which she had left the  prince......she saw him and his beautiful bride searching for her; sorrowfully  they gazed at the pearly foam, as if they knew she had thrown herself into  the waves.<br /><br />Some of the stories are very moralistic, yet he retains a  mischievous sense of humor in some stories.  His stories always reflect his  fertile imagination.  This particular collection was translated by Mrs. H.  B. Paull, H. Oskar Sommer, Jean Hersholt and several other unknown  translators.  Six distinguished artists helped to illustrate this book.  These are black and white illustrations and there are not really very many  of them.  To me a fully illustrated book should be fully illustrated.  Nonetheless, this is not a book just for children.  In fact, I see this  more as a book which should be read to children by their parents.  In this  way parents and children can discuss items of interest.  This book on its  own would most likely not appeal to a child, due to the lack of pictures.  It is meant to be read to them as far as I can tell.  I also would  recommend it to adults who remembered these stories as I did and want to  read them again.<br /><br />Perhaps I also remember the story about the tinder box  very well.  It is a magical story of a soldier who goes into a hollow tree  and finds a passage with doors which lead to chambers.  It sounds  frightening at first but has a lovely happy ending.<br /><br />Books can take us  to another world and this one will take a child to many places they will  never forget.  And so the first story begins: \\"Far down in the forest,  where the warm sun and the fresh air made a sweet resting place, grew a  pretty little fir-tree; and yet it was not happy, it wished so much to be  tall like its companions¯the pines and firs which grew around it.

Beatrix Potter acquired her love and knowledge of animals and the countryside during family holidays in Scotland.  She also had animals as her constant companions as a child.  She sketched and observed them for  hours at a time.<br /><br />Beatrix Potter's books have never lost their popularity.  They are sold by the millions and have been translated into over fifteen  languages.  While her first story in 1902, \\"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\\" was  published in a small edition by Frederick Warne, within a year it was an  instant best seller.<br /><br />This deluxe volume is a collection of all  twenty-three tales and some previously unpublished works.  The stories are  arranged in the order of publication as several are linked together by  events or familiar characters.<br /><br />Both the watercolors and black and white  illustrations have been included.  Children will adore the rhyming names of  goosey gander and pig-wig.  The animals seem to almost take on human  personalities.  In fact, these magical stories are often connected with  real people places or animals.<br /><br />Little girls who have a doll house will  love \\"The Tale of Two Bad Mice,\\" in which two hungry mice try to eat the  artificial plaster doll food.  Even at my age I found it irresistibly  amusing.  These little animals just have such great personalities.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2000-07-15

You will also be  warned not to mix chlorine cleaning products with baking soda.  I was  surprised to find information on refinishing furniture, saving time, saving  energy and saving money.  Those are things we could all learn whether we  like to clean or not.<br /><br />I would recommend this for a new bride, for your  own reference library, or as a gift for your friends who are interested in  having all the answers to their questions in one convenient book.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2000-07-15

Excuse me, could I please tell you about a book I just read?  Well, this is what Emilie Marie would say if she could walk off the pages and into your life.  She also believes that the heart of all good manners is the  Golden Rule:  Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  This is a  little girl you would happily invite over for a tea party!<br /><br />This is just  an enchanting book for helping young ladies learn courtesy and kindness.  Emilie Marie introduces herself in a most polite way, then explains how her  Aunt Evelyn has been helping her practice her manners.<br /><br />This book helps  girls to learn how to meet people, shake hands, answer the phone, be a good  friend and so much more.  I loved the section on the heart of Good Manners.  I must say we adults could learn a few things from this book.  Emilie  Marie learns how to write thank you notes and how to answer invitations to  a party.<br /><br />To give this book to a little girl is also a way to give the  gift of happiness to all those who know her.  Michal Sparks has illustrated  the pink and yellow pages in the most charming way possible.  The blue bow  on the cover is just adorable.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review and I  really hope you will buy this book for someone you know.  I bought it for  my nieces and they love it.

I actually still have the version of this book my mother read to me as a child.  She must have started reading it to me when I was only three years old.  Quite possibly this book started me on my way to finding God.  I  never forgot the stories or the painting style pictures.  The pictures in  fact fascinated me, and I remember looking through the book on my own at an  early age.<br /><br />The language in this book is in simple words, yet teaches  great truths.  This was the source of light to me as a child.  Basically,  this is a book of stories from the Bible in language very young children  can understand.  I quote:<br /><br />King Solomon built this new house.  Do you know  who he made it for?  It is God's house.  It took a long time to build it  because it is so nice.  Solomon is glad because he could make this  beautiful house for God to live in.  I Kings 6:11-14<br /><br />1.  Whose house is  this? 2.  Is Solomon glad?<br /><br />Not only are the stories understandable,  children will enjoy answering the questions, pointing to items in the  pictures and even possibly reading parts of the story themselves.<br /><br />When I  read my \\"adult\\" Bible, I sometimes wish my version was illustrated as  beautifully as this book.  At least the pictures are in my mind and remind  me of when I first learned the beautiful stories of the Bible.  There are  so many lessons we can apply to our own lives today.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2000-07-15

Once you see how  beautiful this book is, you will also want to recommend it to your school  librarian as a reference book.  There is a classification section and a  complete index which one would expect from such an encyclopedic work.<br /><br />I  was shocked to read in the foreword that within the next 80-100 years, many  of the beautiful creatures described in this book would become extinct.  This is definitely a book for all those who value our fascinating planet.<br /><br />If you love animals, this is your ultimate guide to learning more.  With  over 2,000 illustrations of mammals, reptiles, fish, birds and amphibians,  this is truly an incredible visual catalogue of who is who in the animal  kingdom.<br /><br />Each illustrated animal is described in detail.

Damascus, located next to the Amana River in Syria, is the  oldest continually inhabited city in the world.  Death on the other hand, is the oldest fear to haunt each soul on earth.<br /><br />If you have ever  thought about life, death, God and why you are here, this book allows you  to consider Joseph's theories which are based on monotheistic thought mixed  with Eastern religion.  This was an enjoyable read, filled with compelling  questions about why we are here on earth, where we came from, and what will  happen to us when we die.<br /><br />The Road to Damascus is Joseph Pierre's  journey to discovering who God is and who we are.  Joseph Pierre draws  from his own experiences in life and his own epiphany.  Unlike many  authors who tackle this subject, he is able to bring his thought process  across in stories and explanations that you completely comprehend.  In  fact, Mr. Pierre has a subtle sense of humor, even though he discusses  complex questions we have asked from the beginning of time.<br /><br />This is a  study of a man's search for God.  If you are more inclined to Christian  beliefs, you will still find many points with which you agree, even though  his main philosophies are not based on Biblical beliefs. You do not  necessarily need to embrace his theories or philosophies to enjoy his  story.  Everyone will agree with his theory that peace would reign in the  world if we all followed the Ten Commandments and that a lack of adherence  to them has caused us sorrow and pain.<br /><br />This is a compact book that makes  you think deeply and should be read in one sitting.  In this way you are  able to absorb the first part of the book and apply it to the second half  while it is still fresh in your mind.  He examines issues that affect us  all; we all have fears, hopes and dreams.  We are never going to get out of  this world alive.  So, based on this, we are left with few options.  Mr.  Pierre states that man's soul is eternal, with which I agree.  God breathed  life into Man and thereafter Man has the God-like power to create new souls  through conception.<br /><br />This is an excellent book that should cause you to  start asking questions and I hope it will fuel within you the desire to  search for God.  Just like Paul, on the road to Damascus, I believe that  God revealed himself as Jesus Christ.  To Joseph, the revelation is that  God lives within each one of us and sees life through our eyes.  This is a  well written book and I recommend it for those who are interested in  researching different views about who God is.  I also recommend this book  to those who enjoy looking through the eyes of an author who has gone  through a life changing experience.<br /><br />I find it fascinating to delve into  the mind of an author and find out what he truly believes.  I don't believe  there is a single book on which everyone can agree, but if a book can make  you think, then it has done it's job.  What you take from this book is up  to you.  Remember to look for the positive aspects in life.  This will  allow you to take from life what you need.  This attitude will give your  life meaning and help you enjoy your own journey all the more.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewre states that man's soul is eternal, with which I agree.

If barbecuing is on your mind, prepare to transform your grill into a sacred fire pit.  Once you start reading The Great American Barbecue & Grilling Manual, you will be seduced by this ancient art.  Smoky Hale is truly the barbecue guru of our time.  His goal is to show us the best method and to dispel the myths created by those who do not understand the true definition of barbecue.<br /><br />This is a book you will find difficult to put down, so give yourself time to savor page after page of mouth-watering information.  The descriptive writing and historical facts will satisfy your cerebral appetite even before the cooking begins.  Every conceivable piece of knowledge on barbecue is here in one book, look no further.  Smoky Hale makes no excuses for his love affair with \\"Authentic Barbecue.\\"<br /><br />About halfway through this \\"manual\\" you will already be driven to distraction by a tempting array of dishes which includes: Barbecued Pork Ribs, Churrasco, Fajitas, Sirloin Strips, Perfect Hamburgers, Chicken, Shrimp, Pork Shish Kebabs, Grilled Bass, and a Grilled Eggplant and Tomato with Shrimp and Pesto Stuffing.  Most importantly he divulges the secret for knowing when a piece of meat is ready to be turned.<br /><br />Just as you are starting to get nostalgic about your grill, you will happen upon an entire chapter devoted to selecting a new grill.  Yes, by Chapter Nine it is now the time to discover the anatomy of a grill.  The diagram on page 294 may enlighten you as the Hardwood/Charcoal grill is finally explained in detail.  This answered my question as to why one would need a fire box attached to a grill. For those who prefer to \\"Grill\\" quickly, there is an entire chapter on gas and electric cooking.<br /><br />You will soon learn that the word barbecue is not all-inclusive and does not necessarily mean just cooking a steak on a grill.  The decision on which grill to purchase will rest solely on how you intend to use it, as a simple gas grill will start to seem rather elementary after you see the possibilities of a hardwood/charcoal grill.  Smoky also includes some intriguing ways to maintain your grill.  He provides sections on curing, smoking and drying meat.  His recipes for rubs, basting sauces, side dishes, salads and breads are included to heighten the desire of your already tortured palate.<br /><br />I can truly say this is now my favorite book on barbecue.  It is not only written by an author who is completely versed in his subject, this encyclopedic work has been infused with humor and has been filled to overflowing with an overwhelming measure of experience.  Once you read about his friend Paul Kirk's Crab Stuffed Salmon, you imagination will be on fire.<br /><br />All I have left to say is......\\"Start up the Grills!\\" P.S.  No, you cannot borrow my copy!  It is mine....ALL mine.<br /><br />Just so you know, the best source for barbecue grills and smokers made from thick new steel is found in Texas.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewter you see the possibilities of a hardwood/charcoal grill.

The illustrations are whimsical and the messages eternal!  All 127 pages are a pure delight.  This is a collection of quotes which bring to mind the shared memories between friends.  This tiny treasure is divided into five  sections.  The introduction describes friendship in detail and then the  rest of the pages contain famous quotes or brief passages about friendship.<br /><br />My favorite quote is: \\"Happiness is the by-product of an effort to make  someone else happy. - Gretta Palmer (b. 1905) American Writer.  At this  price you can order at least one or two of these books for all your  friends.  As you can see from the cover picture, this is a brightly  illustrated book.  Some of the pages also have pastel backgrounds.<br /><br />Some of  the best gifts I have ever received have been tiny books.  I put them in  my purse and enjoy reading them when I have to wait in line or wait for a  table at a restaurant.  With this book, it is time well spent.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2000-06-11

This is a book with page after page of an area in France I love. It is a place I want to visit time and time again. I can almost smell the intoxicating lavender breeze as I glance at the cover.<br /><br />If you purchase this book as a gift, I highly recommend enclosing something that has the scent of lavender. A soap or even a drop of lavender oil on the inside cover will make this a sensory experience.<br /><br />While I love books filled with recipes, I could not resist this one. Oh, to be in France at this moment sitting by a lavender field. This book truly brought back memories of my trip to France and I enjoyed the information on olives as I had purchased olive oil and olives at a little sea side store in Cassis. You will be looking into plane tickets soon after reading about the rich culinary heritage of this region.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2000-04-24

It is my belief that women will respond very positively to a man who applies some of these principle in his marriage.  Deciding to weather the storms in your marriage is the belief system you need to run as far away from divorce as you can  get. (My sympathy goes out to all those lawyers who won't be making any  money off you and your friends after you apply these helpful lessons.)<br /><br />When  we know we are not threatened by abandonment, that is when we can learn to  trust. Tell each other often that you are not going to leave. You are here  to work things out and maybe save an otherwise hopeless marriage.<br /><br />It is  amazing what these words can do! If nothing else works turn to the creator  who made you and ask him for the strength you need to make it through the  tough times. You are a soul in the school called life and there are some  lessons you cannot learn without a journey into a seemingly hopeless  situation.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2000-04-24

Our words do not always say what we are feeling - our body language always does.  Knowing which words to say on the other hand can  help us to enjoy a conversation more and keep it flowing along.  Small  talk has helped me to realize what to say and what not to say.  I am not  perfect and I still wish I could remember 5 people's names in a row when  introduced to them at a party.  People who expect you to remember all those  names need: \\"How to Deal with Difficult People.\\" You will also  love \\"Stress Management for Professionals.\\" These three should  give you all the basics for interacting on the planet.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2000-04-24

Girlfriends Unite! This book is packed with information on how to make each part of your life extraordinary.  I recommend this book for married women, who can then disregard the dating chapter and living together  references.<br /><br />I also found some very interesting information on pregnancy  and related issues.  An entire chapter is devoted to depression, aging and  stress.  There is information here you just won't find anywhere else.  I  advise overlooking the things which might offend a more sensitive soul,  because there is so much more that you will enjoy reading about.<br /><br />You will  also learn how to communicate more effectively with your partner.  This is  definitely not a book you leave around the house for kids to find. There  are also some things men just would not enjoy reading about. We have to  keep some secrets.

I would rather buy a house with fresh paint, newly carpeted floors and windows that shone as you looked out of them.  My husband gives real estate advice to many of his clients and gives this book to many a client.  We all see our own homes as perfect.  The problem arises when someone comes into our homes and can see things we don't see or don't care about as much as someone else does.  This books will tell you everything you need to know.  Try to think of the buyer and then of course how much more money you will be making.  Good Motivation!  My advice is to do all your decorating and repairs first, then get a cleaning service and deep clean everything.  When you move out you will not have to work as hard!  Who wants to clean two houses then?  Your attention is better spent on your new home at that point.  Who knows, maybe after your home is all spiffed up...you won't want to sell it!

If you are a man who is reading this - you are half way there already.  I think a cassette is an excellent choice as in my experience men shy away from a book about marriage.  If you are a women reading this - put the  cassette in his car (if he hasn't changed to a CD player by now or offer to  give him a massage while he listens.)  That is a bribe but isn't your  marriage worth it?  Massage is one of the best ways to reconnect with your  mate so why not have some intellectual stimualtion at the same time.<br /><br />You  can discuss it while you both are in a relaxed state. Yes, massage is just  as relaxing for you as for him. Do yourself a favor and purchase the set. Ellen Kreidman deserves 10 stars for giving us all this helpful information.

Yoga is a healing, nurturing way you can change how your body feels.  There are also many benefits for the mind.  When I am relaxed my mind does not run a mile a minute.<br /><br />While listening to the easy to follow cues you  will be creating a peaceful setting for sleep.  This tape should be  listened to at night when you can reap the benefits or in the morning if  you feel too stiff to get out of bed. (That may be a sign to get a new  one.)<br /><br />The first time I practiced this yoga tape in the afternoon and was  so relaxed, I fell asleep at the end.  I awoke and was completely refreshed  like I had never felt before.<br /><br />If you like this tape I also recommend Dr.  Weil's new soundbody/soundmind to use as you fall asleep.  You will then  have stretched your cares away and received a massage for the mind.  Take  this tape with you when you travel to get to sleep more easily.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2000-04-08

In my first review, I focused more on Gary Zukav's interviews on Oprah and how his words caused me to react. Now I would like to dive into his book and explain what he believes and give a summary so you can decide if this is a book you want to read for yourself. There are places in this book where you will completely understand the value of truth and will comprehend Gary Zukav's words. There are other times when you feel you mind spiraling out to a place you have never been, because these are the areas you may be unfamiliar with or they may go against your own religious beliefs.<br /><br />There are two view points. We are either created by God and he gives us a soul and then allows us to make our own decisions, or as Gary seems to believe, we came from an evolutionary process somewhere in the universe. Whatever your belief system, you will agree that we have five senses: touch, smell, taste, hearing and sight. He explains how these senses make us a \\"five-sensory\\" individual. Those who have learned there is more to life than physical sensations have become a \\"multisensory\\" human.<br /><br />These Multisensory individuals are those who have realized that our souls are on an eternal journey and speak to our own souls by awakening within us a recognition of the truth. He believes it is time for us to answer the question: \\"Is there a God or a Divine Intelligence?\\" His book is about \\"authentic empowerment\\" and he explains this as a person who is strong enough not to even want to use force against another person. Could this be another way of saying \\"peace in the world?\\" He discusses Karma, evolution, reincarnation, evil, joy, intuition, thought, choice, addiction, relationships, psychology, illusion, power and trust.<br /><br />I agree that an angry person will respond to his life with anger and cause more problems than a reverent person who deals with his problems by showing love and understanding. To learn lessons in life and move from one stage of existence to the other seems to me to be his message.<br /><br />This is a deep, thought-provoking book, and like a scientific formula, it is hard to understand at first. My basic disagreements would be that I don't believe we evolved, but were created...I don't believe we come back to life as souls to live again in human form and I don't believe that we can at all times fight evil with only our minds because there are others who will not or cannot control their own evil impulses. He uses the word evolving throughout the book. This to me is \\"learning.\\" I do believe we create our own situations to a point. His deep concepts are explained with enjoyable stories one can relate to.<br /><br />To me this is a book that shows us where we are as a human race and gives a sense of hope by saying: \\"We can all make the world a better place by making a conscious choice to make it that way, so let's try.\\" If we could all learn to love and as he says: \\"choose the most positive behavior for each moment,\\" we may just be able to gain the authentic power he talks about.

I did not grow up watching Julia Child on her famous TV program, but I sure love butter as much as she does.  I grew up in Africa so I didn't hear of her until a few years ago when I started looking for shows on TV about cooking.  After watching a special on her life and then watching a cooking show where Jacques made the most delicious creations, I decided to hunt down this book.  I enjoyed both Julia and Jacques' sense of humor and love the work they have done together.<br /><br />Most cooks need books they can cook from fast.  This book is for a day when you can take the time to read from cover to cover.  Not only will you learn some new techniques you never thought of (a chicken massage with butter-mmmm!), you will also see that cooks are not all the same. We all have a special talent and gift to give the world.<br /><br />It is good to know that these two cooks stepped out of their own kitchens and have used their lives to teach so much.  I recommend this book to all who collect books and all who may be new to the world of cooking.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2000-04-07

While I consider myself to work mostly on instinct in the kitchen, it is fun to read that you were right all along.  Yes, as my  grandmother taught me - potatoes are easier to peel when hot.  She always  made me boil them in their jackets when making potato salad.<br /><br />I had also  wondered why lentils sometimes stayed firm after being cooked for the same  time as other recipes.  The secret is on page 207 and an acidic ingredient  is the culprit.  From personal experience I knew that I should let a cake  cool before frosting it but this could save someone a lot of melted icing  if they just didn't think about it.<br /><br />Think of this book as your  grandmothers wisdom all in one book.  Sharon is truly an expert and has  done her research.  This book has helped me to realize why things work the  way they do and has validated many of my own beliefs.

My  grandmother first taught me the delicate art of creating choux pastry.

I already had everything typed in one file on my computer when I first found her book.<br /><br />I simply used my search tools in Word to locate all the items she discussed and believe me I had made quite a few common mistakes.  The book itself was extremely useful...I was however more impressed that when I wrote to Barbara - she actually wrote back and gave me some of the best advice I have ever recieved. After using almost every principle taught in this book, I can truly say that I have produced a cookbook I am proud of and will enjoy using for a lifetime.<br /><br />So, whether you grew up overseas like I did and didn't realize powdered sugar was actually called confectioners' sugar, or you are writng recipes that contain foreign words, this is also the book for you.  The chapter which gave information on leading food authorities gave me a greater insight into what I needed to give my readership.<br /><br />If this is the perfect guide - I hope I have produced the perfect cookbook.  Thank you Barbara for taking the time to help cookbook writers everywhere.  Now I am taking the next step - finding a publisher and creating a website.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2000-04-05

I see this book as an intellectual journey into the world of facinating food.  While you don't need a science degree to understand the facts and figures, you might feel like you have one when you finish reading this  comprehensive resource.  It may take me a few years to absorb all the  knowlege presented here.<br /><br />While testing recipes I noticed a great  difference in the quality of baked goods when I used two different brands  of flour.  Who would have known that hard wheat and soft wheat produce  different results.  There I was adding more and more all-purpose flour to a  recipe that had worked the first time I tried it.  The only variable was  that I was using a soft/hard wheat blend and had used a hard wheat flour  the time before.  What a revelation!<br /><br />My chocolate cake recipe now states  exactly what brand of flour to use.  The texture is chewy and delicious and  lets just say that it would not have been this way if I had not understood  the differnce in the quality of a flour.  If you are trying to understand  why things work or don't - this is one of the best scientific studies I  have begun to read.  I also grew up in Africa and found the information on  Maize versus Corn facinating.<br /><br />I continue to order a maize meal from a  catalog since the texture is different than the cornmeal we use in America.  Who would have guessed that the Native Americans were enjoying popcorn  long before any one else.  We should thank them for taking the time to  cultivate one of our favorite snacks.  The truth is, so many cultures have  contributed so much to our American way of life.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2000-04-05

Whether you just enjoy imagining you will make a loaf of bread, or want to purchase a gift for a friend....This is the book on bread you will both love.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2000-04-04

This book is truly a labor of love.  No other book has such varied multicultural information all in one place.  This book should be celebrated for its diversity and insight into the world of every imaginable cooking experience on the planet.<br /><br />I value this book highly for it's insight into a world I may not be able to visit without a reading tour.  I have found her research to mirror much of my own research and I would highly recommend this book to those who look at cooking from an intellectual level and are curious about other cultures.<br /><br />My grandmother has always told me I have a Norwegian heritage and I was delighted by the 7 carefully written pages on this subject.<br /><br />If you want an overview of cooking from Africa, Albania, America, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Holland, England, France, Germany, Iran or even Japan....this is the book for you.  While you will not find recipes you will finally understand what Mealie-meal is or why Bobotie is so good.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2000-04-04

This is the ultimate information resource for the curious cook.  The information is accurate and includes almost every ingredient, food, or recipe description a new cook could ever want to know.<br /><br />I was dissapointed not to find a description of Fleur de Sel which is the best salt you can  purchase. With that said, I really have no other complaints. A work which includes so many multicultural ingredient explanations is worth all 5 stars.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2000-04-03

If you have ever tried to make a potato salad or french fries you will find that the process may sound simple, yet without a few tried and true methods you may end up with less than desirable results.<br /><br />This is the beauty of Christopher Kimball's books.  He not only tells you which  potatoes work best in each recipe, he explains the proper method for  cooking and storing them.  You will find a great secret on page 50 when  making potato salad.<br /><br />You will also enjoy the descriptive writing these  tiny treasures are so famous for. The only thing I would add to this book  is the idea of serving the baked sweet potato with butter and maple syrup.  If you are tired of boring baked potatoes, this is the book for you.  I  also recommend The Best Recipe by the same author.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2000-04-03

This is not only a book for those who love to be entertained, it is also for those who love to cook and want to make their cooking the best it can be.<br /><br />Christopher Kimball is one of the great researchers of our time.  His attention to detail is remarkable.  As an aspiring cookbook author myself, I see this book as an example of how recipes should be written.<br /><br />My favorite sections are the detailed scientific and descriptive essays which are intriguing and entertaining to read. Not only did this book help me decide which barbecue grill to purchase; I also can't wait for summer to cook a butterflied chicken.<br /><br />The information on chocolate is extremely accurate.  This is the first book I reach for when I have a cooking question or want to validate my beliefs.  You could say this is my cooking Bible.  I also like the fact that there is a website and a real author you can actually write to.  The website also gives the option to purchase individual recipes.<br /><br />I find it refreshing to find that the author is interested in his readership and really does want you to have success the first time you make a recipe.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Kimball for helping us clarify the technical details and solve the cooking confusion.  I can't wait for the next book.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />END	2000-04-03
