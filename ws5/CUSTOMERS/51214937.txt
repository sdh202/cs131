She moved to New York to follow her dreams, but returned to her hometown of Briarwood, giving up that dream and instead of designing dresses, she made wedding dresses from existing patterns. However, there was one dress that it was rumored she still worked on. No one is allowed to see it, but every wishful bride would love to be the one to buy it and wear it on her wedding day. <br /> <br />Sylvie won't talk about her past and why she left New York, and it's a very sensitive subject for her. Instead of confronting her past, she buries herself in her many jobs - Dog groomer and boarder, wedding dressmaker, and other part time jobs that keep her busy day and night. <br /> <br />As the book opens, Sylvie sees that there are neighbors moving into the home next door, the house that once belonged to family friend Iva Whittaker who had passed away. Sylvie's current home, by the way, happened to have belonged once to her grandparents, the Shea's, and the Shea's and the Whittaker's were family friends from way back. Everyone in town thought the Whittaker house had been willed to a nephew, but looking at the man that was moving into the vacated house, Sylvie did not recognize him at all and was shocked to hear that the so-called nephew had sold the house to a total stranger. <br /> <br />Joel Mercer is a single dad, with a lovable six-year old daughter Rianne. While Joel comes across as grouchy and cantankerous, Rianne looks like she is looking for a new friend, and when her cat is treed by Sylvie's temporary boarder Oscar the dog, Sylvie and Rianne meet, and they soon become friends. Sylvie becomes an honorary member of the Shea family, making friends with Sylvie's niece and even calling Sylvie's mother \\"Grandmother Nan\\". Joel, in the meantime, finds himself attracted to Sylvie, but Sylvie is totally unaware of his feelings. <br /> <br />There is a lot of sadness inside Sylvie, but she hides her feelings behind her work, giving everyone the impression that she is a woman who is strong and independent. But deep down, she longs for the life that her sisters have - both are happily married, with one in the family way. Sylvie works lovingly on her wedding dress, never expecting to wear it. But with the Shea women constantly looking to set Sylvie up on blind dates, it is highly unlikely that Sylvie will remain single for very long... <br /> <br />I enjoyed this small town love story by Roz Denny Fox. This type of romance I always find endearing, and the ending scene of THE SECRET WEDDING DRESS pretty much put the icing on the cake for me. This is a love story for those who enjoy old-fashioned romances and happy sweet endings. Recommended. <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

THE LAYING ON OF HANDS by Brenda Rhodes Miller<br /><br />October 9, 2005<br /><br />Amazon rating 4 stars<br /><br />THE LAYING ON OF HANDS by Brenda Rhodes Miller takes place in the South where \\"Miss Muchie\\" is born and raised to be a healer. Her father and his mother are both healers, and when her grandmother Tyler Mama realizes Muchie has the gift, she begins training Muchie to follow in their footsteps.<br /><br />The novel's narration begins in the early 1900's in Buccatunna Mississippi. Miss Muchie works with her grandmother to learn how to use the herbs that add to their healing powers, and accompanies her grandmother when she delivers babies all over the county.  Her grandmother is a very highly respected woman in their community, known for her knowledge of herbs and medicine. It is Tyler Mama's wish for Muchie to take over after she passes on.<br /><br />As she grows older, Muchie finds she is able to heal others with her power, but what she also learns is that for some reason, she cannot help those closest to her.  She begins to doubt her faith, and wishes she did not have this gift of healing.<br /><br />While Muchie is still of school age, she falls in love with a man who arrives in town with a group of ministers who come to build a real school.  Muchie is much too young for Edward Preston or \\"Teddy\\" as his close friends call him, but eventually they find a way to be together and start their new life in Mobile, Alabama.  Their time together is a happy time, but when tragedy strikes, Muchie isn't sure she wants to go on with her life.<br /><br />THE LAYING ON OF HANDS is a story of faith and perseverance at the hands of tragedy, but it is also a look back in time.  The Civil War brought the freeing of the slaves, and Muchie's life mirrors the life of those who came after slavery, but before the time of the Civil Rights movement and the women's right to vote.  Muchie lived in a time where it was difficult to survive alone as a black woman, but with the help of loved ones and friends, she overcomes tragedies and makes a life for herself and her children.  I enjoyed this book and loved the character of Muchie.  I'm giving this book 4 stars.	2005-10-09

IMAGINARY MEN by Anjali Banerjee <br />September 22, 2005 <br /> <br />Amazon rating 4/5 <br /> <br />\\"Anjali Banerjee debuts in Imaginary Men, a chick lit story that takes place in the Indian-American community. The main character, Lina Ray, initially seems stereotypical of genre heroines - a single professional in her twenties, looking for love. But the more one reads this novel, the more it stands out from the crowd. While romance is the main story line, a sub-theme shows how hard it is for those pulled between two cultures to find a middle ground. <br /> <br />The book opens with Lina Ray in her hometown of Kolkata, India, attending her sister Durga's wedding. Lina Ray fears her Aunt Kiki's overbearing personality - because Lina Ray is still single, despite being the eldest sister, Aunt Kiki will be playing matchmaker again. This time, Kiki's idea of the perfect match is a guy Lina Ray refers to in her mind as 'Pee Wee Herman'. Not good. To avoid being tied down, she lies to everyone, saying that she is already engaged to a man named Raja.\\" - M Lofton - Complete review at BookLoons. <br /> <br />This book was funny and smart and not typical chick lit.

A LITTLE CHANGE OF FACE by Lauren Baratz-Logsted <br />September 22, 2005 <br /> <br />Amazon Rating: 4/5 stars  <br /> <br />In A LITTLE CHANGE OF FACE by Lauren Baratz-Logsted, a woman decides to change her image from a beauty to a plain Jane, to see if she can attract a man not for her looks, but for what is inside. <br /> <br />This was my introduction to Baratz-Logsted's books, and I have to say I enjoyed this one. A LITTLE CHANGE OF FACE is not your typical chick lit novel.  The premise is a bit off the wall, but I feel that the author made it work. Scarlett Jane Stein has always been known for her good looks and great body, but she's tired of being judged by her appearances.  She decides it's time to make a change, so she goes from beautiful to plain Jane, even changing her job and moving to a new town to complete the process. <br /> <br />As Lettie Shaw, she is now a dowdy old maid, and she is no longer attracting the people she did in the past when she was a beauty.  With the help of her `default' best friend Pam, Lettie is as plain as can be.  <br /> <br />Scarlett (Lettie) finds out what it's like to live like the other half - to have to make an impression on other people without having to use her body. But she also learns a bit about friendship and people through this experiment.  This was chick lit with a little bit more, and A LITTLE CHANGE OF FACE may be a book that not everyone will \\"get\\", but I felt it was a well-written book, very witty and funny, and will be reading the rest of Lauren's books in the near future.	2005-09-22

Simone, however, does not have plans to follow in her mother and grandmother's footsteps.  Madame Gabrielle, the matriarch of the family, is very disappointed but tries to convince Simone to follow in the family trade by introducing Simone to a Persian jeweler, whose expertise is in red diamonds. Unfortunately for Gabrielle, Simone and Cyrus fall in love and marry. To escape her family's disappointment in her, they move to the mountains of Tehran where they live in peace and happiness. <br /> <br />While the book starts out as a romance, it soon takes on the feel of a mystery, when Cyrus disappears and is presumed dead, and Simone tries to put the pieces together and find her husband's murderers. The center of the mystery is the red diamonds, and Simone believes that he knew something about these diamonds that endangered his life.   <br />  <br />While part of COURTESAN focuses on the mystery of the red diamonds and Cyrus's disappearance and probable murder, the other important theme is the family origins of the Honore' family.  The reader will learn, through Gabrielle's letters to Simone, the truth about their family, and what Gabrielle tried to hide from her daughter and granddaughter for all those years.  In turn, a few of the characters in the book are not who they claim to be, and by the end of the story, the reader will fully understand Gabrielle's epic-like story and how her life as a courtesan came to be.   <br /> <br />I enjoyed COURTESAN, but not as much as I loved her debut, HAREM, which I felt, was better written.  Despite having said that, I do recommend COURTESAN for lovers of historical fiction.  I will definitely read her next novel, whatever it may be.	2005-09-17

Gracelin O'Malley by Ann Moore <br />August 26, 2005 <br /> <br />Rating:   4 stars <br /> <br /> <br />GRACELIN O'MALLEY by Ann Moore is the start of an epic trilogy of books that centers on the people of poverty-stricken Ireland. It starts out at a slow pace, but once it picked up I raced through this novel about a woman and her family living in Ireland of the mid 1800's. Gracelin O'Malley is the only girl born to a couple who live off the land that is owned by an English squire. Due to circumstances that she cannot control, Gracelin ends up marrying this squire, and for the next few years she suffers at his hands, living in fear but determined to hang on, to save her own family's livelihood. The Irish are dependent mostly on the English, who control the land and the wealth.  And with the potato famines, it is a wonder there were people that did not succumb to the starvation that they all experienced.  <br /> <br />GRACELIN O'MALLEY is very depressing in many parts, but there is hope for Gracelin. She is a woman that is headstrong, and will sacrifice herself for the well being of others, family or stranger.  Her fate in life is probably akin to that of many during her day, but she stands out in this novel as a woman that is determined to survive. <br /> <br />For those who love historical fiction, this is for you.  I have already bought the next two books in the series and hope to read them before the year is out.	2005-08-27

A PERSONAL MATTER by Karyn Langhorne <br />August 26, 2005 <br /> <br />Rating:    4/5 stars <br /> <br /> <br />I enjoyed A PERSONAL MATTER by Karyn Langhorne, the story of an African American paralegal at a nearly all white law firm who finds herself working for an attorney who is difficult, to say the least. Alayna Jackson spent most of her adult life raising her younger sister Martine, who was 7 years old at the time of their mother's death. While the age difference was only 10 years, the relationship between the two girls was more like that of a mother and daughter, and while Martine grew up with everything that Alayna was able to give her, Alayna herself didn't spend much time on herself. She worked several part time jobs, got herself through high school and became a paralegal, all at the same time.  <br /> <br />With Martine getting ready for high school graduation, Alayna is concerned about her sister's upper education, but unfortunately Martine has her own plans.  Alayna, on the other hand, has just received a promotion and a raise, but is now forced to work for \\"The Ice Man\\", Ben Richards, an attorney that may be up for partner soon, if he can bring in this really big client with the help of Alayna.  <br /> <br />Alayna is approaching the big Three-Oh, but she has yet to have a real relationship with someone of the opposite sex.  And while she lusts after \\"The Ice Man\\" day and night, she knows that she can't cross that racial line.  Ben also feels something for her, but the two of them try their best to keep their relationship on a professional level.  Let's see how long the two of them can maintain that level! <br /> <br />Lots of tension between Martine and Alayna, plus \\"The Ice Man\\" and Alayna are constantly fighting.  There's a lot going on in A PERSONAL MATTER, and the two story lines were dealt with quite nicely.  The characters are three-dimensional and the chemistry between Alayna and \\"The Ice Man\\" was definitely apparent. The race issue does comeup, especially when a brother shows his interest in Alayna, and he questions her and her relationship with her boss, who is white. All in all, I enjoyed this book a lot and would love to read more by Karyn Langhorne.	2005-08-27

FEVER by Linda Dominique Grosvenor<br /><br />August 27, 2005<br /><br />Rating:  3 ½ stars<br /><br />FEVER by Linda Dominique Grosvenor is about a group of people (two couples and one widow) that are dealing with their various relationships.  It's a sequel to her book LIKE BOOGIE ON TUESDAY, but FEVER works as a stand-alone novel.<br /><br />One couple lives in Los Angeles.  Tim Richardson is an up-and-coming film director, and his wife Nina is originally from New York and wishing she were back. While he works all day, she's at home and she's bored.  She gave up her career when she moved with him to the West Coast. Their sex life has been almost non-existent too. She is ready for a change.<br /><br />Carla and Sam are in New York and going through some rough times in their marriage. The problem with their relationship is that they started out on the wrong foot, when during their engagement she was found fooling around with another man. While Sam forgave Carla, this past indiscretion comes up periodically during their marriage, and now that she's had a baby, she hasn't been able to get out of her post-partum blues.  She doesn't want any counseling, and doesn't seem to be motivated at all to fix their marriage. Sam loves her with all his heart and is willing to do anything to make her happy again, but there is only so much a man can take.<br /><br />There's a fifth person thrown into the mix.  Troi is Sam's sister-in-law. Her deceased husband Vaughn was Sam's brother, and in many ways Sam reminds her of Vaughn.  Her history of Vaughn was rather tumultuous toward the end of his life, due to his infidelities and subsequent diagnosis of Aids.  With Sam coming over to her house to help out Troi and her young daughter whenever they need it, the two begin to bond. It doesn't help that Sam needs someone to talk to, since his hands are tied in regards to his wife.<br /><br />I enjoyed FEVER and found that I liked each of the main characters.  Linda Dominique Grosvenor's writing reminds me a little of Eric Jerome Dickey, at least in the way she approaches her story.  Each chapter focuses on one set of characters, going from one set of characters to the other as the story progresses. The only complaint I have is that the book is too short.  The endings for each couples' story could have been drawn out a little longer, but other than that,  FEVER was a satisfying African-American lit novel, and I wouldn't mind reading more by Grosvenor.	2005-08-27
100017:US	51214937	R280DN5BOB46DQ	0312301936	428666378	Bitter Milk: A Novel	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A promising debut novel by a gifted writer	BITTER MILK by John McManus <br />August 21, 2005 <br /> <br />Rating:    3   stars <br /> <br />Here's a book that was unique from the start.  The debut novel BITTER MILK by John McManus is narrated by a character that does not exist, except in the mind of its main character, Lorn.  The narrative is rambling at best, almost like a stream of consciousness type of writing.  <br /> <br />The story takes place in the east hills of Tennessee, and 9-year old Lorn lives there with his mother. He's overweight and very much the loner, except for his \\"friend\\" Luther. Lorn's mother isn't your typical maternal character. She's very independent and has wanted to be a man for a long time. Luther, the imaginary friend (or is he real? The book does a good job making him as real as he may seem to the boy Lorn), has a mind of his own, and as the reader will find out, in some ways Luther is in competition with Lorn's mother. Luther wants Lorn all to himself, but Lorn is trying to get the attention of his mother, who is so obsessed with her own troubles. Yet, Luther is treated as a real person, as is seen when Lorn's mother sets a place mat at every meal for Luther as well as Lorn. <br /> <br />This is southern gothic at its best, with characters that are dysfunctional and situations match the characters that live them.  The crux of the story is Lorn and his self-esteem, and the reader will watch him start off as a very insecure boy, but moving toward adolescence and growing in self-confidence by the end of the novel. What is interesting is that Luther, at least for a while, disappears.  Lorn no longer needs him, especially when he is off looking for his mother, who had gone away due to reasons Lorn is not aware of.  <br /> <br />Besides the focus on Lorn and his mother, there is the subplot of the new uncle who has brought developers to their mountain, planning on taking over the family land and turning it into moneymaking real estate. <br /> <br />BITTER MILK is a very difficult read. It's non-traditional in its structure, with no chapter breaks or quotation marks to denote conversations.  Yet, if a reader is willing to delve into the life of Lorn Garland, they will walk away that much more enriched.  John McManus shows promise as a literary talent, although this novel does not quite succeed in doing what he was trying to accomplish. However, I would definitely keep an eye on this author, because he's one that is not afraid to challenge literary standards and try something new for the sake of his art.  The youngest ever recipient of the Whiting Writer's Award, John McManus is a writer that will go far.	2005-08-21

SWEET AS SUGAR, HOT AS SPICE by Kimberly Raye <br />August 21, 2005 <br /> <br />Rating:  3.5/5 stars   <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Sweet as Sugar, Hot as Spice follows the story of the Farrel sisters, whose mother is a famous feminist with her own television show.

Now, her mother wants to be friends. Jacqueline has a significant other, Donovan Martin, the father of the three sisters, but marriage is not in the cards as far as Jacqueline is concerned. It goes against her religion. So, with two of her daughters happily wedded, Jacqueline is proud that Eve has resisted the temptation to do the same. <br /> <br />The book opens at the wedding of sister Xandra, with Eve still in shock over the entire premise. Then, she gets a brilliant idea. After she becomes reacquainted with Linc Adams, a redneck womanizer NASCAR driver, with whom she had a blind date a number of years ago, Eve decides that he may be the solution to her problems.\\" See Bookloons for complete review.	2005-08-21

It's the story of a man, Doctor David Henry, who makes a big decision on the night of the birth of his first children, twins, that alters his family's future. When he helps deliver the twins with the help of his colleague Caroline Gill, they discover that one baby is born with Down Syndrome.  His decision is to tell his wife Norah that the baby was born dead.   <br /> <br />As the years pass, this one decision marks the family forever. The ghost of the baby Phoebe is ever present, as it affects Norah's attitude on life, tears their marriage apart, and indirectly affects the remaining twin, Paul. It's a novel that spans several decades, as the family changes over time. <br /> <br />At the same time, the life of Caroline Gill and the baby Phoebe are told in parallel.  Caroline was to take Phoebe to a home for babies like her, but instead she makes a decision to take Phoebe home with her instead.  That fateful night, as she finds her car battery is dead in the parking lot with a newborn baby, she finds help from a truck driver that eventually becomes a part of their lives.  Caroline raises Phoebe as best she can, giving the girl a world of hope and optimism.  It is a wonder that David even thought that Phoebe's life would be cut short, as is true for many born with Down Syndrome.  But Phoebe proves to the world what love and perseverance can do, and that no one has a right to throw away anyone's chances at survival. <br /> <br />This was a wonderful debut novel that I am going to remember for years to come.  It was a very tense drama, a page-turner about the lives of two families that played out over several decades, starting from the early Sixties and into the present day 21st century. One will want to sympathize with Norah, the womanwho \\"loses\\" one of her twins at childbirth, and damn the man that causes her pain. David had his reasons for what he did, but I think the reader will not see that as an excuse.  While I didn't quite like the way the author wrapped up David's portion of the story, over all I am giving this book 4 stars and a recommendation for readers to pick this one up today.  Here is another author to keep an eye on.	2005-08-20

THE PERFECT PLAY by Louise Wener <br />August 20, 2005 <br /> <br />Rating:  4/5 stars   <br /> <br /> <br />Louise Wener is on my list of favorite new authors. I read GOODNIGHT STEVE MCQUEEN earlier this year and LOVED it, and now having read THE PERFECT PLAY, I'm ready for another one of her books (will there be a third?).   <br /> <br />There are two main characters. Big Louie is a transplanted American living in England and not doing much of anything. He's agoraphobic, obsessive over germs so is constantly cleaning, and is addicted to gambling.  Audrey Ungar grew up with a father who was a gambler, and she in turn seems to have caught the bug.  Her father left her mother years ago, but Audrey still wants to know why he deserted them, and through Big Louie, she finds a way that may connect her with her father again.  <br /> <br />THE PERFECT PLAY is the story of an odd friendship, of two persons who are hopelessly addicted to gambling, and one woman's need to resolve the mystery of her missing father.  Funny in parts, serious in others, and somewhat sentimental at times, THE PERFECT PLAY is a winner in my book.  This book comes recommended.	2005-08-20

ZORRO by Isabel Allende <br />August 13, 2005 <br /> <br />Rating 4/5 stars <br /> <br /> <br />Isabelle Allende's ZORRO is her version of the story that was originally introduced in 1919. Zorro's beginnings is the focus of Allende's novel, which is also going to be the basis of the third in the ZORRO trilogy of movies starring Antonio Banderas. Allende stays true to the original story, tracing Zorro's roots from his birth in Alta California (as Diego De La Vega, the son of the Alcalde of Pueblo de Los Angeles and an Indian woman) in the late 1700's. He lives his early years on the hacienda with his parents, Toypurnia (Regina) and Alejandro de la Vega, and his \\"milk brother\\" and best friend Bernardo, the bastard child of an Indian woman.  <br /> <br />The two friends will travel as teenagers across the Atlantic (by way of Panama) to reach Spain, and that is where Zorro becomes a reality. In Spain, Diego and Bernardo move into the home of family friend Tomas de Romeu, where Diego falls in love with the eldest daughter, Julianna. It's an unrequited love that Diego suffers, and earns an enemy in Rafael Moncado, who vows to win Julianna's hand and make her his wife. Julianna's younger sister Isabel also becomes an integral part of Zorro's life, as the novel will reveal. And with the girls' companion, Nuria, the \\"family\\" is complete.  <br /> <br />There is not enough room here to detail all the characters that populate ZORRO the novel, but it takes on epic proportions throughout. The adventures of Bernardo and Diego include living with the gypsies, dealing with pirates (and Jean Lafitte!) and learning the ways of the California Indians. <br /> <br />Those who love historical fiction that centers on early California history will appreciate this wonderful novel. Allende throws in humor, adventure, love and romance, and of course evil villains, as Diego becomes Zorro and learns how to protect the innocent in the name of justice.	2005-08-14

THE CONFESSIONS OF MAX TIVOLI by Andrew Sean Greer <br />August 13, 2005 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />THE CONFESSIONS OF MAX TIVOLI is the story of the unusual life of Max Tivoli, who physically ages in reverse, as he mentally grows older. Max is born \\"old\\". He's the size of a normal baby, but his outward appearance is that of an old man.  People are repulsed by him, not knowing what to make of him. Even his family takes special care to keep him away from the curious public.  As he gets \\"older\\" it is noticed that he is starting to grow younger, and his grandmother estimates that he will die at the age of 70, in the year 1941. <br /> <br />Narrated by Max, he tells his tale of how he cannot be who he truly is.  As a young boy, he has to pretend he's an elderly man, because that is what the world thinks he is.  At an early age, his mother tells him \\"Be what they think you are\\". And he does as she says, until he meets Alice, who eventually becomes the love of his life. <br /> <br />There isn't too much that one can say about this book.  It's a story about friendships, love, and wanting what one can't have.  It is also a novel about learning how to deal with handicaps, because Max is truly handicapped in every sense of the word. The world we know cannot accommodate someone like him, who does not look the way the public would expect him to. Yet, he longs to live the way everyone else does, but he knows this will never be.  The only person that truly understands him is Hughie, his best friend for life, and at the core of this story is their relationship, a friendship that lasts a lifetime. <br /> <br />I loved THE CONFESSIONS OF MAX TIVOLI, and will most likely be one of my favorite books read in 2005.  It was beautifully written, a unique look at what true friendship is all about, and how it feels to live as an outcast, as someone that is perceived as different from the mainstream. This book will truly become a modern classic.	2005-08-14

I couldn't resist, because I had loved SEASON so much.  In TWILIGHT, Lavinia Gibbs' story is told, from her early years in America until she is forced to leave the country, after embarrassing her family because of a failed engagement.   <br /> <br />It is the turn of the century and Lavinia is born into an upper class family of wealth and prominence.  Unfortunately, Lavinia tries to be as conventional as is expected of her, but she fails. When she breaks off an engagement that was difficult to attain to begin with, her parents are very upset and to save face, they send her off to Paris with a monthly severance to allow her a comfortable living. <br /> <br />She is now in her 30's and she slowly adapts to her new world in Paris. She makes friends among the English speaking set, and eventually finds a job assisting a married French man who is trying to sell off an apartment that belongs to his wife.  She finds she is attracted to Gaston, but keeps this to herself, as he is unavailable.  But eventually, she finds herself in an affair to remember, and Gaston becomes the great love of her life. <br /> <br />The attraction for me with TWILIGHT is not the actual story, but the way Mosby writes.  There are some authors that can write anything, and I will gladly read it.  TWILIGHT's story is slow to come about, and just like THE SEASON OF LILIAN DAWES, TWILIGHT's charm is the detail to the writing and to the actions and thoughts of the characters, mainly Lavinia.  Even the affair with Gaston doesn't happen until half way through the book.  <br /> <br />With that said, I didn't like TWILIGHT as much as I enjoyed the previous novel, but both were worth reading.  These two books are related, but the order in which they are read is not important. What is important is that bothbooks seem to contain women that are highly unconventional, living in the early 1900's, women that do not care what society says, and have a need to live as freely as they feel will make them happy. The ending to TWILIGHT was somewhat ambiguous, and it almost seems as if the author set that up intentionally, to lead us to yet a third book. I personally would love to read yet another book containing the characters that populate both these novels.  Mosby is a talented writer and I hope to continue to see her books published.	2005-08-14
113545:US	51214937	R4WYXYS0BL83G	0446614874	919778725	In Your Wildest Dreams (Warner Forever)	Books	3	12	15	N	N	Steamy romance in New Orleans	IN YOUR WILDEST DREAMS by Toni Blake <br />Amazon rating 3/5 <br /> <br />A woman disguises herself as a high-priced call girl to help find her missing sister in Toni Blake's latest steamy novel, IN YOUR WILDEST DREAMS. It's a sizzling hot romance that takes place in the heart of New Orleans. Jake Broussard is a local New Orleans ex-cop who is now working as a bartender at an exclusive club called the Chez Sophia. Stephanie Grant is a sexually naive woman from Chicago who thinks she can disguise herself as a call girl in order to find her missing younger sister Tina.  <br /> <br />When the two meet the sparks fly. Jake teaches Stephanie a lot of things behind closed doors, but Stephanie's main objective is to find her sister, who she thinks is now a prostitute.  Jake doesn't want a committed relationship, but unfortunately Stephanie starts to subconsciously think that he really loves her. The sex is hot, and Stephanie tries to remind herself that after they find Tina, it's \\"goodbye, Jake\\". <br /> <br />The author does a good job with the sexy love scenes, but the subplot involving the runaway Shondra felt like it did not belong.  While Jake's involvement with the young teen showed a different side of him that the reader will love, this part of the story felt a bit awkward as it seemed to abrupt the flow of the rest of the book. <br /> <br />On the other hand, Jake's past with Becky was a welcome part of the story, as it explained why he had a hard time getting seriously involved with any woman, including Stephanie. The author teases the reader, throwing out hints  who Becky was, until their history is finally explained.  <br /> <br />IN YOUR WILDEST DREAMS had plenty of sexy erotic scenes for those who love their romances hot and wild. However, for those who like their romances a little bit more tame, this may not be for you. The mystery behind the missing Tina adds a dimension to the novel that the reader will enjoy.  I personally didn't care for Stephanie, however, who was a bit too naive for me when it came to life on the streets. Conversely, I enjoyed Jake's character.  He's what romance readers are looking for when they grab their latest romance novels. I'm giving this novel 3 stars for the story line, and would have rated it higher if I had liked the main character a little bit more.	2005-08-13

At the time, Aria Jackson was 9 years old. Besides Aria, her mother and her sister Hermione were also in the car. The story is told by Aria (Ariadne), and the reader will see how the accident shapes their lives.  <br /> <br />Now an adult, Aria is involved with a man that she hopes will become her husband. She's 25 and still feels the scars of the accident. It affects her attitude and her views of the world. She feels that life never goes the way she wants, and envies everyone else around her, including her best friend Rochelle, who was adopted into a very wealthy African American family. Aria thinks her own life may be turning around for the better with her boyfriend Dwayne, until she finds that she's pregnant. <br /> <br />This book worked on various levels. It's the story of Aria and her viewpoint of the accident versus what really happened. But the book also was about the many relationships that Aria had with those around her, especially with her mother and her sister, both of whom were also in that same accident. One will sense that Aria had a lot of growing up to do, as she was constantly feeling sorry for herself, while her sister went away and made a life for herself, marrying their father's best friend. Aria lives in the bad side of town with her best friend, despite the fact that Rochelle has her family's financial support - they could have lived in a much better neighborhood. I found that Aria always found ways to put herself in situations that would make her feel sorry for herself, in some ways attracting attention from others because of the life she led. But in other ways I liked Aria. She was willing to learn and grow. She learns a valuable lesson with her relationship with Dwayne, the result of which leads the reader to the end of the story. <br /><br />I hope to read more by Tayari Jones. She has a way with words - the book was short, but yet she packed in a lot of living in these 300 or so pages. A very fast read, but definitely not a fluff read. THE UNTELLING had a lot of depth to its story telling, and I enjoyed it a lot.	2005-08-13

Saul <br />August 13, 2005 <br /> <br />Rating:    4  stars <br /> <br />Earlier this summer I read a wonderful book titled LIGHT OF DAY by Jamie M. Saul.  One of my favorite books this year so far, it is the story of a man, Jack Owens, who must come to terms with his 14-year old son's suicide. As the book begins, Jack is in his office at the college where he teaches, and is waiting to get a call from his son.  Instead, he receives word from a detective that his son has been found dead of an apparent suicide. <br /> <br />LIGHT OF DAY examines a parent's grief of the death of a child, but more than that it focuses on whether a person can be counted responsible for someone else's suicide.  As Jack looks back on their lives, starting from his courtship with Danny's mother, Anne, their marriage and breakup, and finally Jack and Danny's life together in this small college town, Jack grapples with the idea that he could have prevented Danny's death. <br /> <br />Jack, as well as the reader, will begin a journey into Danny's life, and it isn't until the very end of the book that one understands Danny's angst, and why he did what he did.  LIGHT OF DAY brings to mind some ethical and moral questions, including \\"what is the right thing\\" in terms of one's decisions in life?  Is loyalty more important than morality? Is it more important to stay true to oneself? These are the questions that Jack ponders every day, (as does Danny) as he tries to put together the puzzle to Danny's suicide. <br /> <br />I really loved LIGHT OF DAY, for its focus on character and heavy moral and ethical questions that will have one question the same issues.  I still do not know whether Jack did the \\"right thing\\" at the end of the book. It's a book that had me thinking for days after I read that last page.	2005-08-13

Sophie Temple has nowhere to live after the death of her aunts, and decides to replace Sophie Kent who is a missing heiress, an illegitimate child of Aunt Millicent. After she presents herself to her new family, Sophie is invited into the home of Lady May, while Sophie lives with the guilt of having deceived this very hospitable woman and her family. <br /> <br />In the mean time, Lady May's handsome brother-in-law, Gideon, is recovering from a shooting accident which occurred during a duel. He is laid up at Lady May's home and Sophie decides she wants to get to know him, a man with a reputation of being a rogue. Secretly, the two forge a friendship, and unfortunately fall in love, realizing that this can never result in anything more than a flirtation. Sophie is to be presented to the ton and Gideon is deemed not suitable for marriage to someone like her, a woman of wealth and honor. Little does Gideon and Lady May know, that Sophie is not who she appears to be. <br /> <br />A subplot has Lady May dealing with her own romantic troubles.  She loves Lord Marcus Roberts, but she is not quite ready to marry again, although her husband has been dead for many years. Lady May has a secret that she is afraid to reveal, for it will affect the family as well as herself.  <br /> <br />THE BEAUTY OF BOND STREET kept this reader interested, especially because of the amusing characters that filled this book. But Sophie stood out as a character that the reader will empathize with, and will wish that she does find the peace of mind and the respectability that she craves.  She was a woman that was born on the wrong side of the tracks, a daughter of an actress.  She wanted respectability as well as comfort, and knew that her only way out was to marry a  man that could bring her all this. Gideon was a man that enjoyed living the life of the rogue, a man that in the past had no qualms with having affairs with other men's wives.

The reader will want to root for her. I am giving this book 4/5 stars.	2005-08-08

My rating for this book is 5 out of 5 stars, despite the fact that the ending was a shocker (did not see it coming, and I know some readers felt cheated after reading that last page), I believe that the story and the ending justify themselves. <br /> <br />THE LAST TIME THEY MET is not really a true sequel, but it's a stand-alone book featuring some characters that are focused on in THE WEIGHT OF WATER. WEIGHT OF WATER was about Jean, a photographer, on assignment to research a murder that happened on an island off of Maine years ago. Her husband was Thomas, who in this \\"sequel\\", becomes the main character of events that happened before and after the time frame of THE WEIGHT OF WATER. In this second novel, the story opens with Linda, a 52-year old poet who is attending a convention in Toronto. She does not realize Thomas would also be attending the convention, and when they do meet, it is to bring back memories of a life they had shared together in the past. <br /> <br />The novel is written in a very obscure way, in that the dialog is not in quotes but italics, giving the feel of being distant and removed from the immediate happenings of what was going on in the novel. It felt as if the view points, that of Linda in most cases, but alternating with Thomas, was that of looking at the action through a foggy window... <br /> <br />The novel is separated into three parts - the present events occurring at the conference where Thomas and Linda meet after many years of separation. The next section is their life in Kenya while they are in their 20's, which for me felt MORE real and more immediate for some reason.  <br />Then the third section told their lives as children and young adults, when Thomas and Linda first meet. This last section is told in disjointed paragraphs, with hints of things that happened. Things are finally resolved at the end of the book, but in particular, something is revealed on that last page that is so poignant, that it changes the entire meaning of the book. For those who \\"buy it\\", it'll be a box full of Kleenex. It's a tragic story of two people who loved each other and were meant to be with each other forever, but because of certain events, their chance was lost forever. <br /> <br />For those who have not read this book yet, read WEIGHT OF WATER first. I found THE LAST TIME THEY MET so interesting BECAUSE of that first book. A very interesting method, taking a different view point in the second novel. I sympathized with Jean in the first book, but hated her in this second one. It all is about viewpoint. <br /> <br />THE LAST TIME THEY MET, taken alone, will read differently, but the outcome is the same. That last page is what makes this novel what it is, so those who are reading this and are having a hard time getting into it should be patient, and read through to that last page. I was rewarded and I am going to count this as part of my top 30 books read in 2005.	2005-08-07
129148:US	51214937	R24V6QTUVH00MO	0312424094	315724223	Housekeeping: A Novel	Books	4	35	38	N	N	A classic	HOUSEKEEPING by Marilynne Robinson <br />Amazon rating 4/5 <br /> <br /> <br />HOUSEKEEPING by Marilynne Robinson is what I'd call a modern classic. Beautifully written, it's the story of two sisters who are raised in a non-conventional family in Fingerbone Lake, Idaho. Ruth is the narrator of this depressing morose novel, the older sister who often seemed to take on the role of the younger sibling.  The girls do not know who their father is. Their mother is in their lives for a very short time, a free-spirited woman who suffers from bouts of depression. They are successively raised by their maternal grandmother, Sylvia Foster, Sylvia's two elderly sisters-in-law, and finally their Aunt Sylvie, their mother's sister. <br /> <br />The novel opens with a brief history of their family, telling the tale of their grandfather who died tragically in a train crash at Fingerbone Lake.  This lake becomes a character unto itself, helping to set the tone of the book.  It seems to be the center of their world, having taken their grandfather, and later, their mother.  One of the main themes of this novel is death and impermanence, the two girls never really having true stability in their lives.  They do see some stability with their grandmother Sylvia, but this is undone when Sylvie takes over, a woman who seems to want to live the life of a transient. <br /> <br />HOUSEKEEPING is a very difficult book to read, but at the same time, I was drawn to it for the beautiful writing and the complexity of the characters.  Ruth, the narrator, seems to become more and more like Sylvie, her Aunt, while her sister struggles to find some normalcy in their lives. The underlying question could be \\"what is considered normal\\", and who is to judge one family to the next? I personally had a hard time with the character of Sylvie, who was obviously mentally not all there, yet was put in charge of these two adolescents who obviously needed a more structured type of lifestyle.  <br /> <br />HOUSEKEPEEING was Marilynne Robinson's debut novel, written 20 years ago.  Most may find this novel a laborious read, but I believe if one can be open-minded enough, the reader will truly see the beauty of this book.	2005-08-05

Lord Hector Reganoch, Lord of Lochbuie, finds himself out in a thunderstorm and goes to the home of Lord Macleod and his many daughters, seeking shelter.  He meets the lovely Mariota, the second oldest daughter, and he falls in love with her.  Unfortunately, when he asks to take her as his wife, Macleod tells Reganoch that he cannot allow this.  Because of superstition, his oldest daughter must marry first.   <br /> <br />Christina is not as fair as the lovely Mariota, and has not had many men attracted to her as Mariota has, but she would make a good wife. She is eighteen years old and is ready to start a family of her own. She already takes care of her father and her sisters, with the help of Lady Euphemia, her father's sister.  But all this does nothing to impress Hector. He insists on marrying Mariota. <br /> <br />So, Macleod and the rest of the family (excluding Mariota, who has shown no interest in the man) help create a deception, and Hector ends up marrying Christina, while drunk. The two share the wedding bed that night, and by morning, Hector knows he cannot annul this marriage that he was tricked into.  He still yearns for the beautiful Mariota, but does not know what to do now that he's legally married to the older sister. <br /> <br />Christina had fallen in love with Hector on first sight, but she feels that he will never love her, since he loves Mariota. But what Christina does not know is that Hector is slowly getting to know Christina and Mariota, and is realizing that there is a lot more to a marriage than staring at a very beautiful face.  And while Christina is not as beautiful as her sister, he sees qualities in her that are deeper than mere beauty, and finds that he is falling in love with his wife. <br /> <br />Mariota in the meantime is now seton annulling her sister's marriage so she can marry Hector, a man she had no interest in until he married Christina. Obviously, she wants what she can't have.  This is one crazy woman, as the reader will find out. <br /> <br />While it took me a while to get into the story, once the story was set up the novel started to pick up.  The book was a lot of fun, and the author did a good job creating such diverse characters such as the various Macleod sisters.  One thing I enjoy about historical romances is the backdrop, and the beauty of Scotland stands out.  I would definitely read more of this series (I think this is a series).  THE LORD OF THE ISLES is recommended to fans of historical romances with a bit of humor in them.	2005-07-31

MUST LOVE DOGS by Claire Cook <br />July 29, 2005 <br /> <br />Amazon rating 4/5 stars <br /> <br /> <br />MUST LOVE DOGS by Claire Cook was a book I had hesitated reading for a few years because I hated the title. But after reading her most current novel, MULTIPLE CHOICE, and enjoying it, I decided to take a chance.  <br /> <br />I really enjoyed MUST LOVE DOGS, a story about a 40 year old woman, who was divorced and with the help of her sister Carol, goes in search of a man that may be a potential date, let alone a relationship. Besides her dating life, the reader will be introduced to Sarah Hurlihy's huge family. She is one of six siblings and the entire family is very Irish American. Their mother is deceased, and their father is busy making his mark in the dating world.  <br /> <br />Carol helps Sarah put an ad in the paper, and some of the results are hilarious. Sarah's first blind date will have the reader laughing, as it is too funny even to contemplate. Sarah is now getting calls and offers from various eligible men and the book details her adventures with the dating scene, the ups and the downs.  <br /> <br />Besides her adventures in dating, she's also having a lot of fun teaching pre-school children, and one of her potential dates comes from the pool of parents that send their children to her school. Who does she end up after it's all said and done? I guessed whom she would end up with and I'm glad she did. I think the conclusion to MUST LOVE DOGS will satisfy most readers, but at the same time it was fun to watch her go through the various ads and wondering which one would even come close to being Mr. Right.  <br /> <br />Her crazy family will also help keep the reader interested through that last page. This book is simply not just about Sarah's dating life. This book is one notch above the average chick lit novel, with Sarah being a character who is real, a person that the reader will care about.  I'm hoping the movie version of this book does not veertoo far from the original story.  The book works the way it was written.	2005-07-30

The novel opens with a prologue introducing two brothers, Harrison Standish, a sixteen-year old with a crush on a girl named Jessica, and Adam, his half-brother that always gets the girl. Harrison, Adam, and their mother are deeply involved in Egyptian archeology, and are in Egypt excavating artifacts related to Ramses IV and a pair of lovers.  Harrison witnesses Adam kissing Jessica, and thinks, \\"Love was for suckers\\". Flash forward sixteen years. <br /> <br />The setting is now at a museum in Ft Worth, Texas. Cassie Cooper works in PR for the Kimbell, and is helping to host a major event that involves two parts of an ancient amulet and their corresponding mummies. It is all a part of the legendary ancient curse of Kiya and Solen, the research that Harrison and his family were doing back in Egypt sixteen years ago. Adam and Harrison are both involved in this event, since they were responsible for finding the amulets and bringing them to the museum. Unfortunately, Harrison cannot find Adam. <br /> <br />When one of the amulets is stolen, Cassie is blamed. But she's witnessed a stabbing of a man masquerading as a mummy and she think it's Adam, but she has no proof. The mummy and all evidence have disappeared. Now, her chances at a job at the Smithsonian are ruined, unless she can find the missing amulet and clear her name. <br /> <br />With the help of Harrison, whom she thinks is a nerd, Cassie and Harrison try to figure out the mystery of the missing amulet and the missing brother. Opposites attract, as they always say, and it is true for Cassie and Harrison. Cassie had initially hoped to meet Adam, who had been flirting with her over the telephone, but it looks like Harrison may finally get the girl. <br /> <br />While the story in itself was fun,  I had a hard time buying into the Egyptian myths and the magical amulets.  I also found this novel very \\"Hollywood-ish\\", almost akin to one of THE MUMMY movies with Brendan Frasier.  If this is the type of romance one enjoys, then this book is it.  It's a beach read, with a Hollywood-style plot. Readers may enjoy Cassie, who seems to be missing a few marbles, but she may be the reason why I enjoyed the book.	2005-07-24

THE INTERRUPTION OF EVERYTHING by Terry McMillan <br />July 24, 2005 <br /> <br />Amazon Rating: 4/5 stars  <br /> <br />THE INTERRUPTION OF EVERYTHING by Terry McMillan is about a middle-aged African American woman who is ready to find a niche of her own, tired of being the one that has to take care of everyone else.  Marilyn Grimes is that middle-aged woman, working part time at a craft store and enjoying it.  She's been told she's good at making things with her hands, and she's thinking of doing something more serious with it (she's already sold a few things in the shop that is owned by a friend of hers).  But life is busy for Marilyn. Instead of pursuing a career, she spent most of her adult life taking care of her husband, her children, and now she's taking care of her mother and mother-in-law, as well as worrying about a sister who has been in and out of trouble.  Marilyn loves them all, but she is getting fed up that it's never about her, and always about them. <br /> <br />Lots of great characters in this book, including her mother-in-law Arthurine who I thought was a hoot, and her new boyfriend Prezzle.  Arthurine's little dog Snuffy who is on his last legs is also a character unto himself, and the both of them drive Marilyn up the wall.  And now Marilyn's husband Leon seems to be going through some mid-life crisis, something she does not need right now.  He's dressing up in funky outfits and talking about making a career change. I also felt for Marilyn when she had to deal with her mother, Lovey, who seemed to be having major memory problems.  Lovey lived with Joy, the adopted sister who had been off and on drugs for years, and that was another worry that Marilyn didn't need to deal with. <br /> <br />Fans who have loved Terry McMillan's books will love this one.  Although there is a lot of humor as in all of her books, there are also some heavy themes running through, including taking care of older parents and a marriage that may be on the brink of divorce. Although I didn't think it was one of her better novels (I still love HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK the best), it is still a winning novel from this very popular author, and I know fans have been waiting for a new one from her for years. THE INTERRUPTION OF EVERYTHING has a lot of strong women characters, as most of McMillan's books do, and this book is no exception.  Marilyn is a woman that is ready to take on life and live the life she's waited for. Readers will root for her and hope she gets her wish.	2005-07-24

THE LADY LIES by Samantha Saxon <br />July 16, 2005 <br /> <br /> <br />THE LADY LIES by Samantha Saxon is a very enjoyable historical romance that takes place during the Napoleonic Wars. Lady Celeste Rivenhall is a double agent, working for England but posing as a loyal subject of Napoleon.  She was born to a French mother and an English father, making one think that she would be torn as to which country she would pledge her allegiance to. As the book opens, the reader will be introduced to a woman who is cruel and sadistic, and does what she has to do to punish every English soldier that falls into her hands.  She is Napoleon's lover and is very powerful. But there is another side of Celeste that will be revealed as well. <br /> <br />Lord Aidan is captured during a battle against the French, is taken alive and becomes one of her prisoners. He knows his fate is in her hands, but what he doesn't expect to happen happens: someone helps him to escape. What Aidan does not know is that it is Celeste that makes his escape possible, for she has always admired him from afar and wants him to return to England.  <br /> <br />Back in England, Aidan discovers that Celeste is also there, and believes she is spying for Napoleon.  He is incensed and now he believes she's a traitor, and tries his best to catch her in order to turn her in. THE LADY LIES is one misunderstanding after another, as the two find their lives are entangled as Celeste does her best to secretly help the English cause, and Aidan tries his best to catch her in the act of espionage. While there is a lot of chemistry between the two, they agree that there is no future for them. <br /> <br />I enjoyed THE LADY LIES, but I did find Aidan somewhat irritating at times.  I couldn't understand how Celeste could easily mislead someone of his rank.  It is his job to flush out supposed spies, yet he constantly finds himself barking up the wrong tree. Other than that, I recommend THE LADY LIES as an intriguing historical romance, well written with a strong female lead.	2005-07-17

GROWN FOLKS BUSINESS by Victoria Christopher Murray <br />July 16, 2005 <br /> <br />When I picked out GROWN FOLKS BUSINESS by Victoria Christopher Murray to read for review, I chose it because I enjoy African American Lit.  What I didn't realize was that this was African American Christian Lit, but what really surprised me was how much I enjoyed it. Most people who know me know I am anything but a Christian, let alone a person affiliated with a religion. But, what Murray seems to do well is tell a good story, regardless of who her target audience is. The other big shocker of this story was not that the main character, Sheridan, finds out her husband of seventeen years is in love with someone else, but that he's in love with another man. Murray handled this hot topic in a Christian setting very well, and pretty much had characters that were on both sides of the gay issue, whether it was morally wrong or whether a person was born that way.  <br /> <br />Sheridan, the main character, is almost 40, married with two children, and her husband is Quentin, who is in love with his friend Jett. GROWN FOLKS BUSINESS starts with the bombshell of Quentin being gay, and takes the family through all its stages (anger, denial, etc).  Sheridan even goes to her minister to get advice on how to deal with a gay husband.  <br /> <br />In the meantime, Quentin moves out with Jett, and Sheridan now has to pick up the pieces, helping her children deal with a parent that has left.  They are not told that their father is gay, but their son accidentally finds out, and he does not take it very well. As a teenage boy of 16, he is already going through a lot of changes in this stage of growing up, and having to handle the knowledge of a gay father causes Chris to go through a lot of acting out. His sister Tori, who is only 9, takes the news much better, and accepts her father for who he is, unconditionally. <br /> <br />I almost want to compare Murray's writing to Eric Jerome Dickey.  She creates the same sharp-witted characters, with story lines that are so enjoyable and real.  While this book is definitely directed to the Christian audience, however, anyone who enjoys African American Lit will enjoy GROWN FOLKS BUSINESS. I'm proof.	2005-07-17

It is the story of a family that is anything but traditional. Melvina Brown is the main character, a twin to her sister Brenda.  They aren't identical twins at all, and are different in more ways than one.  <br /> <br />Belinda grew up with the looks, and for that reason Mel always felt second best. Their personalities were also opposite, but yet they were as close as two sisters can be.  GOOD NIGHT, HENRY, in part, is the story of their relationship, but it's really the story of Melvina and her relationships with the people in her life including her sons, her current lover Walt, her sister Belinda, and their brother Henry, who had disappeared years ago.  Most people believe Henry to be dead, but Melvina continues to talk to him, feeling his spirit within her.  They were the siblings that most people said could have been twins. His story is also told in flashbacks, and slowly the reader will get the picture of what happened to Henry and why he was no longer a part of their lives. <br /> <br />Life for Mel becomes a bit more difficult when her husband Tucker shows up after having left them soon after the birth of her second son.  Tucker seems to think he's back for good, and does his best to bond with his two boys, one of whom resents him for leaving all those years ago. Tucker tries to show Mel he's changed, but she's moved on. But he is her children's father, and for their sake she tries to be as civil to Tucker as she can. <br /> <br />There's a lot of family dynamics and relationship issues going on in GOOD NIGHT, HENRY.  I loved the way Jennifer Olds writes, and I loved her characters.  They are all flawed, as real people will be.  I also think she did a great job with creating a boy with a handicap. To me it was realistic, especially his relationships with his brother and school friends and family members. And Theo was definitely a character I enjoyed getting to know, a purely good soul who was dealt a bad hand at birth. While Theo may not be the main character, his existence creates friction between his older brother Archie and their father Tucker, for reasons, which become clear in the novel. <br /> <br />I highly recommend GOOD NIGHT, HENRY.  Her writing in this book was beautiful,  containing some of her own poetry, which is what she is known for. One of my favorite new authors, I hope to see Jennifer Olds writing more novels like this.	2005-07-16

Ok, this is a book that I am highly recommending to those who love chick lit with a lot more going for it.  I think even those who aren't regular readers of this genre are going to love it. SHE'S GOT ISSUES by Stephanie Lessing is the story of Chloe Rose, a very naive young woman who doesn't seem to have a clue at what is really going on around her.  The book is narrated by her, and this is where it gets funny - this girl is not normal... her thoughts are sometimes so \\"out there\\" that I could not help but laugh out loud.  Her obsessions with shoes goes beyond an obsession - she actually used to play with her shoes as any girl would have played with dolls, but Chloe still plays with them.  Her shoes, that is. A classic scene has Chloe locked up in a shoe closet at work, and talking.  Of course someone has to walk by and rescue her (\\"Stan\\", her knight in shining armor). It's scenes like these that had me hooked. <br /> <br />Chloe recently is hired at ISSUES magazine, and she is now the assistant to the assistant, whatever that is. Her relationship with her new boss Ruth is something else.  Chloe is doing her best to be a star employee, but she doesn't realize that Ruth is jealous of her ideas and is trying to keep Chloe in the dark by having her do mundane jobs as copying endless files, taking days and weeks to finish.  Ruth also steals Chloe's ideas, and tries to convince upper management that these were Ruth's ideas, not Chloe's. Chloe hasn't a clue what is going on, and constantly backs up her boss, saying what a great person Ruth is to her. <br /> <br />What makes the book succeed is NOT simply that Chloe is somewhat weird and \\"different\\", but it's how people react to her behavior. I found myself doing \\"double takes\\" while first reading this novel, because I did not anticipate reading a book narrated by a woman that was not all there.  She's not stupid, however.  It's just that her perceptions on life and the world are not ordinary. There had been a few times when she would spout off the most intelligent of things.  At other times you will wonder whether she has a brain. But with her weird photographic memory (she is able to recite paragraphs from her sister's boyfriend's economics book he's just published) and her odd behavior and thoughts, Chloe Rose is one character that you will not forget.  If you want a lot of laughs, I highly recommend SHE'S GOT ISSUES. I am definitely looking forward to the sequel.	2005-07-11

A great beach read	MINE ARE SPECTACULAR by Janice Kaplan and Lyn Schnurnberger <br />July 9, 2005 <br /> <br /> <br />This was such a fun book to read!  A great summer beach read, MINE ARE SPECTACULAR is written by the pair that penned THE BOTOX DIARIES, Janice Kaplan and Lynn Schnurnberger. Seinfeld fans will recognize the title (Think \\"Teri Hatcher\\" as the girlfriend with the big you-know-whats who says, \\"By the way, they're mine. And they're spectacular!\\") <br /> <br />There are three main characters, three women who are good friends, all in their 40's. Sara is a divorced mother of one who is about to get married again. Kate is a very famous dermatologist whose clients are often celebrities, and Berni is an ex-Hollywood agent who has traded in her career for motherhood - to twins. They live in the upscale suburb known as Hadley Farms in New York.  <br /> <br />The book is filled with one funny scene after another, with a number of colorful characters that help make this novel a fun read.  A hunk of a soap-opera star, a fianc AND an ex-husband are the main men in Sara's life.  She also has a very difficult future stepdaughter to deal with plus the fianc's ex-wife.  Talk about having your hands full! She also has a son who is now getting to know his father, missing after all these years in Patagonia. <br /> <br />Berni the ex-agent has to deal with her ex-rival Olivia.  It's a rivalry that I found to be very funny. Some people can really be competitive. Olivia, plus her pregnancy, brings a lot of laughs to the story. <br /> <br />Kate is having an affair with a married man who also happens to be very wealthy.  He seems too good to be true, at least in the beginning.  Things get heated a few times when Kate actually \\"meets\\" Owen's wife.  <br /> <br />Overall, I really enjoyed MINE ARE SPECTACULAR and I highly recommend it to women who love reading light-hearted books about slightly flawed women who are trying to find that \\"something\\" in their lives.  These three women were a hoot, and they do prove that life DOES get better after 40.	2005-07-09

HIT REPLY by Rocki St Claire is not that book.  It was the type of book where I didn't care much about the characters, with way too many characters to begin with to focus on. There are two leading women in the story. The first one (and the one I consider the main character) is Amber Fleece, a 20-something woman who is in love with an old flame, a songwriter.  Unfortunately, he lives miles away and is involved with another woman, who he lives with. So, Amber and Gray Instant Message and write emails to each other, sending sexy emails back and forth to one another.  <br /> <br />Amber used to work for Stephanie Hilliard, who is now an at-home mom married to a high power executive of a hotel chain, an executive who is on his way to becoming the CEO. Stephanie finds her life lacking, does not feel any love coming from her husband, and finds herself attracted to a married man who is a high-powered management person that works at the same company that Amber works for, and THEY email and do instant messaging.  She feels she's being unfaithful, but is not sure where to draw the line. She has NOT seen him in years but still remembers the near-close encounter they had years ago.  Apparently, he hasn't forgotten either. <br /> <br />There is a third woman in this story, Julie, who is the assistant to Amber. I really felt that Julie's story was almost not necessary in the scheme of things, and did not fit in at all.  Why was her story even being told? It did read like her story was added to make this a BOOK, as opposed to a short story. Julie is a divorced mother in love with a baseball player who she had a fling with years ago. She's in her 40's now and would love to see him again but is not sure how she will look to him, 20 years later. <br /> <br />The entire book is in email/instant messaging form. Although I loved this format with Meg Cabot's THE BOY NEXT DOOR, HIT REPLY just did not work for me. It WAS a fast read, and I thank God for that, otherwise I would have given it a lower rating. It's a definite beach read, and even for chick lit, some may find it lacking. I was rather shocked to see the \\"high\\" ratings this book got here on Amazon.  HIT REPLY was an \\"ok\\" book, but I'm not really recommending it as there are plenty of better \\"chick lit\\" books out there that are funnier and have characters that I care about.	2005-06-26

In this debut novel by Britta Coleman, Mark Reynolds is the young minister who feels he's fallen into sin after he has premarital sex with his girlfriend and she finds that she's pregnant. He does the right thing by marrying her, but he's asked to leave his current congregation and is transferred to a small town located in the Texas Panhandle.  <br /> <br />Their lives take a turn for the worst, with Amanda falling into depression when she miscarries.  The bulk of the story is about the loneliness that Amanda feels, with no support from her husband, while Mark carries on as if nothing has happened, trying to present to this congregation the appearance that all is right with their world.  <br /> <br />I loved this book a lot.  The beauty of the book is in Britta Coleman's writing, using a lyrical prose as she describes the sparsely populated town that Mark and Amanda move to, a far cry from the city of Houston. The tone of the story is not preachy at all, which could have been so, with the plot that comprised the bulk of the novel.  It's a story of atonement and doing what is right, and learning that there are choices to be made, and not just one path to take.  Highly recommended, Britta Coleman is an author to watch.	2005-06-26

BELLY by Lisa Selin Davis <br />June 25, 2005 <br /> <br />Amazon rating 5/5 <br /> <br />BELLY by Lisa Selin Davis is the story of a modern \\"Archie Bunker\\", a mordantly funny story of a father in search of his old life, refusing to let go what no longer exists. BELLY is also a very impressive debut effort, wonderfully crafted and filled with such dark humor that I laughed halfway through the book.   <br /> <br />Belly refuses to let go of the past, always moping about the daughter that died too young, while his remaining daughters continue to disappoint him.  He has just gotten out of prison for his illegal gambling operation, and while there are no signs of it, he thinks his \\"friends\\" are just around the corner, ready to welcome him back with open arms.  <br /> <br />His post-prison world is filled with things he cannot accept or comprehend.  No longer are the republicans in office, but now the democrats are in power.  His days of bragging about his friends in high places are no longer, and now he drinks alone.  His bar is now a bistro, to his dismay, and his lesbian daughter now has a \\"friend\\" that is living in his house. <br /> <br />The epitome of dysfunctional families, the O'Leary's are a modern day Archie Bunker family, who has seen better days.  Those who enjoy reading dark humor will find themselves chuckling over the bigotry that just seeps out of Belly, although in his heart, he is the one doing the right thing, and he tries desperately to bring back the family that he had always thought would be there for him. <br /> <br />I'm highly recommending BELLY for the way Lisa Selin Davis painted this truly sad piece of a human being that makes up the person that is Belly O'Leary.  A man that is living in the past, one will feel pity for him, and at times will shake their heads, but there may be hope for him. A well-done character portrait of a person who cannot see anything past himself, BELLY is the type of book that will remain in the reader's memory for a long time. Highly recommended.	2005-06-25

I had read MISTRAL'S DAUGHTER back in the 80's, and just loved it! It was one of my favorite novels from that time period. Unfortunately, DAZZLE read like the author was churning it out just to satisfy the publisher.<br /><br />The novel is about Jazz Kilkullen, whose father owns a huge cattle ranch in South Orange County. The book's current time frame is 1990, but the story goes back to the past to tell the story of her parents and how they met. After her mother, who was a very famous foreign-born actress, died tragically, all that Jazz had left was her father, and her two older half sisters who hated her. Their mother had poisoned their minds to expect that Jazz was only the daughter of the woman who took their mother's place in their father's life, and that they were the true heirs of his estate when he dies.<br /><br />Jazz grows up to be a very famous and successful photographer to the stars, and her story is told in flashbacks. She started her career as a child who loved to take photos, and found she had a knack for it. When she falls in love with Gabe, a photographer who wanted to travel the world to far and distant lands, she follows him. She is barely an adult at this point in her life. She finds herself in the middle of wars, riots, anything that is dangerous. The two eventually settle down in France, become engaged and plan their wedding, but he leaves her at the altar. Jazz immediately moves back to the States and her father's ranch, hoping to forget her first love.<br /><br />DAZZLE goes back and forth in time, but also switches from one character's story to another, a very common story telling device in this genre of books (think JACKIE COLLINS, whose books are shorter but are much more smuttier).  Jazz's two older sisters also take center stage at various points, each with their own problems and eccentricities. And their father also takes center stage, as he finds that he has to ward off investors who want to take his land and divide it up.  He could be a millionaire if he sold the land, but he refuses to destroy the legacy of his family, and the history of California.<br /><br />The problem I had with DAZZLE was the characters. None of them felt \\"real\\". When Jazz falls in love with Gabe, for example, it didn't feel real. Where was the chemistry? It made no sense to me what led them to fall in love. Nothing fell into place.  It was as if Krantz was writing a novel without any feeling for the characters true selves. When Jazz falls in love with her distant cousin Casey, that didn't make any sense to me either. It was as if the author turned on a switch, and the next sentence had them in love. There was something missing in these characters, or possibly in the writing itself. I love these epic novels, but this one didn't quite do it for me.<br /><br />I don't want to say that I hated the book. I did enjoy the story, mainly because I grew up in Los Angeles and lived in Orange County for quite a while. I recognized a lot of the places that Jazz would frequent, and it brought back memories for me. I also found the story fascinating.  Novels like this that take history and create fiction stories out of them are fun for me, but unfortunately, a good story doesn't work if the characters aren't thought out a bit better. I also think that if Dazzle had been edited a little bit more tightly, it might have worked. I'm giving DAZZLE three stars.entricities.

198819:US	51214937	R3CHMPR6QF8CNM	0525948767	104909824	Cover the Butter	Books	4	12	14	N	N	Impressive Debut	COVER THE BUTTER by Carrie Kabak <br />June 19, 2005 <br /> <br /> <br />COVER THE BUTTER by Carrie Kabak is the story of a woman who struggles to be who she wants to be, but finds herself always following someone else's dictates, be it her mother or her husband.  The story begins in the present, 1995, with Kate walking into her home and finding it a disaster. Apparently, her teenage son decided to throw a party while she and her husband Rodney were out of town, and now Kate is ready to have a fit.  It's not just her son that is upsetting her.  As she goes to bed, feigning illness, she sinks into a dream world, and her past comes back to her, and it's not a good dream. <br /> <br />The book now takes us to 1965. Kate is fourteen years old and is arguing with her mother.  This scene sets the tone for the rest of the novel, which is in a way a coming-of-age book, and as with all stories with this theme, Kate is trying to find out who she really is.  She battles her mother (her father is usually silent), and finds love and affection from her grandparents in Wales. And in-between she sneaks out on dates (her mother would kill her if she knew), rebels as many teens will do, and tries to be a normal teenage girl growing up in Great Britain in the 1960's and `70's.  <br /> <br />While the reader will find themselves chuckling at times, at others they will feel Kate's anguish as she tries so hard to please her mother, and at the same time feels a rage against her parents for not being able to understand her.  In the end, Kate always seems to find a way to please her mother, despite what it does to compromise her own values and feelings. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed COVER THE BUTTER by Carrie Kabak.  An impressive debut, the author holds promise as a wonderful storyteller, creating characters that will make readers smile or bring tears to their eyes.  Kabak did a great job with tying in the past with the present, and allowing Kate to find her way to true happiness, althoughit's a long, long journey. I recommend this book to lovers of women's fiction, but I also think those who are not regular readers of this genre will definitely enjoy the book.	2005-06-19
199840:US	51214937	RHOEDML3WNVWS	0451201345	75400210	Liar's Game	Books	4	6	7	N	Y	Another good novel by Eric Jerome Dickey	LIARS GAME by Eric Jerome Dickey <br />June 18, 2005 <br /> <br />Rating 4/5 stars <br /> <br />This is the story of Dana and Vincent, two people who meet and fall in love, but because of lies that both make at some point in their relationship, things go wrong later on. Vince lies when Dana asks him whether he's been married or has kids. And Dana omits her past history as well, not telling Vince why she moved to Los Angeles in the first place. <br /> <br />The novel goes back and forth in time, changing voices in each chapter, either telling the story from Dana's point of view or Vince's. This is a regular method that Dickey uses in his novels, and I like the way this helps the reader see all points of views in regards to the very same events. It all comes together at the end. <br /> <br />Besides the \\"simple\\" love story between the two, there are also the stories that go with them: Vince's friend Womack, whom he has known all of his life and Womack's relationship with his woman Rosa Lee. There is Malaika, Vince's ex-wife, who was supposed to be living overseas, but Vince does not know that she and her new husband are now living in San Bernardino with the child Vince is not allowed to see. And there is Claudio, Dana's ex boyfriend, who is still so hung up on Dana that he hunts her down until he finds her. He represents a bad part of Dana's past that she wants to forget. Coming to Los Angeles, she re-created herself and purposely omitted to tell Vince about this part of her life, because she wanted to forget it all. However, lies of omission are still lies, and their relationship hits rocky ground when they both find out about each other's true past lives. <br /> <br />As usual, this novel by Eric Jerome Dickey is a fast read, and the various characters that he creates are enough to satisfy me. I sometimes see his books as African American soap operas, but of course they are so much better than your average soap opera on TV. I can't count how many of his book I've read so far, but I'm always ready to read his next book.	2005-06-18

Rating 4/5 stars <br /> <br /> <br />SEE JANE DATE by Melissa Senate was pretty funny and very fast moving. Jane Gregg works in publishing for POSH PUBLISHING. She is frustrated - she has worked her butt off but has yet to get a promotion. She is aspiring to become an Assistant Editor, especially now since she has taken over her boss's projects. Her boss, Gwen, is off work on maternity leave, and has given Jane the project of all projects: she is to oversee the book by semi-famous actress Natasha Nuteley, whom Jane refers to as \\"Gnatasha\\" instead (the G is silent). Jane and Natasha went to school together, and while Natasha was the most popular girl in school, Jane hated her with a passion. Now, Natasha has come back to ruin Jane's life, but if Jane can get this book edited and published, it may mean a promotion and the recognition she deserves.  <br /> <br />In the mean time, Jane has been invited to her cousin Dana's wedding. (Jane does not care for Dana either). Dana's claim to fame is that Natasha once babysat her, and so it is quite a coup that Jane is working on Natasha's book, a tell-all almost-porno memoir of an affair she had with a very famous actor, and so Natasha is invited to the wedding. Jane does not want to have to attend the wedding without a boyfriend and so she gets her friends to help her get set up on a number of blind dates, hoping that one of these men will become that date to the wedding. This in itself was pretty funny and would have been enough to keep this book going. <br /> <br />I found SEE JANE DATE a little bit heavier (in spots) than the average chick lit. There were some moments where it was very serious in tone, especially when it came to Jane remembering her deceased parents, and some of the bonding scenes she had with Natasha. For this type of book, however, this was a good read, had a good plot, and I hope to read more by Melissa Senate.  Very funny and recommended for those who love chick lit.	2005-06-18
205863:US	51214937	R2GRWQDLTRTYV9	0061095052	946823620	A Woman's Place	Books	4	25	26	N	N	One of my favorite Delinsky novels	A WOMAN'S PLACE by Barbara Delinsky <br />June 12, 2005 <br /> <br />Rating 4/5 stars <br /> <br /> <br />A WOMAN'S PLACE by Barbara Delinsky is the story about a woman who finds herself kicked out of her house and not allowed to see her own children, due to the lies of her jerk of a husband. The narrator is Claire Raphael, and she's a successful business owner who earns about five times more than her husband does. It never bothered her that she made more money than her husband did. She loved him unconditionally.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, because she was so absorbed in her job and her children, she failed to see that Dennis was starting to resent her success. After she returns from a trip to visit her ailing mother, she finds that he has filed for divorce and has taken custody of the kids and kicked her out of the house.  She has no where to go, except to her best friend and business partner, Brody. Unfortunately, one of the things Dennis has accused her of is infidelity and he claims she has been sleeping with Brody, which is not true at all. Claire has no idea how to fight back, since Dennis is telling all sorts of lies about her and the judge has taken his side. <br /> <br />I have to say this is one of my favorite books by Delinsky so far. The plot was well-developed, making it a fast read with so much going on - Claire's issue with her own family (sibling rivalry and a mother that has only seen Claire as the good daughter), Claire's need to be with her children, and finally the demise of her marriage. The reader will watch as Claire goes through the legal motions to get her life back, and with the help of a lawyer who actually cares (as opposed to the judge who seems to think all women belong barefoot and pregnant), Claire fights for what belongs to her. Some may see this as a somewhat soap-opera-ish type of novel, but I found myself wanting to read this in one sitting and wishing Claire could find a way to fight back against her husband.	2005-06-13

This time around, she has written a stand -alone novel, with Vicki Allegretti as a junior Assistant US Attorney who is still learning the ropes. She's got a huge crush on another attorney in her group, Dan, but unfortunately he's married to a woman she cannot stand.  Vicki's partner, Morty, is her hero at work, and in the introduction chapter, the two find themselves involved in a drug-related shoot-out, where two people are killed, including Morty. Vicki was lucky to be alive, or was this a set up? The other person killed was a pregnant black woman, Shayla Jackson, who was their \\"CI\\" (confidential informant) who was about to give them some crucial information, and who also happened to be pregnant.   <br /> <br />Vicki, of course, decides to take matters in her own hands. With the help from a beautiful black woman named Reheema Bristow, who is connected to Shayla Jackson, Vicki does her own detective work against the advice of everyone (in fact, she almost gets fired more than once from her job). As Vicki and Reheema do their dangerous detective work, they find bits and pieces of the puzzle that helps Vicki figure out what really was going down in Devil's Corner, that part of Philadelphia where Morty and Shayla were killed.   <br /> <br />There's a bit of romance between Vicki and Dan, plus a lot of gun action. Part of this novel did remind me of the comedy team of Stephanie Plum and her black hooker sidekick in the popular Janet Evanovich series, which I found a little irritating at times, only because the two pairs seemed similar. But other than that, I did enjoy the book. Fast paced, although at times a little bit far fetched (I didn't buy that Vicki could be as careless as she was, and as irresponsible. Stephanie Plum I buy, but not Vicki Allegretti). DEVIL'S CORNER is a fun summer read, but I didn't enjoy itas much as her previous novels. Still, I definitely would read more by her. I give this book a rating of 3 stars.	2005-06-13

In HIS REAL FATHER Lisa Malden was once Patrick Kelley's girlfriend, years ago, until he had died in a car accident shortly around high school graduation. His twin brother, Joe, had at one time been her best friend. Seventeen years later and Joe has finally returned home after living in Southern California, making a career as a filmmaker. What Joe doesn't know is that Lisa is hiding a secret about her son Brandon, who everyone assumes is Patrick's. It has to do with the paternity of her son, and Lisa is not sure what to think. But if what she thinks is true, the knowledge will change the lives of many persons, including Brandon, who had never recovered from the loss of his paternal grandfather.<br /><br />The story of Joe and Lisa circles around their past and their love of each other, which always remained hidden to the public, as Lisa had at one point been in love with Patrick. The two never really admitted their true feelings to each other, because of Patrick. But as the years pass, and they try to pretend nothing ever happened that one fateful day many years ago, it is now time to bring up the past and bury it. Joe had been running forever from the tragedy and blamed his father's bar for the death.  Lisa's guilt stemmed from one illicit night, when passions between her and her boyfriend's brother were finally realized, something that never should have happened.<br /><br />There's a lot of soul searching in this novel, as well as secondary characters dealing with their own problems of unrequited love. The subplot of Maureen's (Joe's mother) upcoming wedding to a man that not everyone feels is suited for her, the paternity issue of Lisa's son Brandon, Lisa possibly buying the family owned bar from Maureen, and the love story between Lisa and Joe, are the major subplots of this story. But the focus is on Joe and Lisa, and Brandon who is spiraling downward for reasons his family do not fully understand. HIS REAL FATHER is yet another novel by Salonen that works for me, and I always look forward to her romances.	2005-06-06

ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF A DREAM by Sheila Williams <br />June 5, 2005 <br /> <br /> <br />ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF A DREAM by Sheila Williams is the story of Juanita Lewis, a woman who finds that after raising three children and catering to their whims and needs, realizes that it is now her turn. She is a middle aged African American woman who is now on a journey to find her inner self. So, one day she moves out of her home in Columbus, Ohio and eventually ends up in a small town called Paper Moon in the state of Montana.  <br /> <br />Life in Montana was a big change of scenery for her, and Juanita discovers that she loves living in this small town she now calls home. She meets Jess, who becomes the new man in her life, and also befriends an eccentric old lady named Millie Tilson, who has lived her life to the fullest and is still going strong.  Juanita's best friend is a lesbian truck driver named Peaches, and it's because of her that Juanita travels around the western United States, meeting people that will influence her future. <br /> <br />It's when she hears about Millie's death that Juanita finally returns home to Paper Moon, and finds that she's inherited the Bed and Breakfast inn that Millie ran.  Juanita wants to continue what Millie started, but finds she has made an enemy in Millie's estranged son, who is trying to take over the B and B so he could tear it down to make a parking lot.  <br /> <br />I surprisingly found this novel a wonderful experience, as I had no idea what to expect when I picked up this book.  While the first part of the novel meanders a bit as Peaches and Juanita travel through California and beyond, it helped set up the novel for what was to come, and I was able to appreciate that. While this book is probably labeled as African American Lit, it certainly had a different feel compared to the books by Eric Jerome Dickey as well as Terry McMillan.  This is not a bad thing, and it was refreshing to read a new voice in this growing genre.  I amdefinitely recommending this book, and hope to read her first novel, DANCING ON THE EDGE OF THE ROOF.  Sheila Williams is a writer that I believe is going to go far.	2005-06-06

IMPROBABLE by Adam Fawer <br />June 4, 2005 <br /> <br />Rating 4.5/5 stars <br /> <br />What a suspenseful book IMPROBABLE was! Adam Fawer's debut novel, IMPROBABLE is a fast paced thriller that combines the world of espionage and science, notably statistics and probability and physics. David Caine is a gambler - more specifically, he's an addicted gambler. He plays high stakes poker and while he had this problem under control, lately he's had this obsessive need to play and win, always thinking the next hand will make him more money. While playing a game at Vitaly Nikolaev's club \\"Chernobyl\\", David is on a roll but suddenly he smells something awful and blacks out. He has had yet another seizure, each one becoming worse than the last. <br /> <br />David once taught statistics and probability in college, until his seizures made it difficult for him to teach, and he truly knows his stuff. He is able to compute probabilities in his head as any Joe can count to ten. He's a genius when it comes to this. What he loves to do is compute the probability of an event happening, and he notices that he has started to see visions, in which he sees different probable outcomes of various events, in particular, those that he impacts. It is this \\"gift\\" that puts him in trouble, taking him into the dangerous world of espionage. <br /> <br />In the mean time, Dr Tversky is experimenting on a young woman (a student of his, who is now his lover) with drugs and electrodes, expounding on a theory connected to scientific laws discovered by Heisenberg that says that all things are predetermined, and Maxwell, who says things are random. But Tversky believes that things APPEAR to be random, but are in fact pre-determined. Using Julia as a guinea pig, he almost finds a way to tap into a person's intuitive subconscious, which would allow one to see various probable futures, possibly learning to control one's destiny or a particular outcome. <br /> <br />David doesn't realize what is going on with his mind. He does know that he's been able to see visions of future probabilities, notably after he started taking an experimental drug to help with his epileptic seizures.  He soon finds he can foresee disasters that could have had him killed. His twin, Jasper, is schizophrenic, but unknown to David, Jasper also has had some similar experiences in regards to predicting the future. <br /> <br />International spy Nava Vaner finds herself in trouble with North Korea, and after taking the millions they owed her for some espionage work, they find that the CD she has given them is defective. She knows she's in trouble, and tries to bargain with them. She has only a short time before she can save her ass, or she'll soon be dead.  <br /> <br />Nava earns a living spying for various countries, killing terrorists and others when asked. She has no allegiance to any country, although at one time she considered herself Russian, and then later she helped spy for the United States, her adopted country. Now, she finds herself in the middle of David Caine's nightmare, in which he is trying to desperately obtain money he owes to the Russian gambling house, while also trying to escape from others who are trying to capture him. <br /> <br />The novel is almost one big roller coaster ride, with a few quiet lulls in the action when David or someone else is explaining some scientific theory, or when someone such as Nava is telling her life story.  Although I loved the theory, at times I felt it bogged down the over all novel, but other than that, this was a really great story, and a wonderful debut.  (It should be noted that I think learning about probability and the various scientific theories this story touched upon were important to understand the gist of the novel). It's rare that I will stay up until midnight reading a book (I'm an early bird in most cases) but this book just wouldn't let me go.  This book is a must-read, and I was glad to be able to read IMPROBABLE.	2005-06-04

WHISPERS AND LIES by Joy Fielding <br />June 4, 2005 <br /> <br />Rating 4.5/5 stars <br /> <br /> <br />I can't believe how much I enjoyed this book.  WHISPERS AND LIES was one of those that I could not put down! Joy Fielding is an author that can be really good. I think this is so far my favorite book by this author, and I cannot recommend it enough. The main character is narrating in the first person. Her name is Terry Painter, 40 years old and a nurse. She lives alone in the home her mother used to live in until she had died a few years ago. Terry begins her story saying how she should have seen what was going to happen, setting up the novel with a lot of suspense. You know something is going to happen, but you just don't know what. As the reader learns more about Terry's situation, the reader is going to want to sympathize with her and will want to find out what is going to happen to her next. <br /> <br />At the start of the novel, Terry is interviewing a potential renter. Alison Simms is her name and she's much younger, in her twenties, and quite different from the very quiet and almost shy older woman. But for some reason Terry really likes Alison, and without even researching her background, Terry on the spot offers the back cottage for Alison to rent. <br /> <br />But as the days go by, Terry starts to feel that something is amiss. Things happen that she is not sure is really happening, and she is afraid she's reading too much into little nuances, things that are being said to her, people that she sees. She soon finds herself not trusting Alison, but at the same time she wants to be friends with her. Terry does not have many friends at all, and Alison at this point is the only friend she has. <br /> <br />In the meantime, she's dealing with her \\"favorite\\" patient, an elderly woman named Myra Wylie. Myra is on her deathbed, but seems to be hanging on despite having cancer and other health issues. She has a son that is divorced, and Josh seems to \\"like\\" Terry. Terry really likes Josh too, but is too shy to do anything about her feelings, at first. <br /> <br />What shocked me was the way things turned out in the novel. It is all about perception. It is a shocker, and I'm not even going to get into the plot much here. But I found myself totally glued to the pages, literally could not put this book down. I shook my head at the ending, shocked at what I learned about Terry. Wow! Anyone that has enjoyed this author's other books will have to read this one. It was very fast paced and the suspense was unbelievable! Wonderful!	2005-06-04

Both books feature the Chickalini family and focuses on a different member of the family in each one.  In ONCE UPON A BLIND DATE, the focus is on Dominic Chickalini, whose friend Maggie O'Mulligan is a control freak and has a need to find him a wife.  <br /> <br />Written as a totally light-hearted romantic comedy, Maggie is helping Dominic find his future wife, and so they go to a coffeehouse called MATCH MOCHA MATCH MOCHA to search for that fantasy woman. Unfortunately, it is Maggie that decides what Dominic's match should be, so she is the one that fills out the questionnaire for him.  <br /> <br />At the same time, also at MATCH MOCHA MATCH MOCHA, Charlie Kennelly is helping his friend Julie find her dream man.  Dominic becomes that dream man, and it's Charlie's idea that Julie should take her dream date to a basketball game, giving Dominic the impression she's a sports fan. (Julie knows nothing about basketball).  <br /> <br />On this first date, Charlie and Maggie come along for the ride and soon trouble begins. Maggie finds that she doesn't like Charlie at all. But she wants to make sure that Dominic impresses his date Julie so that they will end up getting married eventually.  While Maggie and Charlie try to control their friends and dictate how they should impress the other, the actual date doesn't seem to get off the ground, and no one is sure that the date is a success or a failure.  <br /> <br />While Dominic and Julie half-heartedly continue to court each other, with some hilarious results, Maggie and Charlie find themselves attracted to each other, yet they keep irritating each other at the same time.  It's opposites attract, but neither wants to admit to anyone that there is something going on between them. <br /> <br />While the two ofthem dance around each other, wanting each other yet afraid to admit it, Maggie has a boyfriend that is currently living in South America, providing medical care to the poor.  She thinks they will get married one day, but most of her plans are pure fantasy.  When Jason finally tells her that he's returning home, Maggie freaks out, but tells herself that this was her plan all along, to marry Jason.   <br /> <br />While I enjoyed this book much more than the previous THE NINE MONTH PLAN, ONCE UPON A BLIND DATE isn't what I'd typically read when it comes to romances. While I do enjoy the comedic aspects of these two books, I find the characters are a bit flat and stereotypical. At the same time, these books are good beach reads. They are not heavy reads, nor are they too sugary sweet for some tastes.  For readers who enjoy their romances light and not altogether grounded in reality, these books are for them.	2005-05-30

In her early twenties, Henry runs the farm she grew up on, an estate known as Stannage Park in Cornwall England.  It is 1816, and she is awaiting the appearance of the new Lord Stannage, a man by the name of William Dunford.  He was a distant relative to the late Lord Stannage, and had inherited the estate.  Henry's plan was to make life so miserable for Dunford that he would not want to stay on the farm or have anything to do with it. Henry's fear was that she would lose her home and would be living on the streets.  She loved this farm more than anything else in the world, and would do anything to keep it. <br /> <br />The first part of the book is filled with stunts that Henry pulls to make Dunford want to go back to the city.  She puts Dunford through many tests, including making him get up at 5:30 in the morning to start work on the farm and telling him that all they will eat for their noon meal is porridge. But nothing seems to scare him off.  Instead, the two become friends, and then one day Dunford decides to take Henry into town (London) and have her see a different type of life.  He wants to see her in pretty dresses, not in her mannish outfits she wears on the farm. He is also slowly growing fond of her, and is afraid to admit that he may have feelings for her. <br /> <br />MINX takes the Eliza Doolittle theme, as is somewhat common among these historical novels, and Henry blossoms under the tutelage of Dunford's London friends.  Everyone notices that Henry and Dunford have feelings for each other, but the two of them do not want to acknowledge it.  When Dunford learns that he is now Henry's guardian, he isn't sure that it's even appropriate for him to have any romantic feelings for her.  In the meantime, Henry is the hit of London and is quite a success. She has become a lady. <br /> <br />I'm giving MINX by Julia Quinn three stars.  Although over all it was an enjoyable book, I felt the book went a bit too long, and could have been cut shorter.  The \\"happy ending\\" took forever to come, and I was ready for the book to be over before the actual last page.  The characters however were well written, and while the theme has been done before (Eliza Doolittle), the story line was amusing.  On the other hand, I didn't buy into how fast Henry and Dunford become good friends.  It didn't make sense to me that she would even care for him, since they were from different worlds.	2005-05-29

THE READING GROUP by Elizabeth Noble <br />May 28, 2005 <br /> <br />Amazon rating 4/5 <br /> <br />THE READING GROUP by Elizabeth Noble was a year in the life of the members of a reading group. Some of these women know each other and are good friends, while others are total strangers, but as each month progresses, the women begin to learn more about each other and become integral parts of each other's lives. <br /> <br />Each chapter begins with the book of the month, including discussion of the book, which I found very refreshing. In some ways, their lives will parallel the books they read. I also enjoyed noting that some of the books the women read in their group were books which I have read and loved in the past: ATONEMENT, EDEN CLOSE, REBECCA and GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING. <br /> <br />The members of the group: <br /> <br />Harriet, the founder of the group - she is married to Tim, and is in a marriage where she feels she's suffocating. Tim, on the other hand, worships the ground she walks on. They have two children. <br /> <br />Nicole is Harriet's best friend and co founder of the group. Her marriage seems to be OK on the outside, but she has been battling a husband that has been unfaithful since who knows how long. They have three children, including twin boys. <br /> <br />Polly is a single divorced parent of two older children, one of whom (Cressida) will present a family problem half way through the book.  <br /> <br />Susan is Polly's best friend. Susan has the best marriage and family life in the group, married to husband Roger and they have two kids, one of whom is at university. But she also has an estranged sister who lives in Australia and a mother who is aging rapidly before her eyes.  <br /> <br />And finally there is Clare, who is the least vocal member of the group. She is going through a rough time in her marriage. She has had so many miscarriages that it's affecting her happiness and her outlook on her life with her husband Elliott. It is tearing the marriage apart, and the irony of it is that she works as a midwife. <br /> <br />THE READING GROUP by Elizabeth Noble is a book I highly recommend. I think most women readers will welcome this book. The only problem I had was remembering who everyone was, including all the husbands and children attached to each member, but there is a list of characters in the beginning of the book that I resorted to quite often. In some ways this book reminded me of Maeve Binchy's writing, without the Irish slant. This book takes place in England and as a lover of contemporary British fiction, I loved this book as well.	2005-05-29

In order for Gideon to secure a title and wealth, he needs to marry up, and Constance, who is beautiful and wealthy, is his ticket.  He isn't just after her money, however. He truly believes she's the right woman for him and he thinks he loves her. And since his Uncle Edward, who is supposedly on his deathbed, is to pass on his estate to Gideon, Gideon feels he should look good in Constance's eyes. <br /> <br />Lily is the pickpocket that Gideon saves from going to jail, and he makes a bargain with her. He and his best friend Laurie (Lord Kilmartin) will coach her until she is presentable in society, and with her help, he will win Constance's heart by making her jealous.   <br /> <br />It's a variation on the Eliza Doolittle story, and for me it worked.  I enjoyed the characters and their shenanigans as they (and Lily) fooled society.  Lily becomes the toast of the town, and of course Gideon finds himself infatuated by her. Lily also finds herself falling for him, but both know that this is a romance that can never be, as they are from different worlds.   <br /> <br />Lily's young sister Alice is also a charming addition to the story, and as usual a child in a historical romance makes for a welcome subplot.  Lily and Alice are orphaned, and so it is Lily who is looking after her ten-year old sister.  Lily makes her living as a pickpocket because there was no other way.  But stepping into Gideon's world makes her own world look even worse, and she dreads the day she and Alice will have to return to it. <br /> <br />For those who enjoy regency romances, I recommend TO LOVE A THIEF.  It's funny and charming and the author did a good job describing the world of Regency London.  It was a definitely fun book to read.	2005-05-28

GENEVIEVE by Eric Jerome Dickey <br />May 14, 2005 <br /> <br /> <br />One of my favorite books by Eric Jerome Dickey, GENEVIEVE is the story of a couple who are afraid to deal with their pasts.  The opening begins with a hot steamy love scene, and it is revealed that the narrator is having an affair with his sister-in-law.  But, while the opener makes one think the novel will be about the affair, it is not truly correct.  The bulk of the story comprises of secrets and lies told between Genevieve and her husband, the unnamed narrator. As they travel to Alabama to attend the funeral of Genevieve's grandmother Willie Esther, family secrets are revealed that explain the choices the two of them have made in the past. <br /> <br />The sex scenes I have to say were some of the best I've read in a long time! (Not everyone seems to get these scenes right).  But these scenes are definitely NOT the bulk of the story.  The two main characters started life in poverty and rose to the top of their professions, living the life of luxury in Los Angeles.  There is a reason they ended up where they did. The trip to Alabama has both of them remembering their pasts, and a few choice secrets are revealed at the very end of the book which will shock the reader (at least it shocked me!).   <br /> <br />While this book is a departure for Dickey (it's a much more serious read than previous novels, and there is only one narrator as opposed to three or four), it is certainly one of his better novels. Highly recommended to fans and newcomers, GENEVIEVE is a book I will remember for a long time.	2005-05-23

The book is separated into three parts, and in each part the reader sees a glimpse of the main character at the age of 12, 26, and finally at age 36.  <br /> <br />The book right away depicts the family as a victim of divorce.  Denny's parents are brain surgeons and do not have much time for family life, including their daughter Denny.  Lily and Charles Roman are already divorced in the opening of the novel, but both parents do play a role in Denny's life. A third adult, Maureen, plays a much more important role than her own parents do. She runs an answering service, but her duties soon move into family territory by helping to run the household and be there for Denny when she needs her.   <br /> <br />The three parts of WHAT TO KEEP are comparable to snapshots taken at different times of their lives.  With Denny at 12, she is struggling to find an identity, yearning for her parents' attention but knows always that she'll come up short.  Maureen is what saves Denny during these growing up years.   <br /> <br />At age 26, Denny is now a struggling actress, and her mother is married to Phil, a man she once had a fling with back in part one, and the two of them are moving to New York.  Denny again is struggling with her relationship with her mother, and seems more focused on her career and her memories in the house she grew up in, rather than being there emotionally for her mother. She doesn't feel she gets any support from Lily, and when Denny finds out she's up for a movie roll in a film by Robert Altman, she tries to find a way to go back to Los Angeles earlier than she had planned. A significant turning point does occur in this time of her life, something that happens between Phil and herself. It changes their relationship, oddly enough for the better. <br /> <br />At age 36, Denny is now a playwright and is about to have her first play open. She is nervous but proud that she has reached this point in her life.  It is yet another pivotal part of her life, and again her relationship with her mother comes into play. <br /> <br />Throughout all three sections, Maureen seems to play a large part in Denny's life.  While at first she seems to be in the background, it slowly becomes apparent how Maureen is really the surrogate parent that Denny needed, in childhood as well as an adult.  It is Maureen that is there for Denny during key moments such as a school play. It is sad to know that Denny's own biological parents are not able to fulfill that role, but at the same time it is interesting to read about the dynamics that make this family work. <br /> <br />What was most enjoyable about this book were scenes that the author chose to use to describe this family.  Quirky scenes, such as Lily's adventures after being involved in a car accident, are part of the charm of WHAT TO KEEP.  And the fact that each person in this novel is not a typical \\"normal\\" person, but someone that seems to stand out in one way or another.  While Maureen is described as an agoraphobe, in some ways she seemed to be the most normal person in the book, at least to me.  <br /> <br />I really can't say enough about this book, and that I am most certainly going to be reading any future books by Rachel Cline. She's an author to keep an eye out for.	2005-05-18

She's gone through two husbands who abused her in some way, and the third was a very elderly but kind man that understood her needs, allowing her to run free in London.  He too has passed on, and she is now left a widow, wondering if she will marry again. Upon his death, the local vicar, Mr. Heywood, has become the guardian over her two sons.    Lady Sophia decides she likes Mr. Heywood, although the shy and inexperienced vicar is a far cry from the men she had been seen with in the past. It seems that Lady Sophia has had a change of tune, and is ready to settle down.  And the vicar soon realizes that the rumors about Sophia may not all be true, and sees a different side of the widow that the rest of the world did not.    A subplot involving Sophia's estranged father, Tom Eliot, the Earl of Dunhaven, spices up the story line with an attempted kidnapping, among other things, giving the novel an exciting twist.    I loved this regency - it had a lot of humor in it, a bit of intrigue and a lot of excitement with the arrival of Sophia's father.  I would recommend this romance to all who may have been avoiding regencies in the past.  It's books like this that make me want to read more of this genre.    Overall, THE SEDUCING OF MR. HEYWOOD comes highly recommended as a very enjoyable regency. This reviewer will gladly read another historical romance by Jo Manning.	2005-05-14

In chapter one, she is attempting to commit suicide but not succeeding.  While she is still trying to get the gun to work, she hears the sound of a carriage and runaway horses. The carriage crashes and she finds that the driver is dead, but there is a lady of wealth who is heavily injured. The dying woman exclaims, \\"Don't let them... have... it\\". Eliza goes through the woman's belongings to find out who she was, and discovers her identity as Elizabeth Mendoza de Leone, and she too was a widow, if the letter upon her person tells the truth.     This twist of fate takes Eliza on a journey, in which she masquerades as Elizabeth Mendoza, in the hopes of finding a new life for herself.  And things do work out, as Dylan Ferguson \\"saves\\" her from the wreckage and takes her home with him.  She now lives the life of the upper class, in the home of the Duchess and Duke of Wakefield, Dylan's sister and brother-in-law.    Deception and lies continue to pile up on top of each other, until Eliza cannot stand it anymore. She loves Dylan, and he loves her, but will he still want her after she tells him the truth? And when she finds her life is in danger, because she is now thought of as Elizabeth Mendoza, she can't seem to convince anyone that she is really a farmer's wife, Eliza Kent!      Read as a pure escape novel with a happily-ever-after ending, this is the perfect novel to take on a vacation or a beach weekend. Some may feel that parts of the plot may be a bit far-fetched, but all in all it was an enjoyable read. This reviewer recommends MOSTLY A LADY and would gladly read other books by Lisa Manuel.	2005-05-14

HELLO,IT'S ME by Wendy Markham  Edited May 19, 2005      HELLO IT'S ME by Wendy Markham was not what I had expected to find.  A book that is a little more than the standard light-hearted romance, it delves into the topic of how to go on after the death of a spouse.      Annie Harlowe was married to the love of her life, Andre, and had two children together. They live a simple life on the beaches of Long Island, in a small village called Montauk. It is in the prologue that Annie learns of her husband's sudden death, helping to set the mood for the rest of the book.    The chapter after the prologue begins a year later, and Annie is trying to make ends meet by helping out with her best friend Merlin's catering company and serving food at parties that are held at exclusive summer homes owned by the rich and famous. This is not Annie's favorite thing to do but it helps to pay the bills. She also creates trinkets and other types of souvenirs that the beach crowd may want to buy before going back to their homes in the city. She's an artist first, and always will be, and she refuses to conform to society's expectations by working a 9-to-5 job. This was what she and Andre had always vowed, and she was not going to change now.      Annie has it in her mind that Andre does not want her to move on. Every day she calls Andre's old cell phone number, which she is still keeping active by paying monthly fees despite the fact that she can barely pay her other bills, and listens to his voice on the recording. One day she swears that Andre has picked up the other line and is trying to send her a message. What that message is, she does not know, but she tries to contact him again, knowing that anyone who knew what she was doing would think she'd finally cracked.    At one of Merlin's parties she meets Thom, a very wealthy man, and he finds himself very attracted to her. Annie doesn't realize it, but she too is also mutually attracted to him. Unfortunately, Thom is dating (and expectedto marry) Joyce, who is supposedly the perfect woman for Thom. Annie, on the other hand, refuses to take off her wedding ring, feeling that she's expected to love Andre until the day she dies.     Despite these problems, Thom finds a way to get under Annie's skin. Luckily for him she loses her wedding ring at the party and now he HAS to deliver it to her personally. This is the start of their relationship: two people taking a chance on something very uncertain. Annie is not quite ready to move forward, but her kids have already taken it to heart that Thom is going to be their next daddy. This reviewer feels the kids steal the \\"show\\", so to speak, and there are a number of scenes that will leave the reader sniffling into a tissue.    HELLO, IT'S ME is a very delightful novel. The two children, Trixie and Milo, will be every reader's favorites. They were both very lovable little children (at the start of the book Milo is five years old, and Trixie is three) and in their innocent ways help bring Annie and Thom together. What was a surprise to this reader is that the novel is not your average light-hearted romance. This story works on many levels, and touches upon a topic that is not often seen in a typical romance, the subject of how to deal with the death of a spouse. This reviewer gives this novel by Wendy Markham four stars and recommends it to all who love a romance with a small box of tissues.	2005-05-12

Her latest, OH MY STARS, was quite different from PATTY JANE'S HOUSE OF CURL and her more recent ANGRY HOUSEWIVES EATING BON BONS, but I think this latest book is one that I'll remember for a long time. <br /> <br />Violet Mathers starts out in life feeling unloved and unwanted. She's too tall, too plain, and then after she loses an arm to a horrific accident in the sewing factory where she works (she is only sixteen years old at the time), she soon feels that her life is not worth living. At the age of 18, she leaves her father (her mother had left them years ago for another man), gets on a bus bound for San Francisco, hoping to be the second person to end their life by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge. <br /> <br />What can only be fate happens during this bus trip.  The bus ends up in an accident, and because they are stranded somewhere in North Dakota, she ends up being rescued by a very handsome young man named Kjel, and his good friend Austin, and they bring her home.  This is the turning point of her so far miserable life, and her life is now on the upswing. <br /> <br />A good part of this book entails their travels as a musical band they call THE PEARLTONES, and Kjel becomes something of an Elvis-like music idol.  The time period is the late 1930's, so rock n' roll has not yet been invented, color lines have not been crossed, and so their musical world is a bit different than what we know today.  They encounter racism during their travels, as Austin and his brother Dallas are black, but Kjel doesn't see color, and while Violet was brought up to believe that blacks and whites should be segregated, she learns something new through her friendships with Kjel and Austin. <br /> <br />I really loved this book.  I do have to admit that there were times when I felt the book could have beenedited differently, but by the end of the book, I had a feeling that this was a story I would not forget easily.  I am glad I read it and am looking forward to more by Lorna Landvik.  This may have been her best book yet. Violet's early life was depressing, however, and some may not enjoy reading about her early years, but I saw this story as an uplifting type of novel, where even the almost impossibly sad lives can turn around if surrounded by people that care about them.   <br /> <br />Violet narrates: \\"Who'd have ever thought a shunned, husky-voiced, one armed, big-chinned girl with a hive of bees in her head could live a life so full of miracles?\\" <br /> <br />I think that summed up the book quite nicely.	2005-05-07

IN HER PRESENCE: A HUSBAND'S DIRTY SECRET by Nancy Weaver <br />May 6, 2005 <br /> <br /> <br />This is the story of several generations of sexually and emotionally abused people, all under the hands of one man, Rufus Poygoode. He was raised by an aunt who sexually abused him as a boy, and it is no surprise that it is continued down to the next generation.  While the focus of the book is on this man who has no qualms about the pain and suffering that he hands down to his children and grandchildren, it is also on the persons that are abused. <br /> <br />The story starts with the introduction of Rufus and Maebelle Hawkin's.  She happens to be an opportunistic type of woman, not having any scruples about stealing men from her friends or sisters.  In this case,  Rufus is married, and when he decides he wants to make Maebelle his own,  he convinces her that he and his wife are working on the divorce, which is not true at all.  Through lies and deception, he gets her in his bed and she becomes his common-law wife. <br /> <br />What he does to her and her daughters is beyond words.  Nancy Weaver tells the tale of an abusive man and those that live under his roof.  The first half of the book details how Maebelle ends up with Rufus, and she's not quite the victim in the beginning, as she helps get rid of his wife Charlotte, who lives in fear of her life and is glad to be rid of him.  When Maebelle's daughters tell their mother of the sexual abuse they are receiving at their stepfather's hands, Maebelle doesn't do a thing.  At times she even thinks her daughters are jealous of her, and are trying to steal him from her. <br /> <br />Rufus' plans for Maebelle and her daughters were downright evil. I won't go into detail here as it  may be a bit too much of a spoiler.  But he is definitely not one that cares how others feel, and is always out for himself. <br /> <br />While Weaver's story had good intentions, I found this book a tad over done, with most of the characters merelycaricatures of black people. The time frame was the 1950s, but the author was inconsistent at times (she starts the book out in the late 1950's, but further into the story, it is only 1950. It could have been a typo, or she merely got her time frames wrong). The book also needed a lot of editing, with quotation marks in the wrong places and too many commas in other instances. While the story itself had a message, I think the plot could have been edited down a lot, with corrections made to facts that were inconsistent.   <br /> <br />The topic of abuse is a heavy duty one and the author wanted to write a story about how people in hardships overcome and eventually will rise above, but the book needed a lot of work. The author has potential and I hope that with her second novel she will grow into an even stronger writer.	2005-05-07

Because of her timing, she ends up on the \\"Amelia Celeste\\" and as luck would have it, a speeding boat causes a horrific accident, killing all but three people on both boats. Julia is shocked to find she has survived, and she wonders what God had intended for her life to spare her, while others had died.  <br /> <br />Noah Prine also was on the \\"Amelia Celeste\\", along with his father Hutch, both of whom were lobster fishermen. While Hutch does not survive the accident, Noah does, and he too wonders why he was chosen to live out of all the others who died in the accident.  <br /> <br />The third survivor is Kim, and her story is a mystery to all. She's gone mute since the accident, and no one knows why. Noah and Julia slowly put the pieces together, with Julia befriending the young woman who seems the most shaken up by the accident. <br /> <br />Julia, in the meantime, temporarily moves in with her Aunt Zoe Ballard, her mother's younger sister, and learns from Zoe about a family secret that has kept Zoe and Janet (Julia's mother) on non-speaking terms for years. Because Julia had chosen to visit Zoe on this trip, Janet is no longer speaking to her daughter, either, to Julia's frustration.  <br /> <br />Julia is also pondering the state of her marriage and whether she even wants to return to her life with Monte in New York. She is finding that she is attracted to Noah, but does not want to act upon it at this point.  Noah in the mean time, who is falling in love with Julia, is contemplating his relationship with his teenage son Ian, a son that he hadn't spent much time in forging a relationship with, due to a divorce. Julia and Monte have an adult daughter (Molly) who is now questioning both her parents' fidelity. And Julia is also trying to get her own parents (Janet and George) to even pretend that they care about their only daughter and the fact that she could have died in that boating accident.  <br /> <br />THE SUMMER I DARED has different elements that readers will enjoy. There was the romance between Noah and Julia, which is woven into the mystery of the boating accident. There is intrigue, as the police investigate the accident and whether Kim has anything to do with it.  There are a number of subplots that may or may not interest the reader, but I think Delinsky did a good job with pulling them all together. In the long run, the story isn't just about the accident, but what the accident brings out in the three survivors.  The Ratmammy gives THE SUMMER I DARED four stars.	2005-05-06
253690:US	51214937	R6KJ8V31TW16B	0060734175	157867055	Mambo Peligroso: A Novel	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Loved it!	MAMBO PELIGROSO by Patricia Chao <br />May 1, 2005 <br /> <br />Rating 4/5 stars <br /> <br />MAMBO PELIGROSO centered on the story of several Cuban Americans, but mostly on a woman named Catalina, whose mother was from Japan and father was from Cuba, and part of her childhood was spent in Cuba before Castro took control of the country. Things changed for their family when Castro came into power, and when her father commits suicide, she escapes with her mother to America, where they live with her father's sister in Florida. The bulk of the novel is centered on the New York mambo scene, where Catalina goes to live as an adult. It is Catalina's passion, the New York mambo scene, as she lives and breaths mambo night and day. As she learns more about this very difficult dance, she also finds herself yearning for her Cuban roots, which she let go when her father died all those years ago. <br /> <br />Other main characters include Wendy, who becomes a good friend of Catalina, and at the same time a rival for affections from their mentor, El Tuerto, who is also another main character. The story is told in the present, with the characters going back into the past to tell their individual stories. The book ends in Cuba, back where it all started. <br /> <br />This is a very intense book, with lots of strong language, lots of sex and violence. \\"Peligroso\\" means \\"dangerous\\", and while at first it's the world of Mambo that it refers to, the reader can see that it actually points to the dangerous life that is led by those who are trying to take down Castro. At this point the novel centers on Catalina's cousin's story (Guillermo). When Catalina had lived in Florida, her life revolved around Guillermo, and her story ends with her life in some way returning back to him. <br /> <br />Anyone that enjoys intense ethnic drama with political overtones will like MAMBO PELIGROSO. There is a lot of Spanish and some Japanese phrases mixed in, which lucky for me I understood.  I'm not sure how the non-Spanish and non-Japanese reader will interpret those sentences. Most of it is pretty much translated in some way or another by inference, but I did notice a few places where I had to guess what the meaning was. It shouldn't detract from the enjoyment of the book, but some may not care for it. Otherwise, this book is enthusiastically recommended.  It may be one of my favorite books of 2005.	2005-05-04

The opening scene has Catherine with her belligerent father Herb Anderson, her mother Ada, and Clay's parents Claiborne and Angela Anderson. Clay's family is wealthy and successful, while Catherine's family can tout Herb as a chronic alcoholic and abusive husband and father. When Herb finds that his daughter has gotten pregnant by this wealthy young man, he decides he's going to get what's coming to him, which is any money he can coerce from the Anderson's. Catherine doesn't want any of the money, but wants her father to drop the whole thing, and let her take care of this situation herself. <br /> <br />The book then goes into Catherine's attempt at fixing her mistake. She moves into a single mother's home while telling her family she's run away and moved to a different state. Clay finds out that Catherine is still in town and hunts her down. When he proposes to marry has as a business proposition, Catherine does not know what to think but she does not want to be in a loveless marriage like her parents. <br /> <br />Although a lot of this book is dated, I still enjoyed the plot and as always enjoyed Spencer's writing. She always seems to write these stories that start out so-so, but by mid book, I cannot wait to find out what happens next. The characters may at times seem stereotypical, but it did make a good story. As always I look forward to reading another one of her books.	2005-05-01

It wasn't a bad book, but this was the first time one of her books did not have me wanting to read non-stop. There were parts that I felt were boring to me, or maybe I should say I didn't seem as interested in this book as I did with my last read, WHISPERS AND LIES. <br /> <br />Judy is the narrator of this novel - she's almost 40 years old, is married to a very handsome and successful man, Hunter Dean Price III, but she is finding her marriage is growing stale and she is getting rather upset that they rarely have sex. She works for a publishing company and is the editor in charge of cookbooks when she is let go. The company has been bought out by a larger company and they are trying to cut back. It was odd, since the cookbook division was making a lot of money for the company. Arlene, Judy's good friend, also finds she has been let go, and she was the editor in charge of romances, another moneymaker for the company. While Arlene finds a new job relatively quickly, Judy finds herself without a job. Apparently no one is hiring cookbook editors. <br /> <br />In the meantime, she starts going with Hunter to the country club they belong to, THE OAKS. She hates this place, hates the people that belong to it, but Hunter lives and breathes for this place, thinking it is a way for him to move up in his company. The only person she particularly likes is Ducky, whose wife Nedra is one of the top tennis players in the club, spending all her time with the tennis instructor Rob. <br /> <br />When Claire Cox, a famous women's lib advocate, joins the Club, it stirs up a lot of members at the club. Claire's great-grandfather or someone like that was once a member, so she is allowed in by default.  Unmarried woman are not normally allowed into the club - woman have to be married to existing members to be let in. Judy on the other hand is ecstatic and decides that she needs to make friends with Claire in order to pitch a cookbook idea to the famous woman and maybe getting her career back on track. <br /> <br />Not soon after, at the 4th of July party, Claire is found dead. Oddly enough, the local police, in particular Detective Tom Cunningham, ask Judy to help spy for them at the club and find out who the killer may be. Thinking she has no real friends at the club, she may have an easier time of spying on the other members. <br /> <br />The novel then turns into a story of intrigue and suspense, and soon Judy finds her life in danger. The book actually takes off from this point, with the killer turning out to be someone I didn't suspect at first. As I said, this was not a favorite of mine by Heller, but it did have the usual witty banter she is famous for. I'm giving this a 3.5.	2005-05-01

The main female protagonist is an ex-stripper and has an illegitimate daughter who happened to be fathered by a future priest. Nicole, the ex-stripper, has a best friend Janet, who was an ex-nun and now currently is the creator of a very popular comic strip (along the vein of the super hero). Janet also runs a home for women, and this is where Nicole lives, with her teenage daughter Rayne. <br /> <br />The novel opens with Rayne, who has befriended yet another outcast, this time a young boy who is very hyperactive and calls himself Rat. Rayne has no real friends, mainly because she refuses to conform and be part of the mainstream. Because of this, school is painful for her. She spends as little time at school, and what time she has left she is helping out the homeless and the unloved and unwanted, taking in strays when she can. <br /> <br />When Rayne accidentally finds out that her father is not deceased but is alive and well in the state of Illinois, she and Rat (now called Tim) run away and they travel by bus on their \\"Daddy Quest\\". In the meantime, Nicole is worried to death over her missing daughter, but eventually gets in contact with Aaron Luchetti, the father of Rayne, and she too gets a surprise: Aaron never became a priest and has been living all this time with his family on their farm in Illinois. <br /> <br />The story then moves to Illinois, where Rayne arrives to find her new found family, confronts her mother and her father, and the reader is introduced to a slew of characters. From this novel, it is obvious that the author had intended it to be a start to a series of books, and this reader is looking forward to reading them all. Ms Handeland knows how to write well-rounded characters and for the most part, I feel that this is the key to writing a good romance.  THE DADDY QUEST is a recommended romance forthose who enjoy the genre.	2005-05-01

Tracy is a widow at age 33, raising a 9-year old son, with a stepdaughter in college. While Tracy is still in shock over the death of her husband, she is also aware that their marriage had not been very good the past few years, and now she was dealing with a lot of debt that she had not known about until now. In order to make ends meet she is renovating an old hotel called the Heartbreak Hotel, and hopes to make a living in the hotel business. <br /> <br />One evening, a stranger named Wade \\"Johnson\\", comes to her hotel despite the fact that they have not yet opened for business, and asks if he can spend the night. She tries to refuse him but he offers her a lot of cash, and she cannot say \\"no\\". What was to be a one-night stay turns out to be longer than that, and while at first Tracy is very nervous around Wade, as he seems to be very introverted and mysterious, she soon learns that he's someone she can talk to, and they eventually come friends. <br /> <br />Wade is hiding something from Tracy and the world, but in order to preserve their growing friendship, Wade chooses not to confide in her. Tracy, in the meantime, finds that she can talk to Wade and she goes to him for emotional support when she finds out about her deceased husband's secret life. What she finds out is devastating to her, and while she has only known Wade for a few days, she finds that she can go to him for comfort. <br /> <br />Other characters in this novel include Chelsea, the stepdaughter who visits them during the summer and Tracy's son with Glenn, Matthew, a 9-year old who misses his father very much. Chelsea has a lot of anger toward Tracy, while at the same time tries to accept Tracy as her stepmother, but the addition of Wade in Tracy's life puts a strain on their relationship. Matthew on the other hand is happy to have met Wade, and sees him as a possible new role model in his life. <br /> <br />While HEARTBREAK HOTEL is a romance, it also has elements of suspense and intrigue with the subplot surrounding Wade's past life. The reader will find that this is the story line that keeps one interested in the book, especially when Tracy's life is put in danger due to Wade's involvement in a series of murders. <br /> <br />I enjoyed reading HEARTBREAK HOTEL as much as I enjoyed reading the previous book, HEAT WAVE. I didn't enjoy all elements of the plot, however, that which pertained to the ghost story of Captain Ezra Poole, but I really enjoy Landis' writing style. I hope to read the first book in this series, LOVERS LANE.	2005-04-30

I just finished reading SWAN PLACE, which I also enjoyed, but this third novel I had a little trouble liking as much. In RIVER JORDAN, there are several stories going on at once, with various central characters. The focus therefore isn't on one main plot line, but on several.  <br /> <br />The book opens in jail, with Pansy, a black woman, waiting for her parole hearing when she sees a vision of Jesus coming to her. After this experience, she embraces Jesus as her savior.  <br /> <br />In the meantime, Peony, Pansy's sister, is employed by Miss Alice and Mr. Franklin, who are trying to figure out how to deal with an elderly mother that needs to find a home. White Columns, the home where Miss Amy Lee is currently residing, is about to be closed down permanently.  Peony thinks that a good idea is to have her sister Pansy, who may be getting out of jail soon, help take care of the elderly woman, Mr. Franklin's mother. Peony thinks that if Pansy can get out of jail, she would be the perfect person to help care for the elderly Mrs. Franklin (Miss Amy Lee). <br /> <br />Jordan, Miss Alice's daughter from a previous marriage, is very unhappy with her mother's new marriage. Mr. Franklin shows no patience for this young shy girl, and Jordan is miserable.  She can't seem to do anything right where he's concerned, so she often spends her time away from home.  The only person besides her mother she feels she loves is Miss Amy Lee, who she knows is coming home soon. <br /> <br />When Pansy gets out of jail, a lot of lives are impacted by her arrival at her new home. She immediately bonds with her new employer, Miss Amy Lee, who in turn \\"wakes up\\" and becomes her lively old self again, the person that Jordan grew to love before she was sent to White Columns. The three of them end up on a great adventure, involving yet another character, Gertie, who is a teenager with such a horrible disposition that I hated this character after getting to know her! Gertie has run off with a new beau, and Pansy takes Miss Amy Lee and Jordan with her to find the missing girl.   <br /> <br />There are other various characters in the book that readers will enjoy reading about, including a simpleton named Honey Boy, who is beloved by all in the town and thinks that every day is Christmas Eve.   <br /> <br />While I'm not giving this book an enthusiastic recommendation, I still found it enjoyable for its story lines and the interesting characters introduced by Trobaugh. Those who enjoy Southern Lit may enjoy this book, but fans of Trobaugh may agree that this is not her best effort.  Still, it is worth reading, and I'm giving this book a 3 star rating.	2005-04-25

Books	3	7	8	N	N	A good beach read	WHERE IS HE NOW by Jennifer Greene <br />April 23, 2005 <br /> <br />In WHERE IS HE NOW by Jennifer Greene, Nate Donneli and Jeanne Claire Cassiday are two ex-lovers who were always meant to be. A fifteen-year class reunion is coming up, and this event could be what brings the two together again.  <br /> <br />At one time in her life, Jeanne thought for sure that her life and Nate's would be tied together forever. They were sweethearts in high school, but shortly after they both started college, Nate broke off their relationship with no explanation whatsoever.  <br /> <br />Jeanne was heartbroken, but in order to get over him she puts her soul into her father's business as a convention event manager, dealing with planning and booking events and also making sure their business stays solvent. While her father was excellent with the customers and clients, he was awful with money. <br /> <br />It is now 15 years later and Jeanne finds herself in charge of the class reunion, along with her friend Tamara, the friend who ended up pursuing her dream and becoming a rock star, and the class nerd Arnold. Jeanne is asked to contact Nate, in the hopes that he will help them with the main speech at the reunion, since he was the one labeled \\"most likely to succeed\\".  Nate, however, ended up working at his father's garage instead of being the architect he always wanted to be. He felt he was a failure, despite helping to raise his brothers and sisters after his father's death, as well as keeping the business alive.  <br /> <br />After learning what happened to Nate after graduation, Jeanne realizes what a success Nate's life really was, but someone needed to point it out to him. There were also feelings of love and attraction between them, and she wanted to resolve any of these feelings before she moved on with her life. She recognized that her love for Nate had stood between her and all the love relationships she had since high school, including a marriage that failed miserably. <br /> <br />Nate now has a successful luxury car business, as well as a precocious teenage daughter. A lot has happened since graduation, and both Claire and Nate slowly rediscover each other and catch up on each other's lives after graduation. Neither had expected to find each other doing what they were doing now, and it was a learning experience for each of them to understand whether their dreams had been fulfilled or not <br /> <br />An interesting subplot involves Arnold, who always had a huge crush on Tamara, and Tamara, who felt that her life was a failure. As the two of them work on the class reunion party, Tamara sees a different side of Arnold and learns a little about her own feelings. <br /> <br />I found myself liking this book, although it wasn't the perfect novel. I enjoyed the various subplots, but felt that there were too many things going on for one book. The story of Arnold and Tamara should have been taken out and saved for a separate book, while the focus should have been on Nate, Claire, and their two families. There was not enough attention made to Claire's father, who I thought had an important story that could have been explored. Overall, however, I feel that this is a book worth reading.  It's a good beach read, or can be saved for a rainy day.	2005-04-24

Told in Dove's voice, her story begins with the loss of her mother to cancer, her stepfather's next marriage to Crystal, a very pretty but very young girl, and what happens in their lives soon thereafter. The bulk of the story spans a year of Dove's life, as she writes and details their adventures and their stories of survival after her mother passes away. <br /> <br />I wasn't disappointed with this story.  It's not action packed, but a lot does happen to Dove, her two younger siblings, and their brand new step mother, as they try to make ends meet after the loss of Dove's parents.  Although it is Crystal that tries to take over as their parent and takes responsibility over them, it is really Dove that is the center of stability for this little family, and they get help along the way from family and friends.  When they eventually move to Swan Place and live under the protection of Buzzard, the maid for the owners of the estate, their lives change for the better, and Dove and her siblings learn how a segment of the population lives, a world that does not live in poverty. <br /> <br />I gave this book a rating of four stars, mainly for the lovely way that Augusta Trobaugh writes.  Filled with wonderful characters from the Deep South, SWAN PLACE is a book that the fan of Southern Lit will appreciate.  While SOPHIE AND THE RISING SUN was the better novel, readers will not be disappointed in SWAN PLACE.	2005-04-24

There is much concern that she will become an old maid at age 24.  She has been engaged to several men before, but for one reason or another none of these engagements have led to matrimony. Hindley Moore is her latest betrothed, and was expected to arrive at the Southard's Ball, where Larkspur was hoping to announce the engagement, but he never shows up.  Lark's father decides that he needs to pick her future husband for her, before the family becomes an embarrassment.    It is at the Southard's Ball (held by Lark's sister Delphinium and husband John) that Lark meets Mr. Benedict Queensman, a physician and apparent heir to an estate that belongs to Lord Raeborn, who is three times Lark's age and will eventually become Lark's new fianc. Lord Raeborn has said that Mr. Queensman (Benedict) will inherit Raeborn's estate if he dies without an heir. Hence, Lady Larkspur's role in securing an heir. Lark is very upset with this situation, and worse yet, she has fallen for Ben, who is only a doctor and thus not a suitable match.     Lark resolves to get out of this wedding. She feigns illness, due to her broken heart over the jilting by Hindley Moore, who they discover had eloped with a former mistress. Ben decides that he will take Lark to the seaside to stay at Mr. Knighton's Sanatorium at Brighton, not too far from Ben's hospital and home. Lark doesn't know it, but Ben has ulterior motives.    While this book is enjoyable overall, with the fast paced mystery that involves Gabriel Siddons and Ben Queensman, the novel had a more serious undertone than some of the recent regencies this reviewer has read. At various points, it seemed that there was too much narrative and not enough dialogue to suit this reviewer's tastes. However, that is more a personal opinion, and may not be a hindrance for another reader.The plot to overthrow King George IV was most exciting, giving the book an added dimension of complexity, although it seemed to take off too slowly at first.  The last half of the book seemed to go much faster, making this romance worth reading after all. This reviewer recommends LADY LARKSPUR DECLINES with 3  stars.	2005-04-23

Her marriage to his father was not a happy one, and in fact the rumors are that her husband had been having affairs during the past few years. Now that her husband is dead, and the mourning period of one year has passed, Claudia has still not taken off her mourning clothes to look for a new husband.    Noel Clifford, Lord Hawke, is the co-guardian of Claudia's son. Noel finds any excuse to come and visit Claudia and Edward, which infuriates Claudia for some reason. Deep down, however, she is attracted to him and wonders what his motives must be. Noel does seem to have an agenda, but is trying his best to get in Claudia's good graces. She soon wonders whether Lord Hawke's interest is in her personally, or in the property that she owns.    MY LADY FAIRE is what I would call a pleasant read, with the pace somewhat slow and the romance between Noel and Claudia, except for a few passionate kisses, almost non-existent except in their minds. For those who enjoy slow-developing relationships will welcome this novel. This romance is definitely not for those who are looking for a bit more action.     One of the highlights of this book for me was the interaction between 7-year old Edward and the adults. Somewhat precocious, and definitely in need of a male father figure, this reader felt that this was one instance in which a child placed in a romance played a welcome role in the development of the story. When young Edward took a fall from his pony, it was wonderful to see the gentlemen friends of Lord Hawke come to Edward's aid, helping out in his recovery and giving him some needed entertainment during his convalescence.     Overall, this romance is not a must-read, but for those who are looking for a pleasant Regency romance, this is it. MY LADY FAIRE is well written, but is not one for those who are seekinga much faster paced novel. This reviewer gives the book 3  stars.	2005-04-23

His latest challenge is to solve the mystery behind the rumors of ghosts living in a cemetery in the small town of Boone Creek, North Carolina. When he starts to fall in love with the local psychic's granddaughter, she does her best to dissuade him, knowing they come from different worlds and that nothing would come of this romance.   <br /> <br />TRUE BELIEVER is a departure for Sparks, in that this is not a tragedy.  It is a straightforward story of a man who is trying to solve the mystery of the ghosts in Cedar Creek Cemetery, and in the midst of working, he meets Lexie Darnell, a woman who has been hurt in the past and is afraid to love again.  The two are worlds apart in terms of background, but he feels that they have a chance to make a go at it.  <br /> <br />Lexie believes in the ghosts, as do many of the town's people.  If Jeremy finds the solution to this puzzle, it would change life in Boone Creek and possibly ruin any chances Jeremy has with Lexie.  But he continues on, wanting to prove that yet again he can solve any mystery that involves the supernatural. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book, but it's not going to be a favorite.  I have always enjoyed Sparks' tragedies (in particular MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE). TRUE BELIEVER was a well-written novel, but it lacks the \\"oomph\\" that is characteristic of his stories.  The most enjoyable part of this story was the mystery behind the ghosts, but I in particular enjoyed the characters that filled the pages.  Sparks always does a good job with the characters that grace the pages of his novels, and while the plot itself may lack something, TRUE BELIEVER is worth the read for any Sparks fan.	2005-04-21
269421:US	51214937	R13BA90L7VGK1E	0312319169	863828045	Company Man	Books	4	31	36	N	N	Another Winner from Joe  Finder	COMPANY MAN by Joseph Finder  March 26, 2005    COMPANY MAN is the story of a CEO (Nick Conover) of a large office furniture manufacturer who finds himself involved in a murder, while at the same time is dealing with the death of his wife and the impact it has on his children.     Nick works for Stratton, a company that makes high-end office furniture, and they have been in business for a few generations. Unfortunately, things have been rocky since Nick took over, and has had to lay off hundreds of employees. It's a typical scenario in the business world, but Stratton is the main employer for this small town of Fenwick, Michigan, where almost everyone knows someone that was employed there or had been laid off. Nick goes from being popular guy to \\"the slasher\\".    As the story begins, the reader finds out that Nick's home has been broken into more than once, and although nothing is ever stolen, someone has been writing graffiti on his walls. The police do not see this as a threat, even after they find the family dog in the pool, butchered. Soon after, his friend Eddie, who also happens to be Nick's director of security at Stratton, helps him install a security system as well as try to find out who could possibly be the person doing this to Nick and the family. Eddie suspects an ex-employee by the name of Andrew Stadler who was supposedly schizophrenic and had been part of the layoffs, except he quit before they could actually lay him off.    One night Nick kills Andrew in self-defense. Andrew had shown up in the yard (the brand new security system alerted Nick) and from there, his nightmares begin. Eddie comes to the rescue once again, but he wants to cover up the murder. Nick wants to go the police, saying it was in self-defense, but Eddie says that Nick would definitely go to jail. Nick believes him, since Eddie used to be a cop with the Grand Rapids police, and knows the routine. So, Eddie helps Nick cover up the murder, with Nick not knowing any of the details. Eddie feels that the less Nick knows the better.    In the mean time, there is something going on with the management team at Stratton, and Nick finds that he can't trust anyone. Scott McNally, his CFO, was his most trusted man at one point, but now Nick can't even trust him either. Scott begins to make decisions without informing Nick, obviously going behind Nick's back, travelling overseas without letting Nick know.  It is almost obvious that Scott and the top management of Stratton are all hiding something from him. Desperate, Nick enlists Eddie to help get to the bottom of it, and as they find out what is going on, Nick finds himself wanting more than ever to help save the company that seems to be on the brink of bankruptcy.    One added element helps crank up the tension in the story: Nick gets involved with the daughter of Andrew Stadler, and regardless of the advice Eddie gives Nick about staying away from her, Nick feels a connection with her, and cannot stay away.  Eddie is worried that Nick's involvement with her may jeopardize things, and lead the police to them.     The two story lines are written in parallel, and as the cops (including Audry Rhimes, an African American female cop that finds all sorts of opposition from her peers) come closer to finding the truth of what happened that night, Nick's problems at work escalate. The ending climax was not what I had expected and it was a shock to find out who really was the one that was breaking into Nick's home.    This is the second book by Joseph Finder that I have read, and while I liked this book, I still find PARANOIA to be my favorite (for sentimental reasons). Both books were hard to put down, however, and I stayed up past my bedtime to finish reading COMPANY MAN. I think some may find that the ending was a bit too sensational, but overall the book was well written and I loved the suspense. Those who enjoyed PARANOIA will definitely love COMPANY MAN.  As for myself, I'm looking forward to Finder's nextnovel (keep cranking them out, Joe!)	2005-04-21

THE BREAKDOWN LANE by Jacquelyn Mitchard <br />April 5, 2005 <br /> <br /> <br />THE BREAKDOWN LANE was my first book by Jacquelyn Mitchard, and it was not what I had expected. In some ways, her writing style reminded me (at first) of Joyce Carol Oates, a writer that I have read once and had a very hard time reading, but by the time I read the last page, I said, \\"Wow!\\". Mitchard writes her stories in somewhat the same way. At least in THE BREAKDOWN LANE, the characters reminded me of those in Oates' WHEN WE WERE THE MULVANEYS. Lots of characters that you aren't sure you will like, and one that I totally loathed and despised, populated THE BREAKDOWN LANE. <br /> <br />Julie is a middle-aged woman who has never been called traditional. And neither is her husband. Julie grew up with a famous father (a writer) and lived with wealth. Her husband is Jewish and his childhood was quite different. This book isn't so much about their relationship, but about two people that go through some really weird stuff as her husband Leo seems to be going through a really bad mid-life crisis, but it's more than just that. Leo pretty much \\"drops out\\" of society and lives his life as he pleases, not really caring about how it impacts those around him.  Julie in the mean time is going through some major health issues, and eventually finds out she has MS. With a jerk of a deadbeat husband and three kids that need them both, she is at her wit's end. <br /> <br />While I enjoyed this story, I don't know if I liked the way that it was told. There was something missing. Sometimes I felt that the author jumped ahead when she shouldn't have, skipped things to make time pass faster. Sometimes it worked, but I felt that this is one of those instances when a book should have been longer. My guess is that either the editor made her cut out a lot (to keep it a mainstream novel) or the author simply got lazy. I'm guessing it's the former. <br /> <br />I really admire a writer, however, that can make youhate a character as much as I hated Leo. There are men (and women) like this in the world.  Leo was a sociopath who can justify everything he did. He was a poor excuse for a father, a husband, and a human being. He definitely needed psychological help. I felt bad for Julie, although I can't say that I \\"liked\\" her. But I liked the way the author portrayed her. <br /> <br />I did feel the ending came on too soon, that things were wrapped up too quickly, and I didn't think this book should have had a \\"happy\\" ending. But, maybe that was better than a totally sad ending, since readers would have really been upset. I have one more book by her on my TBR shelves (her Oprah selection) that I guess I should try to read later this year. It would be good to compare the two books.	2005-04-05

In HEADS BY HARRY, main character Toni Yagyuu is telling her story of what her life is like living on the big island of Hawaii.<br /><br />Toni is the middle child of a lower middle class Japanese American family. Her father, Harry O, is the local taxidermist, and it seems like she's being groomed to take over the family business one of these days.  The novel details the dysfunctional life that Toni is growing up in, while at the same time it is shown with a touch of humor.  I always find Yamanaka's books very interesting, showing a different side to the Japanese American experience that is so far apart from that of those living on the mainland.  While there is a lot of humor in this book, I found it more tragic than funny, and although Toni always finds a way to come up on top, the ending to this story is one that I had hoped could have been avoided.  Still, I do commend this book, especially since Yamanaka did not go with a Hollywood ending and gave Toni a more realistic ending for a person such as her.<br /><br />Besides the interesting story line, the characters of this novel jump out at the reader and make the story that more compelling.  I especially liked the character of Sheldon, Toni's gay brother, and his dream of being a hairdresser.  I had a hard time liking a lot of the other characters, mainly because they were mean spirited, a product of their environment.  The reader will watch Toni grow up and eventually make a go at it in college.  It is almost painful to watch her try and fail, her dreams always too far to reach.<br /><br />HEADS BY HARRY is yet another novel by Yamanaka that takes the reader into the life of the Japanese American living on the Hawaiian Islands.  The culture in itself is fascinating to read about, and while this was an interesting read,this reader enjoyed BLU'S HANGING much more. Both books are tragicomedies, a type of book that maybe not all readers will enjoy.	2005-03-27

PARKERS by Joan Medlicott <br />March 20, 2005 <br /> <br />Three different generations of Parker women work together to try to get along in THE THREE  MRS. PARKERS by Joan Medlicott.  I found this book somewhat slow-paced but by reading other reviews on her books, it seems that Medlicott writes \\"cozy\\" reads, or at least books that are somewhat slower paced than average. What is important in this book is the relationship between the three women, with the plot taking secondary importance. <br /> <br />Winifred Parker is the eldest of the Parker women. She is very wealthy, and has remained bitter for many years about the fact that her only son married a woman that she did not approve of. Winifred never liked Zoe, and after Stephen married Zoe, they cut all ties from Winifred. Although Zoe tried to bring Winifred closer when their baby Katie was born, Winifred ignored them as if they did not exist.   <br /> <br />Zoe never forgave Winifred, but now she needs her mother-in-law's help. She is about to lose her property to the bank, and with no other income but her own she cannot survive financially. She bargains with Winifred to borrow money, allowing Winifred to move in with her on the property, in South Carolina.  In the meantime, unbeknownst to Zoe, Winifred is dealing with Meniere's disease, and knows that she needs to find someone to move in with, because she can no longer live alone. <br /> <br />Katie is Zoe's daughter and after nine years of taking care of her brain-damaged daughter alone, she is now on her own. Her daughter had recently passed on, and Zoe offers Katie her home where she can recuperate and get some emotional support from her mother.  For the first time, all three Parker women are now living together under one roof. <br /> <br />While the three of them deal with living together, Zoe is hiding a secret about a past relationship with a man named Alan.  Her secret puts them all in danger, and although the novel does not end with them confronting this ex-boyfriend, it does lead a good part of the story. <br /> <br />Different sub plots weave in and out of the novel, but the main focus is the relationship between the three women.  The author shows them growing and learning to deal with each other, but it takes a lot of effort on the part of all three, and a fourth women, Maude O'Hara, Winifred's new nurse, helps bring the three women together. <br /> <br />THE THREE MRS. PARKERS is not for everyone, but I think most women who enjoy \\"women's fiction\\" may find this book readable.  It's not the perfect book, but the author did do a great job with creating three different generations of women whose history is tied to one man.	2005-03-26

GOOD NIGHT STEVE MCQUEEN by Louise Wener <br />January 25, 2005 <br /> <br /> <br />Danny (Steve) McQueen is dreaming of becoming a big music super star in GOOD NIGHT STEVE MCQUEEN, the debut novel by Louise Wener.  Danny (as he prefers to be called) is almost 30 and is still working part time at the local video store while he tries to make a go at it in the world of music.  His bandmates Vince and Matty are also dreaming of that day when the three of them, as the band DAKOTA, hit it big and make their way to the Top of the Pops.   <br /> <br />Danny's girlfriend, Alison, loves him but she's tired of having to support the both of them.  She wishes that he would realize that this dream of his is just that, a childish dream, and that he'll never make it big.  She gives him an ultimatum, to either make a big effort to score big, or quit music altogether and get a \\"real\\" job.  She gives him six months to shape up.  Danny takes her threat to heart and tells Vince and Matty that they have six months to change their careers for the better, and soon the three of them are plotting and planning their way to the top. <br /> <br />In the mean time, Danny is also working in a \\"specialty\\" video store owned by Mr. and Mrs. Kostas, chatting it up with the elderly Sheila, their most loyal customer.  Sheila, as well as the other characters in this book, is such a hoot. She's in her 80s, but just loves those martial arts movies.  If he's not working, Danny is hanging out with Matty and Vince, either rehearsing or getting drunk. In between the main story line, we learn about Danny's \\"pathetic\\" life, told with a humorous twist, as he narrates the story of his start in life (he actually believed his father WAS Steve McQueen), his discovery of music, and how he met the love of his life (Alison).   <br /> <br />I found GOOD NIGHT STEVE MCQUEEN to be a surprise winner, and laughed quite a bit as Danny told his tale.  Although some American readers may get confused with some of the British dialog, I found myself laughing out loud, and read this one pretty fast. I think that most American readers should be able to get past the British English, and will enjoy this debut effort by Louise Wener. Wener has another book coming out this summer, which I intend to read.  This is a new author to watch for!	2005-03-20

THE SEASON OF LILLIAN DAWES by Katherine Mosby <br />March 17, 2005 <br /> <br /> <br />THE SEASON OF LILLIAN DAWES is going to be one of my favorite books for 2005. Beautifully written, the story is about Gabriel Gibbs who has just been kicked out of boarding school and is forced to live with his older brother (by ten years) Spencer in New York.  He is introduced to the life of high society and attends parties and other social events with his brother.  It is during this time spent in New York that Gabriel becomes aware of a woman named Lillian Dawes and he becomes obsessed with her.  It is more than just a crush. She is the center of his summer, but he also spends his time getting to know his eccentric Aunt Lavinia, who had just moved from Paris, studies under the tutelage of Spencer, and enjoys his time at cocktail parties and weekend soirees.  It is, in a way,  a coming of age book, with a twist. <br /> <br />Reading this book will remind many of THE GREAT GATSBY and other pieces of that time.  Mosby's writing is definitely not for the average reader, and this book is not a casual read.  Be prepared for some serious reading.  Those who are not focused on the book will most likely lose interest.  But if you are a reader that has the patience for highbrow narratives,  this book will definitely keep you entertained.  The mystery behind Lillian Dawes is the focal point of the last half of the book, and if nothing else, this should help the reader reach that last page.	2005-03-18

HARD EIGHT by Janet Evanovich <br />March 13, 2005  <br /> <br />Rating 4/5 stars <br /> <br />Here is another fun romp of a story featuring bounty hunter Stephanie Plum.  In Janet Evanovich's HARD EIGHT, Stephanie is still toying with the idea of having sex with Ranger (that awesome hunk of a bounty hunter that all women drool over) but she's also wondering what is up with Morelli, her \\"true love\\".  He hasn't called in a while, and she thinks she misses him. She's also helping out a neighbor of her parents', Mabel, whose daughter is missing and is asked to find her as a favor. This leads Stephanie into all sorts of trouble, and as usual her vehicles catch on fire (I think we count 3 in this novel, maybe 4). She's being chased down by the Easter Bunny, and masked men dressed up as Bill Clinton and Nixon. Only Stephanie can survive it all! As usual, I'm' recommending this one. It is always fun to return to one of Evanovich's Stephanie Plum books!	2005-03-13

THE LOVE OF A LAWMAN is the last book in this series of novels set in the small fictitious town of Callister, Idaho. They are all stand-alone books, with characters that crossover into all three novels, while each book centers on one or two particular characters. In this third novel, the main character is Isabelle \\"Izzy\\" Rondeau, a woman who had left Callister years ago. She ran away from a family life that was very dysfunctional when she was only a teenager, and now years later, she has returned, running away once again. This time, her long time \\"partner\\" and boyfriend has deserted her and their daughter Ava, for another woman, and she thinks that the best thing for Ava is to return to her hometown, where she can be near family. <br /> <br />The book opens with a scene that may break one's heart. Ten-year old Ava is crying out to her mother to come outside. Izzy runs out to her, and sees in the distance a gray shape, what she thinks is their dog Jack, lying on the neighbor's property across the fence. Izzy instantly knows that Jack is probably dead, and that the family's long time neighbor and enemy, Art Karadimos, has something to do with Jack's demise. It is a tearful opening but one that sets up the stage for the rest of the novel. Izzy is doing her best to make a living after her breakup with Billy, having left her home in Texas and coming all the way back to Idaho, and now dealing with people such as Art and the people in town who love to gossip about her. She wants desperately to make it on her own, raising cutting horses, but she isn't sure she can do it alone. With a lack of funds and people like Art on her back, she is having a hard time surviving, financially and emotionally. <br /> <br />Then, along comes Sheriff John Thomas Bradshaw, who also happens to be an old school mate of Izzy's.  When she contacts the sheriff to come out to the ranch to help her confront Art regarding the shooting of her dog, she finds out that the new sheriff is someone she grew up with. John sees Izzy, and remembers the big crush he had on her when they were in school, and how he wished that she had eyes for him. But back then, she only had eyes for Billy, who eventually fathered Ava. <br /> <br />Izzy does not want anyone's help, nor does she want to get involved with a man again.  She's been hurt by Ava's father and cannot afford to have another man come into her life, only to walk away from her and her daughter. However, John soon gets under her skin after he offers to help her out with her horses, and with seeing her every day, the sparks start to fly. <br /> <br />This reviewer really liked Anna Jeffrey's writing style. She did a good job with describing this fictitious town of Callister, and the world of rodeos and cutting horses. There were great characters as well, in particular, that of Isabelle. Izzy was painted as an independent, yet somewhat pigheaded and stubborn woman, who could not see that John had no ulterior motives. At the same time, the author showed her in a very natural light, as no one is perfect, and having a character with flaws as Izzy did make her that much more real. Her loyalty to her wayward brother, Paul, was also a plus in the story line. However, at times it did seem that there were too many things going on at once in this novel. On the other hand, the author handled the multiple plots very well, and kept this reader entertained and wanting more. For those who enjoy their romances with a hint of erotica, there were a number of very long and steamy sex scenes that were done very well. <br /> <br />This book definitely worked as a stand-alone novel in this trilogy, and this reviewer will be reading more by Anna Jeffrey in the future, including the rest of this series. THE LOVE OF A LAWMAN is highly recommended. <br /> <br />	2005-03-12

Robert the Bruce is King and is trying to unite Scotland as the clans fight amongst each other. Morganna's vow is to avenge the murder of her clan, the KilCreggars, who were attacked and killed off by the FitzHughs a number of years ago.    Taking place in the early 1300's, the novel starts with Morganna stealing weapons and other valuables off of a clan member of the FitzHugh, thinking that he is dead. Unfortunately, he is not and he gets up, grabs her and takes her prisoner. He doesn't treat her cruelly, but tells her that she will become his squire in order to pay him back for the \\"sett\\", or tartan outfit, he gives her to replace her tattered one that signified her own clan, the KilCreggars. Alexander FitzHugh, or Zander, doesn't realize he is dealing with a woman. He thinks that \\"Morgan\\" is a young man. He also thinks that Morgan stole the tartans she is wearing, so he is not aware that she's a KilCreggar.    Morgan initially thinks that Zander is the laird, or head of the clan, and so Morgan vows to find a way to kill him. While Morgan becomes Zander's squire, and they traipse across Scotland, she tries to figure out a way to take her revenge against the FitzHugh clan. In the meantime, Zander is picking up servants and maids along the way, surrounding him and Morgan with people loyal to the FitzHughs. Morgan, as part of her duty, uses her talents with various weapons to hunt and protect Zander and their group, and this immensely impresses Zander, as well as any person that witnesses it. Young maidens swoon at Morgan's feet, and young men glow with admiration. Morgan's skill with hitting targets is so incredible, that her legend spreads throughout Scotland.    The novel continues on in epic style, as they travel the country to help unite thepeople of Scotland. At the same time Zander cannot figure out why he is so attracted to his squire (he is afraid he has developed homosexual tendencies and a few times he goes away to do penance for his sins). His own brothers figure out the truth about Morgan much faster than Zander does (they claim he's the slow brother). Once Zander figures out that Morgan is really Morganna, the fireworks begin. Morgan had been attracted to Zander for quite some time, but she tells herself she would rather live the life of a man, and thinks she has no interest in being a feminine attractive woman. She soon finds out how wrong she was!    This book was pretty funny and for the most part was not a very serious tale, despite the themes of Robert the Bruce and the unification of Scotland. Jackie Ivie threw this reviewer for a loop, not being much of a fan for historical romances. It was a very enjoyable book, with wonderfully painted characters, and a lot of wit and humor on top of that. One thing that did stand out: the sex scenes, which lasted several pages a scene, were some of the best this reviewer has read. Sex scenes are one of the hardest things to write in any novel, including the romance, but Ivie made them work for her. They weren't embarrassing as some writers can make them, but felt very appropriate and \\"right on\\". There was nothing embarrassing about these scenes of intimacy between Zander and Morganna.    Overall, LADY OF THE KNIGHT is highly recommended by this reviewer for all readers of historical romances. In fact, any romance reader that enjoys romance with a twist of humor should enjoy this novel. This reviewer is looking forward to any future novels by Jackie Ivie.	2005-03-12

THE LANGUAGE OF SYCAMORES by Lisa Wingate<br /><br />March 11, 2005<br /><br />Courtesy of WWW.LOVEROMANCES.COM<br /><br />The third book in a trilogy by Lisa Wingate, THE LANGUAGE OF SYCAMORES is a beautifully written story about a woman who finds herself at a crossroads in life.<br /><br />Karen Sommerfield receives news that she is being laid off, despite years of loyalty and the fact that she helped build the company to what it is today.  She also receives bad news that a cancer that she thought she would not see again has returned.  Her doctor has asked her to make an appointment as soon as possible, as he thinks that the initial test results are pointing towards the return of this disease, but he is not one-hundred percent sure. Karen, not wanting to deal with this possibility, decides it's a good time to take up her sister Kate's invitation to return home to Missouri, in time for a small family reunion.<br /><br />Karen has not been home in ages. One of the reasons she has stayed away from her hometown was the death of Grandmother Rose two years ago. Rose was a big part of Karen's life, and her death was something Karen could not accept. Going home brings back many happy memories of a woman Karen had loved more than she had loved anyone. The thought of being in the home that reminded her so much of her beloved grandmother was difficult for Karen, but this was better than having to deal with the layoff and the possibility of cancer.<br /><br />The trip back home does Karen a lot of good. She realizes how much she's missed being there. She also meets a shy insecure twelve-year old girl who lives down the road with a grandmother and uncle. It is obvious that this girl, Dell, needs a lot of love and care, and while Karen has never had children of her own, she finds herself being motherly to Dell and they become very attached to each other.<br /><br />Besides getting involved with the young girl, Karen also becomes involved in a summer camp program called JUMP KIDS, and it changes her outlook on life as well as Dell's. It's a summer of fun and excitement and a newfound interest that has Karen looking forward to each day. It helps Karen forget about her lost job and her health concerns, and also opens up a brand new world.<br /><br />The central theme of the book is that of family ties, and while Karen's cancer scare and her job could have been the only focus of this book, instead the story also revolves around Grandmother Rose and the legacy she left behind.  Kate and Karen's relationship is also a central theme, with the two of them drifting apart due to different lives and focuses. Kate is busy with her children and a husband, having chosen the life of a housewife and homemaker.  Karen and James could not have children, and focused on their careers to forget what was missing in their lives.  There is also sibling rivalry and jealousy that keeps the two sisters apart, and it is their search for the truth about their family that brings them back together again.<br /><br />This reviewer extremely enjoyed and highly recommends THE LANGUAGE OF SYCAMORES. Wingate has a wonderful way with words, and one word to describe her writing is \\"beautiful\\".  She did a good job in setting up a backdrop that was the beauty and charm of the rural town of Hindsville, Missouri. She also has a talent for creating characters that are real and although they may have faults, the reader will want to spend more time with these fictional people, getting to know them better and wishing their story never ends.  What this reviewer did not care too much for was the abrupt ending, although it did help wrap up loose ends and also solved the family mystery.  It was in fact a plot twist of sorts and certainly surprised this reader.  THE LANGUAGE OF SYCAMORES is a must-read.  The first two books in the trilogy will certainly be on this reviewer's list of books to read in the coming year.JUMP KIDS, and it changes her outlook on life as well as Dell's. It's a summer of fun and excitement and a newfound interest that has Karen looking forward to each day. It helps Karen forget about her lost job and her health concerns, and also opens up a brand new world. <br /> <br />The central theme of the book is that of family ties, and while Karen's cancer scare and her job could have been the only focus of this book, instead the story also revolves around Grandmother Rose and the legacy she left behind.  Kate and Karen's relationship is also a central theme, with the two of them drifting apart due to different lives and focuses. Kate is busy with her children and a husband, having chosen the life of a housewife and homemaker.  Karen and James could not have children, and focused on their careers to forget what was missing in their lives.  There is also sibling rivalry and jealousy that keeps the two sisters apart, and it is their search for the truth about their family that brings them back together again. <br /> <br />This reviewer extremely enjoyed and highly recommends THE LANGUAGE OF SYCAMORES. Wingate has a wonderful way with words, and one word to describe her writing is \\"beautiful\\".  She did a good job in setting up a backdrop that was the beauty and charm of the rural town of Hindsville, Missouri. She also has a talent for creating characters that are real and although they may have faults, the reader will want to spend more time with these fictional people, getting to know them better and wishing their story never ends.  What this reviewer did not care too much for was the abrupt ending, although it did help wrap up loose ends and also solved the family mystery.  It was in fact a plot twist of sorts and certainly surprised this reader.  THE LANGUAGE OF SYCAMORES is a must-read.  The first two books in the trilogy will certainly be on this reviewer's list of books to read in the coming year.	2005-03-12

THE DEATH AND LIFE OF CHARLIE ST CLOUD by Ben Sherwood <br />March 11, 2005 <br /> <br />Courtesy of WWW.LOVEROMANCES.COM <br /> <br />One of the best books this reviewer has read so far in 2005, THE DEATH AND LIFE OF CHARLIE ST. CLOUD by Ben Sherwood tells the story of a young man and a young woman who both live their lives structured around loved ones who have passed away. <br /> <br />Charlie's childhood ended when he, his younger brother Sam, and their dog, Oscar died in an automobile accident when Charlie was fifteen. While the firemen/paramedics did what they could to save the two boys, only Charlie was resuscitated.  Through a miracle, Charlie was able to see his brother one last time before he returned to the land of the living, and promised Sam that he will forever be there for Sam and will continue to watch over him. <br /> <br />Charlie spends the next thirteen years working for the local cemetery in order to be close to his brother's grave. His relationship with his brother does not end with the car accident, as the reader will soon discover.  It is a magical gift that Charlie has received, and he does his best not to lose this unearthly gift. <br /> <br />Tess Carroll, a young woman who had lost her father a few years back, obsesses over sailing solo around the world. She does what she can to avoid thinking about her father, who was taken too early in life.  During a major storm, she is sailing her boat and it is hard to believe that she has come through alive. The next scene finds that Tess is at her father's grave, as if the previous storm had never happened. <br /> <br />While at the cemetery, Tess meets Charlie, and after chatting for a bit, they set up a date for dinner. The two find that they are soul mates. However, Charlie soon hears bad news about Tess, and it shatters whatever feeling of hope for the future he might have had. <br /> <br />THE DEATH AND LIFE OF CHARLIE ST. CLOUD is a book full of magical events and the wonder of life beyond death.  Some readers may find this story a bit too ethereal, quite like the novel THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN by Mitch Albom, or even THE LOVELY BONES by Alice Sebold.  All three books are quite different in how the topic of death and the afterlife are approached.  However, if one enjoyed THE FIVE PEOPLE or THE LOVELY BONES, they will certainly love THE DEATH AND LIFE OF CHARLIE ST. CLOUD. Ben Sherwood is truly one of the more imaginative authors we have today, and this reviewer is definitely going to read his debut novel, THE MAN WHO ATE THE 747. <br /> <br />	2005-03-12

It is the story of two families whose lives are shaped by the birth and subsequent adoption of a baby girl.  <br /> <br />The book reads like two separate books at one point. It's the story of Andie, who gives away her baby at birth, not telling the father that she had been pregnant.  Andie moved away as soon as she learned about her pregnancy, not wanting to ruin her boyfriend Cole's life with an unwanted baby.  Twenty years later, she is returning home for a high school reunion, where she eventually tells her story to Cole and Tammy, who was her best friend.  <br /> <br />Her story is told from the day her baby is taken, to her marriage to Freddie La Rue and the birth of their two children Dana and Jerry.  Then comes the story of Dana, and how she resents living in the shadow of this older sibling, \\"Shannon\\", thinking her mother only cares about the missing baby, and not about her own husband or children.  <br /> <br />The biggest part of the novel is the story of the Carsons, a very wealthy family that spans several generations of ambitious men and controlling women.  This story leads to Zoe, who is adopted by Diane and Jay. <br /> <br />While the story itself was interesting, the way this book was structured did not help to make this book a readable story.  Separating out the two families as if they were different novels made the read frustrating at times.  What kept this reader going was the story of Zoe.  Her story alone could have been it's own book, while the story of Andie and Dana could have been saved for another one.  I'm giving this book 3 stars since there were characters that I felt were worth reading about, but the overall story was not well written and could have been better. With that said, anyone looking for a realistic view of adoption will not find it here.  It made for a good story, but was not 100% believable.	2005-03-12

THE DUEL by Barbara Metzger <br />March 11, 2005 <br /> <br />Courtesy of WWW.LOVEROMANCES.COM <br /> <br />THE DUEL by Barbara Metzger was yet another fun Regency romance that this reviewer has had the pleasure to read in the past few months.  <br /> <br />In THE DUEL, Ian, the earl of Marden, finds himself facing the husband of one of his lovers, Lady Paige, in a duel to the death. Lord Paige, fortunately, was a bad shot, but he also wasn't above cheating by shooting toward Ian's back before the count of three. When Ian's wild shot intentionally goes into the trees to scare Lord Paige, it hits a young innocent boy that happened to be riding his horse nearby. Lord Paige runs away, and Ian goes to the boy and takes him to his estate, along with the boy's sister Athena. Ian lets them stay with him while the boy, Troy, recovers from his injuries. Ian is filled with guilt and will do anything to make sure that Troy gets all the medical attention he needs. <br /> <br />What then follows is a complication that Ian does not need.  Athena is not a girl, as Ian thought at first, but was really a young woman of nineteen years, and it becomes quite scandalous among the public knowing that she is living with a man in his home without an appropriate chaperone. Ian tries to right this wrong, but no matter what he comes up with to fix the problem, he finds himself even worse off than before. When his mother suggests that he wed the young gal to stop the ton from gossiping, he is not sure Athena will go for it. <br /> <br />This is the first Regency this reviewer has read by Barbara Metzger. Last year's contemporary novel LOVE, LOUISA was very enjoyable, but one can certainly see why she's won awards for her Regencies after reading THE DUEL. THE DUEL was not only funny and witty, as the best of Regencies can be, but the story line was thought out very well. There was never any scene that felt out of place, nor were there long drawn out chapters that could have been edited out.  Ian's best friend, Carswell, was the icing on the cake, as he added so much comedy to the story that this reviewer could not help but chuckle. Carswell dressed in drag to pretend to be a chaperone for Athena was classic. <br /> <br />With that said, this reviewer highly recommends THE DUEL to all Regency fans, but also to any fan of romance novels that enjoys a little comedy in between the romance. <br /> <br />	2005-03-12

THE OTHER WOMAN by Jane Green <br />March 12, 2005 <br /> <br />Here is yet another Jane Green novel that I loved.  THE OTHER WOMAN tells the story of Ellie and Dan Cooper's marriage, and the other woman in Ellie's life, her mother-in-law.   <br /> <br />Ellie starts out in her relationship with Linda Cooper as friends, and is so excited that she is finally having a mother figure in her life.  However, the more she gets to know Linda, the worse things get.  Linda is a very controlling woman, and this becomes very apparent during the wedding preparations.  And if that wasn't bad enough, things get worse when Ellie becomes pregnant with her first child.  Ellie feels that if only Dan supported her, she could deal with his mother, but Dan in fact thinks that Ellie is being childish and is overreacting.  <br /> <br />While the book starts off on a very humurous note, as things get worse for Ellie and Dan, the tone turns quite different.  Ellie and Dan's marraige is now on the rocks and it doesn't look like anything can save their marraige. <br /> <br />I really loved this book, as I have with most of the books by Jane Green.  With the exception of BOOKENDS, I think Jane Green's novels are worth reading and will make fan out of anyone.  THE OTHER WOMAN comes highly recommended by the Ratmammy.	2005-03-12

THIRTY NOTHING by Lisa Jewell<br /><br />March 9, 2005<br /><br />THIRTY NOTHING was a fun chick lit book whose plot reminded me of ROSIE DUNNE by Cecelia Ahern, which I had just read last month, but THIRTY NOTHING is so much better. THIRTY NOTHING is about two friends, Dig and Nadine, who spend the last 10 years dating other people, when in fact it's really each other that they want. Neither can admit to this, because they both think the other doesn't care about each other in THAT way.  It's a series of miscommunications that keeps them apart.<br /><br />But, what could be better for two best friends who are attracted to each other to become romantically involved?<br /><br />Dig and Nadine are both brand new thirty-year-olds, and both comment on how neither has had a real committed relationship. That's when Dig's old love, Delilah, shows up after being out of his life for about ten years, and Nadine does something rash by contacting her old boyfriend Phil, who had left her mysteriously one day without any explanations. There are a lot of misunderstandings that break apart Dig and Nadine's friendship at one point or another, a friendship that had lasted since childhood, but it takes the reappearance of both Delilah and Phil to help make both Dig and Nadine realize who they really love.<br /><br />The Ratmammy highly recommends THIRTY NOTHING as one of the best chick lit books ever written.  It's fun, yet works on more than one level.  It's the story of true friendship and true love.	2005-03-09

The stories of the two main characters, Paris Hightower and her mother Ebony Hightower are told almost as two separate stories, starting first with Paris's story as a young overweight teenager, trying to find some self-confidence in her life. Unfortunately her story almost disappears once Ebony's story, that of a woman on the run from the law, takes front stage. While the author did a good job with creating vividly real characters, there was much work needed on the plot.<br /><br />In brief, the story was about two women, mother and daughter, who start out with not much hope of having their dreams come true, and then years later, they are accomplishing just that.  However, some things stand in the way for both these women, with Ebony Hightower's story ending the novel.<br /><br />While this book rated two stars from the Ratmammy, a good idea would have been to either make this book a two book series, focusing on only one woman at a time, or write the story line a little bit tighter. The author shows promise. A BREATH AWAY FROM SLEEP, however, could have been a lot better.	2005-03-07

Julio Santana is of Puerto Rican descent, living in Spanish Harlem.  He makes a living in construction, but at the same time he's also being paid to burn down buildings, as part of an insurance scam.  He makes good money, people get their insurance money, and everyone is happy.  But Julio is tired of the lies and the destruction, and wants out.  He goes to school at night to better himself, and tells his \\"boss\\", Eddie, that he has done his last building and refuses to burn another. Eddie, however, isn't too happy about Julio's plans, and threatens him.    While this is one theme in CHANGO'S FIRE, there are other things that are going on while Julio tries to change his life. There are many colorful characters that reside in Julio's neighborhood, and many are trying to make a change for the better.  There's Maritza, the radical crazy lady that runs a church to spout off her political beliefs.  She hands out condoms and teaches the immigrants about abortion and birth control. There's Papelito, the (...) Santero priest, who is also trying to help those in the neighborhood that come to him. And there is Helen, who Julio finds a deep attraction for, maybe because she is not of this neighborhood and is someone that represents something that is out of reach for him, because of his color.    CHANGO'S FIRE was not an easy read.  The themes in the book were rather complex, and of a nature that some may not care to read about.  I found the character of Julio quite a departure from the type of persons I read about in fiction, and questioned often if what he did for a living truly happens?  Arson is nothing new, but to read about it as if it was someone's every day job felt very different from what I know in my own world.  I think that is why this book will probably stand out for me for a long time.  I'm giving this book four stars, but I don't recommend thebook to everyone.  It's not your every day average read.	2005-02-26

Anderson<br /><br />February 25, 2005<br /><br />I recently read FINDING SALLIQ by Robert L. Anderson and was pleasantly surprised.  It was a well-written novel that centered on a young Black American by the name of Salliq Washington, who was in his twenties, and did not seem to have any goal or objective in life.  He had a good job in the technology industry, but didn't always take it seriously, and a fantastic girlfriend that his family loved, and so did he, but for some reason he was having a hard time committing to her.<br /><br />While the writing reminded me a lot of Eric Jerome Dickey, Anderson has a distinct style.  I really enjoyed reading this book, being a fan of African-American lit, but I also think this book may attract other readers as well. Anderson does a good job with his characters, which is often difficult to do. While some may think the people populating this novel were stereotypical, I didn't feel that way at all and enjoyed getting to know the various friends and family of Salliq.  Traci, his current girlfriend, was the perfect girl to bring home to mother, while Rehnay was the girl that you don't bring home to mother. Salliq's roommates were also a lot of fun, and his co-worker Jimbo, one of the few White male characters in this story, was a hoot.  He drove Salliq up the wall, which made for good comedy entertainment.<br /><br />Salliq doesn't know it at first, but he's at a point in his life in which things will change.  Change isn't always bad, and although things don't always go his way, at the end he finds what he's looking for, and his life turns around.  I'm leaving that up to the reader to find out what it was, but it did throw me.  I had no idea this was coming.<br /><br />I'm giving this book four stars, and found FINDING SALLIQ worth my reading time.	2005-02-26

THE BACHELORETTE PARTY by Karen Mccullah Lutz <br />February 18, 2005 <br /> <br />THE BACHELORETTE PARTY by Karen McCullah Lutz was one of the funniest books I have read in some time.  Zadie Roberts is high school teacher at a very exclusive school, who was dumped by her famous actor fianc at the altar.  Her best friend, Grey, is engaged to her cousin Helen, who she cannot stand, and the only man she is interested in is one of her students, Trevor, who also happens to be a model.   <br /> <br />The novel focuses on the days right before the wedding, and for the most part, the day of the Bachelorette party.  Zadie is invited to be one of the bridesmaids, to her horror, and she has to spend an entire day with Helen and her boring friends.  A day is planned with teas, shopping, yoga, and other \\"girly\\" events.  Per Grey's request, however, Zadie is supposed to help \\"loosen\\" up Helen, who is normally uptight, and by the end of the day, Helen is so loose that Zadie thinks she's witnessed her cousin getting it on with another man. Does Zadie tell Grey, or does she keep her mouth shut? <br /> <br />My review doesn't go into detail, but the antics of the women are just hilarious!  Zadie is one over-sexed woman, constantly thinking and lusting after Trevor, although she KNOWS he's far too young for her at eighteen years.  On the other hand... <br /> <br />This book is not for the very prudish. However, if you are looking for some really lighthearted fun with a lot of sexual innuendo, this book is for you.	2005-02-19

THE BEACHCOMBER by Josephine Cox <br />February 19, 2005 <br /> <br />THE BEACHCOMBER by Josephine Cox is the second book I've read by this author, and so far I am enjoying her books.  Her books are rather deceiving, however. She tends to take her time in developing characters and settings but once you get past that, her stories become somewhat intense and often times it is hard to put down her novels.  She comes up with interesting plot twists that border on the soap-operaish, but with that said, I still feel her books are worth reading.  If you want to be entertained and sink your teeth into a book, this could be it. <br /> <br />Kathy Wilson and Tom Marcus meet when the two of them move to West Bay for the same reasons - to start a new life and contemplate the old.  Kathy is mourning the death of her father, and her mother and sister do everything they can to make her life miserable.  Tom is mourning the deaths of his wife and two children, who he thinks were murdered.  He moves to West Bay to figure out how he can take revenge.  <br /> <br />When they do eventually meet, neither of them knows the other's history, and they do their best to keep their personal lives out of their relationship, at least in the beginning.  In the meantime, Tom has the police back home working on the murder case, while Kathy learns about her father's life in West Bay, where he found happiness with his lover, Liz.  <br /> <br />The novel continues at a slow but gentle pace but speeds up as the mystery of Tom's family's death begins to unravel, and Kathy begins to deal with her despicable family, her mother and sister, who seem to only care about material things.  Other characters also come into play, such as the friends Kathy makes in the village, her neighbor Jasper, who becomes such an important person to both herself and Tom, as well as her evil mother Irene and sister Samantha. <br /> <br /> <br />This book gets four stars from the Ratmammy.  It's not for everyone, but is aimed atromance readers and those who enjoy romantic suspense.  It's not as fast paced as some readers may expect, but I think Josephine Cox's books are well worth the time spent reading.	2005-02-19

Throughout the years, Rosie Dunne and Alex Stewart are best friends who find that at some point in their lives, are falling in love with the other.  Of course neither of them knows how the other feels.  In the mean time, their story is told through notes, emails and letters sent to each other or by friends and family.  <br /> <br />While this method of story-telling has worked with other novels, most notably with THE BOY NEXT DOOR by Meg Cabot, it doesn't quite work as well in ROSIE DUNNE. While the plot line works quite well and is very entertaining, the letters themselves were sometimes too wordy to feel real. The author should have told the story in a different way, as the letters and emails in this book took away from the enjoyment of the story as a whole. I did find the ending to be satisfactory and I do not regret reading the book, but I think I would have enjoyed it more if it had been written differently.  ROSIE DUNNE gets a recommendation from me, with a warning to those who may find the letter writing somewhat tedious at times.	2005-02-12

The Wicked Lover by Julia Ross <br />February 10, 2005 <br /> <br />Courtesy of WWW.loveromances.com <br /> <br />Julia Ross's THE WICKED LOVER is more than just a well written historical romance. Filled with espionage and intrigue, the novel combines elements of romance and mystery to arrive at a winning story. <br /> <br />Sylvie Georgiana works for the Duke of Yveshire, a man of considerable wealth and power. For money, she does him favors by spying on the ton, and in this novel her current assignment is to dig up whatever she can on Robert Dovenby, whose origins are in some doubt. The book opens with \\"Dove\\", as he is called by most, in the middle of a trying scene, where his now former lover Lady Margaret (Meg), Countess of Grenham, is tossing out his clothes and into a bonfire. It was her not-so-subtle way of letting him and the public know that their affair was over, and they were no longer an item. In the meantime, \\"George\\", Sylvie's latest persona, is tied to the bed in Dove's home. It is truly a spectacular beginning to a promising story.  <br /> <br />As the novel continues to deliver its tale, the momentum does not quit. Filled with romance, excitement and mystery, the reader has to guess whether Dove is truly the evil man Yveshire claims he is, or is Dove the honest and giving man that Sylvie sees him as. Yveshire's hatred for Dove is all consuming, and Sylvie's allegiance to the Duke conflicts with what she knows of Dove. The more she gets to know Dove, the more she sees that he's charitable, honest and not the evil man depicted by the Duke. And the longer she is acquainted with this handsome rogue, as she is now his hired secretary, she finds herself deeply attracted to Dove. <br /> <br />Witty repartee can be found between \\"George\\" and Dove, and for quite some time Sylvie thinks that Dove has no idea she's really a woman. However, Dove suspects from the very beginning that this young \\"man\\" is nothing more than a woman in disguise. For what reason, however, Dove cannot figure out. But he goes along with the ruse, pretending as long as he can that she is a person of the male gender. It's a joke on Sylvie, as Dove brings Sylvie along with him on outings that would truly be fit only for a man. <br /> <br />Their lives are soon in danger, as they find that there is someone in their midst that is working for the \\"other side\\". Dove could easily be tried for treason, and they now need to find out who is the traitor. The ending will reveal who is really the bad guy and who are the good guys, and the reader will be satisfied with the conclusion. <br /> <br />THE WICKED LOVER comes highly recommended. A complex plot, smart characters, and the backdrop of the life of the ton, the fan of historical romances will find this novel worth reading. Julia Ross has a gift for writing a unique type of romance novel, and this reviewer plans on reading more by her in the future. <br /> <br />	2005-02-11

Double Trouble by Claire Cross <br />February 10, 2005 <br /> <br />Courtesy of WWW.Loveromances.com <br /> <br />DOUBLE TROUBLE by Claire Cross opens with what looks to be an advice column. \\"Hot_Chic\\" needs advice on going to a funeral versus meeting Mr. Right. \\"Aunt Mary's\\" reply is to wear \\"something sleek and black\\" in case the heir of the deceased needs solace, and thus begins the story of Marylys O'Reilly, the protagonist of this novel, a spin-off to Cross's 2001 book THIRD TIME LUCKY. <br /> <br />In DOUBLE TROUBLE, Marylys is a computer geek who among other things writes an advice column through the Internet. Her twin sister has just left her husband, James Coxwell, a very handsome and successful lawyer, and two pre-adolescent sons. So, how does Marylys fit in with this story? At first it wasn't apparent what she had to do with James and Marcia Coxwell, and that made the first half of the book very frustrating for this reviewer. Marylys reacts to her brother-in-law James (and vice versa) with such chemistry and near-passion that this reader questioned why one would like or even admire Marylys, who as the main character of this contemporary romance, spent a lot of her time flirting with her own brother-in-law. It didn't make any sense at all, since it seemed that the author started out by painting Marylys as a likeable person, yet Marylys was doing something so heinous as to go after her sister's husband when Marcia had just left him. It didn't matter that Marylys and her twin Marcia had a very strained relationship. The fact that Marylys was the main character almost dictates that going after one's sister's husband was not something she should have been doing, at least in the eyes of the romance reader. <br /> <br />After halfway through the story, the reasons for this character's aberration becomes clear to the reader. Marylys' personality and behavior was based on an event in her life that happened years ago, before James had even met her sister. With thisone event, everything changes Marylys in the eyes of the reader. This reviewer was able to breathe a little better, knowing that the protagonist was not as shady as she was starting to appear, but despite the explanation, it may have been better if the reader wasn't left in such suspense for so long. The problem with the main character in a romance seeming to have such an attraction toward her sister's husband may anger and turn off some readers, as it did this reviewer. If this secret was revealed sooner, instead of taking up half the book, this reviewer feels the book would have been much better.  <br /> <br />Another problem with this book was the dialogue. A lot of the dialogue just did not read right, in that when the reader goes from one person to the next in a conversation, it felt as if the same person was speaking the entire time, with the author just changing the names in between quotes. The conversations were often boring, or irrelevant to the story. <br /> <br />The same can be said about the whole section about the \\"Ariadnes\\", a group of women that Marylys met with once a month. Although it is understood that these women were a somewhat important element in Marylys' life, and they also helped to explain some of her character traits, the group for the most part was really an unnecessary addition to the plot line. If they had been left out of the book, the novel would not have lost anything. There were many parts of the book that felt extraneous, and better editing may have made a better book. <br /> <br />On the other hand, there were some fun characters in DOUBLE TROUBLE. The relationship between the two sisters, although most of it was \\"off camera\\", was a great idea, albeit not original. This reviewer would have enjoyed seeing more of this relationship. The two sons of James and Marcia were also a welcome addition to the cast of characters, and should have been utilized more. The same goes for Connor O'Reiley, Marylys and Marcia's widowed father, whowas cantankerous and yet lovable at the same time. And Meg, Marylys' best friend, was a hoot! <br /> <br />With that said, this reviewer is giving DOUBLE TROUBLE a three-star rating, despite the negative aspects of the novel. There were enough positive things that made up for it, mainly interesting and fun characters that are often what makes a romance work. A little bit of editing would have made this a four-star book and a much enjoyable read.	2005-02-11

Miss Whitlow's Turn by Jenna Mindel <br />February 10, 2005 <br /> <br />Courtesy of WWW.loveromances.com <br /> <br />This was a fun regency romp written by Jenna Mindel. MISS WHITLOW'S TURN is the story of George Clasby, as he desperately seeks a way to clean up his reputation. He is known to have flings with married women, and now that he sees many of his friends marrying and settling down, he realizes he wants the same thing too. Unfortunately, his reputation is well known, and no single woman that is of a decent background wants to be associated with him. <br /> <br />George comes upon a brilliant plan to call on Miss Harriet Whitlow, who is now out on her third season and has been known to turn down suitors left and right. He has no desire to settle down with her, but they have already been acquainted and he thinks this is an easy way to ease his way back into respectable society. Since Harriet is highly respected in society, anyone associated with her would surely be accepted into society as well. <br /> <br />Harriet, on the other hand, has had her eye on George ever since they had met during her first season. When George turns his attentions on her, she is overjoyed and cannot believe her luck. Unfortunately, her father hates George and will not have his daughter wed to someone of the likes of him. Instead, he has chosen for his daughter Lord Grafton, a man that Harriet finds boring and annoying and she needs to find a way to get rid of him before she is stuck with him for life! Can she find a way to stop Grafton from proposing to her and at the same time win over George's heart? <br /> <br />Very fun reading! Any one who loves romances and has yet to try out a regency romance needs to read this one. This reviewer really enjoys the humor that often comes with these regencies, and MISS WHITLOW'S TURN was no exception. Very humorous and well written, with characters that felt very real and not just stereotypical people from this era. MISS WHITLOW'S TURN is highly recommended to lovers of regencies, and those who have yet to read one.  <br /> <br />	2005-02-11

Mei Lu Ling has just been promoted to lieutenant, and her current assignment is to work with an insurance investigator on missing ancient Chinese antiques. It doesn't help that her family has been in the Chinese antique business for quite some time, and in the back of her mind she is worried that one of her family members may be involved with the thefts, as well as two murders tied to the missing items. Mei Lu is a no-nonsense cop, and will have to involve her family in this investigation. However, she is not sure she will be able to do a good job, knowing how disappointed her parents are that she did not stay in the antique business. She wishes that they will take her off the case and replace her with someone impartial. <br /> <br />When Mei Lu gets to know Cullen Archer, the insurance investigator assigned to this project and who is also a patron in the Houston art world, she finds herself attracted to him. Does she let business and pleasure mix, or will she shut him out in order to solve her case? Mei Lu's other friends in the academy have all met their significant others, but she seems to be married to her job. She refuses to let Cullen distract her, feeling that this is very unprofessional on her part. However, their feelings are mutual, and Mei Lu does her best to keep him at bay, while Cullen does his best to convince her that they need to give each other a chance. <br /> <br />As always, Roz Denny Fox does not fail to write a romance with something more. She tends to create characters that are fun to read about and get to know, and this reviewer was especially pleased to find that she included an Asian as her main character. As an Asian American, this reviewer was able to relate to Mei Lu's attitudes and her relationship with her family. The ending may catch most readers by surprise, which is the reason why this romance can be called a \\"romance with something more\\". This is not your standard romantic novel, but that is what the Superromance line is all about. They are romance books that go beyond the category. <br /> <br />Readers who enjoy this book should definitely seek out the rest of the series, Women in Blue: THE PARTNER by Kay David, THE CHILDREN'S COP by Sherry Lewis, THE WITNESS by Linda Style, and HER LITTLE SECRET by Anna Adams. The final entry to this series will be published in March and is entitled A MOTHER'S VOW, by K.N. Casper.  <br /> <br />With that said, SHE WALKS THE LINE was a highly enjoyable Harlequin Superromance for fans of this genre of contemporary romances. This reviewer recommends it with both thumbs up. <br /> <br />	2005-02-11

The marketing blurbs allude that Ms. Carpentier actually exists, with the story being based on a diary that Mr. Allen discovered on a trip to Denmark. This reviewer did not find any references of Carpentier on the Internet and is wondering if indeed this woman is a work of fiction. Nevertheless, the story of Maximilienne Carpentier, be it fiction or fact, is very fascinating, and will be remembered by this reviewer for quite some time. <br /> <br />THE ISLANDER may remind the reader of classics such as Robinson Crusoe or The Swiss Family Robinson, both of which are stories about survival in an environment that is mostly inhospitable to the average European of that time. THE ISLANDER takes place in the last half of the 1800's, at a time when France is going through political unrest. The three Carpentiers live on an unknown island alone, an island that the reader will discover that by legal rights belongs to Phillipe Carpentier, Maximilienne's father. The three live a comfortable life on that island despite the lack of \\"modern\\" conveniences, and have no desire to return to civilization. With the help of supplies that are delivered to them every few months by a mutual friend, Captain Claude Besson, it seems that the Carpentiers have the best of all worlds. <br /> <br />While her parents grew up in France, young Maximilienne does not know what it is like to live outside their tropical island, but her parents do everything they can to prepare their child in case they ever return to civilization. They teach her to read and write, and do their best to teach her about society and what would be expected of her in certain social situations. They also are in contact with the outside world through newspapers that Besson brings tothem on his visits, and so Maximilienne is fully aware of the geography of the world, as well as current events and politics. <br /> <br />However, this novel is not only a tale of survival. When Maximilienne is left to fend for herself after the decease of her parents, she finds herself at the mercy of her uncle's shrewd wife, Camille, and seeks help from the kind Captain Besson. Her life soon changes for the worst, and her life now depends on her cunning and instincts. <br /> <br />While the novel is touted as being a true story of a young woman's attempt at survival on an uninhabited island during the 1800's, one may or may not believe that any of these events had come to pass. The author did his research and felt assured that some of the important references in Ms. Carpentier's diary did match up to historical facts, thus validating the diary that this book is based upon. This reviewer was caught up in the story and found she thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is quite possible that Maximilienne Carpentier may not have existed as John Allen thinks she did, but that is not what this reviewer is contesting. The story in itself was worth reading, and was a novel that was well written and well structured. It had all the elements that make a story a readable book. At the same time, the characters were likeable, including the \\"bad guys\\", and with the plot being fast paced, it was quite easy to read this book in only a few days. Overall, this reviewer is giving THE ISLANDER four stars. <br /> <br />	2005-02-11
353278:US	51214937	R3TR3R3F1J3Q5B	0373274114	442380700	Close To The Edge (Silhouette Intimate Moments No. 1341)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Close to the edge....	Close to the Edge by Kylie Brant <br />February 10, 2005 <br /> <br />Courtesy of WWW.Loveromances.com <br /> <br />Kylie Brant's CLOSE TO THE EDGE is a romance written with humor, danger, intrigue, and sexy love scenes that will steam up the windows, helping to bring in the New Year with a Bang! <br /> <br />Jacey (Jacinda) Wheeler grew up among the high society of New Orleans, but when she decided a few years ago to open up a private investigation business, her mother considered it only a \\"hobby\\". Jacey, however, was very excited about this venture, and as soon as she hired Luc \\"Lucky\\" Boucher, her business took off. His background did not turn up any police records, but Jacey knew his previous life was not even close to the life she was used to leading with the rich and beautiful. Lucky was sexy and dangerous, with street smarts and the ability to turn a woman's head. Jacey knew not to get too involved with him, except in a business relationship. Until now, that is. <br /> <br />The book opens with a scene in a pool hall, and it immediately grabs the reader's attention with the feel of something \\"going down\\". A beautiful blonde is sitting innocently at the bar, while Lucky is playing a game of pool and keeping an eye on her. While she is innocently attracting men at the bar, Lucky is busy with his friend Remy and a shady character that is trying to cheat him at pool. An altercation arises, but Lucky has it under control. Surprisingly, the blonde, Jacey, knows how to handle men in rough situations. Although Lucky comes to her rescue while two men are fighting over her, she gets out of the bar untouched after she rams her knee into the groin of one of the men. <br /> <br />Next scene: It's a few hours later, and Jacey is contemplating what to wear to a fancy dinner being held that evening by the Sisters of the South Auxiliary, an affair that her mother is expecting her to attend, and Jacey is already running behind. It is the stark contrast between her two worlds that this reviewer found of most interest and feels that it is what helped make the story line move. Jacey's business life with Lucky does not mix with her family life, which was comprised of fancy dinners and mingling with the upper crust. The life of the rich is not what Jacey wanted, however; yet she was able to fit in both worlds when she had to. <br /> <br />Lucky, on the other hand, stood out at fancy dinner parties. The reader sees this when Lucky invites himself as Jacey's date when she is asked to attend her ex-fianc's engagement party to his new fiance. Not only does Lucky's presence invite stares by the other partygoers, but also his dark and sexy looks have all the women swooning. And he does his best to pretend that he and Jacey are an item, which causes more than one set of eyebrows to lift, and irritates Jacey to no end. At the same time, she feels an attraction to him, which she fights with everything she's got. <br /> <br />The rapport between Jacey and Lucky will have the reader chuckling. The two of them go at it in nearly every scene, giving this book more of a humorous tone. They squabble and argue, but yet at the same time there is sexual tension between the two. They both try to resist each other, knowing that getting romantically involved is the worst thing either one can do. How long they can keep their hands off each other is up to the reader to find out. <br /> <br />Fast paced, funny, and smartly written, CLOSE TO THE EDGE is a winner. Those who enjoy reading Silhouette and Harlequin series romances are going to find this book is going to be one of the better novels they will read in 2005. Brant knows how to create characters that a reader will enjoy getting to know; she also knows how to write a good sex scene, which this reviewer has found is possibly one of the most hardest things to write in a romance novel. This reviewer highly recommends this book to all those who enjoy this genre. <br /> <br />	2005-02-11

SOPHIE AND THE RISING SUN by Augusta Trobaugh <br /> <br />February 6, 2005 <br /> <br />What a wonderful book!  I read this book in nearly one day and loved every page. SOPHIE AND THE RISING SUN by Augusta Trobaugh is the star crossed love story of Sophie and Mr. Oto, who because of the time era, are destined never to fulfill their dreams of being together.   <br /> <br />It is WWII, and Mr. Oto is the gardener for Miss Anne, while Sophie is a middle-aged spinster who happens to be Miss Anne's oldest friend.  The book delves into Sophie's history, narrated by Miss Anne, who has known her since she was a baby.  We see Sophie's life through Anne's eyes, and learn about the love she lost in WWII and the reason why she never married.  Sophie never thought she would love again. Instead, she took care of her aging mother and two elderly aunts, and felt this was her lot in life. <br /> <br />Mr. Oto's story is told through his point of view, in the third person.  The reader will learn how he made his way to Georgia unintentionally and why he never left.  He has no friends or family in Salty Creek, but he has no intentions of returning to California.  When he finally meets Sophie, he finds that she is different from the other women in town, and he finds himself drawn to her. <br /> <br />When the Japanese invade Pearl Harbor, their worlds are changed forever.  The fact that Mr. Oto is Japanese is significant, and fortunately the townspeople do not know (yet) that he is.  They all think he is Chinese. Only Sophie knows Mr. Oto's true ethnicity, and both she and Miss Anne are worried for his life.  What happens next is up to the reader to find out.   <br /> <br />I greatly enjoyed SOPHIE AND THE RISING SUN.  I am definitely picking up her other books.  Ms Trobaugh has an obvious talent for writing, and did a great job with depicting her characters to make them feel as real and authentic as they should. SOPHIE AND THE RISING SUN is highly recommended by the Ratmamy.	2005-02-07

They are torn apart due to a \\"tradition\\" held in Tita's family that the youngest daughter is destined to live out her life taking care of her mother.  Tita and Pedro have already declared their love for each other, but Mama Elena has other plans.  Instead, Pedro marries an older sister, Rosaura, who he does not love at all, but he feels this is the closest he will ever get to his beloved Tita.   <br /> <br />Each chapter begins with a Mexican recipe, and the chapters themselves are written as if for a cookbook, except in-between the instructions on how to make \\"mole\\", or how to cook Quail in Rose Petal sauce, Tita's story is told, narrated by an unnamed grandniece. It is the sad, yet sometimes humorous story of Tita's life, and how she is frustrated living as the youngest daughter in the house of De La Garza.  Tita's father has been long deceased, and Mama Elena is the head of the household. She rules with a heavy hand and all live in fear of her.  Tita, however, is the rebellious child, and is often beaten and punished for the simplest of things.  Her biggest punishment is when Mama Elena declares that Tita will not be allowed to marry her love, Pedro, and instead Tita watches her sister take her place.   <br /> <br />Her emotions are somehow transmitted to her cooking. By this time of her life, Tita is relegated to head cook, and she is good at it.  But the pain and unhappiness she feels is now tasted in her cooking.  At her sister's wedding, the guests become sick because of how Tita feels as she cooks the banquet feast.  This is but one example where Tita's cooking seems to become more than just a meal, sending her own emotions into the food that she is cooking.  I loved this element of magical realism, and I'm finding that the more I read books by Hispanic authors, the more sure I will be that I will encounter it.   <br /> <br />As many books written by Latin American authors, LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE spans many years, and although it is quite a short book, it does tell the story of two lives that are forever linked through love.  I haven't seen the movie yet, but I hear it is just as good as the book.  LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE is highly recommended by the Ratmammy.	2005-02-05

THE SHADOW OF THE WIND plays two roles - it's the title of this book by Carlos Ruiz Zafon, as well as the title of a book by Julian Carax, a character in this book by Zafon who becomes a focal point in the life of young Daniel Sempere.<br /><br />Daniel is taken by his father to a secret place known as \\"The Cemetery of Forgotten Books\\" and finds the only book still available by Julian Carax. What Daniel wants to know is why all of Julian Carax's books have disappeared, and he spends his days and nights trying to solve the mystery. The more involved he gets, the more he finds himself in danger for his life. Along with his best friend Fermin, Daniel takes it upon himself, against the advice of more than one person, to find out what happened to Julian and the books that he had written over the years. Who was destroying the books?  And who was Julian?<br /><br />The charm of this book is not just the dual stories of Daniel and Julian, but the many characters that fill the pages. Larger than life personalities, they add to the fantastic story that builds into the climax, a twist of an ending which I did not see coming. The book is rather long, but I think that anyone that can finish this book will find that they will find satisfaction with it.  It was well worth my time, and I hope to read other books by this author. THE SHADOW OF THE WIND shows what good story telling is all about.	2005-02-05
373462:US	51214937	R24ZCHV3DEN1WH	0316780375	480327121	The Weight of Water	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Another great story from Anita Shreve	THE WEIGHT OF WATER by Anita Shreve <br />January 24, 2005 <br /> <br />The WEIGHT OF WATER by Anita Shreve is two stories in one.  The main character, Jean, is a photographer that is covering a story about an 1800's murder that took place on an island off the coast of Maine.  The Isle of Shoals is the setting for both stories, since the second story told is that of the murders.  The narrator for the 1800's setting is Maren, the woman that survived the murders.  The two stories parallel each other, yet both stories are as different as they could be, at least on the surface.  <br /> <br />The story that takes place in the past revolves around a set of Norwegian immigrants, and the reader knows from the start that it will lead to murder.  The present day story centers on two couples, Jean and her husband Thomas, and his brother Rich and current girlfriend Adaline. The four of them, as well as Jean and Thomas's child Billie, are on a boat together, travelling to the Isle of Shoals (Smuttynose) for the sole purpose that Jean could capture in photographs the setting of these old murders. <br /> <br />The stories are interwoven, told as one.  There may be chapter breaks but no spaces between paragraphs to differentiate the past with the present.  This is done intentionally to show how the two stories compare to each other.  As each story progresses, the jumps between each time period become more frequent, until the story reaches it's climax: the murder of the two Norwegian women in the 1870's, and a storm in which Jean and her boat-mates may not survive.  The ending of Jean's story came as a complete shock to me, as I was not expecting this at all.  <br /> <br />What makes THE WEIGHT OF WATER interesting is that it is based on a true story, and Shreve chose to create her own story based on the actual facts.  There is still talk about whether the actual murderer was indeed the one that was sent to death, or if someone else had committed these murders on Smuttynose and gotaway with it.  Shreve chose to come to her own conclusions with this story, and I felt that the conclusion was almost obvious, given the relationships between the characters. <br /> <br />Another way to look at both interconnected stories is that they were both about a set of marriages that the reader watched from beginning to end.  Maren's marriage was not the perfect one, and neither was Jean's.  It was interesting to be able to look at both women, and see how they were similar yet different. Both characters dealt with jealousy on some level, jealousy of a husband's friend, jealousy of a brother's wife.  I found Shreve was rather clever in the way she wrote this novel, and while it took some time to get used to the writing style, once I understood where she was going with the book, I was able to enjoy it and could not stop reading.  THE WEIGHT OF WATER is yet another book by Anita Shreve that I enjoyed, and I recommend it.	2005-01-25

I can't say enough about this novel.  The characters, however, was the driving force behind this book, although the center of the story was Claudia Knight's life as she tried desperately to begin a new one in a village called Court Barron.  She does everything including change her last name, in the hopes that her neighbors will not know who she is, or discover that her husband is Roger Baron, the man who was recently sent to jail for a financially related crime. <br /> <br />While Claudia does her best to start a new life as a single woman, she also has to deal with her two adult children. Her daughter continues to defend Roger, even though he's in jail and has also had an affair with a woman he would rather be with than his own wife.  Her son is in India and emotionally and physically is as far from Claudia as he will ever get. She does have a true friend in her sister-in-law Minna, who supports Claudia through phone conversations and communications through the lawyer, David. <br />  <br />Hiding her true story from the neighbors is a 24-hour job. She doesn't know how long she can keep up this charade, especially with the newspapers that often cover Roger's story on the front page. As she builds a new life for herself, she slowly gets to know the neighbors, and the story unfolds.  Challis does a great job developing the characters and their various relationships, and it is the relationships and the personalities that make BLACKTHORN WINTER a delight to read.  <br /> <br />This book is highly recommended by the Ratmammy.	2005-01-20

It was also her first mainstream novel, after spending the first part of her career writing straight romance novels.  I for one enjoy these mainstream novels, because I feel she's much better at them.  Her romances don't seem to stand the test of time, but this book did. <br /> <br />TWILIGHT WHISPERS is the story of two powerful and wealthy families, told from various view points but for the most part, centering on the murder of two of their members, Mark Whyte and his wife Deborah Warren.  An outsider, Robert Cavanaugh, is the one that starts the book off, as he is the investigator for the murders and he starts the case by researching the history of the two families. <br /> <br />While the murder plot line helped make the story move fast, what interested me the most was the family saga of the Whytes and the Warrens.  Delinsky always does a good job with stories such as this, and I really liked the book.  For those expecting a straight romance, this is not it. Look elsewhere. But for those who want more than just romance, read TWILIGHT WHISPERS.  This book comes recommended by the Ratmammy.	2005-01-15

She seems to have the mind of a child at times, although she lives in her own place (across the way from her husband), earns a living by writing book reviews for children's books, and seems at first glance to be a very normal and stable adult. <br /> <br />However, upon closer look, things look quite differently.  Kitty Wellington seems to be on the verge of falling apart.  She spends her days looking for her child Henry. She also seems to end up on the bus a lot, going nowhere, sometimes coming home early in the morning.  Her need to be awake is sometimes so intense, for she fears her dreams.   <br /> <br />She also has a deep need to find out more about her mother.  Because her mother died when she was only 3 years old, she has very little memory of her, and what she does remember she believes are false memories. Her brothers won't help her, saying it's been too long ago for them to remember a thing.  Even her father refuses to help her out.   <br /> <br />While at first her behavior didn't seem too abnormal, it comes to a point where she begins to do things that are totally irresponsible. When she begins to behave erratically, such as taking a baby that doesn't belong to her, her family realizes that she needs help, fast.   <br /> <br />ASTONISHING SPLASHES OF COLOUR was a truly fascinating look at a woman whose mental state is slowly deteriorating.  It is difficult to like a character such as this, because often times the reader will not know whether to sympathize with her or be angry with her.  What I do feel, though, is that this was a great reading experience and it is a book that I will not forget for a very long time.  The Ratmammy gives this book 5 stars.	2005-01-10

BLESSINGS by Anna Quindlen <br />January 9, 2005 <br /> <br />BLESSINGS by Anna Quindlen is probably going to make my top 20 list of books read in 2005. It is the story of Lydia Blessing, an elderly woman, heir to the estate known as BLESSINGS, built by her father Edward Blessing.  Lydia Blessing is the last of her line.  She's in her 80's, and her only daughter is childless and lives in the city. Throughout the book Lydia contemplates her life, and sees things as if she were living in her past. Her mind wanders in and out as she goes about her day, confusing the past with the present.  Little things will remind her of her parents, her dear brother Sunny, or her dead husband Benny, and all will appear in her mind as if it were just yesterday. Through her memories, the reader will piece together the story of her life. <br /> <br />In the opening chapter, an unknown couple dumps off a baby at the Blessings estate, and Skip (Charles) Cuddy, the handyman that lives above the garage, discovers the baby and decides to keep her.  He tries to keep it a secret, taking the baby with him as he works and cleverly hiding the baby so no one will discover her.  He is very afraid that someone will take the baby from him.  Skip has never had a child of his own, but for some reason he is driven to take care of this one, whom he names Faith.   <br /> <br />Eventually, Lydia discovers the secret of baby Faith, but instead of calling the authorities, she helps Skip with the baby, and her life is instantly changed.  She goes from a very rigid old-fashioned woman to a much happier person, looking forward to each day spent with the new baby and Skip.  The housekeeper's daughter, college-bound Jennifer Foster, is also brought into the secret, and between the three of them, they take care of baby Faith, not even thinking that one day she may be taken away from them.  <br /> <br />Without giving more away, I found BLESSINGS to be a wonderful surprise of a novel.  I bought the book a few yearsback, not knowing what to expect.  I had read BLACK AND BLUE because of the Oprah name attached to it, and enjoyed it a lot, but BLESSINGS is a step above it. Quindlen does an excellent job at blending the past with the present, working inside the mind of Lydia Blessing and slowly revealing all her family secrets.  Things are revealed gradually, as she herself is slowly remembering her past, her happy times spent with her beloved brother Sunny and his best friend Benny, who later becomes her husband.   <br /> <br />I also loved the \\"old time\\" feel of this book, since a lot of the novel takes place in the flashbacks of Lydia's memories.  The Blessings estate is set apart from the town called Mount Mason, and is a secluded area complete with wildlife and tons of land.  The backdrop of this place helps lend a feel to the overall story, one that is filled with nostalgia for the past and longing for things that are long gone.  I loved Lydia's story, and the way it was told, in pieces, as if I was living inside Lydia's head.  Overall, this book is a definite winner and will be on my top 20 list for 2005.	2005-01-09

A GIRL NAMED ZIPPY by Haven Kimmel <br />January 8, 2005 <br /> <br />One of my favorite books read in 2004 was this one, A GIRL NAMED ZIPPY by Haven Kimmel.  I'm not one to read memoirs, but the front cover caught my eye.  The photo of this nearly bald headed little girl in a ruffled blue dress and huge eyes and big ears was something that I couldn't walk away from.  And with enough recommendations from other readers, I finally picked up the book at the end of 2004. <br /> <br />Zippy was the nickname of Haven Kimmel, because of the way she used to zip around the room.  The book is told from her point of view, but through her eyes as a young precocious girl.  We see things as they happened years ago, starting from how she thinks (in her humorous way) her mother and the rest of her family saw her.  One of the funniest sections of this memoir was Zippy recalling her mother's journal and writing about Zippy, and the fact that she hadn't spoken a word until the age of three.  When Zippy finally spoke her first words and they were \\"I'll make a deal with you\\", spoken to her father, her mother's journal entry was \\"Now that we know she can talk, all I can say is `dear God. Please give that child some hair. Amen'\\".  There were lines like this and many more that had me laughing out loud as I read.   <br /> <br />A GIRL NAMED ZIPPY is told in little vignettes, and goes back and forth in time.  The reader is reliving Kimmel's childhood through flashes of memory, one leading into another, and not necessarily in chronological order.  Although this style doesn't always work, I felt it was perfect for this book.  The short chapters made this book a fast read.  Each succeeding chapter added a little bit more to the memories of Kimmel's childhood, giving the reader an idea of what her life must have been like in the late 60's and early 70's growing up in that small town of Mooreland, Indiana. It is a town in which (her sister claims) no one sane would have any interest in hearing about, but obviously Melinda was wrong. Kimmel did write that book about their small town lives in Mooreland, and it was interesting enough to get published.  I would love to read a sequel, and see what other escapades our dear little Zippy got herself into.	2005-01-09

I've enjoyed most of her books that I've read so far, but I am finding I do not enjoy her straight romances that she wrote prior to some of her more recent books, which tend to be more \\"women's lit\\" than just a pure romance. I think I was spoiled, having discovered the author's books by starting with her more recent novels and working my way backward.  Knowing that, the quality of these earlier books is not as good as her more recent novels. Although it is a good thing to know she is improving with age, even without comparing the different types of novels that Delinsky has written, I wouldn't have become such a big fan if it had only to do with these earlier romances. <br /> <br />In MOMENT TO MOMENT, a young woman, Dana Madison battles asthma and the right to have a normal healthy adult life, while Russ Ettinger deals with the loss of a possible sports career when he injures his knee. The two meet by accident, while Dana is fighting an asthma attack.  Fate seems to pull the two together, and soon they embark on a relationship.  Dana's asthma is at the heart of her personality, but she refrains to tell Russ about her health problems.  However, because of this medical issue, their relationship becomes strained.  It's a matter of misunderstandings and withholding the truth, but Dana is very afraid of having any serious relationship with any man, even if it IS with Russ, whom she thinks she can trust. <br /> <br />I wish I could give this book a higher rating, but MOMENT TO MOMENT is definitely not one of my favorite Delinsky books. I have to admit it was well written in some ways, but I didn't feel any sympathy for the characters and couldn't care less what happened to them. Anyone that reads this book should know that MOMENT TO MOMENT is not indicative of the style of books Delinsky writes today.  On the other hand, many readers have told me that they would rather read her older novels than her more recent ones.  It's a matter of taste. As for me, I will eventually read all her books, as I am a big fan, but I prefer her current style of writing and am happy that I had discovered her books.  MOMENT TO MOMENT gets three stars from the Ratmammy.	2004-12-30
408799:US	51214937	RRW86YGNRZH9U	0373712448	72900751	Along Came Zoe: You, Me & the Kids (Harlequin Superromance No. 1244)	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	Excellent!	ALONG CAME ZOE by Janice MacDonald <br />December 28, 2004 <br /> <br />Having read several books by Janice Macdonald, I've come to expect from her the best there is in the world of Harlequin Superromances, and I was not disappointed.  In ALONG CAME ZOE, Zoe finds herself angry with a local surgeon whom she believes is the reason her best friend's daughter is dead.   <br /> <br />Zoe McCann is not one to keep her mouth shut, and she often speaks before thinking.  I found her character very refreshing, very real, with flaws and imperfections that may appeal to a lot of romance readers today. She's over weight, very non-conservative in appearance, and seems to belong in another era (with the hippies).  She's a single mom, with a teenage son who idolizes a father that spends a lot of time surfing.  She wants Brett to become a doctor, while Brett isn't really sure what he wants to be, but it certainly isn't in the field of medicine.   <br /> <br />When Zoe's best friend's daughter, Jenny, dies as a result of an accident, Zoe finds her anger is taking control of her life. She confronts the surgeon that was not available to perform any life saving procedures to save the young girl's life that fateful night, and at first thinks that her assumptions about the doctor are correct, that all he cares for is his salary and his golf game. However, as the two get to know each other, something changes in her assessment of Philip Barry, a man she remembers from her childhood years, when she was the daughter of the Barry's housekeeper. <br /> <br />While Zoe sorts out her feelings for Philip, she is also dealing with her son and his good-for-nothing father.  Philip is also dealing with child-rearing issues, in particular with his only daughter Molly, who seems to be going through some emotional problems that are more serious than what the average teenager goes through.   <br /> <br />Macdonald as usual does an excellent job with weaving the various sub-plotlines together to make onecohesive novel.  It is amazing what she does in the span of a few hundred pages, knowing this is \\"just\\" a Harlequin Superromance novel.  She takes on serious issues and blends them with the romance that the readers come to expect from a Harlequin book, but creates a story that I feel is a step above a simple romance.  Most Harlequin Superromances do strive for this structure in their books, but I feel that Macdonald excels at what she does.  ALONG CAME ZOE comes highly recommended to those who love to read romances with a little bit more.	2004-12-29

MASQUERADING THE MARQUESS was a fun romp set in England's regency era.  Main character Calliope Minton disguises herself to work her way into the world of the \\"ton\\", to help with her career as a successful caricaturist.  Her latest caricatures are all aimed at the handsome Marquess of Angelford, and to her dismay, she finds her path crossing with his more often than she'd like (except that he's great material for her drawings!) <br /> <br />The book is funny but along with it there is romance and danger as the two get involved in finding their missing friend Stephen, who had been helping Calliope on the sly with infiltrating the balls and fancy parties.  This is one book that could possibly be read in one sitting.  I found myself enjoying MASQUERADING THE MARQUESS a lot, and gave it 4 stars.  Recommended for those who love regency romances with a lot of humor mixed in with mystery and intrigue.	2004-12-23
419478:US	51214937	R13EH4V79SA467	0060525479	521219885	Lovers and Liars	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Star Crossed Lovers	LOVERS AND LIARS by Josephine Cox <br />December 17, 2004 <br /> <br />This was my first book by Josephine Cox and I'm definitely going to be reading more by her.  LOVERS AND LIARS was a historical romance with a pair of star-crossed lovers.  Cox does a wonderful job with this story,  creating a cast of characters that help move the story line, with the central story of John and Emily pulling the reader in for a page turning book. <br /> <br />The story takes place in early 1900's England, and Emily and John are in love.  As it is customary for this era,  John must ask permission to court Emily. She's sixteen and he is twenty. Unfortunately, the man of the \\"house\\",  Uncle Clem, is a mean and terrible  man, and does not want Emily to be seeing John.  He beats up John to the point of nearly killing him.  John decides that it is not the right time for Emily and John to be together, so he leaves town, but promises Emily he will return a richer man and will take her away from her uncle, who is abusive and mentally cruel. <br /> <br />Through a series of misunderstandings and lies and an event that changes Emily forever, the two are kept apart. But as the years progress, Emily and John never forget each other, and hope that someday they will be reunited. <br /> <br />This book is definitely for those who enjoy an old-fashioned style of story.  Fans of contemporary romances may not buy into some of the characters that populate the book, and the plot may be a bit over the top for others, but I really enjoyed this book and I plan on reading more by Josephine Cox.	2004-12-18

This one was no exception.  SMALL TOWN GIRL centered on a country music star who comes home to take care of her ailing mother, and after years of avoiding going home, finds herself in the middle of hometown life. <br /> <br />Tess McPhail left home as a teenager to make her way in the world of country music.  Eighteen years later, she's returned as a superstar, and is home to take care of her mother who is having hip surgery, promising that she will stay for a month to help out.  Her sisters had been the ones to be there for their mother all these years, and now it was Tess's turn to help.  She cancels a few concert engagements and puts her music life on hold, while she immerses herself in hometown life, getting reacquainted with all the old neighbors again. <br /> <br />Tess, the reader will notice, hates being home.  She has a hard time dealing with her mother, who still treats Tess like a child.  Tess is rude and ill mannered in some ways, with an attitude that will make one think she is stuck up. She is shocked to see how \\"nerdy\\" Kenny Kronek, now living in the home he grew up in next door to Tess's mother's house, is always over, taking care of her mother.  Her attitude towards him is almost one of disdain.  She is angry that he feels he belongs in her mother's house, as if he were family.  She is also surprised at how the rest of the family (her sister's and in-laws) welcome and accept Kenny as a part of the family, yet he is just the next door neighbor. <br /> <br />She's also battling it out with one sister, Judy.  Judy is overweight and very insecure, and despises Tess and her success as a major recording artist.  Tess wants to bridge this gap between the two, but cannot figure out how to reach Judy.  Her other sister, Renee, on the other hand, is a much more welcoming figure, and thetwo are close and can confide in each other. <br /> <br />As Tess gets adjusted to life back home, and her mother finally has her hip surgery, Tess's attitude slowly changes.  Her relationship with Kenny also changes, as she becomes a good friend and mentor to his daughter, another aspiring country music singer, who Tess finds, is quite good.   <br /> <br />Although SMALL TOWN GIRL is not my favorite book by Spencer, I still enjoyed it.  I found that it was not as complex as some of her earlier books.  However, I am definitely giving this book 4 stars.  It was another well-written story coming from the master of romances and women's lit-type books, and it's a shame that Spencer is no longer writing, having gone into retirement after writing the book that came after SMALL TOWN GIRL, THEN CAME HEAVEN. I did find the ending, although expected, a little contrived, and a little bit too \\"happily ever after\\", but regardless, I felt this book was well worth the read as a fan of LaVyrle Spencer.  For those who did not care for this book, I'd suggest reading one of her better books, BITTER SWEET or HOME SONG.	2004-12-13

In THE BEAUTY BRIDE by Claire Delacroix, the reader will find out one method: by auction. Alexander has become the Laird of Kinfairlie, due to the unexpected death of both parents, and one of his duties as head of the family is to make sure each of his five sisters is betrothed and married off at the proper age. Unfortunately, Madeleine, the oldest at 23, refuses to commit to anyone, since the love of her life, James, has been killed. And, with Madeleine not ready to wed, the other four sisters must wait their turn. Alexander has tried everything, but she refuses to cooperate, so he tricks her into attending the auction held at their estate, with the prime catches of the day bidding upon this fair maiden, who will soon be considered an old maid.    What Alexander has not counted on is the appearance of Rhys FitzHenry, who is wanted for treason. Furthermore, Rhys decides to bid on Madeleine, and with his seemingly unlimited supply of coin, he wins, to the horror of Alexander. Rhys does have an ulterior motive. He believes that Madeleine is the long lost heir to his family's land. With him wed to his \\"cousin\\", the land will be secured under his name.    Madeleine is outraged by the entire concept of this auction. Alexander has been known to be the king of pranksters but this was the ultimate insult. She runs away that night, the night of her nuptials, and lucky for her, Rhys anticipates her actions. He saves her from being raped by someone she thought she could trust, and from there, their adventures take off.    This reviewer enjoyed the adventures of Madeleine and Rhys in THE BEAUTY BRIDE. Historical romances are a very specialized sub-genre, but this novel was so well done that it is possible that any fan of the romance novel will enjoy it. There is humor, adventure, as well as love in this well-written book. The charactersare likeable and believable, the dialogue is realistic, and although one cannot exactly duplicate the English of the 1400's, Delacroix wrote the novel in such a way that will take the reader back in time and believe they are truly there. A touch of fantasy inhabits this novel, with one of the sister's ability to see Fairies, but it is done in such a humorous way that the reader will buy into it. This is the first in a three part series, and this reviewer is looking forward to the next two books.	2004-12-11

ALL SHE EVER WANTED by Barbara Freethy <br />December 11, 2004 <br /> <br />Courtesy of WWW.LOVEROMANCES.COM <br /> <br />Three women are reunited, after the publication of a murder novel informs the world about a past they had tried to forget, in ALL SHE EVER WANTED by Barbara Freethy. <br /> <br />Natalie Bishop is currently a resident at San Francisco's St Timothy's Hospital, achieving the goal she had worked for so hard while a student at Santa Cruz University ten years ago. Back in college, she was one of four young women who called themselves the Fabulous Four - Natalie, Laura, Madison, and a fourth girl, Emily. They were part of the same sorority and had banded together as four special friends who were different as night and day, yet they shared a great friendship. Natalie was the studious one, the one that had promised to take care of Emily. Laura was the all-American girl next door. Madison was the ultra-sophisticated girl, who was experienced in more ways than one. And finally, Emily was the glue that held the group together. She was full of life and adventure, but had a number of secrets that she had taken with her when she died. They were as close as sisters, and no one would have guessed that one night their lives would be changed forever, the night when Emily fell to her death from the roof of their building during a party. According to the novel that is penned by a new author named Garrett Malone, Natalie was the one that supposedly pushed Emily to her death. <br /> <br />Natalie learns about the book by accident while on a break at the hospital. The names had been changed, and she panics when she realizes the book is about her, the Fabulous Four, and Emily's accidental death. While Malone may have thought he had disguised the characters in the book, most people recognize who these girls really were. Natalie's career is now on hold, due to the damage the book is doing to the hospital's reputation. And her ex-boyfriend Cole, who was Emily's brother andis now working for the family newspaper, the San Francisco Tribune, finds himself in a situation where he tries to defend Natalie's innocence, which angers his parents who believe that Natalie did indeed kill Emily. His loyalties are torn, and he also realizes that he has never gotten over Natalie, the girl that broke his heart. <br /> <br />Laura and Natalie reunite to solve the mystery of the book, to find out who Garrett Malone really is, and to discover what really happened that fateful night. Madison does her own investigative work, trying to find out if there is any truth to the novel that is making front-page news. It's been years since they have all been together, but the novel that should never have been written is uncovering skeletons from their past and forcing them together again. Although they had missed the camaraderie of their college years, each of them secretly suspects the other in pushing Emily off the roof that night. With the help of Cole and a few others from their past, they solve the mystery of Garrett Malone, as well as uncover the story of Emily's death. <br /> <br />Freethy had this reviewer guessing until the very end as to who killed Emily, and at one point it almost seemed obvious as to whom the murderer was. Freethy did a good job with adding plot twists here and there to confuse the reader, keeping one in suspense until the very end. This reviewer feels that the author was quite successful with this romantic suspense novel, using Natalie and Cole as the star-crossed lovers who try to convince themselves that they no longer love each other. The romance was not too overwhelming to detract from the mystery that needed to be solved, and the characters all felt believable and logically written. A surprise ending, at least for this reviewer, may catch other readers off guard as well, and kudos to Freethy for achieving that shocking finish. The book was fast paced and judging by how fast this reviewer read the book, it was definitely one that was hard to put down. ALL SHE EVER WANTED was a well-done romantic suspense novel, and it is not always that an author can get it \\"just right\\". This novel is highly recommended. <br /> <br />	2004-12-11

Not knowing what to expect from this unknown author, it was good to discover that this book was worth the time spent.  It's the story of Lena Molloy, who had adopted her daughter 27 years ago, and her obsessive search for her daughter's biological parents.  <br /> <br />Lena and her husband Jack have been happily married for nearly 30 years, and are very proud of their daughter, now a very famous opera singer. She travels the world, leaving behind her parents who live in a small town in England. The novel starts out slow, introducing some of the characters including Lena and Alma, and I found at first that the writing was rather awkward.  But as one reads more of the novel, the better the book gets.  The author slowly draws the reader into the story of Lena's search for the birth mother of her daughter Mary, who is currently on tour, making a name for herself.  Jack is also travelling, as he always does, for his business. Without letting him know, Lena and best friend Alma travel to Ireland in search of clues that will lead them to Mary's biological parents.   <br /> <br />Lena should have told Jack, but he had said over and over again that they shouldn't try to find Mary's parents, because it will only cause trouble.  And Mary had always told her adoptive parents that she was not interested in hunting down her real parents.  Lena, however, thinks that Mary is holding back, and goes out of her way to solve this mystery. <br /> <br />SINGING BIRD was a very simply written story about a woman's obsessive need to find the truth about her daughter's parentage. But it also had a psychological theme, in that Lena herself had a reason for searching for her daughter's real mother. I am glad I continued with this book, when at first I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy it.  It was a book worth reading, and I found that McAuley had a wonderful way with words, telling a good story that was to the point, and I found myself comparing her writing to Elizabeth Berg, another favorite author of mine.  If it weren't for the awkward beginning, I would be giving this book five stars.  However, I am definitely giving it 4 stars for an excellent story that was short and sweet and full of emotion.	2004-12-09

THE YEARS OF RICE AND SALT by Kim Stanley Robinson <br />December 8, 2004 <br /> <br />This was probably the most complex book I've read in quite some time.  THE YEARS OF RICE AND SALT by Kim Stanley Robinson is the retelling of history, based on the fact that instead of only 33% of Europe succumbing to the plague, it's now 99%.  The book starts from the days of the Black Plague, but because history has been changed, this novel is from the viewpoint of mostly Chinese or Muslim peoples.  Reincarnation is an accepted fact, and throughout the book, characters that are telling the tale of this revised history are all reincarnated beings from previous chapters. <br /> <br />I felt that Robinson's theories were pretty good, and made a lot of sense.  Since most of the white population has been killed off, the main world powers are now the world of Islam and China, with the Indians a close second.  There is an interesting mix between the two cultures, with most people of course speaking Arabic languages as well as Chinese dialects.  Great historic figures are either Muslim or Chinese.  And of course all of them were reincarnated, some of them even remembering their past lives and recognizing each other in their future lives. <br /> <br />I won't get into the details of the characters and who they were, since there were so many through the centuries.  What is important to know is that Robinson followed the progression of history from the Muslim point of view, so the world he created was very Muslim-centered or Chinese-centered, with of course place-names changed to reflect this.  There is no such thing as the Americas, since Amerigo Vespucci never existed, plus he's white.  (Caucasians for the most part do not exist, except in a few pockets around the world). It was the Chinese that sought out the new worlds, not knowing that these huge \\"islands\\" existed out there in the ocean.  South America becomes \\"Inka\\", and North America is now Yingshou, with mostly Chinese and Muslim influence.  San Francisco is probably the most celebrated city (but it's not San Francisco anymore, but the \\"Gold Gate\\" exists as it does in the real world). Japanese Snow Monkeys live freely in the trees of what should have been this California city, due to the influence of the nomadic Japanese peoples (China conquered them ages ago and took over the islands of Japan). <br /> <br />And so it goes. <br /> <br />I found that parts of the book were bogged down with too many details, but I think history fans will get a kick out of this book.  I enjoyed the extrapolation that was done in general and thoroughly loved the immersion of Muslim culture of this book. And the most interesting part of all, while the Christians do not even exist, religion does play a big part in world culture, with the Muslims trying to dominate the world, just as the Christians have done in our own.  It's food for thought. <br /> <br />I gave this book a 4 star rating, only because I personally did not enjoy the last two sections of the book.  For me, the war details were not as interesting as the rest of the history that the author went into, but for anyone reading this book, it is necessary to read it all.  I really loved the comedy that took place in the bardo, where one goes before they are reincarnated into the next life.  Characters arguing about why they keep getting killed off, and one character constantly telling the other about not \\"getting it\\".  There is a pattern here, with the reincarnated characters, that I didn't' get until it was pointed out at the very end of the book.  But I'm sure it may be obvious to others. Overall, it was an enjoyable read, although a bit too long for me, but I am glad I read it.	2004-12-08

Casper<br /><br />November 28, 2004<br /><br />JACKSON'S GIRLS by K.N. Casper is the third in the Harlequin Superromance trilogy \\"Raising Cane\\", in which each book takes place on a sugar cane plantation in Louisiana owned by the Fontaine Family.  In this third novel, Jackson Fontaine tries to get to the bottom of all the \\"bad luck\\" that has created havoc on the plantation and at their estate home, BelleFontaine.<br /><br />Leanna Cargill is the insurance investigator sent to the plantation to check out whether Jackson's insurance claims are legit or not.  Jackson finds her \\"trespassing\\" on his land one day, not knowing who she is.  They start off on the wrong foot, but they soon find they have some things in common. Both are single parents, whose significant others are people that are less than trustworthy.  Leanna's ex-husband has a way of manipulating people to get what he wants, and she lives in fear that he will take away her daughter forever by lying and making her out to be the bad mother.  Jackson's story is that he had a fleeting affair with a woman who is now in jail, and had only recently gotten custody of his daughter Megan, whom he loves dearly.<br /><br />While the two get to know each other better, they also try to solve the mystery as to who is sabotaging things on the plantation. It may be easy to narrow down the culprit, but as this is not a mystery novel but a romance, I felt that this part of the story line was not that important.  What I felt was more important was how well the romance started off, and that the two main characters were well developed enough and believable enough to have a romance together at all. The romance developed at a reasonable pace, and so by the end of the book, I felt it was logical that they would end up together and have their happily ever after.<br /><br />While I felt the first two books in the series were not up to par, Casper's JACKSON'S GIRLS gave the series a boost with a 4-star novel thatwas worth the read.  This isn't to say that the other two books were not enjoyable, but I felt that continuity books are probably very difficult to write, especially since the work is divided between more than one author.  However, if a reader's first exposure to a Harlequin Superromance is to this \\"Raising Cane\\" series, I'd suggest reading a different book by any of these three authors (Eve Gaddy, Roz Denny Fox or K.N. Casper) and one should be rewarded with a much better written romance.	2004-11-29

TRUE TO FORM is the third and final book in this series, and each book has been a delight to read.  Reading about Katie and her thoughts and fears about growing up has been such a treat. I feel that Berg gets it \\"right on\\" with everything Katie goes through, including the loss of a parent, first crush, and the trials and tribulations of growing up a misfit.   <br /> <br />In TRUE TO FORM, Katie is now thirteen years old and is getting ready to start high school. Her relationship with her new stepmother, Ginger, is developing and growing, and while her own father was never there for her emotionally, it is Ginger that becomes the dominant parent in Katie's life. As for Katie's older sister, she is now living in California and is rarely heard from anymore. It's as far away from their father as she could possibly get without leaving the country.  <br /> <br />Katie is still in touch with her best friend from Texas, Cherylanne, who is still in contact via long letters filled with advice and the latest news. Cherylanne has her own trials to get through, but as always, she's quick on the advice and very confident that she will get through this difficult time in her life. Katie finds herself growing apart from Cherylanne, as the older girl is now having sex with her boyfriend and is hoping to get married to him soon, but Katie still goes to her as her one source of advice when all else fails.  As the novel progresses, Katie learns what true friendship is really about, and how as life goes on, she in turn will move on to new places, new friends, and she is finally learning to accept her new home. <br /> <br />In the meantime, Katie is recruited by her father to baby-sit the neighbors' three boys, as well as help an elderly man take care of his bedridden wife.  Between the two couples, Katie learns what real love is all about, as she watches the love between old Mr. Randolph and his wife who is still beautiful in his eyes.  Katie also watches while the Wexlers, who are a much younger couple, fall apart before her very eyes.  The wonderful thing about Katie is that while she is at first repulsed by the older couple, she learns to care for both Mr. and Mrs. Randolph as she gets to know them better, and wishes she will someday find a love as strong as theirs. <br /> <br />Katie's new best friend is Cynthia, another misfit. They sleep over each other's house and know each other's secrets as only best friends do.  The climax of the novel is Katie's friendship with Cynthia, and how she betrays Cynthia while trying to fit in with a new set of friends in a school that Katie has just gotten accepted to (with the help of Mr. Randolph).  It's a private school for girls, very exclusive, and Katie thinks now she will be popular and no longer be the misfit she's felt like all her life.  It's a harsh lesson in life that Katie has to learn, but Berg writes this book so realistically that I felt this part of the book was done very well. It was believable and I was not let down with how the book ended. <br />  <br />TRUE TO FORM gets 5 stars from me.  Ratings are obviously subjective, as one can tell by reading various reviews on Amazon.com, and for me, I personally enjoyed the story of Katie Nash, as I have done with the previous novels.  I also enjoy the way Elizabeth Berg writes, but it may not be everyone's cup of tea. Her style is very simple, but yet she tends to pack a wallop in such short books, which I find very impressive.  That is really my main reason for giving it such a high rating. Those who enjoy reading Women's Lit will love TRUE TO FORM.	2004-11-26

SNOWED IN by Christina Bartolomeo <br />November 25, 2004 <br /> <br />Here is a book that will be on my top 20 list for 2004.  SNOWED IN by Christina Bartolomeo is one of those novels that will sneak up on you.  You will fall in love with the main character, Sophie Quinn, while the book itself (at least for me) will be hard to forget.  There aren't too many books that come around that I feel \\"special\\" about, and SNOWED IN is one of those few. <br /> <br />Sophie Quinn has been married to Paul Stoddard for a number of years, and now she finds herself living in the cold world of Portland, Maine, because of Paul's job relocation.  He's very busy with work and she rarely sees him, and when he's home, he's not the same.  She's noticed that the man she fell in love with does not exist anymore.  She's lonely and feels trapped. <br /> <br />Sophie's days consist of dealing with the landlord, Donald, who she has a hard time confronting.  Paul asks her to talk to Donald about their heater, and other things that are not working in their apartment, but she is not the confrontational type.  But, October in Maine dictates the use of a heater, and with theirs not working at all and Sophie being homebound most of the day, she has to do something or she'll freeze to death.   <br /> <br />One day Sophie meets Stephen, a gay man who happened to bang his leg (which was in a cast) against her stool at her favorite coffee house, Java Net.  They strike up a conversation, something that Sophie does not do with strangers, and soon she has made a new friend.  He invites her to join a walking group he belongs to, and so she courageously joins.  Paul is ecstatic that she's found an interest outside her own work, which is doing pamphlets for various non-profit groups and helping a college friend create artwork for greeting cards.   <br /> <br />Soon, Sophie is making new friends, and finds herself attracted in a platonic way to Ned, Stephen's brother. She's married and does not feel a need fora romantic interest outside the marriage, but as I continued reading, I felt that underneath everything, Sophie does not feel married at all.  And therefore, because she did not feel married, she also felt subconsciously that she was not doing anything wrong by feeling somewhat attracted to Ned, confiding with him about almost everything, and becoming as close to him as she wished she were with her own husband. <br /> <br />Along with Ned, there is also an ex-boyfriend who was the love of her life, Rory.  He also becomes a distraction, as she becomes further confused about her marriage and what she really wants out of a relationship. <br /> <br />Despite the heavy themes, the tone of the book is light.  I found myself chuckling quite often while reading about Sophie's exploits.  The book is witty and funny and I was quite amazed that I discovered such a gem of a book. The characters are all rather quirky, which adds to the charm of this book, and the author has a definite gift of story telling.   <br /> <br />I am definitely recommending SNOWED IN, and am going to be hunting down her previous novels, CUPID AND DIANA and THE SIDE OF THE ANGELS.	2004-11-25

MR MAYBE by Jane Green<br /><br />November 22, 2004<br /><br />I've read several books by Jane Green, and MR MAYBE is one of my favorites.  Libby Mason is in search of her Mr. Right, who has to be well off as well as good looking to fit into this category.  Unfortunately, she is finding that the men she's attracted to are never attracted to her, while the ones she's not really interested in she can't get rid of.<br /><br />Then, she meets Nick. He's cute and funny and everything she'd want in a man, but he's got no money. He's a starving writer who keeps food on the table by collecting unemployment (the English version of it).  He is definitely not MR Right, but he sure could be a fun fling, in the meantime.  So, Libby and Nick have a wonderful affair, telling each other that neither is ready to settle down, and this is just for fun.  Unfortunately, Nick sees that Libby is falling for him, and he pulls away from her and leaves her.<br /><br />Libby is heart broken, but then she meets Ed, a not-so-attractive older man (at least by her standards: she's in her late 20's) but he fits the criteria she's looking for. He's loaded.  If she marries Ed, he would have her living the life she's always wanted.  The bad news is that she's not really over Nick, and she's not sure she really fancies Ed.  What is a girl to do?<br /><br />For fans of Chick Lit and beyond, this is a recommended read.  Each of Jane Green's books is different, so it's always difficult to predict how she will write her next book.  However, I can say that so far, I've enjoyed nearly every one, except for BOOKENDS, which I found a little irritating for some reason. But MR MAYBE was definitely a good book. It's funny, with characters you will enjoy getting to know, and for some reason I did compare this one a little to Bridget Jones but not sure why.  Something about the heroine, and the way she related to her parents, made me picture a Bridget Jones type person in Libby.  That's not a bad thing, either.  I am looking forward to the next book, whatever it'll be.either.  I am looking forward to the next book, whatever it'll be.	2004-11-23
449442:US	51214937	R3SQ29B5L38P7Z	0345460693	706833371	Time Bomb (Alex Delaware)	Books	4	5	9	N	N	Another winner from Jonathan Kellerman	TIME BOMB by Jonathan Kellerman <br />November 20, 2004 <br /> <br />Here's an older Alex Delaware novel originally published in 1990, in which a sniper attacks a schoolyard and Alex Delaware and Milo Sturgis are on the case trying to solve the crime.  Alex's job is to help out the kids that were exposed to the violence that left the suspected sniper dead, by counseling both the children and their parents.   <br /> <br />Meanwhile, the police are stumped as to why a young woman had tried to gun down children at a school, although it was also a coincidence that a local politician, State Assemblyman Samuel Massengil, was scheduled to speak at the school that same day.  His political rival, Gordon Latch, also happened to be at the school before the shooting started, and it appears suspicious as to why they were both at the school when only Samuel had been expected to be there.   <br /> <br />The mystery soon leads to the young woman's father, who turns out to be an egomaniac.  Interviewing the neighbors brings up a young Black American that some say she had been dating, but in any case, had befriended her when she had no other friends. And subsequently, themes such as racism, the KKK and Nazism play central to the mystery of who the sniper was and why she did it.   <br /> <br />I've only read a handful of Alex Delaware novels, but I feel this was the most complex of them all.  What I like about these books is that although they do have continuity going for them (Alex Delaware and Milo Sturgis, as well as some other minor characters, are the constants in these novels), one does not have to read them in order to enjoy them.  For those who enjoy a good psychological thriller, TIME BOMB is recommended.	2004-11-21
453142:US	51214937	R1FHL40X8GX3IC	0140230270	725977597	Harvesting the Heart	Books	4	8	11	N	N	Another enjoyable book by Jodi Picoult	HARVESTING THE HEART by Jodi Picoult <br />November 13, 2004 <br /> <br />Jodi Picoult loves to write about people who have problems that do not fit the average person.  Often times she writes about people that would be found on the front page of a newspaper, such as THE PACT, or MY SISTER'S KEEPER. In HARVESTING THE HEART, one of her earlier novels, the main character is a woman who feels she is not worthy of the life she leads, and is afraid that she is just like her mother, who abandoned daughter and husband to start a new life.  Paige feels she is following in her mother's footsteps. <br /> <br />The book's opening chapter places Paige outside the home that she shares with her husband and baby, and she is obviously not allowed inside.  In the narrative, she describes her baby infant, Max, and her husband Nicholas. She also describes a drawing that she's just created. The drawing is of herself with her son Max, but the discerning eye will see that in the center of the drawing she depicts her mother running away, taking with her the child that Paige did not have. The reader is left in the dark as to why she's outside, who this other child is, and what her mother has to do with all this.  For me, it was a great way to pull me into the story. It had me wanting to learn about Paige and the life she's had so far, from her early childhood and memories of her mother, to her meeting of her husband Nicholas up to her present life. The big mystery at the beginning of the novel is \\"why is Paige living outside?\\" <br /> <br />Paige and Nicholas come together as a pair of potentially star-crossed lovers, since both are from totally different worlds.  Paige's life and family would never have crossed paths with the upper class world that Nicholas belonged to, yet somehow the two fall in love and marry.   <br /> <br />I felt HARVESTING THE HEART was two stories in one.  One is the story of Paige and her search for her mother and how her mother's disappearance affected her life. The other is the story of a woman and her relationship with her husband, trying to fit into his world as if she belonged. The two themes come together as one novel, explaining how Paige evolved into the person she becomes by the end of the book, and by then the reader will understand what makes Paige tick and why she did some of the questionable things that she did. Paige may come across as a very mentally unstable woman, but Picoult manages to create a character that one can somehow empathize with, or at least understand.  As always, Picoult writes a book that has an ending that will make the reader think and ponder, and as always, this book by Jodi Picoult did not fail to keep me interested until the very end.  This is yet another book by this author that I recommend.	2004-11-17

All her life, she's had to take care of her father and her younger siblings after the death of her mother who died giving birth to youngest sibling Ralphie.  Nina had no choice but to take care of them all, since her father was emotionally unable to care for them after he lost his wife, and the others were too young to fend for themselves.  Nina is now in her mid-thirties, and is ready to have a baby before it is too late.  On the other hand, she has no desire to get married or to be a real mother.  She is tired of taking care of others, but she has this need to experience the process of having a baby. <br /> <br />Joe, her best friend, has wanted children for a very long time. He's almost made it to the altar twice, but so far he's batting 0 for 2.  He won't let this deter him from having a baby, and he figures that a great way to have one is to have Nina be the mother of his child.   <br /> <br />It takes some convincing, but she finally agrees.  As long as the baby is born before she leaves town, she is up to it.  She has Joe promise that he will take care of the baby without her, and that she is not going to be the mother of this child, except biologically.  She wants nothing to do with the baby at all. <br /> <br />THE NINE MONTH PLAN was a disappointment for me.  While it was funny in spots, and I was able to get into the characters in the book, especially Nina's various siblings, I had a hard time believing that Nina could even think that having Joe's baby without a marriage proposal looming over the horizon was a good idea.  If Nina and Joe were merely strangers that had agreed to work out a surrogate baby deal, that is one thing.  But Nina and Joe were best friends and had known each other all their lives.  I just could not buy this idea, given the circumstances of their relationship as it stood. I give THE NINE MONTH PLAN 3 stars.	2004-11-17

Grayson has a gift for writing such wonderful romances, which can be read in only a few hours, yet they leave such a big impact despite the short length. Emily Grayson knows how to write the perfect old-fashioned romance, and her books are a must-read. <br /> <br />In this tale, a young woman, Maude Latham, makes a big decision by attending college overseas, at Oxford. She has a sense of adventure and this is her first step at becoming an independent woman. It is 1938, and WWII is just around the corner, but she is not afraid of any impending rumors of war. <br /> <br />While studying there, Maude falls in love with her poetry tutor, Stephen Kendall, but there is one hitch: he's married.  Their romance is doomed from the start, but the two are so in love that they take risks, such as going off to London to spend a few hours together. Stephen's marriage is an unhappy one, but he is afraid to ask his wife for a divorce, due to her fragile constitution. He promises Maude that one day he will make that big step, and wants Maude in his life forever. <br /> <br />In the meantime, England enters WWII and Stephen goes off to war, advising Maude to return to the United States where she will be safe, but she is stubborn and stays in England, helping out with the war effort. She becomes a nurse and waits patiently for any word from Stephen. As long as she knows Stephen is coming back to her, she is willing to wait, and this keeps her going through the long days ahead. When she receives word that he has decided to stay with his wife, she is devastated, but continues with her work as a nurse, having made that decision to stay in England. She wonders if she will ever love again as passionately as she's loved Stephen, and decides that she needs to forget all about him and move on. <br /> <br />WATERLOOSTATION is a simple love story that is predictable on some level, but despite that fact, it is a wonderful book. Anyone who is a fan of the old-fashioned romance is going to love this story, and this reviewer recommends reading Grayson's other books as well.	2004-11-12
459609:US	51214937	R3VNEGHAQJUM3I	0525948007	683071329	The Windmill	Books	4	3	6	N	N	Another good book by Stephanie Gertler	The Windmill by Stephanie Gertler <br />Courtesy of WWW.Loveromances.com <br />November 10, 2004 <br /> <br />The name Stephanie Gertler is a name this reviewer has come to welcome when it comes to books. Her previous novel, DRIFTING, left such an impact that the offer to read THE WINDMILL could not be turned away. In Gertler's most recent novel, two people come together and live a life as husband and wife, after enduring tragedy and loss with a previous relationship. What gets the book moving is the realization that one of them has not been completely truthful about the past, and has been living a lie all these years. <br /> <br />The novel begins in the present, with Olivia (Livi) learning that her husband, Carl, has disappeared. She sees him in the morning, as he is getting ready for work. However, she finds out that he never shows up at the University, where he is the Chairman of the Department of Physics. If it were some other man, Olivia may not have been in a panic, but Carl was not one to deviate from his planned schedules, and he would have let her know one way or another if he had to leave on an emergency. It is truly unlike him even to be late for work. The thought of him having an affair occurs to her for a brief second, but she finds that idea totally unrealistic, and feels that something awful has happened to him instead. <br /> <br />As the day wears on, Olivia is as worried as she can be, but when she finds the note he had left for her that morning, she at least is comforted with the knowledge that he will be returning to her soon. Her life is now turned upside down, and she reflects on her own past and the love that she lost many years ago.  <br /> <br />Olivia and Carl Larkin are now in their fifties, with two grown children and a happy marriage. But both of them have a star-crossed past. Olivia fell in love with Noah years ago, and with Carl's disappearance, she begins to think about her past with Noah, a love that should have lasted a lifetime. It is a love that is romantic and at the same time tragic, as the reader will cry with Olivia as she remembers her life with a man that she had so much passion for, and had had such big dreams with. <br /> <br />In the meantime, Carl is travelling back to his hometown, hoping to get closure on a past that he ran away from so many years ago. It is a past that no one in his current life is aware of, including Olivia. Carl hopes that Olivia's love for him will help them get through this, as Carl plans to tell Olivia everything when he returns home to Cape Cod. What he plans on telling her is going to be so shocking, that he knows he may end up losing her in the end. <br /> <br />Words cannot describe the writing of Stephanie Gertler. It is not just the story lines that make her novels feel like magic, but it is the way she tells her stories. The backdrop of Cape Cod helps add to the mood of THE WINDMILL, Cape Cod representing a time in Olivia's life where she felt protected and happy. Cape Cod is where she returns after she loses Noah, and it is where she seeks comfort with her parents after Carl disappears. The setting of New York takes the reader to Noah and Olivia's romance, the excitement of first love, and the newness of a life together. And while Olivia and Carl seem to be happy in their married life together in Massachusetts, the college town represents a different time and life, a life that is more staid, more down to earth. This reviewer could feel the difference in tone between the different time periods, and Olivia and Carl's life together seemed to be covered in a false security, as if they were acting a part and not truly living as they should have been. With Carl's plan to reveal his secrets, he is giving himself and Olivia a chance to come clean, and to start fresh with a new outlook on life. Gertler did a good job at developing these characters as she did, showing that they were not flat characters but people that grow and develop as they are influencedby those around them. THE WINDMILL, a beautifully written story that will live on in the minds of its readers, is highly recommended. <br /> <br />	2004-11-11
461393:US	51214937	R2WGPL5UH1T4PZ	0345466128	906978929	Serving Crazy with Curry (Ballantine Reader's Circle)	Books	5	8	11	N	N	Another good book by Amulya Malladi	SERVING CRAZY WITH CURRY by Amulya Malladi <br />November 9, 2004 <br /> <br /> <br />SERVING CRAZY WITH CURRY is the third book by Amulya Malladi. Having read all three of her novels, I can say that she is improving with each book.  In this most recent publication, Malladi chose to write a dark comedy, centering on a young woman who contemplates thoughts of ending her life. <br /> <br />The thought of suicide automatically brings up negative connotations, but in SERVING CRAZY WITH CURRY, the focus is on recovery.  Devi Veturi is the young woman who attempts suicide in the beginning of the novel, but because of the luck she has in having a meddling mother such as Saroj, Devi's life is saved and she moves in with her parents while she recuperates. <br /> <br />The story takes place in Northern California's famous Silicon Valley.  Devi and her family have been in the States for several decades, and are very rooted in the culture of American life.  However, their Indian traditions are also a big part of their lives, and one aspect is food.  Devi stops speaking after her suicide attempt, but she learns to communicate by cooking.  She creates all sorts of wonderful Indian and not-so Indian recipes, with each one revealing how she is feeling at the moment.  At the same time, she starts a journal where she writes her innermost thoughts, a device that allows the reader inside her head and eventually finding out the root of her depression.   <br /> <br />SERVING CRAZY WITH CURRY sounds as if it could be a downer, but it's not.  Reading the story of Devi and her family is like watching a Bollywood movie. It's entertaining; it will make you laugh.  But at the same time, the reader will get to the heart of Devi's soul, and will begin to understand her story and the anguish she is going through while trying to stay sane in a complicated world.  I really enjoyed this book by Amulya Malladi.  I loved all three of her books and recommend them all.  She has written three very distinct books, which I find refreshing in an author.  A reader will never know what to expect with each new book.  SERVING CRAZY is probably the best written of all three, and I highly recommend it. I am also looking forward to reading her next book!	2004-11-10

THE VINEYARD is not going to be one of my favorites, but I think I'm going to remember it mainly because I had a hard time liking the main character. <br /> <br />Olivia Jones restores old photographs for a living.  She's a single mother, with a daughter (Tess) who has a learning disability. The reader will discover that Olivia is a person that deals with a rough reality by hiding behind daydreams.  She in particular finds herself dreaming about the people in the photographs she restores, including a series of them sent to her boss, Otis, by a woman who runs a vineyard.   <br /> <br />Natalie Seebring is Otis' client, a woman who is in her twilight years and needs an assistant to help write her life story.  Olivia accidentally comes across this request for Otis to recommend someone to fulfill this task, and soon she is dreaming of being that assistant, imagining what each person in those photographs is like.  Believe it or not, she soon finds herself working for the matriarch of this family, and she and Tess move to the vineyard to spend the summer there. <br /> <br />The story takes on two main plots.  While the story of Natalie's life is being told, the reader will learn about her childhood, how she meets her deceased husband Alexander, as well as how she met her current fianc, Carl.  The second plot involves Olivia, and a man she meets at the vineyard, Simon, who also happens to be Carl's son.  Simon and Olivia seem to have something in common, and that is, they are both afraid to venture forth into a relationship with the opposite sex.  But both are obviously attracted to each other, and their romance evolves slowly as the story moves on. <br /> <br />Other characters come into play, in particular the grown children of Natalie, Susanne and Greg, and a third child, Brad, who remains a mystery throughout most of thebook.  His story comes out at the very end, and although I had suspected some of what was to be revealed, I was still somewhat shocked, just as the characters in the book were, too. <br /> <br />While I don't recommend this book as a first time reader to Barbara Delinsky's books, I believe that those who enjoyed her more recent books may enjoy this one.  The irritating characters of Olivia and Tess, however, may grate on some nerves, as it did mine.  Olivia is a very weak, naive, type of person, and I found it very difficult to feel sorry for a woman that dealt with reality by hiding in daydreams and believing them to be true.  Her daughter was a bratty young girl who unfortunately got picked on a lot by her peers, mostly because of her attitude and inability to make friends with others, and not by her disability as mother and daughter are led to believe.   <br /> <br />On the other hand, I think an author is doing a good job if a reader can feel intense dislike or like for an invented character. I had no problems with the writing.  And I looked forward to reading each chapter as I read about Natalie's life story. Overall, I enjoyed THE VINEYARD and as always, look forward to reading more by Barbara Delinksy.	2004-11-09

While I had a hard time enjoying that first novel in this series that takes place mostly in Louisiana, THE SECRET DAUGHTER was a much more enjoyable read. <br /> <br />\\"The secret daughter\\" is in reference to Noelani Hana, a \\"hapa\\" girl who also is the illegitimate daughter of Duke Fontaine, the patriarch of the Fontaine family who died with his wife in a plane crash.  At the end of CASEY'S GAMBLE, the family learns of Duke and Angelique's death, but are also told that there is a third child of Duke, Noelani, that lives on Maui and is going to inherit part of the estate.  The other two grown children are Casey (Cassandra) and Jackson, both of whom work on the sugar plantation that has belonged to the Fontaines for generations.   <br /> <br />Noelani herself has worked the sugar plantations on Maui all her life.  She and her mother before her worked for Bruce Shiller's sugar plantation, and even after her mother had passed on, Noelani stayed on with Bruce.  <br /> <br />In the introduction, the reader gets a glimpse of Noelani's life on Maui, but she is soon en route to Louisiana to meet her half brother and sister, and to see what she has inherited from a father she has never met.  She senses hostility from Casey, but Jackson welcomes her to their home with open arms.   <br /> <br />Before she meets her new family, however, she comes across Adam Ross, who is helping to restore parts of BelleFontaine, which almost burned down due to suspected arson. Casey at first thinks Adam is her half brother Jackson, but soon learns that Adam is a friend of the family. She also finds herself attracted to him, but refuses to get involved with him, knowing she is leaving for home as soon as the will is read. <br /> <br />Things change asNoelani gets to know her new family.  She finds herself liking her aunt Esme, Duke's sister, who is now the matriarch of the family.  And she also falls in love with Jackson's young daughter Megan, who was also a product of an unwed relationship.  <br /> <br />The longer Noelani stays on the plantation, the more she finds herself at home, especially at the sugar mill.  She also finds herself opening up to Adam, and the two of them become close.  She does make sure he understands that she plans on going home to Maui and the Shiller plantation, where she belongs. Adam, on the other hand, does his best to convince her to stay.   <br /> <br />Noelani's love of the life on a sugar plantation pulls her in two directions. She also finds herself falling in love with Adam.  She doesn't think she belongs on the mainland, but will her love for Adam convince her to stay, or is love not enough to tear her away from her beloved island? <br /> <br />I have to admit that of all the books I have read by Ms Fox, this was my least favorite. I think my problem is that I am not really \\"into\\" this trilogy and for me, it doesn't work.  However, I enjoy her writing so much that anything she writes tends to be enjoyable for me.  I do plan on reading more books by Roz Denny Fox, and will give THE SECRET DAUGHTER a three star rating.	2004-11-05

I know there are a lot of Marian Keyes fans out there that have loved this book, SUSHI FOR BEGINNERS. This is only my second book I've read by her, ANGELS having been my first, and I gave it three stars.  SUSHI FOR BEGINNERS I am also ranking three stars, but it's close to 3 .  Here's why:    I think Marian Keyes has a gift for creating funny characters.  I do find myself chuckling as I read her books, and that is a good thing.  On the other hand, the problem I have with her characters is that they don't always seem \\"real\\".  She has them do illogical things, or they may end up with someone that I can't see how it even happened.  When I say \\"illogical\\", I don't mean \\"silly\\" or \\"crazy\\".  What I mean is that she doesn't think her characters out all the way, so that she has them behaving in ways they shouldn't.     Because of this, I find myself rather disappointed by the end of the book.  This was the case with SUSHI FOR BEGINNERS.  Without giving it away, I did not see how one main character ended up with another character (some of the signs were there, but their interactions with each other were not enough, in my opinion, to have them put them together as a couple). I also did not see any chemistry or any reason for one or the other to want to get together.  It just did not make any sense.  On the other hand, I did approve of another couple getting together, because it made a lot of sense and I was also rooting for them.    To sum up, SUSHI FOR BEGINNERS is about a start up magazine in Ireland and the employees that work for it. Ashling Kennedy has just been sacked by another magazine, and finds herself working for Londoner Lisa Edwards at the new \\"Colleen\\" magazine. Lisa is known to be a [...] when it comes to the work place and focuses so much on her career that her marriage has fallen apart.  At the start of the book, she is already separated from her husband and buries herself in work to try to forget him.  Ashling is also dealing with a broken relationship, and is afraid to start up with someone new until she hits the comedy club circuit with friends Ted and Joy and meets a comedian, Marcus.      The good thing about SUSHI FOR BEGINNERS is the fun you'll have with the characters and the chuckles you will have when you read about them. If you don't take this book seriously, you will enjoy it.  For those who are looking for a much better written book, this is not it.  I suggest trying a book written by Jane Green.	2004-11-03

CARAMELO by Sandra Cisneros <br />October 30, 2004 <br /> <br />I found CARAMELO by Sandra Cisneros a fun rambling novel that spanned several generations of a Mexican American family. Celaya, or Lala as she is called, is the narrator for the most part, with other family members interjecting their opinions here and there throughout the novel.   <br /> <br />The book starts with the family taking off from Chicago, their current home, in three cars to make the annual trek down to Mexico to visit with \\"The Grandmother\\".  Once they arrive in Mexico, Lala begins the story of The Grandmother, and how their family came to be.   <br /> <br />I had a wonderful time reading this one.  It was not just the story that was so riveting, although the Grandmother's story kept my attention.  It was the way the story was told, by Lala and her grandmother, as the two went back and forth, trying to get the story straight.  Lala learns about her grandmother's early years and how she met the grandfather, Narcisco (Inocencio).  It's a story that spans two countries and although on the surface it could appear this is all about Lala's family history, it is also about Lala, and how she is looking for self esteem and pride in her family and ethnic roots.  I personally would recommend this to everyone, but not all are willing to read novels that ramble in the style of the Hispanic storyteller.  I say take a chance, and read CARAMELO.  It's worth the time spent.	2004-10-31

He was once a lawyer working for a successful law firm Carthy, Williams, and Douglas, but due to a mistake he made by getting involved with a client causes his dismissal. The mistake had eventually led to the murder of this client, and now Hammond lives with the guilt of her death on his conscience.   <br /> <br />Fast-forward several years and he involves himself in the death of a college friend. It appears to be suicide, but clues tell Hammond that it looks like murder.  He takes it upon himself to find out who killed Doug Townsend, and this in turn leads him to a beautiful opera diva who is battling a past of her own. <br /> <br />I have to admit, although this book did interest me and I wanted to know how it ended, a lot of the plot seemed implausible.  I didn't mind that many of the lesser characters were no more than caricatures, but the opera singer, Michele Sonnier, turned out to be very unbelievable.  A lot of her past did not mesh with what she came to be in the present, and I just did not buy it.   <br /> <br />I feel that Arvin has talent, but he needs to learn to develop his characters with more realism and logic.  Without believable characters populating a novel, it's hard to believe in the plot.  This book is marginally recommended.	2004-10-30

I've read BABYVILLE, which I enjoyed, and BOOKENDS, which I did not.  Each novel so far has been different, and she gets better with each new book.  In this novel, she writes about a woman who is married to a man she thinks she's in love with, and spends her life doing all she can to please him.  It takes a big life change to make her see that what she thought was love was something else. <br /> <br />Alice Chambers is married to what she thinks is the perfect man.  Joe is good-looking, highly successful in his career, and the fact that he's married to Alice always amazes her. She grew up being the wallflower, the girl that wasn't popular, the girl that men never noticed. However, she had always fancied Joe as a teenager, but it wasn't until he met her through her catering company did he notice her at all.   <br /> <br />Joe saw in Alice a woman he could mold into the perfect wife.  His many flings and affairs were with women that were glamorous and independent, with being blonde an important criteria.  Alice was none of these, but Joe knew that he could shape her into what he loved in a woman.  She would make him the perfect wife. <br /> <br />Alice does not notice what she is today is because of Joe.  She does all she can to please him, because she is afraid of losing him.  She loses weight, changes her wardrobe under his instruction, and gets her hair done to his liking.  Appearances are important to Joe, and if it makes him happy, it makes her happy too.  What Alice doesn't realize is that beneath the surface, she is not happy at all.   <br /> <br />Their early years together were wonderful, but Alice soon notices that Joe is not as affectionate as he once was, is often at the office late, and they rarely make love. Joe explains to her that his career is important, and she believes him.  She believes that he's out every night working hard and meeting with clients.  <br /> <br />Then, Joe is asked to transfer to New York, due to an indiscretion between Joe and a fellow employee.  Alice is upset to be moving away from all that she loves, including her best friend Emily, but it doesn't take long for things to change.  While they keep an apartment in Manhattan for Joe during the week, they also invest in a home in the country, a huge lot where there is room to build.  Alice falls in love with the property, and begins transforming the place. And in essence, Alice herself is transformed.  No longer is she dressed up in designer outfits.  She discovers she's happier dressed down in jeans and tee shirt, she puts on some weight, she stops wearing make-up and she begins to make friends with the local women.  While she hated the social scene in London, she finds that she actually loves to socialize with her new friends in Connecticut. It seems that the move to the States was what Alice needed. <br /> <br />Joe, on the other hand, was hoping for a fresh start with Alice, but as time goes by, he realizes he hates it in the country, and loves it in Manhattan.  And his wandering eyes being to wander once again.  Will he ever be faithful to Alice, the woman he truly loves with all his heart?  Or will he continue to stray, finding the excitement of an illicit affair what he needs to keep happy? <br /> <br />I was surprised to find that I enjoyed TO HAVE AND TO HOLD as much as I did.  Jane Green has written a number of books, and judging by the books I have read so far, this one seems to be the most developed of the three.  For its genre, I found it to be perfectly written, and she has always been good with developing characters that feel real.  The character of Alice Chambers is someone you want to cheer on, and you want her to have a happy ending.  And Joe was the perfect cheating husband.  Green develops all her characters enough to make them more than just one-dimensional people, and it helps makeher books that much more enjoyable. TO HAVE AND TO HOLD is highly recommended.	2004-10-27

LINCOLN by John Jakes <br />October 22, 2004 <br /> <br />I've read a number of books by John Jakes, and this one is definitely going to be remembered as my least favorite.  John Jakes is known for his epic-like historical novels that have almost soap-opera-ish story lines, but they are great entertainment and always are known for name-dropping.  And while SAVANNAH does include a few famous historical characters, for the most part it is does not compare to the likes of THE KENT FAMILY CHRONICLES or the NORTH AND SOUTH trilogy.    <br /> <br />SAVANNAH is a much simpler novel, a story focusing on several people living in the South at the height of the Civil War.  It takes place in this famous town of Georgia, and reads pretty much like a Young Adult novel, which I suspect, was intentional.  This story line leads to Christmas, and one can imagine that Jakes wanted this book to be read by young and old alike.  <br /> <br />One of the main characters is Harriet, a precocious twelve-year old who is outspoken and head strong.  She is an endearing character, stands out and helps makes the novel interesting.  In fact, the characters are what kept me reading.  Jakes has a talent for creating characters that are likeable, and he uses them to tell his stories that are right out of the history books.  This book would have been so much better if it were geared towards adults, but it is possible Jakes wanted to try something different.  I am not sorry for having read SAVANNAH, but it is not a book I would highly recommend except for the most ardent fan.	2004-10-23

THE KITE RUNNER by Khaled Hosseini <br />October 21, 2004 <br /> <br />This book will definitely end up on my top 20 list for 2004.  What a wonderful story!  THE KITE RUNNER by Khaled Hosseini is a complex look into the relationship of two boys that grow up together in Afghanistan in the 1970's. And at the same time the backdrop is Afghanistan, starting with life before the Russian invasion, the invasion itself, and finally the country run by the Taliban. The author did a great job weaving his story of these two boys and paralleling it with the history of modern Afghanistan, writing one hell of a book. <br /> <br />The novel goes back and forth in time, starting with Amir as an adult living in Northern California.  We learn about his life through his eyes as he narrates the story, taking the reader via flashbacks to his childhood. His early childhood was mixed with frustration and anger over a father that seemed to have no love, no pride, and no time for Amir.   <br /> <br />Amir and his father Baba lived as part of a privileged society in Afghanistan, his father being very wealthy and well loved by all. They had servants, Ali and his son Hassan, who were pretty much part of their family for as long as Amir remembers.  The main distinction, however, is that Hassan and Ali are a part of a lower \\"caste\\" in the social ranking in Afghanistan, and therefore Hassan and Amir's relationship was based on this invisible boundary that kept them from becoming real friends.  It affected how Amir treated Hassan, and how they behaved in public when they were with Amir's friends.  Although Baba, Amir's father, always treated Hassan and Ali as family, Amir finds himself sometimes treating Hassan as a second-class citizen, for reasons the reader will come to understand. <br /> <br />Their relationship is rather complex, but what destroys it is an act of betrayal that occurs to Hassan after the two boys win the kite-flying contest. The contest raises Amir's esteem in the eyes of his father. However, the act of betrayal destroys whatever trust Hassan had in Amir, and Amir, on the other hand, feels such deep guilt that it destroys their friendship, which in turn changes their \\"family\\" structure.  Amir's refusal to come to Hassan's aid when he needed him the most is the turning point of both their lives.  Amir carries this guilt with him into adulthood, and it shapes everything he does and all that he tries to become. <br /> <br />I can go on and on with this review, but I will cut it short and say that this is one of the best books I've read all year.  The book was not what I had expected, which I thought would be a dry non-fiction book about the war in Afghanistan. Instead, it is a story of a man that lives with tremendous guilt most of his life due to a friendship he took for granted, while the novel parallels what has been going on in Afghanistan. It's a very powerful book with a strong message, and one of the few books I consider to be \\"perfect\\".	2004-10-23

THE MANGO SEASON by Amulya Malladi <br />October 17, 2004 <br /> <br />Amulya Malladi's second novel, THE MANGO SEASON, takes the reader back to India with Priya, who has a great career in Silicon Valley and lives in San Francisco with her boyfriend Nick. What her parents do not know, is the fact that Priya HAS a boyfriend, and he is not Indian.  They are under the assumption that she is currently single, that she is going to eventually marry a nice Indian boy that is arranged by her parents and his parents, and will live happily ever after. Priya's mission: to return home to India to announce her engagement to her American boyfriend. <br /> <br />Telling her family is a lot harder than she had expected, and Priya procrastinates telling them the truth.  In the meantime, she gets involved with the goings on of her family, takes part in the mango season, and finds herself getting back into every day life in India.  She's been away for many years now, and realizes that she no longer feels comfortable in her homeland, but would rather be \\"home\\" in America.  <br />She fights with her mother every day, and misses Nick with a passion. <br /> <br />Unfortunately for her, Priya's parents decide that she was getting too old to be single with no marriage prospects. Before she can tell them about her engagement, they arrange for her to meet a nice Indian boy from a good Indian family, to see if they will agree to marry! Things had gotten bad to worse. <br /> <br />For those readers who have read Malladi's first book A BREATH OF FRESH AIR, THE MANGO SEASON is quite different in tone and in setting. Her first book was about Indian people during the time of the Bhopal disaster, and how it affected one couple that lived during that time in the 1970's.  THE MANGO SEASON deals with Indians who have moved to America and are living a multi-cultural existence, which goes against what their parents' generation believe.  Priya has a hard time accepting that her parents will never understand her desire to marry Nick, or to have anything to do with people that are not from India.  A BREATH OF FRESH AIR was serious in tone, while THE MANGO SEASON is a light comedy, but filled with enough tension to keep the reader going.  It also deals with the mother-daughter relationship, which many will relate to, regardless of ethnic background.   <br /> <br />I am recommending THE MANGO SEASON for being a fast read, filled with interesting characters and a lot of drama.  It was yet another good book from Ms Malladi, and I will definitely be reading more by her.	2004-10-18

The novel features characters that appear in his previous two books, A PARCHMENT OF LEAVES and his first, CLAY'S QUILT. All three are wonderful books that center on life in the Kentucky mountains, families that built their lives around the coalmines in the early to mid-twentieth century. <br /> <br />In THE COAL TATTOO, the two main characters are sisters Anneth and Easter, who are as different as night and day.  Anneth is wild and unleashed, while Easter is a born-again Christian.  Their story is a tale of two sisters who love each other, but find that their differences tear them apart. <br /> <br />What I love about these books is the depth that Silas House goes to describe his characters.  One feels that these characters are part of one's own family, or maybe a reader may want to meet these characters, because House creates characters that are truly real and three-dimensional.  I felt at home with his characters from A PARCHMENT OF LEAVES, and I feel the same with THE COAL TATTOO. He also does a good job at describing the lives of these people, and it feels like I am with them, in the bar dancing up a storm, or in church singing with the choir.   <br /> <br />These three books are what I call period pieces, and reflect a time long gone.  History and technology has changed what this fictional place may have been like half a century ago, but they remain unchanged in these books by Silas House.  I highly recommend reading all his books.  These are not easy reads, but one will feel a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction after experiencing these books.  THE COAL TATTOO is no exception, and the Ratmammy rates it five stars.	2004-10-16

Erica Johnson has just returned from a three week vacation, and finds that there have been a series of fires occurring five days apart all over the San Francisco Bay area. She's part of the Insurance Crime Prevention Bureau, and it is her job to investigate fires to determine whether they are arson or not. Lt. Matt Nichols is the new guy on the San Francisco Special Investigation Squad, having just transferred from Homicide. He's in charge of this investigation, and as he fills her in on the details, she finds an instant dislike to him. But at the same time, she is also very attracted to him. He's gruff and aggressive, and gives her the impression he doesn't like her very much. He's quite the opposite of his predecessor, Charlie, who had a great rapport with Erica. She can't help but compare the two men. Unfortunately, Charlie's retired, and now she's stuck with Matt.<br /><br />There is a reason why Erica chose her line of work. Her mother had died in a fire years ago, and Erica subconsciously has a need to find out why her mother died. She blames herself for the death, but her memories are blank and she can never explain why she feels this way. Matt has some issues of his own.  When he meets Erica, he is reminded of someone from his past, and then realizes that Erica reminds him of the only love of his life, Lynne. Their story is also tragic, with the story ending with her death.<br /><br />As the two of them work together to solve the mystery of these fires, the sparks begin to fly. Even their co-workers sense the attraction, and the two of them are teased constantly. Although it may have seemed unlikely that the two of them got involved romantically in the first place, the authors made the transition from antagonistic co-workers to lovers smoothly and logically.<br /><br />While the romance story line is handled quite nicely, there is also the story line that involves the mystery behind the fires. Some readers may find hard to swallow that the fires all seem to point to someone in Erica's family. It makes for a good story, however, only if one can get past the coincidence that her entire family is on the suspect list. One by one, it appears that any of her immediate family had a reason for starting the fires, especially after a body is found at one of the buildings that was destroyed in the fires; someone that had a close connection to Erica's Aunt Ronya.<br /><br />ASHES is a cleverly written romantic suspense novel, complete with a couple of dead bodies and a mystery that will keep the readers guessing. The romance did not overshadow the plot dealing with the arson cases, but should be enough to satisfy the average romance reader. Readers of suspense may enjoy this novel for it's \\"whodunit\\" aspect, and it kept this reviewer stumped until the very end. The last scene between Erica and her father may have been over-dramatic, but it wasn't too over done. The epilogue may have been too sugary for this reviewer's taste, but all in all, ASHES comes recommended.	2004-10-12

Stress and the City by Stephanie Rowe <br />October 11, 2004 <br /> <br />Courtesy of WWW.loveromances.com <br /> <br />STRESS AND THE CITY by Stephanie Rowe is part of the Harlequin Flipside series, books that have a lighter, humorous edge to the romance novel. In this book, the female lead character, Cassie Halloway, has just returned from the Bahamas, having gone on her honeymoon alone. She had decided to call off the wedding after she had found her fianc with another woman, but because she couldn't get a refund, she goes to the Bahamas by herself. <br /> <br />She's now back in the States, it is New Year's Eve, and Cassie and her best friend, Leo (Leonore) are at a party being held, of all places, in a school gym in Gardenbloom, Connecticut.  She tries to have a good time, but unfortunately she spots ex-fianc Drew Smothers at the party as well. The good thing is, Cassie has just met a very eligible bachelor (or so she thinks) and when Drew walks up to her to say hello, the bachelor, Ty, intuitively notices that Cassie has no desire to speak to Drew. As Drew tries to worm his way into the conversation, Ty wraps his arm around her waist, pretending to be her date. As Drew continues to blather on, Cassie can see no other way out of this situation, and plants a big kiss on Ty's lips, to Ty's and Drew's surprise. <br /> <br />And so starts the hilarious \\"relationship\\" between Ty and Cassie.  Cassie finds out soon enough that Ty happens to be her newest client. She is a stress-management consultant, and feels she's the best there is. Ty is obviously under some stress, since he had sought out her services, but now that he knows who she is, he tries to back out of his appointments. Cassie loves a challenge; she also can't stop thinking about him and that kiss. Convinced that it's her duty to fix Ty and make him \\"stress-free\\", she pursues him like a shark and does her best to finish the job he hired her for. <br /> <br />Her main problem with this job, however, is thathe won't tell her what is making him stressed.  She does learn one thing about Ty, however, and that happens to be the fact that he's engaged to a woman named Alexis. Cassie doesn't let on how much she hates this mystery woman, but she puts all feelings aside and tries to be the professional that she is. Alexis is coming \\"home\\" to Ty in a few weeks, to finally move in with her beloved.  It is up to Cassie to make sure that Ty is ready for Alexis' arrival, but deep down she hopes that Alexis never shows up. So, Cassie spends a lot of time devouring tons of chocolate to relieve her OWN stress. <br /> <br />STRESS AND THE CITY was a near-perfect romantic comedy, except for one blaring error. While the author chose to set the story in the United States, the characters are obviously British. It is never stated but one assumes the characters are American because of the location of this story, but when a character says the words \\"sod\\" and \\"ducky\\", they are not American. It can make one feel slightly disoriented for a few minutes.  But other than that, the book was very enjoyable. Chocoholics will appreciate Cassie's addiction to the substance in times of stress. Lovers of romantic comedies will appreciate this book. If the rest of the FLIPSIDE series are as fun as STRESS AND THE CITY, this reviewer is definitely going to invest some time and money into the remaining books in the series.  <br /> <br />	2004-10-12

Her sister, Ellie, the local librarian, still lives in Millbrook in the home that belonged to their grandmother, the woman who raised the three sisters, while Abby left town years ago and had been working in Boston as a scientist.    Abby has dreaded coming home. She has bitter memories of their childhood and the classmates who constantly made fun of the three sisters. Abby left home never expecting to return, and now she is about to face her hometown once more for the sake of a job. It is only for a few months, and she loves her career so much that it was worth returning home.    Barely back in town, Abby and Ellie are about to order a meal at the Afternoon Delight when someone from the past recognizes Abby. It's Chase Jordan, whom Abby had such a crush on back in high school, but being the class nerd, no one had paid any attention to her back then, except to taunt and tease. She didn't think Chase would even remember her.    When Chase sees Abby, he is astounded at how beautiful she has become. But he still views her as the stuck up girl he remembers from high school. Abby, on the other hand, is so choked up she can barely speak. She still has feelings for Chase, but thinks he would never feel the same way for her. She still sees herself as the insecure girl from the past. Besides, she has a boyfriend back home, Nelson, who she feels is her perfect life partner. She will not betray Nelson and decides that she can never act upon this crush she has for Chase.    Later that week, Abby attends a party at her boss's home, and finds that many of her old classmates are there as well. It's not a very comfortable situation for her, thinking they will ridicule her as they did when they were kids. While her former classmates welcome her back to town, Abby finds it difficult to feel the same friendly feelings towards them. Chase again notices her rude behavior, and gets the impression that she feels she's better than the rest of them.    After an embarrassing altercation with one of her former classmates, Abby cannot wait to leave the party, and as she finds her way to her car, she hears Chase trying to start up his old truck. Abby seeks him out. This chance encounter allows Chase to see a different side of Abby, and he wants to get to know her better.  He asks her out on a date, but Abby tells him she has a significant other, and says she can only be a friend to Chase, nothing more.    As the two get to know each other as \\"friends\\", both have a hard time holding back their feelings.  Abby questions whether she should be loyal to Nelson, or move on with Chase. And Chase finds that the more he gets to know Abby, the more he likes her as a person.    This reviewer was pleasantly surprised with GETTING WHAT YOU WANT.  It was more than just a romance, and while a lot of romances only touch on the \\"relationship\\" aspect and \\"getting there\\", this novel went into the dynamics of the relationship, comparing Abby's feelings of isolation and loneliness as a child, to Chase's feelings of insecurity as a man. Many romances often only explore the here and now, but in GETTING WHAT YOU WANT, the romance novel becomes a little bit more complex. It was interesting how the author worked this part of the story into the romance, and it worked out quite well.  Along those same lines, it's the characters that make a romance work, not necessarily the situation, and the author did a good job developing not only the protagonist and the leading man, but also the minor characters were developed into three dimensional people that \\"felt real\\".  GETTING WHAT YOU WANT comes highly recommended.WHAT YOU WANT comes highly recommended. <br /> <br />	2004-10-12

Sometimes Naughty, Sometimes Nice by Kimberley Raye <br />October 11, 2004 <br /> <br />Courtesy of WWW.loveromances.com <br /> <br />What do you get when you have a woman who owns a company named \\"Wild Woman Inc\\", a manufacturer of erotic toys?  You get SOMETIMES NAUGHTY, SOMETIMES NICE by Kimberly Raye, the second in a trilogy of books featuring three sisters raised by a woman who calls herself a \\"womanist\\".  Jacqueline Farrel is mom, and she's a famous sexologist with her own television show. She's the guru of the womanist movement, women who are aware of their femininity but are not dependent on men.  She doesn't believe in marriage, and in fact, she is not married to the sisters' father, Donovan Martin. Both parents are busy with their own careers and don't live in the same house most of the year. In this second novel, the main focus is on Xandra Farrel. <br /> <br />Xandra has just lost her live-in boyfriend Mark, who had fit perfectly into the role of the \\"holy commitment trinity\\". They had great sex, respected each other, and had common interests. According to her mother, these were the perfect relationship traits, and once you had them, you could not go wrong.  Obviously this didn't apply to Xandra and Mark, since he decided they were no longer a perfect fit. <br /> <br />The book is filled with humorous scenes, such as the opening chapter, in which Xandra is upset that she's found a gray pubic hair. She vents her frustrations on Albert, her chief engineer and close confidante, and he tries to reassure her that her life is not over.  <br /> <br />So, she decides that her new goal in life is to have babies. However, her mother had always taught them that there is no need for marriage. Time is running out, as her body is reaching that stage in life where she may no longer have viable eggs. Mark has spoiled it all by walking out on her, so now she has to rush to find a man that will contribute his sperm. <br /> <br />Enter Beau Hollister, the owner of \\"Hunks for Hire\\", who is going to renovate Xandra's home. The bad news is Beau is the first boy she tried to have sex with back in high school. The key word is \\"tried\\", since Beau was over and done with his part before she had a chance to blink. The event was so embarrassing that neither Beau nor Xandra want to rehash it. <br /> <br />Xandra in the mean time invents a new sex paraphernalia that she thinks is going to be the biggest toy in the industry. But she needs to test it out on a few people. After trying it out with her King Kong vibrator (she always tests out all new products) she gets it in her mind that Beau would be the perfect candidate. If this new contraption can make sex with Beau exhilarating, she has it made. Her next goal - seduce Beau into wanting to have sex with her. It's not an easy task. <br /> <br />This reviewer had mixed feelings for SOMETIMES NAUGHTY, SOMETIMES NICE. The overall story was original and fun. There was plenty of humor to make one chuckle. The problem had to do with the characters. Too many were introduced at once in the beginning of the book. Granted, this was the second in a trilogy of books; however, the reader should not have to read the first book to enjoy the second. This reviewer feels that a good romance introduces minor characters slowly, and does not make too many of these characters as important as the two main characters, the male and female leads. The character of Jacqueline Farrel is made to be as important as Xandra. It was frustrating to switch gears from Xandra, who was looking for a love interest, to her mother's personal life and her television show.  This entire segment of the novel could have been left out. <br /> <br />Another problem with the characters was that their personalities felt forced. It felt as if they had been created mainly to fit the story line, and not the other way around. Although the characters in some way did evolve and grow, they felt too rigid and structured in the beginning.  By the end of the story, the main male and female characters had resolved their differences, as in any romance, but the jump from point A to point B did not feel natural. <br /> <br />Despite these negative points, this reviewer gives three stars for SOMETIMES NAUGHTY, SOMETIMES NICE. It is still a good beach read and a nice way to pass the time.  <br /> <br />	2004-10-12

This book has made me a fan for life, and although I've been told most of her books are as good as this one, I can imagine that a \\"bad\\" book by Lipman will still be a passable read.   <br /> <br />Harriet Mahoney finds herself going nowhere in the world of writing. Her dream is to have a book published, and she is currently writing a novel based on her parents' life.  She belongs to a writing group, where she does not feel she totally belongs, and she is in a long-term relationship with a man that only cares about his bagel business.   <br /> <br />Harriet soon finds herself without a boyfriend and without a place to stay. She and Kenny had been together for twelve years, when he tells her he's met someone else, the love of his life and they are now engaged to be married. Out of the blue, she gets an offer to ghost write a story by an infamous adulteress, Isabel Krug, and Harriet finds herself moving into a mansion in a New England town called Truro.  The neighbors despise the mansion for being \\"more Malibu than Cape Cod\\". But Harriet loves her new home, and is now on her way to getting to know her new employer, who was in bed with her married lover when his wife shot him to death. <br /> <br />Isabel Krug is a woman of mystery.  What's not mysterious about her is her need for attention and drama in her life.  It is evident in her choice of men (two of whom were married at the time she got involved with them) and her desire to write a book about the murder that made her famous. Harriet suspects that she was hired not just to write this story for Isabel, but to be a companion to this woman, who lives alone with her handy-man Pete, and a man Harriet later finds out is her husband, Costas. Isabel needs Harriet just as much as Harriet needs Isabel. <br /> <br />As Harriet learns more about the murder of Guy Van Fleet, the more she learns about Isabel and her wild and crazy past.  Lipman has a knack for writing witty and intelligent passages and I found myself laughing throughout the book.  Lipman also does a wonderful job building up the character of Isabel Krug, who was larger than life but yet written in quite a believable fashion.  What I loved most of all was the friendship that developed between Harriet, the very insecure writer with low self-esteem, and Isabel, who was beautiful and glamorous and belonged with the rich and famous.  Lipman paints Isabel as a woman in need of attention, but someone who is compassionate and understanding, too. Harriet grows with the help of Isabel, as she slowly gains confidence in herself and finds out truly what makes her happy, and it isn't her \\"passion\\" for writing. ISABEL'S BED is highly recommended by this reader!	2004-10-10
496122:US	51214937	R3UA3KCP9R2I0M	0140293248	221101137	The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing	Books	4	4	5	N	Y	A different type of book	THE GIRLS GUIDE TO HUNTING AND FISHING by Melissa Bank <br />October 7, 2004 <br /> <br />THE GIRLS GUIDE TO HUNTING AND FISHING is not a novel.  It's a series of stories (some that had been published previously) centering on Jane Rosenal, starting from the age of fourteen through middle age.  Each story reveals something different about her, puts her in different situations, and in nearly every single story, it is told with a lot of wit and sassy humor.  I found myself chuckling through some of the earlier stories, and found myself empathizing with her in another story (about her father dying from cancer). <br /> <br />I don't know of any other way to describe this \\"novel\\".  It isn't a novel and so there was no climax or high point at the end of the last chapter.  However, I did feel a sense of \\"ending\\" with that last story, feeling that maybe Jane had finally found someone that she may love for the rest of her life, or maybe as she said \\"We are just two mayflies mating on a summer night\\".  Very profound.   <br /> <br />My overall feeling about this \\"book\\" is that I loved it, mainly because it is not what I had expected.  With a title such as THE GIRLS GUIDE TO HUNTING AND FISHING, I expected a tale centering on a teenage girl living in Wisconsin, for instance.  What I did not expect was a coming-of-age series of short stories, chronicling the life of one woman from New England, along with her desires, thoughts, and opinions. I found it unique and it kept my attention throughout the entire book.  <br /> <br />The middle story, which many readers have questioned, bothers me as well.  But, from what I feel after reading this book, it was just a \\"lull\\", a transition story, in which Jane had moved into her deceased aunt's apartment, and it signified a big change in her life (her starting her relationship with her aunt's friend Archie). It was a rather weird blip in this series of stories, and that is only my guess as to why it appeared in the book.  Other than that, Ihave no real complaints about THE GIRLS GUIDE TO HUNTING AND FISHING.  With that said, I don't think this is a book that any reader can enjoy.  One needs to be in a certain frame of mind, and come to the book not expecting anything in particular, or you may be disappointed.	2004-10-08

QUEEN OF DREAMS is the fourth novel by Divakaruni that I've read and it did not disappoint.  For those who have read her books, this one resembles VINE OF DESIRE the most, with both taking place in the Bay Area of Northern California, but at the same time has references that lead back to India.  Both books relate to the immigrant's life in California, and how their life has changed since leaving their homeland.   <br /> <br />But that is where the resemblance stops.  In QUEEN OF DREAMS, the focus is on relationships, mostly between a mother, Mrs. Gupta, and her adult daughter Rahki.  While VINE OF DESIRE was rooted in the physical world, QUEEN OF DREAMS flows into the world of dreams, as Mrs. Gupta has the ability to decipher them, be it her own or others. She has the ability to help others through their dreams, and this is what drives her. While mother and daughter are close, this is one area that Rahki is not allowed to trespass.  She desires her mother's talent, but it was not passed on to her. It leaves Rahki bitter and resentful that she cannot share in this part of her mother's life. <br /> <br />The book follows Rahki's attempts to understand her mother better, and at the same time the reader, and later Rahki, are allowed to see what Mrs. Gupta's dream journal confesses.  The journal tells Mrs. Gupta's story, from her days in India to her dreams that foretell her death.  <br /> <br />Rahki, in the meantime, is newly divorced and living with her young daughter Jona.  She is trying to survive by running a coffeehouse and selling her paintings, hoping to be \\"discovered\\" one day.  She also has to deal with her ex-husband Sonny, who is in her life almost every day because of their daughter.  She has not forgiven Sonny for something that happened during their marriage, and she has never told her family about this incident, which led to their divorce.   <br /> <br />I enjoyed QUEEN OF DREAMS as much as I have enjoyed her other novels.  I love how she blends in the culture of India, the Old World, with life in California.  She does a good job describing what it feels like to be an immigrant in the United States, as well as being the children of immigrants, not quite belonging to the new country and certainly not belonging to the homeland. The segments on dreams were done well enough that Divakaruni had me believing in them.  <br /> <br />She also did a good job showing how the characters related and reacted to September 11, which was the climax of the book. It brought back memories for me, showing how those of Middle Eastern descent and Indian descent, living in America, were treated due to the color of their skin, shortly after this horrific event. It again displayed the immigrant experience in America, one of the themes in QUEEN OF DREAMS.   <br /> <br />For those who enjoy reading about other cultures living in America, or those who enjoy stories of mothers and daughters, this book is for you.  I recommend this book heartily.	2004-10-04

These books showcase the light side of romance, a romantic comedy.  In this novel, protagonist Adrienne (Ari) Kelley is engaged to a very proper man Collin, a surgeon, and they are expected to marry soon.   <br /> <br />As the book opens, all Ari can think about is sex, and why it's not very fun doing it with Collin.  But she expects to marry Collin eventually. The thought never enters her mind to leave him until she meets Simon Masterson, who owns a company that manufactures answering machines. His latest \\"creation\\" is Cindy, the wonder of all answering machines. Ari had just written a thesis on the stress that answering machines create in the modern world. When her thesis makes headlines, this is how the two meet.  Collin hears about the news articles regarding her thesis, and decides he needs to fix this problem.  This type of marketing was not good for business. <br /> <br />This is the second FlipSide book I've read, and I was a little disappointed with this one.  My problem with the book was there was not much bulk to the story. The characters were one dimensional, which is ok with a romantic comedy, but I needed more than that.  I could not buy the fact that there was any real romance or chemistry between the two of them. I felt that the author did not do a good job in making this romance feel \\"real\\".   <br /> <br />On the other hand, I loved Ari's wacky family, which reminded me a lot of the family of Stephanie Plum in the Janet Evanovich series.  Ari's grandmother Bubbi was very much like Stephanie's grandmother in some ways (both are very crazy).  If it weren't for the family, this book would have been a disappointment. <br /> <br />I'm giving this book 3 stars for readability (it was a fast read) and it was funny in parts.  Unfortunately, I just did not care for the romance part of HUNG UP ON YOU.I hope to try one more FlipSide before I give up entirely on the series.	2004-10-02

DON'T CRY NOW by Joy Fielding <br />October 2, 2004 <br /> <br />This is my third Joy Fielding book and although I don't find her to be the perfect author, I do find that she tends to write such great page turners that one will ignore the faults of the book and read on until it's over. In DON'T CRY NOW, a woman discovers she doesn't know who to trust, having been told that someone is trying to kill her and her daughter.  <br /> <br />Bonnie has been married to her husband Rod for about six years now, and has a strained relationship with his ex-wife Joan.  The book opens with Joan calling Bonnie on the telephone to warn her that her life is in danger.  She begs Bonnie to meet her at an open house, which Joan is hosting (she is a real estate agent). But, by the time Bonnie arrives at the house, she finds Joan is dead, shot through the heart. Since Bonnie chose not to tell her husband or anyone else about this secret meeting, she has no alibi when the police come to inspect the murder scene. She becomes their first suspect. <br /> <br />Bonnie and Rod bring in the two children from his previous marriage, Lauren and Sam, to live with them after Joan's death and this itself adds tension to each scene.  The two teenagers never did show a fondness for Bonnie, and she has a rough time trying to convince them at first that she is on their side.  The two teens seem to get along fine with their stepsister Amanda, Bonnie and Rod's child, but they have a harder time accepting Bonnie as family. <br /> <br />She herself does not know whom to trust, and it leaves her sleepless at night. As the chapters turn, nearly every main character becomes a suspect, including her estranged brother Nick, her stepson Sam, and even her husband, who does not seem to have an alibi either.  <br /> <br />DON'T CRY NOW is another fast paced book that you will not want to put down.  Despite some flawed characters (it was hard to totally believe in the character of Bonnie, who seemed far less intelligent than the author meant her to be), the story line flowed from chapter to chapter.  Fielding does do a good job with character descriptions and developing them, but at times I find that she tweaks these characters to fit the story. I found it hard to believe whom the murder turned out to be. It felt like a contrived Hollywood script, but all in all, I am going to recommend this one because it WILL keep you up all night, wanting to find out whodunit.	2004-10-02

KEEPING FAITH by Janice MacDonald<br /><br />September 29, 2004<br /><br />In this Harlequin Superromance, a thirty-one-year old single mother finds herself confronting her ex-husband and her mother about some decisions that were made for her when her daughter was born six years ago. KEEPING FAITH's protagonist Hannah Riley finds out by accident that her mother lied to her then-husband Liam Tully, a full-time musician, telling him that Hannah had an abortion. This started off a string of events that led to their eventual divorce.<br /><br />When Hannah first meets Liam, it is in Ireland while on vacation, and he is singing with his Celtic folk band The Wild Rovers.  They fall in love and end up marrying on a whim.  Hannah's parents never approved of Liam, and her mother Margaret blames Liam for Hannah's father's death, as well as Hannah's nervous breakdown after their breakup.<br /><br />It is now six years later and Liam finally knows he has a daughter.  Hannah had assumed all these years that he wanted nothing to do with them, but now she knows the truth. Liam's dilemma is whether he really wants to get involved with Faith. He's not father material, and he loves his life as a musician, in the recording studio as well as touring on the road.  Faith, their daughter, has no idea she has a father.  She was told her father was in heaven.<br /><br />Hannah is angry with her mother for manipulating her life by lying to Liam about the baby.  She now feels it's Liam's right to see his daughter and to get to know her.  Margaret, however, has other plans for them, and does her best to discourage Liam from getting close to Hannah and Faith.<br /><br />As the story progresses, Hannah battles with her mother and questions whether her mother has as much right to Faith as Liam does.  It doesn't help that Hannah and Faith live with Margaret, where their every move is monitored and watched by the entire family. Hannah finds she does not have any privacy, and cannot do a thing without the scrutiny of everyone.  At the same time, she isn't sure if she wants to start up a relationship with Liam again. She never really stopped loving him, and neither did he. But is she making the same mistake twice?<br /><br />This is one Harlequin Superromance I have to say was so good I am rating it 5 stars.  MacDonald is a superb writer, and her skills as a novelist are almost too good to be relegated to just plain old romances.  Lots of interesting characters; she does an excellent job with creating these characters and making them feel real.  Great dialogue, and excellent plot, too.  I am definitely reading more by her, as I am sure each novel will be a page-turner as this one was.  Highly recommended.	2004-09-30

The book reads like a historical novel.  It starts with the birth of Emily, the main character of this book.  It is a tragic scene, ending with the death of her mother Rachael.  Seventeen years later, Emily is living with her mother's family, and has been treated like dirt all these years for reasons at first unknown to the reader.  She is treated like a servant, and is not given any love or affection except by her grandmother, who dies when Emily is only three years old. <br /> <br />Emily finds a way to escape, but not before she accidentally kills one of her uncles, and she is now on the run.  She makes her way to San Francisco, in search of a man that had supposedly befriended her mother before Emily's birth, and from there she soon finds a job as nanny to a wealthy man's two children. <br /> <br />Life sounds like it should have been grand at this point, but Emily sees and hears things in her new employer's home that causes her employer to threaten her and to warn her to mind her own business.  And she also finds her past continues to haunt her, never giving her peace of mind. <br /> <br />My overall opinion about A SONG FROM AN EMPTY FOREST is that I did enjoy the book. There were plenty of punctuation errors (excessive use of the comma, for example), but these were minor problems and did not really detract from the enjoyment of the book.   <br /> <br />This was a page-turner, and had a hard time putting the book down as I got more involved in the story. There was an element of mystery in this book, as well as the suspense of whether Emily would be hunted down for the murder of her uncle.  While the book for the most part was good, I felt the ending was a bit contrived and also felt that the characters did not always behave ina logical manner, especially towards the end of the novel, which took place before the Civil rights movement of the late 1960's.  <br /> <br />I'm giving this book three stars, for being a page-turner, and keeping me glued to the book, but could have been better if the characters were thought out a little bit better.	2004-09-30

Vine, a young Cherokee girl, is rumored to have sent men to their graves by casting spells on them, for she is reputed to have special magical powers. The white men of the area fear her, especially as they pass her home on the way up the mountains to work on the construction of a mansion being built for a rich man named Tate Masters. <br />  <br />One day, Saul Sullivan and his brother Aaron are on their way up the mountain to help with the construction, and they pass Vine's house. Saul sees Vine for the first time and is instantly smitten, but she ignores him. A while later, she hears screams and finds that Aaron has been bitten by a poisonous snake. With her knowledge of Indian medicine, she saves his life.  <br /> <br />Vine's life is changed forever. No longer does she live within the confines of the Cherokee community. The snakebite that nearly kills Aaron paves the way for Saul and Vine's courtship and soon they are married. She moves away from Redbud Camp and the Cherokee people, and moves in with her new husband and mother-in-law Esme, who live in a place called God's Creek.  <br /> <br />Although Vine and Saul love each other, she misses her family terribly. However, her mother-in-law is very supportive of them, despite the rumors that have spread about Vine and her evil spells and the fact that she is a Cherokee. The two women become close, which helps to ease Vine's homesickness. She befriends the local midwife, Serena, who Saul mentions, is \\"crackerjack\\", but Vine ignores the comment and soon the two women are the closest of friends.  <br /> <br />The people at God's Creek also accept Vine as part of their community. She learns their ways, sings their songs, dances their Irish jigs, and eats their food. She creates a loving home for her husband and new baby. But she is not completely happy. She finds that Saulis not as talkative as she would have liked, and is upset that he keeps things to himself, failing to open himself up to her.  <br /> <br />At the same time, Aaron develops an obsession for Vine, which begins to scare her. She tries to ignore what is happening, and one day she finds that he is following her, hiding behind trees as he spies on her. She keeps this from Saul, knowing that he will never believe her and will always come to the defense of his family.  <br /> <br />With Saul by her side, Vine feels protected, but one day he tells her that he has decided to temporarily move to a neighboring county to help with the war effort. It'll help bring in more money and give them the type of life they can only dream of. As soon as Saul leaves God's Creek, Aaron approaches Vine and professes his love for her, coming on so strong that she screams at him to leave. He disappears, leaving Esme and Vine to fend for themselves, only to return months later with a new wife, Aidia, who happens to physically resemble Vine.  <br /> <br />With Aaron back in their lives with a new wife, Vine at first thinks that everything is going to be all right. But as Aidia begins to confide in Vine, she finds out that Aaron's return to God's Creek spells trouble. What later happens between Vine and Aaron is so horrible that no one learns the truth except Vine's closest friend Serena. With this weighing heavy on her mind, Vine finds life intolerable and dreads the day of Saul's return, knowing that she can never keep this secret from him. <br /> <br />Like a series of musical notes, Silas House creates in A PARCHMENT OF LEAVES a lyrical work of art as he tells the story of Vine and her life away from her Cherokee roots. The beauty of the story is found not only in the story itself, but also in the way that House lays down his words on paper and paints the world of early 20th century Appalachia. Although several important themes run through the story, I feel the most important component of this book is how House chose to tell his story, with a lot of imagery and descriptive passages that helped take me back to the home of his ancestors.	2004-09-27

EVERY INCH OF HER by Peter Sheridan <br />September 24, 2004 <br /> <br />Here is a wonderful tale of a survivor, Philo Dolan, and her story is told in EVERY INCH OF HER.  Peter Sheridan creates a lovable character in Philo, who despite all her problems, makes sure that everyone around her is happy and being taken care of. <br /> <br />In the first chapter, Philo arrives at a local convent, seeking a place to stay. She has left her husband and children, but does not tell this to the nuns. She lets them believe she's a single woman wanting to become one of them.  The nuns, however, find it hard to believe, especially by looking at Philo's huge body covered with tattoos, and hearing that between every few sentences are uttered a foul word.  Philo keeps forgetting that nuns do not swear. <br /> <br />She also forgets that nuns do not smoke, and Philo is a chain smoker.  She is also a compulsive eater, and at close to 250 pounds, she still cannot seem to stop.  She eats to help forget her own problems, that of her abusive husband, the children she has left behind, and her past, which she wishes no one to find out about.   <br /> <br />Philo is not one to give up, however. She always makes the best of a situation, and now that she lives at the convent, she does her best to fit in by helping out.  Her crowning achievement is helping out at the senior citizen's center, and between herself and her new best friend Sister Rosaleen, they get the seniors blood stirring with a few rowdy games of bingo and a game of BLIND DATE.   <br /> <br />All good things do come to an end and Tommo, Philo's husband, tracks her down at the convent.  Does Philo return to him and her children, or will she stand up to him and stay with the nuns? <br /> <br />EVERY INCH OF HER was a delight to read.  Philo was a character that was easy to love, and it was fun to read about her antics.  She's quite a personality, with her faults and vices but yet written in such a fashion that one cannot help but want to meet her.  Sheridan also did a good job at painting a picture of the Irish working class.  This book reminds one somewhat of ANGELA'S ASHES, another sad tale told in a humorous tone. Not told in quite the same epic scale as ANGELA'S ASHES, but just as memorable.	2004-09-25

THE GAZEBO by Emily Grayson <br />September 19, 2004 <br /> <br />For those who love the books of Nicholas Sparks, THE GAZEBO by Emily Grayson covers familiar territory.  The star-crossed lovers are Claire Swift and Martin Rayfiel, and their story is told through tape recordings made by Martin, telling the story that spans fifty years.  He has asked the editor of the Longwood Falls Ledger to print their story in the paper, but when she refuses, he leaves Abby Reston, the editor of the paper, a briefcase full of cassettes and mementos that tell the tale of Claire and Martin.  <br /> <br />The love story starts on May 27, 1949, the day the two meet. They are young adults, both about to make that change from teenager to responsible adult.  Martin is about to leave for college at Princeton, and Claire is expected to stay in town and become a secretary or possibly help out with her father's business.  They are from opposite sides of town. He is part of the wealthy families living at The Crest, and Claire's family is working class. The two are expected not to associate with one another, so it is an event when the two meet by chance. Martin had just received a beating by a group of boys in town, and Claire sees him sitting at the gazebo that sits in the middle of town, and offers to take him to her house to do something for his black eye.  <br /> <br />That fateful day begins the lifelong relationship between the two, and as all love stories, theirs is not an easy road.  The reader may or may not buy into the choices made by Claire regarding their love affair, but this reader feels that it made a lot of sense. The ending was expected, but nevertheless it warrants a box of tissues.  A very fast read, anyone that loves this type of story will enjoy THE GAZEBO.	2004-09-19

DRIFTING by Stephanie Gertler <br />Courtesy of WWW.LOVEROMANCES.COM <br />September 13, 2004 <br /> <br />DRIFTING by Stephanie Gertler is a story within a story. The novel starts with the introduction of Eli and Claire, a happily married couple that is dealing with the last child moving away to start her life in college.  Claire is feeling lost and sad, but it is a new start for Eli and Claire. An opening scene describes their faithful old dog Stella, as she is, barely able to walk due to her arthritis. It is a reminder of the years that have gone by, and the changes that now await them. It is the end of an era, and the beginning of a new one. <br /> <br />There are changes in store for them, one of them being more time on Claire's hands. Eli is busy with his veterinary office, and Claire had her career as a psychiatrist, running the Inn, and raising their children. With both Jonah and Natalie off at college, she is feeling a void in her life. The free time is allowing her to think back to her own childhood, remembering the mother who abandoned her and her father Jack when she was only two years old. <br /> <br />Her anger and resentment toward Ursula, or Sulie as she was called, may have been tucked away in the back of her mind, but it had never gone away. Although her father, Jack, did a good job of raising Claire alone, it did not make up for the loss of the mother that Claire felt she needed all those years ago. <br /> <br />When a man and his seven year old blind daughter show up at the Inn to spend a week in their town of Drifting, Claire's mind goes through those memories of her own childhood. With the help of Nick Pierce, the young girl's father, Claire imagines what life must be like for young Kayla, who according to Nick, was to be sent away to a boarding school for blind children because her own mother did not want her. This tugs at Claire's heartstrings, and from this moment on, she latches on to the two of them, emotionally bonding with them because of her own past.  <br /> <br />Eli warns Claire that his instincts tell him there is something about Nick that he cannot trust, but he can't pinpoint what it is. Claire defends Nick and tells Eli he is imagining things. But when Nick and Kayla disappear a few days later without a goodbye, Claire realizes the big mistake she's made, and all because she saw herself in little Kayla, letting her emotions blind her. <br /> <br />The novel takes a turn in which it goes from a leisurely atmosphere of a quiet resort to that of a fast paced missing people search. While the novel appears to be mostly about Nick and Kayla, the overall picture points really to Claire, and her need to understand why her own mother deserted their family. This reviewer found this novel wonderfully done; it was a different approach to a story that has been done before. Claire resolves her feelings at the very end, and the reader will find satisfaction with this ending.  Highly recommended, Stephanie Gertler is an author to be on the lookout for.	2004-09-13

I was in for a treat!  It's a story filled with outrageous characters and caricatures of people living in a town called SOUL CITY.  The residents can fly, they eat magic muffins, and living several hundred years is not uncommon.   <br /> <br />A man named Cadillac Jackson travels to Soul City to cover the mayoral election.  However, Cadillac has the hardest time writing down anything, because what he sees and learns in Soul City is so hard to describe.  He finds himself meeting the various residents, and through him the reader gets to meet the many larger-than-life characters that grace these pages.   <br /> <br />The gist of this book is African American pride and a sense of history of where they have been, and where they are now.  But in between all that the reader gets to walk down memory lane through a sea of pop culture that will have one laughing and smiling.  It's a very short book, only 184 pages, but it could have easily been longer.  I didn't want the book to end, but although it was only 184 pages, I think Toure did a good job at telling a fable about racism, about accepting others for their differences, and for appreciating one's roots and celebrating all that has come before.  This book will definitely be on my top 20 list for 2004.	2004-09-11

PLAYING WITH BOYS by Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez <br />September 10, 2004 <br /> <br />PLAYING WITH BOYS is the latest novel by Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez, whose THE DIRTY GIRLS SOCIAL CLUB was a big hit the other year.  In this novel, three Latina women living in Southern California become friends through a movie script written about a woman that endured horrors while living in El Salvador.   <br /> <br />Alexis Lopez, originally from Texas, is now living in Southern California, and manages Hispanic musicians.  Due to some \\"mishap\\" that involved her most famous act, Los Chimpances del Norte, she discovers she may need to expand her horizons.  She comes across a woman, Olivia, with a wonderful script about her mother's life in El Salvador, and Alexis decides to buy it and make a movie out of it.  She also hires out-of-work Latina actress Marcella Gauthier Bosch to play the lead in the film. <br /> <br />The three of them become friends, but in the meantime, they each have their own set of problems.  Alexis is dealing with a psychotic ex-boyfriend.  Marcella is dealing with a mother that never showed any support for Marcella, despite the fact that they are both actresses.  She is also worried about her fading beauty, insecure that some younger actress will take her place in the world of Latina beauties.  And Olivia is dealing with nightmares, memories of life in El Salvador. She's losing sleep and weight. <br /> <br />When Alexis meets handsome Cuban singer Vladimir, her life takes on an interesting turn, but learns he's still in love with a woman he left behind in Cuba.  His goal is to get her out safely and to be reunited with her. Alexis is disappointed that she will never win his heart, but takes him on as his new manager and does what she can to promote his music, and to help him bring his one true love to the United States. <br /> <br />I enjoyed reading PLAYING WITH BOYS. Although it took a while to get into the novel, once I saw where the plot was heading, I was hooked.  The strength of this novel are the characters, who come to life and feel as real as the person sitting next to you.  I would love to read a sequel to this book, if only to see what the future brings to these wonderfully created characters.  Highly recommended.	2004-09-11

THE DOCTOR DELIVERS by Janice Macdonald<br /><br />September 7, 2004<br /><br />In THE DOCTOR DELIVERS, Janice MacDonald writes a story about a divorced woman with two children who finds herself falling in love with a doctor who is known as a ladies man, never wanting a commitment from any of the women he's been with. Catherine Prentice is a divorced mother of two young children, Julie and Peter, and is trying to make a living at Western Hospital in the public relations department.  Her job is to help get good publicity for the hospital.  Her big challenge at the moment is to convince Dr Martin Connaughton to take part in a press conference, but he's notorious for his hot temper and his lack of cooperation. And Catherine is not one to be very aggressive. Her boss Derek is not very happy at the way Catherine is handling the situation, and she's worried that her job is at stake.<br /><br />While Catherine has problems at work, she also has issues with her ex-husband, who happens to be married to her ex-best friend, Nadia.  Gary, the ex-husband, does his best to intimidate Catherine and make her feel insecure as a mother and as an employee of the hospital.  In his eyes nothing she does is right.  It doesn't help when the kids come home from their visits with dad, filled with stories of how wonderful Gary and Nadia are, and all the things Peter and Julie get when they are out shopping. Catherine feels less than nothing as a parent, knowing that Gary is trying to make her think she cannot provide for them, yet she will not accept any help from anyone. She is doing this on her own.<br /><br />Dr Martin Connaughton works in the NICU at Western Hospital, and although he's known throughout as a man with a terribly hot temper, he's also known for being an excellent neonatal doctor.  Martin has been married before, years ago when he was still living in Ireland. It's been five years since Sharon had died, and he has never really gotten over the tragedy.  He keeps walls around him, making sure he never gets attached to any one woman. His life is his work.<br /><br />It is inevitable that Martin and Catherine meet, since it is Catherine's mission to convince Martin to be friendlier to the press.  When they see each other at the hospital holiday party, they find that there is a spark between them, and Martin is ready to get to know Catherine better, despite the fact that it is her job at work to make him do something he repeatedly refuses to do. Something about her smile reminds him of someone, and then he realizes it is his beloved Sharon. He no longer wants to avoid Catherine, and wants to spend more time with her instead.<br /><br />When Martin delivers triplets on the Long Beach Freeway, he becomes a hero, and it is up to Catherine to make sure that Martin is available to the press for interviews.  When the press finds out that one of the triplets may not make it out of the hospital alive, a controversy arises involving Martin and a surgeon who wants to perform a controversial type of surgery to save the infant's life.  Martin is opposed, and soon his job is on the line, and so is Catherine's.  At the same time, Martin and Catherine find themselves falling in love, causing more problems for Catherine and her ex-husband Gary.<br /><br />THE DOCTOR DELIVERS by Janice Macdonald has got to be one of the best harlequin superromances I have ever read.  She knows how to write. I couldn't find fault with anything in this book, except for a few grammatical errors that had been overlooked during the editing of the book.  The story held my interest and the characters were believable. I would gladly read anything this author writes.  Highly recommended.	2004-09-07

BEE SEASON by Myla Goldberg <br />September 5, 2004 <br /> <br />A few years ago I had read a wonderful novel by Myla Goldberg, BEE SEASON.  It is about a dysfunctional Jewish family whose lives are disrupted when the daughter, Eliza Naumann, wins a spelling bee.  She had never displayed any aptitude in school for any subject whatsoever, and usually spent her leisure time watching television.  It was her brother, Aaron, who was the star of the family, and he spent a lot of his free time with their father, Saul. When Saul realizes Eliza has talent after all, he decides to groom her into a championship speller, and now the time once spent with Aaron is spent with Eliza. <br /> <br />I had procrastinated too long in writing this review, so the details of the story have faded from my mind.  I do remember one thing: this was one of my favorite books read in 2003.  The main attraction to this book is the characters.  The novel goes into detail the history of Saul and his wife Miriam, the rather unconventional lifestyle they had in their college years, their courtship and subsequent marriage. Some of the story leads to a somewhat paranormal type of story line, which may or may not turn off the reader.  However, I felt that Goldberg's skills as a writer made this whole section of the book very believable and well done. Saul's obsession with Eliza and her spelling prowess take the novel to its climax, and the ending I found very unexpected, yet appropriate. <br /> <br />I rated this book 5 stars, for originality and content.  It is a definitely recommended!	2004-09-05

FOREVER AFTER by Kimberley White <br />September 5, 2004 <br /> <br /> <br />FOREVER AFTER by Kimberley White was my second BET Arabesque romance, and so far I'm batting 100.  In the opening chapter, 27-year old Jova Parker is dealing with an ex-boyfriend who has just sued her for damages, and she was nowhere near the accident that totaled her vehicle.  The ex is Herman Norman, and although their relationship had started out on the right foot, he turned into a person that she had a hard time respecting.  The last straw was the accident he had while driving her Lincoln, claiming SHE owed him money for his medical bills.   <br /> <br />In the mean time, Jova is grieving over the death of her mother, but had been busy building up a clientele at her new salon, Tresses and Locks, bought with her mother's insurance policy.  Jova felt that she will make her mother proud, by creating a successful business in her honor.   <br /> <br />Across the street is David's Garage, and Davan Underwood, David's nephew, has just moved to Detroit from Utah to help out his dying uncle.  He's noticed Jova, and introduces himself to her.  There are sparks, but Jova is not ready for a relationship so soon after she'd been treated so badly by Herman, and does her best to keep her emotions in check.  At the same time, Dawn, who also works at the salon, finds herself attracted to Davan, and soon starts to believe there is a real relationship going on between them.  <br /> <br />Davan doesn't give up where it concerns Jova. He does his best to convince her to go out with him on a date, asking her to give him a tour of the city. Jova considers this new relationship a purely platonic one, at first.  But Jova slowly let's go of her stubborn attitude and let's him into her heart.  Problems arise between Dawn and Jova because of Davan's interest in Jova, and soon Dawn quits the salon, accusing Jova of backstabbing her. <br /> <br />As Jova and Davan's relationship slowly blossoms, Davan's Uncle Davidrequests to meet her. David's relationship to Davan is similar to that of father and son, and he insists on meeting Jova.  Jova and David hit it off and she in turn looks up to him as the father she never had.  While his health deteriorates, she helps take care of him and befriends him, making Davan very happy that the woman he loves and his surrogate father have become good friends.   <br /> <br />Herman isn't out of the picture and he returns periodically to threaten Jova and asks for money to save him from the men who he owes money to.  His gambling habit has gotten out of control, and for some reason he thinks she can help him.  She thought he was out of her life for good, but despite their break up, his influence on her life has a negative impact, and it begins to affect how she deals with her romance with Davan. <br /> <br />I enjoyed FOREVER AFTER, and felt it was a great story.  It was more complicated than the average romance.   However, I did feel there was a problem with some of the writing.  A few of the chapters ended abruptly, and the transition to the next chapters felt stilted and stiff.  Other than that, I am recommending FOREVER AFTER and would definitely read another book by Kimberely White.	2004-09-05

McFadden <br />September 1, 2004 <br /> <br />CAMILLA'S ROSES by Bernice L McFadden is a story of several generations of strong Black American women, leading up to Camilla, who at the beginning of the story, discovers she has breast cancer.  The opening chapter details Camilla's successful life with her husband Bryant and daughter Zola, and depicts a scene where she and Bryant discover the lump after a raunchy play session in their bedroom.  She goes to her doctor whom the family has known for many years, to confirm what they already had guessed, and is asked to give her family medical history.  Camilla hesitates, because she does not have a family other than Bryant and Zola. As far as she's concerned, she had risen from the ashes of the phoenix. <br /> <br />The novel then goes into the past, into the heart of the ghetto, starting with two sisters Velma Rose and Maggie Rose. It's a story of sibling rivalry that leads to tragedy. Through all this is the family history that leads to the story of Camilla, her roots.  <br /> <br />CAMILLA'S ROSES was a very short novel with an important message. I wasn't sure I liked the writing style of Ms McFadden, although I enjoyed the story itself.  While I felt the characters were partly caricatures of real-life people, the story itself was real. The message the reader gets by the end of the book points to the importance of family, no matter where one comes from.  Camilla spent her adult life pretending she was someone else, to escape the family she was ashamed of, to run away from the family that gave her nothing but unhappiness during her childhood.  It took a life threatening illness for her to think back on what her family meant to her, and find a way back home.  I enjoyed CAMILLA'S ROSES mostly for the story that McFadden told through these pages, a story that spanned several generations of turbulent life in the ghettos of New York.	2004-09-01

In this novel, Alex and Milo Sturgis are on a mission to figure out the connection between a murder that has just occurred in Beverly Hills, and one that happened previously and left unsolved.  The victims of the first murder are a man and a woman, found shot and stabbed in a car parked outside a Beverly Hills home.  It almost appears to be a sexually motivated murder, judging by the positions the couple was left in at the murder scene. The male victim was seeing a therapist, Mary Lou Koppel, and that is where the investigation begins. The previously murdered woman was also found in a sexual position, and is later found to have been going to therapy as well.  <br /> <br />The connection between the two is rather flimsy until Dr Koppel herself gets murdered.  There is definitely a link between all three, and it is up to Alex and Milo to find out the connection. <br /> <br />I've only read a handful of Alex Delaware novels, and I have enjoyed them all, but this one was the least favorite so far.  I found myself losing interest during parts of the novel, which were filled with a lot of political rhetoric.  I didn't think there was a need to go into that much detail in a novel such as this.  A few paragraphs would have sufficed.  I also was not happy with the ending, feeling that there were some unanswered questions that could have been resolved.  All in all, however, I do recommend THERAPY but for new fans of Jonathan Kellerman, I suggest starting with one of his older novels.	2004-08-24
547753:US	51214937	R3UTCH32QUJ294	0743411250	940771299	The Woman Next Door	Books	5	2	2	N	N	One of my favorites by Barbara Delinsky	THE WOMAN NEXT DOOR by Barbara Delinsky <br />August 21, 2004 <br /> <br />Barbara Delinsky has become one of my favorite authors.  In THE WOMAN NEXT DOOR, she writes about a group of women living on a culdesac who find themselves threatened when the neighborhood widow is found to be pregnant.   <br /> <br />The novel opens with the wedding of Amanda and Graham O'Leary. It is a happy beginning to a promising future.  Graham is a member of an 8-sibling family, and they are all anxious for Amanda and Graham to start a family of their own.  As the years go by, however, Amanda has yet to conceive, and their fertility problems begin to put a strain on the marriage. It is now 5 years into their marriage, and they are still childless.  Karen and Lee are another couple living on this culdesac. They have their own marital problems, mainly that of Lee's infidelity.  Russ is a househusband, working as a writer from home as he watches and takes care of the kids.  Wife Georgia is a career woman and is rarely home, as she travels to promote her company's products. She is the CEO of this company and she's proud of her achievements. <br /> <br />When word gets around that Gretchen, the lonely widow that had been married to a much older man, is pregnant, the three women begin to worry.  She had been widowed long enough for them all to know that her husband was not the father. And she never seemed to have company.  She was always alone, or else one of their own husbands were over at her place fixing the plumbing or doing some other odd job around the house to help her out. Each of the women at one point or another suspect that their own husband is the father of that unborn child.   <br /> <br />Delinsky does a good job creating well-developed characters that appear real and true to life.  As each couple's relationship is detailed and taken apart, the reader will try to guess who is truly the father of this woman's child.  When Amanda goes out of her way to befriend the lonely widow,more is learned about Gretchen, the young woman who is treated as an outsider, because she made the mistake of marrying a widower who also was much older than she. Amanda learns that there is more to Gretchen that meets the eye, and sees that maybe possibly she and the other women are wrong about Gretchen. <br /> <br />As I have with most books Delinsky, I very much enjoyed THE WOMAN NEXT DOOR.  As always, Delinsky writes a novel that is fast paced and is hard to put down. She blends elements of contemporary fiction with a hint of romance, that between Amanda and Graham, who are the main characters, but the other couples play a large role in the story as well.  I also found the ending very satisfactory (but I won't give that away), making this book for me a 4.5/5 rating.	2004-08-22

Jernigan but never makes it to the altar. In the opening chapter, Keeley Murdock describes one of her earlier memories of her relationship with A.J., a scene in which he and she are about to \\"do it\\" in the kitchen.  A.J. is dressed only in an apron and a cooking mitt, and he begins to hiccup. This memory fades out and turns into a present day moment. Keeley is now at her wedding rehearsal dinner, and she hears the same hiccup sounds she knows so well, but instead of her being on the receiving line, it is her best friend Paige. Keeley finds the couple in the act and is so enraged that she breaks out into a major hissy fit and calls off the wedding.  <br />  <br />Will Mahoney is the gentleman that rescues Keeley after the rehearsal. As Keeley is running out of the building after her humiliating experience, she heads for the valet parking and decides to leave a message on A.J.'s red Z-3, when she hears a man behind her cough, letting her know she spelled \\"asshole\\" wrong.  He then offers to drive her home in his yellow Cadillac, and thus begins the rather shaky business relationship between Will Mahoney and Keeley's interior design company Glorious Interiors.    <br />  <br />Will ends up to be a very wealthy business man, and is hoping to rejuvenate the failing bra company LOVING CUP, which was at one point the town of Madison's main source of employment.  He also wants to put money into an old antebellum mansion called Mulberry Hill.  He is wooing a woman he has never met, hoping to entice her with the mansion.  Keeley and her Aunt Gloria are asked to fix up the place in record time.   <br />  <br />While all this is going on, a separate subplot involves Keeley's missing mother, who disappeared decades ago when Keeley was just a child.  Her father and everyone else in town weren't really sure what had happened toher mother all those years ago, but everyone assumed she had run off with a married man whom she was having an affair with.  Keeley's thoughts often go to her mother, wondering why Jeanine Murdock never came back to get her only child.    <br />  <br />Then there is the story of Mulberry Hill and the renovation project.  This could have been a story in itself, with Will wooing Stephanie, the woman he sees for the first time on a public television telethon.  I found these scenes pretty funny, and enjoyed the antics of the dog that Stephanie owns and treats like a baby.    <br />  <br />Austin LeFleur was another fun character thrown into the novel, and he helped keep the momentum going.  He was Glorious Interior's next door neighbor, the florist, and he goes along with Keeley on her antique shopping expeditions.  He worked well as comic relief.    <br />  <br />The problem I had with HISSY FIT was that the book took off in too many directions.  The title HISSY FIT refers to the wedding that never happened, but once that was over and done with, it was if a different book took over.  The new direction of the story took the reader on an antique shopping adventure, and at times those scenes and descriptions went way too long for such a book as this.  I feel this book would have been a lot better if the story continued on its original path -- a story about a woman seeking revenge on her ex-fianc.  Instead, it focused on Will Mahoney and his aspirations for the town of Madison and the remaking of Loving Cup, and his obsession in making Stephanie his wife. This part of the story was fun and was the heart of the novel, but in that case, the title of the book should have been something entirely different.  The book was really never about a HISSY FIT, but the hissy fit helped start the story and bring it to a somewhat logical conclusion.  I am giving HISSY FIT only three stars, due to the lack of direction this book took. If it weren't for some of the interesting charactersthat graced these pages, I think i would have rated it a bit lower.	2004-08-21

I was expecting a story filled with violence and gore, due to the title.  And since I'm not familiar with the Polish culture, I was not aware of what Duck Blood soup was in the first place. This book is the story of a young medical resident who gets himself hooked on prescription drugs. Rocky Van Slyke is a young man who is on his way to becoming a doctor, but takes a detour courtesy of a shady lawyer, Vincent Buddy, who uses Rocky to get prescriptions filled for his own use. <br />  <br />Rocky doesn't see Vince as anything more than a potential friend and the hospital's resident lawyer. Vince uses Rocky by enticing him with the drugs, and demonstrating that these drugs are an easy way of getting high. Being a doctor, it is easy for Rocky to get these drugs by writing up a prescription under false pretenses.  Vince knows that once Rocky is hooked, he'll do anything to help Vince obtain the drugs. <br /> <br />The story opens with Rocky finding himself in a hospital and being told he just had a seizure.  They hint to him that it is possibly the exposure to drugs. Thus our story begins.  Rocky is the narrator of DUCK BLOOD SOUP. He goes back and forth in time, alternating the past with the present. He tells the story of his childhood: His father who was always away in the Army; his lonely mother who resorts to finding comfort in the arms of other men; and his life after his mother dies, in which he takes care of his dying crippled father. The story always returns to the present, with Rocky dealing with Vince and his drug habit, his fellow residents at the hospital, and his girlfriend Karla.   <br /> <br />While at first the reader may not see where the story is headed, it becomes clear that Rocky's past has a lot to do with his present.  Molea does a good job at creating this person, Rocky, and describing what makes him tick.  It also becomes apparent what Vince the shady lawyer is doing to Rocky, and a few secrets come out at the end of the story about this lawyer, which will tie it all together.  Vince's relationship with Rocky, at least to this reviewer, first appears to be innocent, but as the book progresses, it becomes obvious that their relationship is more akin to a parasite.  <br /> <br />I am recommending DUCK BLOOD SOUP.  It's well written all around, and I hope that Molea continues to write, as he shows he's got what it takes to write a good book. Excellent!	2004-08-18
553487:US	51214937	RS0A3HT1KTJ6E	0060085444	550428439	She Went All the Way	Books	4	3	5	N	N	3 1/2 stars	SHE WENT ALL THE WAY by Meggin Cabot <br />8/16/04 <br /> <br />Courtesy of WWW.LOVEROMANCES.COM <br /> <br />Meggin Cabot's, THE BOY NEXT DOOR, was a delight to read, and was one laugh after another.  SHE WENT ALL THE WAY is another story. Although this novel starts off great, there are scenes that seem a bit forced, and over all, this book is only marginally recommended. It's a great beach read, despite the fact that most of the book takes place in the cold wintry environs of Alaska. It's light, and fast, and there is not much thinking involved, which qualifies for a great read at the beach or anywhere on vacation during these summer months. <br /> <br />Lou Calabrese is a scriptwriter, and has made some of the highest grossing Hollywood films ever. At the start of this book, she's just been dumped by long time boyfriend-turned-super-movie-star, Bruno Di Blas, (not his real name) because he's fallen in love with his co-star in a movie that Lou wrote. She's bitter, but knows she is better off without him. They were high school sweethearts, but apparently he didn't mean that much to her. What she's worried about are the tabloids, which can be awfully nasty. <br /> <br />Lou goes to Alaska to participate in the latest sequel to her popular movie series starring Jack Townsend, one of Hollywood's most popular stars. The down side to this is the two of them do not get along. The upside is that she gets to put him in the most precarious situations, since she's the scriptwriter. Jack happens to be her best friend's ex, and he's been known to love `em and leave `em.  When the two of them end up on a helicopter ride together that ends up crashing in the wilds of Alaska, their troubles have only just begun. <br /> <br />While the rest of the world thinks the two of them are dead, Lou and Jack are desperately trying to stay alive, while some madman tries to kill Jack. It is one crazy scene after another, just like those from her many movie scripts. The book itself reads likea very unlikely, unbelievably crazy James Bond movie, but as long as the reader does not get too caught up in what appears to be a totally outlandish story-line, one will be able to get through SHE WENT ALL THE WAY.  It's pure escapism, with a romance that is sure to please any reader of the genre. On the other hand, the book could have been much better, and while it started with a bang, it did not maintain the same caliber of writing throughout the book.  Anyone looking for a better book should try THE BOY NEXT DOOR.	2004-08-17

Jane Alcott writes a column in the Seattle Times called \\"Single Girl in the City\\".  By night she is the author of a raunchy serial in a gentlemen's magazine, HIM, and calls her column \\"The Life of Honey Pie\\".  Her co-workers have no idea that she is the author of this very risqu piece of writing. No one would even think she would be involved in it, because of her reputation as being very plain, very dull, and probably someone who hasn't had sex in ages, if ever.   <br /> <br />Then, she is given the challenge of a lifetime: to be the substitute sports writer covering the local hockey team, the Seattle Chinooks. She'll be able to work with the team one-on-one, including interviewing the guys in the locker room.  It is a dream come true and a major boost to her career. Unfortunately, the guys on the team are not too thrilled with the idea of a woman sports writer, and they do their best to deter Jane from interviewing them.  They humor her with conversation, as long as it is not about the team.   <br /> <br />Jane is very frustrated, especially by the goalie Luc Martineau.  He has a reputation of not allowing anyone, man or woman, to interview him.  Jane finds herself with mixed feelings toward this man, someone who is the opposite of what she is.  She's short, flat chested, and wears unflattering clothes.  Luc is tall, built like a football player, and is known to be a ladies' man.  They are opposites, yet she feels drawn to him, and unknown to her, he is drawn to her as well. <br /> <br />Jane's adventures with the team is almost heart-rending.  She tries her best to get the guys to talk, and it's a long uphill battle.  The reader will want to cheer her on as she makes in-roads a little at a time. She finally bonds with them during a brutal darts game, and from then on she feels that they are finally letting her into their inner circle. <br /> <br />In the meantime, Jane is slowly falling in love with Luc, and she does not know what to do. <br /> <br />A side plotline is the story of Luc and his younger sister Marie, who has been orphaned and now lives with her big brother in Seattle.  Unfortunately, she rarely sees him because he is always on the road.  He has no clue what to do with Marie, because he is used to being the single guy, and has only met Marie a few times in the past.  Now that her mother has passed away, and their father had died years ago, she has no one to turn to but Luc.  Luc has no idea how to raise a teenage girl. Yes, he's an expert on women, but not on girls.   <br /> <br />SEE JANE SCORE was a book I did not expect to like as much as I did.  I am not a sports fan, but yet this book was more than that. The author seems to know a lot about hockey, or did her homework, and kept the story authentic when it centered on the games and the team.  She also was able to make the romance between Luc and Jane believable.  I'm recommending SEE JANE SCORE and will definitely try Gibson's other books.	2004-08-13
557920:US	51214937	R1VKR27W0KGAOY	0595305873	573189610	Park Avenue Rich	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Jackie Collins meets Mr Ripley	PARK AVENUE RICH by R.J. Revaitis <br />August 10, 2004 <br /> <br />R.J. Revaitis' novel, PARK AVENUE RICH, is a combination of Jackie Collins and a touch of Mr. Ripley (Patricia Highsmith). A good looking con man works his way through the rich and famous, blending in without a care in the world, pretending he is one of them, befriending them, and then taking as much as he dares from them without getting caught. <br /> <br />The main target of this scam in PARK AVENUE RICH is Freddie Von Eckhardt, an heiress to a multi-million dollar empire.  She jets around the world at a whim, and so does her sister Ursula. Freddie is into partying non-stop and is known to have a very promiscuous love life, but she is hoping to find that dream man one day, someone that will put a stop to her roaming and convince her to settle down.   <br /> <br />When Freddie meets Jimmy Cavanaugh at a bar, she's instantly smitten.  He's good looking, and \\"obviously\\" he has money.  He buys her drinks, and before she knows it, she's in Jimmy's bed. She has no idea that Jimmy had drugged her cocktail and never suspects a thing. Jimmy, however, is already planning the next step.  <br /> <br />He introduces Freddie to his idea of a chain of nightclubs, the first one to open up in Miami. But he needs some backers.  She is so infatuated with the con man that she does not see him as anything but legitimate.  They get to know one another, and she learns that he is from a very wealthy family from Canada, a family as wealthy as hers.  What she does not know is that in truth, he grew up poor and learned his skills of a con man through his parents. As far as she can tell, he's belongs with the rich and famous, one of her kind and he's legit, and in her excitement she immediately sells his idea to her friends.  And they all buy it.  No one suspects he's anything but who he says he is. <br /> <br />Across the Atlantic in merry old England, Chief Inspector Ian Chesterman is trying to solve the case of a missingheiress, Lady Margaret Pembroke, and her current lover Mr. Roger Barrymore.  There appears to be no connection to this story with that of the action happening in New York, and the novel bounces back and forth between the two plots.  I found this irritating at first, but knew that there had to be a connection in order for this book to work.  And there is!  It does take quite some time to find the connection, but for some readers it may turn out to be obvious. <br /> <br />The novel is filled with characters that would feel at home in a Jackie Collins novel.  Lots of drug use, sex and a little bit of violence are thrown into the story.  And the character of Jimmy Cavanaugh is very reminiscent of the famous Mr. Ripley character created by Patricia Highsmith.  Although the book was well-thought out, I couldn't give this book as high marks as I would have wished, due to the fact that the author took concepts that have been done before.  A lot of the book was formulaic in the style that I have just mentioned, and the ending was pretty predictable, since he seemed to be imitating a Mr. Ripley story.  I could almost envision Matt Damon in the role as Jimmy. This reviewer gives PARK AVENUE RICH three out of five stars.	2004-08-13
560307:US	51214937	R3D4U4L85KF0V4	0066213789	605726194	The Wedding of the Two-Headed Woman: A Novel	Books	3	2	4	N	N	I didnt' like it as much as I'd hoped I would	THE WEDDING OF THE TWO-HEADED WOMAN by Alice Mattison  <br />  <br />Here's a rather unusual title for an unusual book: THE WEDDING OF THE TWO-HEADED WOMAN, written by Alice Mattison.  The title is in reference to a headline taken from a tabloid newspaper that the main character, Daisy Andalusia, sees at the home of one of her clients. She uses this in her experimental acting group and from there, the group creates a play based on a woman with two heads.  <br />  <br />This probably sounds rather eccentric and enigmatic. It is.  The book is written in a style in which the reader gets bits and pieces of dialogue or scenes that all come together as the story progresses. We slowly learn a little more about Daisy and what makes her tick. Daisy is the focal point, and the play she is participating in symbolizes more than just a woman that has two heads, as the play starts to evolve and grow.   <br />  <br />Daisy herself is a woman that seems to have a great need to control everything in her life.  She obsesses over sex, is used to being free and single, and has just married her long time lover, Pekko Roberts, who is a slum lord (but is in denial about it). Daisy is in business for herself, taking on clients that need help cleaning up.  Her clients live like pack rats, living in homes that are fire hazards and resemble any house cleaner's nightmare.  She finds satisfaction in cleaning up and organizing these homes, but only homes with a somewhat organized mess.  Her latest client, Gordon Skeetling, becomes one of her obsessions, and not only does he become a favorite client of sorts, he also helps her with her other obsession, sex.    <br />  <br />The book takes place over an eight-month period, culminating shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11th. It is interesting that the author chose this time period to parallel the life of Daisy Andalusia.  It appears the author was making a statement, stating that the problems Daisy and her friends were having over this play they were creating, paled in comparison to the events of that fateful day.    <br />  <br />But all in all, this book I found to be a bit too much.  There was a lot of symbolism that I found too cryptic for my tastes, and although I think a different type of reader could have enjoyed this book, I couldn't get into it.  I was disappointed and felt that it was a bit over my head, which I am very embarrassed to admit.  I'm giving this book 3 stars, mostly for effort. If I had enjoyed it more, I would have bumped it up a notch.	2004-08-10

DRIVE ME CRAZY by Eric Jerome Dickey <br /> <br />This is my third book by Eric Jerome Dickey, and as with the others, I loved this one!  What makes DRIVE ME CRAZY different from the other two I read (CHEATERS and MILK IN MY COFFEE) is that the focus is not on relationships.  DRIVE ME CRAZY is the story of an ex-con that hooks up with the wrong woman, and finds himself in a very dangerous situation.   <br /> <br />\\"Driver\\", as he's called, has an affair with his future boss's wife, and she asks him to murder her husband for him and pay him for it.  Driver needs the money so he agrees to it, but chickens out when he actually meets the husband face to face. Wolf, the husband, ends up hiring Driver to work for him at his limousine company, which solves Driver's unemployment problem, but makes matters worse between he and Lisa, the wife.  Driver refuses to kill the husband, since now they have a working relationship, but Lisa continues to badger Driver, threatening him and his friends and family. <br /> <br />In the meantime, Driver gets involved with another woman, Arizona, who he finds out is a con-artist, and he uses her to get back at Lisa, who is now making his life a living hell, trying to get her money back. Another woman becomes involved, Panther, who Driver finds himself getting involved with emotionally.  She's worried for him, knowing what is going on in his life, and is afraid he's going to wind up dead. <br /> <br />A lot of great characters in DRIVE ME CRAZY that help make the book fun.  Dickey is good with creating characters that stand out and help make the story line move.  This book was one of those that I couldn't put down, and I always look forward to a new one by this author.	2004-08-08

In this novel, Deborah and Sharon are sisters that don't get along.  In the opening chapter, their mother is turning seventy-five and is expecting both of them to be at her birthday party. Sharon is helping to cater the event.  Deborah needs to bury the hatchet, so she flies down to Florida to spend time with her family.   <br /> <br />In the mean time, Deborah is making a living writing for a popular television soap opera, \\"From This Day Forward\\", and is currently dating one of its stars.  When Woody the head scriptwriter gets fired, Deborah's job is on the line, and she soon finds herself without a boyfriend (Philip was only dating her, she learns, because of her inside scoop on the actor's character on the show).  To top it off, Deborah's apartment is burglarized, and she feels that maybe it seems to be the right time to make a change in her life. <br /> <br />Deborah flies down to Florida for the big birthday bash, and is told there is a job opening at the local historical center so she contemplates taking the job.  When her mother has a heart attack, Deborah sees this as an omen and accepts the job and moves her things out of her New York apartment.  <br /> <br />Deborah and Sharon are now forced to deal with each other, since their mother has asked the two women to get along for her sake. Dr. Jeffrey Hirshon is the cardiologist that saves their mother's life, and during visiting hours, both women find themselves falling for the charming doctor. One thing leads to another, and soon the sisters find themselves in the middle of a murder investigation because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.  <br /> <br />The two sisters continue their bickering as they try to solve the murder.  While contemplating potential suspects, Deborah finds something very suspicious about Sharon's new beau, who also happens to be an ex-classmate of Hirshon. Deborah also suspects her new neighbor Ray Scalley, who at times seems very suspicious too, yet she is not sure if she likes him or not. She remembers Ray didn't like Hirshon when the doctor was alive.  Could Ray possibly be the murderer? <br /> <br />This sounds like a serious murder mystery, but it's not.  This is a typical Jane Heller romp, with laughs coming from every page.  The book does keep the reader going with the \\"who-dunnit\\" aspect of the story line, but all in all, it's one laugh after another as everyone gets into one scrape after the next.  If this book doesn't turn a reader into a fan of Jane Heller's, nothing will.	2004-08-08

MY SISTER'S KEEPER by Jodi Picoult <br />8/5/04 <br /> <br />Jodi Picoult's latest novel, MY SISTER'S KEEPER is one of those page-turners that you will not be able to put down.  A couple learns that their daughter, at age two, has a rare form of cancer.  The only possible chance the toddler has is from a donor, but there is no match for her.  Instead, the couple decides to have another baby, created with specific genetic traits, so that this new baby DOES become the perfect match for the two-year-old. <br /> <br />Thus, starts the life of Anna Fitzgerald, whose main reason for being conceived is to save the life of her older sister, Kate.  Brian and Sara Fitzgerald will do anything to save their daughter, and this is the only way they know how.  While at first the concept sounds very noble, and they are adding another child to the family (there is already an older child, Jesse), as the years go by, the family undergoes a change, and it is not for the better.   <br /> <br />As the children grow older, it is obvious Kate's illness is making a great impact on all of them. Jesse becomes the troubled older son, who gets involved with drugs and crime.  Anna becomes the \\"good\\" child, the one that does her best to keep a smile on her face, and is Kate's best friend.  Because Kate is constantly in and out of hospitals, she is pretty much schooled at home and Anna is her constant companion. <br /> <br />Anna, however, comes to a point in her young life where she is tired of being used to save her sister.  Donating marrow, blood, and whatever else is needed to keep Kate alive, is wearing her down. And psychologically, it's making Anna feel that the only reason she was a part of this family was because of Kate.  Through an action that shocks the entire family and the community, Anna sues her parents for the rights to her own body, and the family is now torn in two. <br /> <br />As with any Jodi Picoult book, the legal system is the highlight of MY SISTER'S KEEPER. Campbell Alexander is the lawyer who is hired by Anna to represent her, and his old childhood sweetheart, Julia Romano, is appointed by the presiding judge to act as Guardian ad Litem for Anna. They reunite after many years of being apart to fight it out and to figure out what needs to be done in the best interest for Anna, a girl who no one has looked out for until now.  It had always been in the best interest for Kate that Anna's body was being used, but now it is up to the legal system to decide whether Anna had rights over her body or not. Did Anna and Kate's parents have the right and power to decide what they can do with Anna's body, since she was a minor? What if they asked her to donate her kidney to Kate, a surgery that is not concerned simple? Did Anna have the right to say no?  <br /> <br />MY SISTER'S KEEPER is full of moral and ethical questions that will have the reader glued to the pages.  The ending is a shocker, and it would be shocking to hear of anyone who did not need to use a hanky by the time they had finished the book.  This has been so far my favorite book by Jodi Picoult.  Highly recommended!	2004-08-05

GAINING INTEREST by Dara Girard was about two oddly matched people who find themselves attracted to each other.  Adriana Travers owns a lingerie shop and designs lingerie as well. She also tends to overspend to the point where she's headed towards bankruptcy.  The mall is her friend. Eric Henson is the brother of her best friend's husband, and he also happens to be a financial wizard.  Cassie, the best friend asks Eric to help out Adriana's finances as a favor, not intending to set them up romantically. <br /> <br />Their first appointment is a disaster, and Adriana is livid as Eric tells her how to budget her money.  She thinks Eric is dull and boring and feels that being tight with money is not a good attribute.  He's also very reserved and conservative, and is nothing like Adriana, who is wild and loves to dress to impress.  When Eric tells her that it's his birthday, she feels that a night out with her friends would be a nice treat, so the two of them attend a play and later go dancing at a club with a bunch of her friends.  Adriana sees a different side of Eric.  <br /> <br />While they are at the bar, she sets eyes on Lynda, Eric's future fiance, who is dancing very close to another man. Adriana feels a need to protect Eric when she spies Lynda and Barry together, but it's too late: Eric spots the couple and a fight breaks out. <br />  <br />Soon, a relationship between them ensues, but neither of them sees it as being permanent. At the same time, Adriana's seven-year-old daughter Nina moves in with Adriana, since Laurence, Adriana's ex-husband, is marrying a woman who does not like kids.  Adriana is also not the maternal type, and has a hard time dealing with Nina's moving in, but Eric turns into the perfect man by helping Nina transition from living with Dad to living with Mom.  Eric and Nina become close, to Adriana's disappointment and a part of her is jealous that they can be so close, yet she and Nina barely speak to one another.  <br /> <br />Best friend Cassie is rooting for their relationship to become serious, while Eric's brother Drake doesn't think it'll last.  To add to that, Eric's not-so-clean past may possibly threaten to tear the two apart.  Is there any hope for Adriana and Eric?  Do opposites really attract? <br /> <br />I loved GAINING INTEREST; however, the final few chapters relating to Eric's con-artist past did not sit right with me.  Because not much of this part of his past was divulged until the very end, it didn't read as being very real, and felt like a last minute effort to tie up loose ends.  Other than this awkward ending, I do recommend GAINING INTEREST.  I think Dara Girard has a lot of talent as a writer, and I would definitely read more by her.	2004-08-01

Mindy Friddle's THE GARDEN ANGEL is filled with quirky yet lovable characters, reminiscent of the characters gracing the pages of a Richard Russo novel.  In her debut novel, Friddle places two very unlikely women as friends, through a common bond that may ultimately test the two in their very shaky relationship. <br /> <br />Cutter (Catherine) Johanson is fighting her sister and brother to keep the house that has been in their family for many generations.  Their family the Harris's, are the founding fathers of their small town of Sans Souci, Florida, and Cutter is not only proud of the family heritage, but this house was their grandmother's, the woman that raised the three of them after their parents left them orphans years ago.  Sister Ginnie and brother Barry both want the money they could get from selling the place, and neither seem to care about the family history that is deeply rooted in this old house.  Cutter handles two part time jobs to make ends meet, hoping to save up enough money to buy out both siblings so she can keep the house in the family. She knows this is futile, because neither part time job garners much money, but she dreams on, hoping that one day she will no longer have to worry that her real estate agent will be bringing yet another potential buyer. <br /> <br />Ginnie, in the meantime, has discovered she is pregnant by her married lover.  \\"Wife\\", as Ginnie likes to refer to \\"the other woman\\" in her lover's life, is described by Ginnie as an evil woman who is doing things to make her husband Daniel unhappy, and Ginnie is waiting in the wings for the day Daniel leaves his wife Elizabeth.   <br /> <br />Elizabeth Byer, a very mentally ill and unhappy woman, lives as a shut-in, pretending to work on her thesis on Emily Dickinson.  She is afraid of life and anything to do with it, and rarely leaves the house. Through an anonymous phone-call, Elizabeth learns of Daniel's infidelity, and is pointed to the house where Cutter and Ginnie live. It is through this phone-call that Elizabeth meets Cutter, and their odd friendship begins. <br /> <br />As the two slowly get to know one another, Cutter is able to bring Elizabeth out of her shell, to a point where Elizabeth is now looking forward to spending the day outdoors, and not cooped up in the house as she normally does.  Daniel has no idea Elizabeth is making these excursions with Cutter to the Farmers Market or to the Pancake Palace where Cutter works.  It's a very tenuous friendship, but through it Cutter is able to help out a woman who was deemed too ill to live without help from others. Elizabeth slowly comes out of her shell. Even Daniel notices the difference.  <br /> <br />Cutter is fully aware that Elizabeth is the wife of Ginnie's lover, and therefore Ginnie has no idea that this friendship even exists. But Cutter is sure that the day will come when all is out in the open, and there will be hell to pay. The climax of this story is such a scene, I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall while the chaos ensued. <br /> <br />The various friends of Cutter all have quirky little personalities.  She spends a lot of time across the street with Father Bob and his Home for Retarded Men.  She even has one man, Alfred, clean house for her and brings him to the newspaper where she works.  With the help of the men across the street, she and Elizabeth find a way to deter a potential buyer. Elizabeth will do anything for her friend Cutter, and her goal now is to save the house that Cutter desperately wants to keep.   <br /> <br />While the reader gets to learn about Elizabeth, Cutter's private life is also put into focus, especially when her relationship with her boss at the newspaper, Curt, develops into something more. As with all her relationships, this one is also based on very shaky ground, but Cutter thinks there is more to it than what it really is. <br /> <br />THE GARDEN ANGEL is most likely going to be in my top 20 list for 2004.  I highly recommend this book, and I look forward to seeing more by her.  It's funny, sad, whimsical, and such a fast read that you will wish it never ends.	2004-08-01

DIM SUM centers on the life and insecurities of this woman who does not seem to fully appreciate her Chinese heritage.  She is ashamed to bring friends home, due to the fact that she lives with her grandmother and the place smells of Chinese herbs and spices.  She talks about ?hoarders?, Caucasian men who are into Asian women, and she despises them for it.  She makes a point to avoid men like this.   <br /> <br />She doesn?t see it right away, but her fellow employee Michael turns out to be another hoarder, but for the most part she is pretty obsessed with him until she realizes it.  It pretty much reeks of obsession when she stalks him one day, thinking he?s on a date.  Michael, however, is either not aware of her obsession with him, or is flattered by it, because he is never deterred by her behavior (he wasn?t aware of the stalking, by the way) and the two of them continue to flirt in the office. <br /> <br />THE DIM SUM OF ALL THINGS did remind me of Amy Tan?s novels.  Keltner places the book in the present day, but as with Amy Tan, Keltner also brought the reader back to a character?s past, in this case Pau Pau, Lindsey?s grandmother.  Through Pau Pau, Lindsey slowly begins to see what her family background is all about and learns to respect the past.  But in the mean time, the reader will have to endure Lindsey?s paranoia about being Chinese, something this reader cannot relate to (being Japanese American).  Is there really a person out there that is that ashamed of his/her ethnic background? Lindsey is truly a pathetic person, and this reader had a hard time liking her.  However, she redeems herself in the end, and therefore this reviewer is going to give this book a rating of 4/5.	2004-07-23

They are on a trip to visit her parents, the Farlows, who now own \\"The Whistling Winds\\", a small adobe ranch resort in New Mexico which they used to visit on vacations while Liz was growing up. Many happy memories are attached to this place, and Liz is looking forward to this mini-vacation. Her good friend, Maria, still lives close by, and it feels wonderful getting reacquainted with her longtime friend and her parents, the Valdezes.<br />Other interesting characters include two guests of the resort, Major Reginald Hall and Miss Bartley. Major Hall claims to have graduated from West Point and spends all his time digging for archeological artifacts at Husaka, one of the old abandoned pueblos. Miss Bartley is an elderly matron who appears to have a crush on the Major, and seems to have been brought up in an upper class, privileged environment. Both of them irritate Liz from time to time, but Cokey enjoys their company, constantly asking them questions.<br />However, there is one person who stands out. Clyde Hawkins works at the resort, helping out her parents in any way he can. By trade he's an artist, selling his artwork at Maria's gallery. Liz feels drawn to him, while Clyde has also noticed Liz and approaches her one day at the resort. There is one problem - Liz is finding herself questioning a lot of things about his culture, that of the Adobe Indians. She can't believe that both he and Maria take seriously the myths and legends of their people; superstitions that Liz laughs at and questions them on whether they truly believe these stories. Liz also shows her obvious repulsion toward a group of dancers at a festival, an act that does not go unnoticed byClyde. Clyde tells Liz that his previous marriage broke up because of their clash in cultures, and Liz is confused on how she feels.<br />Maria warns Liz that Clyde is meant to be an artist, and cannot be distracted by a love interest, especially someone who is not of their ethnic background. Liz wonders if there is more to Maria's warnings than that of a concerned friend, but promptly ignores her advice. When Cokey's new pet cat disappears, Maria's warnings about the myth of Morning Star may be coming true, and that their lives may be in danger. But how could Liz truly believe that an ancient myth about a deceased Indian could be anything other than legend?<br />INDIAN TIME was a well-written book, but it lacked a few things.  The book was too short, and it stands to reason why there was not enough room to develop the relationship between Clyde and Liz. While the other characters appear to be fully-developed in detail, especially that of Major Hall and Miss Bartley, the author did not spend as much time creating a realistic romance between the two main characters. There were a few romantic scenes between them, but this reviewer found it hard to believe there was any chemistry.  This reviewer believes the book was aimed toward the young adult audience, and in that case, the lack of any real romance makes sense.  However, this reviewer had a hard time believing that there was anything real going on between Clyde and Liz. On the other hand, the mystery behind the missing cat, and other adventures that follow, were well done. The author could have used another fifty pages or so to make this a perfect romance. There is definite promise in this author's future, and this reviewer gives INDIAN TIME three and a half stars.	2004-07-19
583017:US	51214937	R2UM0TAFTQJ8BO	0778320634	561779183	Wedding Ring	Books	4	38	40	N	Y	Southern Roots	WEDDING RING by Emilie Richards<br />Here's a book I would recommend to women who love to read about southern traditions and families. WEDDING RING by Emilie Richards takes place in the Shenandoah Valley --- Toms Brook, Virginia --- and centers on three generations of women that are learning to deal with each other and come to terms with a death in the family that occurred three years ago.  Tessa McCrae had lost her only child Kayley in a car accident, and is still not able to deal with the emotions from this tragedy.  She blames herself, and has shut out her husband to the point that she's driving him away, using the excuse of helping out with her grandmother to stay away from Mack during this particular summer. In the mean time, her mother Nancy has asked Tessa to help her with cleaning up Grandmother Helen's home in Toms Brook, and to their dismay they find that it's a mess.  The term \\"pack rat\\" doesn't even describe the condition of this house.<br />The many different quilts that are found in the house help bring the bickering women together.  Helen and Nancy open up their souls and tell the stories of their childhoods and early years of marriage with the discovery of each quilt.  It's a side that Tessa has never seen of each woman and it changes her perspective of both of them.  <br />The Wedding Ring quilt is one that helps unite the three women, and there is a history behind it.  Tessa learns how the quilt was created, through the stories told by both Nancy and Helen, and it is a touching story.  While the purpose of the title is not apparent from the start, by the end of the book the reader will understand how the Wedding Ring quilt is central to the story.  The first of a trilogy of books called the Shenandoah Album trilogy, based on these traditional quilts, I found WEDDING RING a very enjoyable read. It's a type of book that will be enjoyed by women who like to read about family and traditions, in particular those families deeply rooted in the south.	2004-07-19

In this Harlequin Superromance, the heroine is Addy Pierce, who in the prologue is remembering when she caught her husband Mark in bed with another woman. It was a shock to her system, since she had always thought their marriage was rock solid, despite the late work hours they both kept, and the fact that they rarely spent any alone time together anymore. Seeing him with that other woman was a slap in the face, but it helped Addy look back on her marriage and her life, and realize she had been hiding behind her career while her marriage slowly crumbled.<br />Addy is a very successful lawyer in Washington D.C, and had always thought this would be enough to make her happy. Mark had expressed no interest in starting a family, and she had accepted it.  It wasn't until she saw him with his pregnant lover that she realized he just did not want to start a family WITH HER.<br />During a business trip taken around the time her divorce has become final, she finds herself alone in the hotel bar, and accidentally bumps into an old childhood friend.  Culley Rutherford was a successful doctor with a small town practice, the same town where Culley and Addy had grown up together all those years ago. She had not seen him in a while; their friendship having faded once Mark and Addy had become an item. What Addy never realized was that Culley had always had some feelings for Addy other than friendship.  But he had kept his feelings hidden, knowing that Addy had been in love with Mark.<br />Culley and Addy decided to have a few drinks together that night, and against Addy's better judgement, they end up in bed.  Addy leaves the next morning without a note or a message, and it leaves Culley troubled.  She figures she will never see him again, until she receives a call from her hometown, saying that her mother is in the hospital and needs Addy right away. Things change because of that one phone call, and Addy finds herself moving temporarily back to Harper's Mill to help out her mother with their apple orchards.<br />Addy finds that you CAN go home again, and as she and her mother mend a relationship that had begun to unravel due to time and misunderstandings, Culley and Addy rekindle their friendship, as well as make that move toward a new direction.  And getting to know Culley's daughter Madeleine is a treat. <br />As they get to know each other again, Culley and Addy slowly reveal their secrets to each other, building a relationship of trust. But as their relationship starts to take off, Culley's ex-wife Liz reappears in his life, and Culley is torn between a woman he truly has loved all his life, and a woman that needs him emotionally to survive. <br />One trademark in every Inglath Cooper romance is at least one scene that is sentimental, but not overly maudlin. A touching scene with Addy and a young deer she had been nursing was very apropos and welcome in this story. It was a good point demonstrating not only the young deer's soon-to-come independence from Addy, but in turn, Addy's independence from her own past with Mark and a departure from her own low-self-esteem.  <br />This reviewer enjoyed UNFINISHED BUSINESS. As usual, Ms. Cooper did a wonderful job creating characters that her readers will like and care about.  It was surprising to find the novel starting off in the setting of the big city, and it was a relief to see Ms. Cooper taking the rest of the story to the small town setting where she is quite an expert.  It is quite evident that her skills as a writer grow with each new novel, creating a better balance between primary characters and secondary characters. This reviewer can honestly say that this is her favorite book by Ms. Cooper so far. Highly recommended!	2004-07-19
602217:US	51214937	R1Z4LSLH3833AW	0385335814	370438124	The Summer Guest	Books	4	15	21	N	Y	One of my favorites in 2004	THE SUMMER GUEST by Justin Cronin<br />I?m going to preface this by saying this was one of my favorite books this year so far.  THE SUMMER GUEST by Justin Cronin is the story of three people ? Joe and Lucy Crosby, and a multi-millionaire Harry Wainwright, whose lives are tied together through circumstances involving a fishing camp.  The story itself is more emotionally driven than action-driven, and with the beautiful writing skills that Cronin uses, I found this book refreshing and very enjoyable.<br />THE SUMMER GUEST is in part a love triangle.  Joe and Lucy meet as teenagers at the fishing camp that Joe?s father runs.  At the same time, Harry has become a regular customer, but he is already married.  Unbeknownst to Lucy, Harry?s wife is terminally ill.  In the meantime, there is a chemistry between Lucy and Harry that is hard to deny, but her heart belongs to Joe, even when he evades the Vietnam draft and escapes to Canada, leaving her behind in Maine.<br />The story?s present day is 1994, and Harry has returned to the camp one last time. He is terminally ill with cancer, and knows this will be his last visit.  Joe and Lucy are now married, and they run the camp.  They have hired a young man named Jordan to help run it with them, and it is to Jordan that Harry leaves the camp, after buying it from Joe and Lucy, who have decided it is time to let it go.  They now have a daughter, Kate, that rounds out the cast of characters, and it is through Kate that the story ends with a final ?bang?, as a secret is revealed to the reader that ties all of them together.<br />This may not be everyone?s cup of tea, but I enjoyed the characters that Cronin created in THE SUMMER GUEST. The book spanned several generations and two wars, and the author was able to tie everything together, making the characters to be believable and real.  His descriptions of the natural landscape of Maine helped create an atmosphere of idyllic summers and of an age long gone.  I would certainly readmore of Justin Cronin.  Highly recommended.	2004-07-05

I had expected DIVINE SARAH by Adam Braver to be more than what it turned out to be - a novel that didn't even come close to what the blurb on the back said it would be.  Although it was interesting to read about this legendary actress, Sarah Bernhardt, and it was even more interesting to have her in the setting of early 1900's Los Angeles, the book read as if it were slightly disjointed, as if the parts that were to come together never did.<br />The story takes place in a week's span of time, in Southern California 1906.  While Sarah Bernhardt battles her demons and wishes she were retired, news reporter Vince Baker is upset about the quality of news writing and what he is expected to put out.  Then we have Abbott Kinney, a successful land developer who became the founder of the city of Venice, California, who is a strong character in this book, and actually helps make the book worth reading.  <br />But over all, the book fails to be what it should have been - it should have been a story about two people who are soul-searching, trying to figure out what their futures hold for them. I believe this was Adam Braver's vision for this novel, but it is not what I got from reading it.  <br />He created characters that did not quite ring true on paper, and their stories should have been written so that they actually had a connection to each other, but I didn't see the connection.  He might as well have been writing separate stories.  I also found the character of Vince Baker weak and one-dimensional. Regarding Sarah's character, from reading this book, it did not come across to me that Sarah was French; the author did not attempt to replicate speech patterns that would have made me think she was not from this country. On the other hand, I did enjoy the character of Max Klein, her gay manager and confidante.  I think Braver did a good job creating this relationship betweenKlein and Bernhardt, and it was probably the most enjoyable aspect of the book.  <br />I'm not giving this book a 5 star recommendation, but giving it only 3 stars, because I don't think everyone who reads this book will have the same reaction I did.  There are a lot of redeeming qualities to DIVINE SARAH, one of which was the introduction to this legendary actress of the late 1800's and early 1900's. I am not sorry I read this book, but I am rather hesitant in reading another one by Adam Braver.  He may not be my cup of tea.	2004-07-03

MULTIPLE CHOICE by Claire Cook is the story of a mother and daughter that end up attending college at the same time (but at different schools).  Narrated by \\"mom\\", March Monroe, the story is told in a light tone and is funny throughout.  Her daughter Olivia is in college now, and although March tells her tale as if the two of them are close friends, Olivia's attitude toward her mother is one of embarrassment.  She's at a time in her life where she's friendly with Dad, but she would rather not be in her mother's company.<br />Olivia has no idea her mother has started college until they bump into each other at the college radio station as fellow interns. (College was husband Jeff's idea ---  he discovered that it was a great way to get financial aid if there were more than one college student in the family). <br />It's one funny scene after another. The station decides that they need a new show to fill in a time slot, due to a vacating show focusing on New Age philosophies called \\"Karyn's Karmic Korner\\" hosted by a woman named Rhonda. The show \\"I'm Rubber, You're Glue\\" is created, and March and Olivia are the stars! It's their chance to become famous and make a go at it in the world of radio, while being themselves, discussing topics and answering questions from a mother and daughter point of view.<br />In the meantime, March has a crush on their producer, David, who she finds out reciprocates her feelings, and she dreams up fantasies that include him. It's harmless fun, although at one point March is almost tempted to make that one step past that forbidden line.<br />Antics with the impossible \\"Andrea\\", March's last client in her \\"directionality\\" business, are full of laughs, as March tries her best to wean Andrea off of her.  Andrea is starting to suffer separation anxiety, and March is almost happy to be rid of her and this business, although the money was pretty good, and the job was pretty easy. At one pointAndrea uses March as a high-priced baby sitter.<br />I  loved MULTIPLE CHOICE. It's not a  literary novel by any means, but it's a very simple, fun,  summer read that will have you chuckling.  I'm giving this one 4 stars, and highly recommend it to fans of chick lit.	2004-07-02

She is happily married to husband Keith and they share a wonderful daughter named Katie, who is in preschool.  Besides being a mother and wife, she also runs a day care called Little Spirits, which has been a great success.  However, when Bonnie starts to show dissatisfaction with her life, Keith isn't sure what to think, and feels that it must have something to do with him.  But, no matter how often Keith asks Bonnie, she can't explain why she is not happy.  All she knows is that what she currently has is not enough.  She loves Keith and Katie, and she cannot understand why she needs something more.<br />In the meantime, Little Spirits has been plagued with some bad luck.  Fires have broken out, and while at first her brother Greg, the Sheriff of Shelter Valley, thinks the first fire may have been the result of a prank, they soon begin to suspect arson.  But who would purposefully try to burn down the daycare?  Bonnie has kept some information to herself, the fact that she is being forced to move the daycare to a different property. When Greg finds out the truth, he wonders if her landlord may be the one that is trying to chase her out.<br />While Bonnie is battling with problems at the daycare, she is also watching her marriage fall apart.  Keith no longer trusts her, since he senses that she is hiding something from him and is not willing to talk to him about how she feels.  He confides with a co-worker Martha, who convinces him the solution may be to have another baby.  To his dismay, it only pushes Bonnie further away. And Shane, an old boyfriend of Bonnie's who sustained brain damage from a skiing accident, now works for Bonnie at the daycare, and he reminds her of their high school days, when they were an item. <br />BORN IN THE VALLEY was a pleasant read. However, there were a few scenes that I felt didn't belong in this book.  I also felt the character of Martha, Keith's co-worker, was a little hard to figure out at times (was she or wasn't she coming on to Keith?).  Despite the few flaws I found in the novel,  I'm going to give this book 4 stars.	2004-06-30

EDEN CLOSE by Anita Shreve<br />EDEN CLOSE by Anita Shreve centers on a murder that takes place almost 20 years ago in a small rural town in upstate New York.  Andrew, now working in sales and advertising in New York city, returns home for his mother's funeral and brings back with him memories of his childhood friend Eden and that murder which took place next door at the Close family's residence.  <br />Eden Close was a childhood friend of Andrew, he being seventeen at the time of the murder, and Eden only fourteen.  He recalls the blossoming of their friendship, the recklessness that was part of Eden's personality, and the murder of her father that was still a mystery to Andrew all these years later.  He remembers bits and pieces of what may have happened, but on that fateful night, all he remembers is hearing a gunshot, screams, and nothing more. <br />Upon his return home for the funeral, Andrew stays to deal with the family property and get it ready for sale. He is the only surviving member, his father having passed away five years earlier from a heart attack, and he is an only child. As he goes through the many old items in the house, he recalls his childhood and the murder and accident that caused Eden to lose her sight.  While Eden was such a big part of Andrew's life when they were growing up, he has had nothing to do with her since the murder.  He finds out that she's been shut inside her home with Edith Close for all these years, except for a few years where she spent time in a special facility. He becomes obsessed with his need to get in contact with Eden, and to find out what has happened to her, despite Edith's determination to keep Andrew away from Eden.<br />Andrew does succeed in getting in contact with Eden again. And slowly, she feeds him the story about what really happened twenty years ago, as they slowly rekindle their friendship and lost love, behind Edith's back.  What Andrew finds out is a shocker, and the book culminates in a scene straightout of the movies.<br />I really enjoyed EDEN CLOSE.  I started the book having no idea what it was about, but I was not disappointed.  A page-turner from the very first page, it took me only two days to read the entire book.  While parts of the plot I did find predictable, it was the journey of the story that kept me going, not the ending.  EDEN CLOSE comes highly recommended.	2004-06-30

Each chapter is told by a different character, giving differing viewpoints of the story.  It may have been a method of story-telling that could have failed, but Napolitano does a good job of making each voice stand out as a unique personality, and the overlapping chapters and view points give this book a unique feel.<br />The book has a large cast of characters, most of whom are members of the McLaughlin family, either by marriage or by birth.  Catharine is the matriarch, and it's her story that is told in the opening chapter by her granddaughter Gracie.  Gracie details the birth of the twins, two of Catharine's children that never got a chance at life.  The birth is a story that goes into detail, up to Catharine's husband Patrick's devastating behavior of taking the dead twins and throwing them in the trash.  It's the start of a novel that describes a family that has endured hardships, yet despite these hardships that could have brought them together as a family, they find themselves drifting apart.  Catharine's attempts at keeping the family together are wasted, as she ages and realizes that without her there, her children and grandchildren almost have no need to stay together as a family.<br />Gracie's pregnancy remains a secret throughout most of the book, and the reader watches as Gracie makes one decision after another regarding the baby, without any regard to the father's feelings, whether to take care of it on her own, or find help.  Catharine's intuitive nature helps her figure out Gracie's situation, and insists on helping out her granddaughter. Gracie's problems are temporarily fixed, but not for long.<BR> <BR>Gracie continues on her every day destructive behavior, meeting new men purely for the sake of sex.  Gracie's history is of a woman who has no self-worth, bouncing from one man to another as if trying to win a contest.  Her temporary roommate is her sister, Lila, who is struggling with her own problems. While Gracie uses her body to define her self-worth, Lila is doing the exact opposite, trying her best to keep from getting into a physical relationship with any man.  When Lila finds herself in a very unlikely relationship with a friend of the man that fathered Gracie's child, Lila goes for it, despite her repulsion for the man. Lila's obsession was her scholastic achievements, and was on her way to becoming a doctor, when she suddenly lets go of the dream, focusing mainly on this new relationship.<br />Louis and Kelly are two more main characters. The two have been married for years, Kelly being Catharine's oldest surviving child.  She lives life trying to control everything in her life, including her family, and slowly realizes she's alienated herself from her husband and her children, Gracie and Lila.  Louis loves his wife but after a death at a work site in which he blames himself, he finds himself needing to distance himself from Kelly, spending nights downstairs alone.  He secretly obsesses over his lost employee, and finds ways to take care of the widow, a woman that becomes involved in the family later on in the novel.<br />While most of the story takes place in the present, the various characters narrate scenes from the past, helping to explain what makes these characters tick.  It's a mix of the present and the past that makes this novel come alive, culminating with Gracie and her story about her pregnancy.  Her situation helps bring together this family that has been becoming more and more distant as time moves on.  Catharine's sense of family is strong, and through Gracie she tries to unite them before it's too late.<br />This reviewer enjoyed WITHIN ARM'S REACH.  With a novel that spans several generations of familyhistory, Napolitano wrote a wonderful family saga that will be enjoyed by many.  This book deserves a 5 star rating.	2004-06-26

THE DRESS LODGER by Sheri Holman falls short of my expectations, but I won't be giving it a terribly bad review.  What was good about this book was the story. There are several themes and story lines going on at the same time, with Gustine the prostitute and her baby as one focal point, Doctor Chivers and his obsession with his anatomy school another, and finally the cholera epidemic the third.  Between the three, Holman weaves a story about life in Sunderland, England in the early 1800's, focusing mostly on that of the poor and unfortunate, but also contrasting their lives with the upper class, which is represented by Doctor Chivers and his fiancée, Audrey.<br />Gustine works as a pottery assistant by day, and is a prostitute by night.  She and her baby live in a rundown lodging, owned by a shady man named Whilky Robinson, who is also her pimp.  He has the help of an old hag known as The Eye, who literally can only see through one eye. She is hideous and can strike fear into anyone that sees her.  She cannot speak, but follows Gustine at night wherever she goes, making sure Gustine earns the money Whilky has hired her for.<br />The story starts with a narrative, an omnipresent narrator that points out Gustine to the reader.  She is known for her blue dress, which from afar makes her look like a lady of upper class standing. Upon closer inspection one will know she is a prostitute, and she is working her shift.  The Eye is always behind her, keeping watch.  While Gustine is servicing her latest customer outside near the wharf, she spies a body near the water.  It is a dead body, to Gustine's delight.  She then searches out the Doctor, Dr Henry Chivers, who the reader soon finds out is looking for fresh dead bodies to help teach his anatomy class.  Dr Chivers believes that a good doctor needs to practice on a real body, and that classroom lessons on paper are not enough.  Gustine has volunteered to find bodies for him.<br />And so starts the intricate novel THE DRESS LODGER.  It is full of interesting characters,  two-dimensional yet serving the purpose, to tell a story.  What makes this book not quite the winner it could be is the writing style and the structure.  Holman apparently tried to emulate Dickens and other contemporaries of that time.  However, she falls short of her goal.  I would give this book A+ for effort, but the story definitely needed to be re-written and fixed up.  The ending was also somewhat sloppy, although again I applaud the effort.  If it were not for the fascinating story of the cholera epidemic and reading about 1800's England, I would not have wanted to finish this book.  It was difficult to read, especially the first few chapters, and it wasn't until I got past that point that I really was able to get into the story.  This book is getting 3.5 stars from me, 4 stars based on Amazon's rankings.	2004-06-20

It sounds tragic, but LOVE, LOUISA is anything but tragic.  Instead, it's an often funny, often lighthearted story of one woman who does her best to get back on her feet, get over the loser of a fiancé that decided not to show up at their wedding, and recover the dignity she knew she once had.<br />The story starts in New York --- to be precise, Manhattan.  It is the eve of their engagement party, and Louisa has just crashed Howard's \\"beloved\\" Porsche.  As they argue over the accident and the money that is involved, the conversation moves to finances and even worse, pre-nuptial agreements.  Louisa is appalled that the man she loves is worried about what could happen in the event of a divorce!  This was surely a bad omen, but Louisa fails to see it as such.  When Howard and his entire set of friends and family members fail to show up at the wedding, it's pretty obvious that he's changed his mind and Louisa carries on at the wedding reception as if nothing is wrong, and goes on the honeymoon by herself.  She paid for it, so she might as well enjoy it!<br />Things couldn't get worse, but they do.  She returns from the Bahamas with the worst sunburn ever, ending up in the emergency room. That's not the end of it.  It's one thing after another, from the wedding to the end of her honeymoon, written in the style that is quite popular with today's chick lit and comedic-romances.  This reviewer had a difficult time keeping from laughing out loud. Although we do want to sympathize with Louisa, it is still pretty funny.  She is definitely not having any luck!<br />Louisa then has to figure out where she is going to live.She has to retrieve her belongings from Howard's apartment (which used to be theirs, but he has thoughtfully changed the lock) and figure out where she is going to work (she and Howard were employed for the same company, so she gladly stepped down for her future husband). Her life is a mess.<br />Remembering the family cottage near the South Hamptons, Louisa decides to go there and set up camp for a while, at least until she can figure out what to do next.  As she buries herself in housework and tries to fix up the place, she finds herself getting acquainted with the handyman, Dante.  It takes Louisa a long time to figure out, but Dante actually owns many of the dwellings in the area, and so Louisa in the mean time treats him like the hired help.  He's actually one of the wealthiest men around.  It is one funny scene after another, as always caused by misunderstandings. And through all of this, Louisa finds herself wildly attracted to him, which causes her to panic.  The feelings are mutual, of course.<br />LOVE, LOUISA is one of the funniest contemporary romances this reviewer has read in a long time.  It does not quite fit the chick lit category of romances that have glutted the book shelves lately, but follows a more conventional style of writing, yet has plenty of light-hearted humor that will keep the reader chuckling.  It is no surprise that Barbara Metzger has been awarded two Romantic Times Career Achievement Awards. Highly recommended!	2004-06-19

SALEM FALLS by Jodi Picoult<br />Jodi Picoult does it again with SALEM FALLS, a story about a man who is falsely accused of rape. Jack St. Bride was a teacher and soccer coach at a small town high school, when he is accused of rape and is sentenced to 8 months in prison.  When he is released, he finds his way to another small town, Salem Falls, to start a new life, hoping that anonymity will give him the peace he is looking for.<br />The wheels of fate start turning when he has to report in to the local police department and let them know he is a sex-offender.  In this small town, gossip spreads fast, and soon the entire town learns who Jack really is.  Only two people feel that he is innocent of the crime he was accused of back home: Addie Peabody, who owns the \\"Do-or-Diner\\" and her father, Roy Peabody.  Both of them are dealing with losses that have greatly affected their current life, and in some way they can relate to Jack as he struggles to escape from his past.<br />At the heart of this story is the theme of  \\"the witch hunt\\", as the towns people watch Jack closely with condemning eyes as they wait for him to make his first mistake. He is then accused of yet another rape, this time accused by the only daughter of the richest man in Salem Falls. Jodi Picoult keeps the reader guessing, as even the reader isn't sure whether Jack is guilty or not.  As with KEEPING FAITH and THE PACT, this book ends in the courtroom, and it is anyone's guess what the final verdict will be. <br />This is yet another Jodi Picoult book that I enjoyed a lot.  Although it took me a while to get into the story, as I had a hard time relating to the teens who practiced witchcraft, it all came together in the end.  Highly recommended, I am giving this book five stars.	2004-06-16

THE TRIALS OF TIFFANY TROTT by Isabel Wolff<br />I hadn't read a really good CHICK LIT book in a while, but here's one I highly recommend: THE TRIALS OF TIFFANY TROTT by Isabel Wolff.  It reminded me somewhat of the heroine of BRIDGET JONES DIARY, since both books portrayed a woman that was far from perfect, and had a problem meeting Mr. Right.  The tone of both books I found similar as well, and I think it helped me get into TIFFANY TROTT that much faster.  But, while there have been a lot of imitations out there since DIARY came out, I think this one stands alone as one of the few that I feel is not an imitation, but the real thing.<br />Poor Tiffany Trott doesn't seem to have any luck with men.  One boyfriend was obsessed with golf (and other women) and another was obsessed with women's clothing.  After much frustration, Tiffany decides to put an ad in the newspaper to see if she could find a decent man worth keeping.  Her adventures in dating had me laughing-out-loud.  When she makes a new best friend, Kate, who is also single and having men troubles, the two of them decide to team up and try the singles' \\"meet `n greet\\" parties and raves.  These lead to more funny adventures in dating that had me smiling.<br />Among all the men she meets, the one she cannot forget is from the newspaper ad and who called himself \\"Seriously Successful\\".  After a wonderful first date, she knows she's met Mr. Right, but he is honest enough to let her know he's married, and is trying to find someone on the side.  (He's unhappily married, and refuses to divorce his wife so as to not devastate his teenage daughter).  She backs off and turns him down, but he is the one that she dreams of at night, wishing he were free. No matter whom she meets, she always finds herself thinking of him.<br />Besides the adventures in dating, THE TRIALS OF TIFFANY TROTT is filled with a lot of fun characters that populate Tiffany's world. I felt it was the characters that made this book a fun read, not the actual plot. Some of these characters were larger than life and were exaggerations of real-life people that we may meet on the street, but I think this fact helped to make the book entertaining and enjoyable. I'm giving this book four stars, and if there is a sequel to THE TRIALS OF TIFFANY TROTT, I'll be the first in line to read it.  It is probably going to be one of the funnier books I will read this year.	2004-06-12

It's the story of an identical twin that returns home after years of living apart from her family, to find her twin sister that has gone missing. The novel is funny with a little bit of intrigue and adventure and some romance as well, as Ariana Costas, the main character, does her best to find her sister.<br />Ari has never felt that she belonged with her crazy family.  Her parents, cousins, aunts and uncles are all a bunch of crazy Greeks who enjoy a good con job to make some instant cash.  They don't see their actions as doing anything wrong.  They are just trying to earn a living the only way they know how.  In addition, as the reader gets involved with the hi-jinks of the Costas family, it is not difficult to fall in love with this zany family. However, Ari always felt she had to be straight-laced and clean, and could not stand living with them. She was embarrassed to be a part of this family. Years ago, she had made a decision to be different from the rest of them, and left home to become a professor at a college in Vermont.  Her only reason to return home to New Jersey was because of her sister. Although the two were not as close as they once where, blood is thicker than water.<br />Upon her arrival back in town, Ari runs into a good looking man that thinks Ari is her sister Zoe, and although there is some confusion at first, Quinn Donovan realizes it has to be the other twin.  Their meeting occurs while Ari becomes a target as live bullets are firing upon her. Quinn saves her life and makes his introduction. Ari finds out that Zoe and Quinn worked together at the local Casino, and Ari feels that the casino holds the clues to her missing sister. While Quinn tells Ari to go home, because she is putting herself in danger by staying, Ari does the opposite and gets herself a job at the casino.  She soon finds her life on the line, as she gets closer to the truth about Zoe.<br />In the mean time, there are sparks flying between Ari and Quinn, but Ari thinks it's because she has dressed herself up to look more like Zoe, who was always been the more glamorous of the two.  Quinn, who unknown to Ari is an undercover detective, finds himself drawn to Ari. There are a number of steamy scenes between the two, amidst the action at the casino. The book ends with a climactic scene at the casino, Ari learns the truth about her sister and as with all romances, there is a happy ending.<br />This reviewer enjoyed UNDER THE BOARDWALK for what it was, a beach read. While it wasn't the perfect book, as a casual read it fit the bill.  The mix between the mystery behind Zoe's disappearance, the adventures in the casino and the romance between Ari and Quinn did not work well for this reviewer. The book may have been better if there was more emphasis on comedy, especially the Costas family (including their silly little monkey) and less emphasis on the serious themes, such as the subplot of the young foster child that gets involved with the Costas.  Although the story was touching, and it helped show off Quinn's personality, this reviewer felt it might have been better to make that story a separate book.  Despite these negative points, there were plenty of positives in UNDER THE BOARDWALK, and as a beach read, it's a recommended read.  This reviewer gives the book 3 and a half stars.	2004-06-11
647128:US	51214937	R2RD3EJ2XC5QEC	0060514957	121138293	Killer Smile	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Another great book by Scottoline	KILLER SMILE by Lisa Scottoline<br />Lisa Scottoline's latest legal thriller, KILLER SMILE, takes the reader back to WW II to solve a mystery involving an Italian immigrant.  Lawyer Mary DiNunzio is working for a client whose family goes back to WW II when a number of Italian Americans were rounded up and placed in internment camps, similar to the Japanese Americans.  Amadeo Brandolini died during WW II at one of the camps, and Mary is trying to figure out if this was truly a suicide, or murder.  <br />She picks up clues that lead her to the conclusion that it was murder, and as she delves further into the history of this man, she finds herself in danger.  When her law office is burglarized, she can't imagine that this is related to her investigation of Brandolini's life.  Her boss Bennie Rosato is not pleased that Mary cannot let go of this investigation, because it is obvious that all Mary can do is breath and think about Amadeo.<br />A side trip to Fort Missoula, Montana, where the internment camp used to be, helps Mary put more pieces together.  She discovers that Amadeo had a close friend at the camp, which may be the key to what really happened.<br />I enjoyed reading KILLER SMILE.  It was not your typical legal thriller, since Scottoline spent a good part of the book on the Italian American experience during WW II.  It was an eye-opener, as I had thought only the Japanese Americans were sent to the camps during this awful time in history.  One thing I was not happy about, however, were the many errors that were made during one scene of the book.  An entire scene taking place in a Japanese restaurant showed countless errors referring to specific foods.  The word \\"togarashi\\" is red pepper, NOT sweet potato cakes as was told in the book.  An error such as this is either a poor research job or misinformation, and the author needs to find a different source in terms of researching details such as this.  I am assuming the facts about the Italian American experiences during WW II are accurate.<br />Despite the few negative comments, I am going to give this book 4 stars.  It was worth the read despite the errors, and non-Japanese readers will definitely not catch them.  This is my second book by Scottoline, and I definitely plan on reading the rest.	2004-06-01

Courtesy of WWW.Loveromances.Com<br />PERFECT SWITCH by Lisa Plumley<br />If you happened to be the identical twin sister of a famous television star, would you trade places with her?  In Lisa Plumley's PERFECT SWITCH, Meredith Madison, a plain, quiet, historian that had never wanted to be compared to her more glamorous sister, decides to take advantage of her sister Marley's star status, replaces her at a \\"fantasy camp\\" and manages to fool almost everyone. <br />The novel opens with Meredith riding in a luxury limo with Tony Valentine, a very sexy man that Meredith is not aware is the head of the once successful Valentine Studios in Hollywood. She thinks she's on her way to a fantasy escape vacation, taking Marley's position since Marley is on her honeymoon, unknown to the general public. Tony fills Meredith in (since he thinks her agent has apparently forgotten to tell her what is going on) that this is not a vacation, but two weeks of work.  Meredith is to be the star attraction at a fantasy acting camp, where the average Joe can attend classes and learn how to put on a television show.  Her job is to help teach various classes on the art of being an actress and a star. The success of this camp will determine the future of Valentine Studios, so there is a lot at stake, and a lot of responsibility on Meredith's shoulders.  Meredith has a heart attack but does not let Tony know that she is not her famous sister Marley.  She's gotten herself into this mess, and she vows she'll get herself out.<br />Meredith does her best to be the Marley replacement, and while most of the acting camp including Tony cannot figure out what is wrong with \\"Marley,\\" Meredith thinks she has them all fooled.  She thinks her clothes are glamorous and does not understand that hairy legs and belching in public does not make her into a star.  Tony does eventually find out the truth from Meredith, after a lot of convincing, although at first he is not totally persuaded there is a twin.  But after a while he is able to tell that Meredith is no Marley.  Meredith's choices in outfits, her makeup, especially her hairy legs, prove that she is a fraud. Her behavior in public was another indicator that she was not Marley.<br />PERFECT SWITCH is a comedy romance, with Meredith being the main act.  There were plenty of funny scenes that left this reviewer giggling. However, despite the light tone that is felt throughout the book, it is also a story about a woman who is struggling to find her own identity, having always lived in the shadows of her famous sister.  As Tony and Meredith get to know one another, there is an obvious spark that ignites between them, and while Tony falls in love with Meredith, Meredith firmly believes he loves her for her \\"Marley\\" look, and not for who she really is underneath the clothes and the makeup. <br />While this reviewer enjoyed most of the book, there were parts that appeared to go on too long.  Part of the problem was not enough action, too many contemplative scenes with either Meredith or Tony \\"thinking out loud.\\"  Another problem in some scenes was not enough dialogue, and too much narrative for a romance of this genre. Otherwise, it was a fun ride to tinsel-town, a behind-the-scenes look at the world of show biz, with two unlikely romantic partners finding their way toward each other. A reader could do worse. Three and a half stars goes to PERFECT SWITCH.  This reviewer would definitely consider reading another book by Lisa Plumley in the future.	2004-06-01

WIDE OPEN SPACES by Roz Denny Fox<br />Roz Denny Fox wrote several Harlequin books based on characters that belong to a conservation group called SAVE OPEN SPACES, and here is one of these books. WIDE OPEN SPACES centers on the romance between Coltrane Quinn and Summer Marsh.  Colt works for SOS, and his mission is to obtain the land owned by Summer Marsh, a recent divorcee and mother of a 7-year old son, who is trying to run this ranch on her own and keep it in the family.  The large ranch has been a part of her family for many generations, and she is currently fighting her ex-husband Frank Marsh over the property.  Frank deceived her father by befriending the elderly man, and found his way into Summer's heart in order to get a hold of the land.  It wasn't until her father died that Summer knew what type of man she had married.<br />While Frank is doing his best to get the land so he can sell this prized Oregon property to land developers, Colt is trying to figure out how he can obtain this huge ranch for SOS. Their ultimate goal is to have the ranch set aside as Government protected property to preserve the wildlife and the farm animals that currently reside within the confines of this land.  Colt finds out that Summer has lost her hired hands to a local developer, and in order to help her out and buy time for SOS, Colt volunteers to work the ranch to save her cattle, with the help of his friend Tracey.  Summer has no idea that Tracey and Colt work for SOS.  They keep this a secret as long as they can, so that their boss Gabe Poston has time to set the deal in motion.  Colt thinks the best solution would be for SOS to buy the property and take on Summer as the manager.  That way she can stay on this property and hand it down to her son when the time comes, and with the help of the government, she'll be able to keep the ranch going indefinitely.<br />While Summer, Colt and Tracey try to round up the cattle, things start to happen around the ranch.  Someone tries tosteal her prized bull, and later on someone tries to kidnap her son.  A rescue attempt with a nest of baby eagles leads to a dangerous adventure that brings Colt and Summer closer together, but Summer and Colt both have been hurt badly in prior relationships, and the wall always comes up before either of them can get too close to the other.  When Summer finds out through a friend that Colt was talking in secret with a man in a business suit in town, she begins to distrust Colt and fires him.  But if she can't trust Colt, whom can she trust?<br />I enjoyed WIDE OPEN SPACES.  This is my third book written by Ms Fox, and I enjoy the way she writes.  Her characters always seem believable and likable.  Although she doesn't always write about the great outdoors of Oregon, I can tell that when she does, her heart is truly in the writing.  It is obvious how much she loves the state of Oregon, and its heritage to ranching and to its wildlife.  I'm giving this book 4 stars.	2004-05-31

By Muriel Jensen<br />FOR THE LOVE OF MIKE by Muriel Jensen is another book in the Harlequin series \\"Cooper's Corner\\", a small town in the northeast, centering on a Bed and Breakfast called Twin Oaks.  In this story, Mike Flynn and his two daughters and huge St Bernard take a vacation in the small town of Cooper's Corner, while Colleen O'Connor and her two boys and Siamese are taking a vacation courtesy of her employer.  Both families happen to be staying at the Twin Oaks. When they meet by accident, it's not love at first sight.  While the kids all get along with each other and with the other parent, the two adults clash in a big way.<br />As with all romances, Mike and Colleen do start to have feelings for each other, but Colleen has a wall that prevents her from getting into any serious relationships. She was hurt by her ex-husband, and has decided not to get involved in any permanent relationships to avoid getting hurt again, or disappointing her young sons. Mike does not have custody of his daughters, but all Mike wants now is to have a family again, and it takes some doing for him to convince Colleen that they belong to each other.<br />While this was not the best in the Coopers Corner series, I still did enjoy FOR THE LOVE OF MIKE.  The writing in the beginning was a little stiff, and I did not buy the fact that the two animals happened to have the same homophonic sounding names. (Chewy and Chiue). But once I got past that issue, I had no problems getting into the story and enjoying it.  This reviewer is giving FOR THE LOVE OF MIKE 3 and a half stars.	2004-05-28

It's not only a story of a girl's coming to terms with her mother's disappearance, but also a look back at an era that started with the end of the Vietnam War and the fight for Civil Rights.<br />Angela Davis Brown's life revolved around the love she had for her parents. Melanie is a beautiful woman who at one time had aspirations to becoming someone famous, perhaps a model or an actress.  Angela's father is a professional magician, working at nightclubs and private parties.  With his lack of income, her mother is the breadwinner of the family, and Melanie often berated Teddo for not bringing in enough money. When Melanie disappears, life goes on and Teddo does his best to bring up Angela on his own, trying to bring in more money and giving Melanie the sense of family she needs. He doesn't always succeed, but his heart is in the right place, teaching Melanie about life and about her black heritage.<br />The story is told in flashbacks, using images from the seventies to describe Teddo's convictions of a black man who is trying to survive in a white man's world.  Although this story is about Angela, the story about Teddo and Melanie helps round out Angela's search for the answers she needs to explain why her mother abandoned them.  <br />I especially enjoyed the references made to the 1970's, reminscing about the era that I grew up in.  But I also enjoyed reading about these characters. I found myself laughing as Angela's father warns her about the bad influences of watching shows like the Brady Bunch and Partridge Family, subservice white man shows that taught kids all sorts of bad things. He didn't want his daughter to be like that!  His aspirations for her were to go to upper class white private schools and fitting in with that same crowd.  Although his pride in being black was always apparent, he also had a need to be cultured, to be accepted by the upper class white population. He also taught her the gift of reading, and tried to show her that education could be acquired from simply reading a book.<br />I really enjoyed WHEN DID YOU STOP LOVING ME.  It was not what I had expected at all, although I cannot say at this point what I was expecting.  After reading this book, I felt a satisfaction that comes from reading a good book, short and sweet, yet it packed in plenty for such a short novel.  I am looking forward to more by Veronica Chambers.	2004-05-25

The series starts off with Stephanie unofficially engaged to Joe Morelli, but she's also lusting after Ranger, the rather unconventional bounty hunter (not that bounty hunters are conventional).  <br />Stephanie continues to deal in the bounty hunter business, this time trying to capture an old man named Eddie DeChooch who is more elusive than she would like to admit.  Mooner and Dougie from Hot Six are somehow involved with DeChooch, when Dougie disappears without a trace.  It's Stephanie to the rescue! And of course, there's at least one visit to the neighborhood morgue, with Grandma Mazur up front and center.  <br />An adventure with a pig's heart turns this one into a somewhat darker Stephanie Plum novel. Also, the first half of the novel did not read as funny as previous Stephanie Plum books, but all in all, SEVEN UP is still a fun fast read, and will have the reader chuckling before too long. This is definitely recommended reading for those looking for a fun beach read!	2004-05-20

THE GOODBYE SUMMER by Patricia Gaffney<br />I read THE SAVING GRACES a few years ago, but THE GOODBYE SUMMER, Patricia Gaffney's fourth book, is so much better.  I did not love THE SAVING GRACES; it was not the perfect book.  Something about the way the author put that book together did not make it flow at all.  She had four central characters, and although some authors are very good at writing books like this (Maeve Binchy comes to mind), Gaffney is not.  However, THE GOODBYE SUMMER was such a good book, that I am going to rate this one five stars.<br />THE GOODBYE SUMMER is the story of Caddie Winger, thirty-five years old and is living with her grandmother, \\"Nana\\", who raised her because her mother was never home due to a singing career.  Caddie never knew her father.  In this book, Caddie is struggling to become someone, and when she meets the man of her dreams, she finds that she is coming out of her shell and is no longer the timid, shy, music teacher she has been all her adult life.  <br />Caddie's other inspiration are the friends she makes at \\"The Wake House\\", where her grandmother insists on living at while she recuperates from an injury.  It is here that Caddie starts to come alive, especially after she meets a new member of the House, Thea, who becomes the mother and best friend Caddie has always yearned for.<br />The words to describe this book are \\"charming\\" and \\"wonderful\\".  THE GOODBYE SUMMER is filled with so many interesting characters, yet they do not overwhelm the main point of the book, which is to tell Caddie's story.  I did not want this book to end.

My first and only Jonathan Kellerman book was read ten years ago; it was a book titled BAD LOVE, also an Alex Delaware series.  I enjoyed that book, and there is no excuse why there was a gap of 10 years between that book and A COLD HEART.  My excuse is that I was only reading a book a year at that time, and therefore did not even know there was a series built around this character.<br /> A COLD HEART features, of course, psychologist Alex Delaware, who helps solve crimes with his detective friend Milo Sturgis, who works for the LAPD in homicide.  The two of them find themselves involved in a series of crimes that seem to be centered on a common theme: the victims are somehow related to the arts.  The clues are vague, and there does not seem to be an obvious connection to any of these crimes.  <br />Alex, Milo, and detective Petra O'Connor (who was introduced in BILLY STRAIGHT) work together to find the serial killer.  Clues point to one young adult, a loner named Kevin Drummond, but some of the clues don't add up.  It isn't until the very end that the reader, and Alex and the detectives figure out who-done-it.  A side story about Alex and his ex-girlfriend Robin also ends up connected to the serial killer, with an exciting finish as they figure out who the murderer is.<br />I enjoyed A COLD HEART as much as I enjoyed BAD LOVE.  From the amazon reviews I have read here, I was probably at an advantage since I have not read the entire series of books, and therefore did not find this one \\"tired\\".  It was all \\"new to me\\".  I did have a problem with the new character introduced in this book, Eric Stahl, who I thought at one point of the book was the killer.  I am going to guess he may be used as a continuing character in future books.  I will find out soon enough.  <br />And on that note, I do recommend A COLD HEART.	2004-05-13

Tom is the principal of the local high school, his wife Claire is an English teacher in the same school, and their children Chelsea and Robby attend the high school in this closely-knit town.  They are a happy family, and everyone knows it.  Tom and Claire are 100% devoted to their children, and Chelsea, a cheerleader, and Robby, a football player, are well-rounded well-behaved teens that love their parents very much. <br />Right before the school year starts that September, Tom is introduced to a new student, Kent Arens, and after a second look at Kent's mother, Tom realizes Monica Arens was the one-night stand he had a week before he married his wife Claire. And it is obvious to him that Kent was the result.  Kent is the spitting image of Tom at that age. Tom had never had a need to let Claire know about his fling, because it happened before he made his wedding vows, and he did not think he'd ever see Monica again.  There was nothing between them, no emotional ties. They meant nothing to each other, then or now.<br />What happens the next few months is something out of Tom's worst nightmare, as he struggles with keeping this a secret or letting his wife and family know about the affair.  Their world is torn apart as slowly, the rest of the school finds out who Kent really is, a student that was embraced by the student body and as popular with them as Chelsea and Robby. <br />HOME SONG deals with the theme of infidelity and how it impacts a family that seems too strong to be torn apart. LaVryle Spencer as usual creates real characters with real feelings, characters that are also likable and authentic.  This reviewer's only complaint is the Hollywood-type ending, but over all, this was another excellent book by Spencer.  She has a knack for writing stories that will shock the reader, yet does so in a very realistic manner that makes her stories believable.  Highly recommended!	2004-05-04

Her mother lives on the mainland and she does not know who her father is.  Her maternal grandmother, a very feisty strong-willed woman who is trying to correct the errors she made while raising Emi-Lou's mother and Aunt Vicky, is raising Emi-Lou.  If it weren't for her Grandma and her best friend Yvonne, Emi-Lou feels she would have no one else in the world to love her.<br />The story details Emi-Lou's (Louie's) trials as she attends Junior High school, tries to fit in, and maintains her friendship with Yvonne (Von).  When Emi-Lou notices that Von is starting to pay more attention to another girl in school, warning bells go off inside her head, and she finds herself wondering what is going on.  Jealousy rears its ugly head as she lets this new friendship come between her and Von.  <br />Emi-Lou also deals with boys, wishing to be noticed by the coolest in school, and Von helps Emi-Lou lose weight.  She finds a new sense of self-esteem when they finally notice her, but maybe for the wrong reasons.  It's tough growing up, especially if you don't have parents that want you, and when you are overweight and feel like an outcast.  <br />NAME ME NOBODY by Lois-Ann Yamanaka was yet another wonderful book immersed with the Hawaiian Japanese culture, complete with pidgin and culture that is part of the Hawaiian Japanese world.  This reader felt very much at home with this book, being Japanese American, but a Haole should be able to enjoy the story as well, as it is a universal theme that Yamanaka explores, that of fitting in.  This reviewer gives NAME ME NOBODY four stars.	2004-05-04

HEAT WAVE by Jill Marie Landis<br />HEAT WAVE by Jill Marie Landis is the second novel in the Twilight Cove Trilogy.  In this story, Private Investigator Kat Vargas finds herself relocating temporarily from Long Beach, California to the small beach town of Twilight Cove, house-sitting for her good friend Jake, another P.I. While she is settling in, she meets one of the local residents of the town, Ty Chandler, who asks her to help find his daughter, someone he did not know existed until just recently. The missing daughter was born 19 years ago to his high school sweetheart, but because of a life of drugs that destroyed Amy in the end, he and Amy parted before he ever knew about the baby.<br />Kat's current philosophy in life was to keep emotional attachments at bay, and had focused on her career to keep from falling in love again. She keeps her past hidden from most people, a past that has shaped her into who she is today.  But Ty Chandler is about to change everything.  He finds himself falling in love with Kat while they work together searching for his daughter, and Kat tries her best to keep her own feelings for Ty hidden.<br />Their search leads them back to Southern California, where Ty's daughter Sunny is living a life that is headed towards disaster.  When Ty offers her a home with him in Twilight Cove, Sunny at first turns him down, but surprises him and Kat by showing up one day at his front door, with her own baby in her arms. Ty has become an instant father and grand father!<br />Kat and Ty slowly build their friendship, while Ty and Sunny develop their own.  Things get complicated when Sunny starts to distrust Kat, seeing that Kat does not seem too comfortable around the baby.  Sunny senses that Kat is hiding something, and does not hesitate to let Ty know. And Kat finds her instincts tuned in to the fact that Sunny may not be telling them everything that they should know about her. When Sunny and the baby disappear one day without a trace, Kat goes on her own to track down the missing girl.<br />HEAT WAVE was my first book by Jill Marie Landis.  It was not what I had expected, thinking I would be reading a pure romance novel. Although the main story line is that of Kat and Ty's budding romance, Kat's secret past and Sunny's life in Southern California play a big part in the novel, a story that brings two people together who may have never met except under these circumstances.  I give this book 4 stars, and recommend it to those who are not true romance fans, but may enjoy a book that has a mix of several genres in one.	2004-04-27

KEEPING FAITH by Jodi Picoult<br />This was my second book by Jodi Picoult, and I will definitely be reading more by her.  As with THE PACT, KEEPING FAITH centered on a controversial topic, something that would be seen in today's headlines.  In KEEPING FAITH, there are two themes - one of a family being torn apart by infidelity and divorce, and the other one centering on the child that is caught in the middle.  But this is not any ordinary child custody story.  What happens here is something that is only seen in Catholic history books and other religious literature: Seven-year-old Faith is discovered to have powers that are akin to miracles performed by Catholic saints.<br />Faith's news brings the media to their home town, everyone wanting to witness and spread the tale of this little girl who can bring back the dead, who is suffering from stigmata (spontaneous bleeding from the hands and feet), and can perform other miracles. Her mother Mariah is trying her best to deal with this plus deal with her broken marriage. With the help of her mother, Mariah tries to make sense of what is happening.  When her ex-husband Colin finds out what is happening to Faith, he uses this to point fingers at Mariah, telling the world she is causing her own daughter to suffer and become a media circus. He files for custody, when only a few months ago he had walked out the door, not bothering to look back. Faith is torn between her two parents, and at the same time finds herself in the middle of this mystery about herself, not knowing why she is able to do what she does.<br />KEEPING FAITH is a riveting, complex story that will keep the reader interested till the very end. It is what I definitely call a page-turner.  Highly recommended!	2004-04-25
692663:US	51214937	R3H4EXNP9WWJPN	0060740450	795338322	One Hundred Years of Solitude (Oprah's Book Club)	Books	5	42	47	N	N	One of the greatest books of the 20th Century	ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE by Gabriel Garcia Marquez<br />Reading and finishing ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE by Nobel Prize winner Gabriel Garcia Marquez was a challenge and a chore.  I found myself falling asleep at times, at others I wanted to chuck the book.  But as I found myself reading more and more of this classic book, I wanted to finish it and wanted to be able to give an honest critique about one of the most important novels written in the 20th century.<br />Why was this book a chore to read? Because Marquez chose to write this novel in the rambling style imitating his grandmother, who would tell him stories when he was a child.  There are paragraphs that go on forever, and in fact, there is one sentence that went on for two pages.  When I got past that 2-page sentence, I almost laughed out loud.  Wow!  <br />Next thought comes to mind - was this book worth reading? Yes!  The problem with this book is that one cannot just read the first 100 pages and decide \\"this is awful\\".  Without getting to the end, one will not have the true satisfaction of what the book encompasses, will not understand what the book was about.  When I got to that last page, I put the book down and realized I had just finished an epic novel by an author that obviously deserved the Nobel Prize for Literature.  The book was indeed pure genius.<br />To sum it up, ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE is an epic story in the birth, life and death of the small fictional town of Macondo in a South American country.  It parallels several generations of Buendias.  One of many themes that passed through the family was the fear of one of the descendants would be born with the tail of a pig. Incest is one of the themes that runs rampant throughout the book, one of the many funny elements that kept me reading.  (Not to give it away, there is one child that is born with a tail. I'll leave it to the reader to find out!). <br />Another theme I saw that was obvious by the time I ended the book was realityversus magic realism. While the earlier portions of the history of Macondo was rooted in magic brought to the town by the Gypsies, as one reads further into the story, one encounters realities of war, life and death, and other happenings that this town held as important.  A major turning point was the start of the Banana Company and the arrival of the white man.  And in turn the people of the town had to deal with unions, and workers benefits. What was so shocking was the cover up of an event that came about from a strike. The fact that the townspeople could believe in the lies the Banana company would say to cover up this event was shocking, yes the townspeople easily believed in flying magic carpets and other mystical happenings.  It is true that people will believe what they want to believe, and not necessarily what is the truth.<br />The members of the Buendias family were all larger than life. The Jose Arcadios and the Aureliano's were the two main male characters, each generation being named for someone in the previous one.  Remedios and Amaranta were the common female names, all of them in their own right standing out as someone that was special and unique.  Ursula and Jose Arcadios Buendias were the matriarch and patriarch of the family. Ghosts abound; magic is an every day occurrence.  The novel is Gabriel Garcia Marquez's most famous novel and helped give credit to the genre known as Magic Realism (other good examples are HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS by Isabelle Allende and THE SECOND DEATH OF UNICA AVEYANO by Ernesto Mestre-Reed).  <br />This reader gives ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE a five star rating.  It is not recommend to those who will not have the patience to read a rambling style of narrative.  It is difficult, and often times frustrating.  As seen by the many negative reviews on Amazon, mostly by Post-Oprah publication readers, please note that this book is not for everyone.  But for those who can appreciate fine world literature, this if for you.	2004-04-25

Because of a high school reunion, Olivia Ashford travels back to her hometown of Summerville, Virginia and back through time to reminisce with old friends and remember the love that never left her.<br />Olivia is a famous news anchor on a national cable TV station, but fifteen years ago she was living in a small town, going to high school and deeply in love with John Riley.  Everyone thought they would have a happily-ever-after, but because of a secret that Olivia never shared with anyone, their story ended when she graduated from high school.  Abruptly leaving town and her father, Olivia went on to become a successful woman in the world of broadcasting.  Coming home to Summerville, however, helped Olivia remember who she really was.  <br />John Riley has never forgiven Olivia for leaving him without a trace, without a word of explanation.  Now that Olivia's back in town, John's anger is out of control.   John is still mourning a wife that had passed away only a few years ago, and it is his daughter he lives for.  Going through the guilt that he never loved his wife enough because of the love he still felt for Olivia, John goes through each day carrying a burden that cannot be lifted.<br />At the reunion, it is obvious to everyone that John and Olivia have never forgotten the love they once shared, but because of Olivia's secrets, John's anger prevents him from having even a simple conversation with her.  Olivia is not looking for reconciliation with John. She only wants to let go of the past and be able to move on.  <br />JOHN RILEY'S GIRL by Inglath Cooper has to be one of my favorite Harlequin Superromances that I've read in the past few years.  She was able to make the reader feel as if we were experiencing the sights and sounds of the countryside of Summerville.  Her ability to make the reader empathize with the characters impressed me.  I found myself reminiscing about the good old days, just as her characters did.  This reviewer highly recommends JOHN RILEY'S GIRL.	2004-04-18

Snodgrass does a splendid job taking the reader into this ancient world where royalty lived among the riches of nature and civilization, and kings had the city's citizens at their beck and call.<br />The prologue immediately introduces to the reader the heir to the throne, Al-Mon, a handsome prince fit to be king.  His story is that of twin sons born to the king and queen, but only one lived.  That child was Al-mon. Although Al-mon was well-loved and cherished, he had a \\"birth defect\\" that made it difficult for him to secure a mate. His future queen needed to be a woman who would love him for who he was; a man not perfectly made in the image of the Mayan gods.  His defect was the shape of his head. For some reason, Al-mon did not have the typical flattened forehead that the rest of the Mayans had, and because of this, Al-mon was having the hardest time attracting a woman who loved him despite this unattractive physical trait.<br />Speed forward into the 20th century, where Raina Cotterell is working hard at an archeological dig with her associates.  She's at the site of a famous Mayan ruin, digging up information on the life of Al-mon, a famous king of ancient Maya.  Her associates are Burke O`Neil, who she looks upon with contempt, and the Osbornes, Roy and Cynthia. <br />It seems like a typical day in the life of an archeologist, except for several things.  When they find a stone carving of a Mayan king, they notice that it uncannily looks like Burke.  Then, as they continue their exploration, Raina uncovers a passageway in an ancient building that leads them to something they will never be able to talk about: it's a passageway to the past. The unbelievable happens --- the four of them travel back in time, finding themselves in the world of Al-mon and eighth-century Maya. And they don't know how to get back.<br />From there on, their lives are changed forever.  They meet Al-mon and are introduced to the lives of Mayan royalty.  Because they are now living in the past, they know that they cannot do anything that will change the course of history, and unfortunately Al-mon sees these newcomers as messengers of the gods, and Raina his future queen.  There seems to be no way out of this mess. They know it is important that all four of them return to the 20th century alive, so they do whatever it takes to keep from getting killed.<br />Of course the last thing that anyone wanted to happen does happen --- Raina and Al-mon fall in love. Raina knows her future is not with Al-mon and to preserve the path of history, she needs to find a way to tell him the truth about herself and her three friends, and return back home. <br />This reviewer had a difficult time deciding how to rate FEATHER ON THE WIND.  Although the general story in itself was riveting and kept this reader's attention, there was a problem with the quality of writing. It almost read like a stereotypical romance, a type of book that many non-romance readers would avoid. Love scenes were written in such a way that this reviewer felt should have been either rewritten, or not put in the book at all. Some of the scenes felt contrived.  On the other hand, detail to attention was a plus with this story.  The author obviously did her research and studied up on the ancient Mayan civilization.  The main problem was probably the characterization of the five main individuals in the story. This reviewer enjoyed the character of Al-mon, and although Burke was a very despicable type of person, he was well done as a main figure in this story. But overall, there was something lacking in this almost-wonderful book.  The story was enough to keep one's attention, the ending brought tears to this reviewer's eyes (an appropriate happy ending) but it could have been better.  This reviewer gives FEATHER ON THE WIND three stars.	2004-04-13

It can be safely said that there will be more Stef Ann Holm books read in this house.  Written with a charm that is very welcome in this genre of books, the novel centered on Jillene McDermott and her life with her two young girls after her husband has passed away.  She struggles to make ends meet, working at the coffeehouse that she and her husband tried to make a success, but upon his death, she discovers they are in so much debt she doesn't think they will survive financially.<br />While she and the girls make a go at it without dad, Vince Tremonti, a very famous crime-writer returns home to Blue Heron Beach, where Jill and her family also happen to reside.  He's lived for years in Los Angeles but decides he needs a change of pace, and comes home to think things over. He wants to make a career change, due to the criminals he ends up dealing with because of the type of books he writes. He's also been a bachelor for a long time, going from one relationship to another but never really sticking with anyone for very long, and is not looking for someone to start up anything new. However, when Vince and Jill meet, there is a mutual attraction that neither wants to admit.  Jill doesn't need to worry about dating now. She's got enough on her mind with her two daughters and a coffeehouse that is in the red. And Vince has a lot of unfinished business that needs to be taken care of, before he can move on with his life.  <br />The two build up their friendship slowly, but Jill thinks he's got something going with the local real estate agent, and is surprised to feel that she's jealous of them.  In the mean time, she needs to see to her girls' needs, and the scenes that feature the three of them are probably what really attracted this reviewer to the book.  The scenes are very charming, showing the two girls as very cute, especially when they decide to put an ad in the local paper for their mother so she can find a date.  The results are hilarious.  These, and other situations, are what add up to make this book a worthwhile read. <br />Other characters involve the local townspeople, including Vince's father who is described as a sweetheart of an older man, running the local barbershop, as any old fashioned town would have.  He has his own romance, wooing a widow who he has had a crush on for a very long time, but had held his tongue due to the fact that she was still married.  <br />This reviewer gives GIRLS NIGHT 4 stars.  It was a great introduction to the books of Stef Ann Holm, and hopefully her other novels are as good or better than this one was.	2004-04-13

Greeley<br />Andrew Greeley's latest novel, THE PRIESTLY SINS, details a fictional account of a sexual abuse case involving the Roman Catholic Church.  Greeley's appeal to his readers is probably the warm characters that he introduces in his books. In this particular novel, the reader meets Father Herman \\"Hugh\\" Hoffman, a very likable man who finds himself in the middle of this big controversy, as a witness to a rape of a young altar boy by a fellow priest.<br />The book is somewhat uneven in tone due to the interspersing of newspaper articles that are used to help follow the progress of this case.  However, THE PRIESTLY SINS is mostly a story about the life of Father Hoffman, and the events that lead up to his involvement in this abuse case. Told in a very light hearted manner,  Hoffman narrates the story of his childhood, his involvement with his childhood sweetheart Kathleen, and the path that led him to the priesthood.  <br />It's difficult to say which is more interesting, Hoffman's life story, or the actual sexual abuse case that he was a witness to.  Both plot lines were of big interest to this reader.  An additional plus to this book is the appearance of the famous Blackie Ryan,  Greeley's most popular character.  I have yet to read a Blackie Ryan novel, but I will definitely look these up, after having read THE PRIESTLY SINS.  I wouldn't mind too much to read another novel centering on Father Hoffman, as he is another very likeable character.  THE PRIESTLY SINS gets 4 stars from this reviewer.  A very enjoyable and readable book, it's a great introduction to the novels of Andrew Greeley.	2004-04-10

MILK IN MY COFFEE is about a successful African American man living in New York that becomes involved romantically with a woman that is white.  And it is not something he broadcasts to the world. It's not that he's ashamed of being involved with a woman that is not black, but he knows it is something that his friends and family will not approve of.<br />Told in a very lighthearted yet down-to-earth way, MILK IN MY COFFEE addresses the age-old issue of interracial relationships.  Jordan Greene is casually involved with one woman, who is black, but unintentionally gets involved with another woman that happens to be white, an artist named Kimberly Chavers.  They find they are soul mates, and every thing is perfect except for the issue of race.  It's a complicated scenario, more so because of the interracial stigma that is still pretty much inherent everywhere. They feel the sexual tension between them almost from the start, but keep their relationship purely platonic, at least for as long as they can.  But as they begin to get to really know each other, both of them wonder where this is heading and whether they have a future together.  Kimberly's friends seem to be a little more understanding, but Jordan's friends go ballistic when they think that HE thinks black isn't good enough for him.<br />The book gets complicated when Jordan's brother Reggie goes missing, and Kimberly has a secret past that comes back to haunt her. Not to be revealed here so as not to reveal any spoilers, this reader was very surprised with this turn of events.  The ending was worth getting to, and there will be more books by Eric Jerome Dickey read in this house.  Anyone wanting to be introduced to the books of Eric Jerome Dickey should start with this one.  Highly recommended!	2004-04-07

HEART OF THE BEAST by Joyce Weatherford<br />HEART OF THE BEAST is the debut novel by Joyce Weatherford, which tells the tale of a family that has farmed and ranched for many generations in eastern Oregon.  Their history ties them to the Nez Perce Indians, who now claim that the land, known as Heart of the Beast, belongs to them, and they plan on fighting for it until they get their land back. <br />Iris Steele, 28 years old, is the youngest survivor of this ill-fated family.  She returns home to see to her dying mother, the beautiful Elise, and to help settle the estate.  Iris's father Ike and older brother Jake have long ago passed on, and she is the only one remaining that will inherit the land that her parents farmed.  Upon the death, Iris locates her crazy aunt, Hanna, Elise's sister, and she arrives promptly straight from the psychiatric hospital with her \\"heads\\", sculptures of several generations of Steeles and Winters.  Hanna is obsessed with these heads, and now she needs to complete the very last one, that of Iris.  Hanna cannot rest until this is done.<br />Iris is informed about a law suit against her family, in which the Nez Perce Indians claim the land she's inherited, The Heart of the Beast, is theirs, and she now braces to deal with yet another problem. And as she readies herself for this trial, she remembers her past, her life growing up in Oregon, and the tumultuous story that was her family.<br />This novel can only be described as tragic.  Iris's family history is filled with men and women that farmed for a living, raising horses and cattle and growing crops, from the first generation that traveled the Lewis and Clarke trail as they made their way from the East Coast to Oregon, down to her own parents. But it was not out of love that they lived on the land.  It was with a hatred and a violence that is graphically described quite succinctly and with much detail by Weatherford.  Iris's father was a man filled with hate, showing only disdain for hischildren, anger towards his wife, and ruled the land and their home with a military arm.  But as Iris relives her family's history, it is obvious why her father Ike Steele was as cruel and sadistic as she knew him to be.  A family history of larger than life men and women fill the family tree, and it is this history that Iris remembers in detail, as well as her own childhood and memories of what living on the land meant to her.  <br />HEART OF THE BEAST will be one of my favorite books read in 2004.  It's told on an epic scale, taken out of American history books, yet most of it takes place in contemporary times, which is hard to believe as the images one gets from reading this book reminds one of days of yesteryear, when the West was still being tamed.  It is mention of songs by Prince and Ever Clear that brings the reader back to the present. However, the story of the Indians and the white men that helped build this part of the country makes one think HEART OF THE BEAST is a story that takes place in the past.  This reviewer feels that anyone that loves to read a good novel is going to enjoy HEART OF THE BEAST.  Highly recommended!	2004-04-03

The winner of the Books In Canada \\"First Novel\\" Award and the winner of the Canadian Authors' \\"Association Book Of The Year Award\\", it is told through the eyes of a Japanese Canadian girl, only five years old at the start of WW II.  OBASAN is told in flashbacks as Naomi Nakane looks back as an adult, finding out what really happened to her family and their loved ones during this horrible time in history.<br />Naomi and her brother Stephen were raised for the most part by their uncle and aunt, because their parents were not able to care for them during and after the years following WWII.  Naomi's mother leaves for a visit to Japan shortly before Japan enters WWII with the United States, and is never seen or heard from by Naomi or her brother again. The young Naomi recalls letters going unanswered, never knowing whether her mother has ever received these notes or is too busy to even care about her children left in Canada. Their father remains in Canada with them, but becomes ill and is taken away during the war, spending most of his time in hospitals.  Their contact with him is intermittent. Uncle Isamu and \\"Obasan\\" are asked to take care of the two children in the event anything happens to the Nakanes, and they raise them, not having any children of their own.  They become a family unit, and as one reads the book, it is obvious that young Naomi finds nothing too unusual in this setup, as hardships keep them focused on one thing only: survival.  <br />The book starts with Naomi hearing news that her Uncle has passed on, and she is forced to return to the home of Obasan, which brings back a rush of memories that she had preferred to keep suppressed.  Told in flashbacks, letters, and poetry, Naomi's story is slowly told. Because she was so young, Naomi herself was not fully aware ofwhat was happening during WWII.  All she knew was that their family had to move several times, were restricted to where they could show their faces, and were ostracized and made to suffer because they were Japanese.  It didn't matter that she and her brother were born in Canada.  Being Japanese had stripped them of all rights that belonged to them as Canadian citizens.<br />OBASAN is based on the author's own experiences in Canada during WWII, and reading OBASAN I could feel a lot of her anguish coming through the pages. I was very interested in reading about the Japanese Canadians plight during WWII.  I myself am Japanese American whose own father and family were sent to the camps in California.  I was astonished to read that a similar situation had occurred in Canada, and it was one factor that kept me interested in the book.  On the other hand, I did not quite like the way this story was told, and had a hard time getting through the entire book. It was not an easy read. What motivated me to finish the book was because I wanted to find out what happened to Naomi and her family, and what happened to her mother.  The mystery to this is not revealed until the very end, and it was a very tragic ending to an altogether tragic book.  There is no happy ending, but a lot of unanswered questions, including why such an event could have ever happened in a modern democratic society.  Although I couldn't say this was a \\"Must-read\\", it is definitely a chapter in history that everyone should be aware of, regardless of race or nationality.  This reader gives OBASAN 3.5 stars.	2004-03-28

Comparable to Dora Levy Mossanen's HAREM, THE FOURTH QUEEN takes a young woman from a culture outside that of Middle Eastern heritage, and places her into a foreign world full of strange foods, colors, music, and values. But, while HAREM was filled with magical deeds and other wonderful things akin to fairy tales, THE FOURTH QUEEN is rooted in reality. Both books share a wealth of knowledge of this time and place in history, a world vastly different from that descended from the culture of Western Europe.<br />It is the mid-1700's, and young Helen Gloag is on a ship headed towards the New World. She is looking for a new life away from Scotland and a life of poverty that she wanted desperately to escape. As the ship is headed toward its destination, it is attacked by pirates and she, along with many of the women, are taken to Morocco to be sold. <br />Helen's life takes on a strange turn.  She is now ensconced in the life of the harem, one of thousands of women that are vying for the attention of the Emperor of Morocco. Only four lucky women are chosen as queens, and while at first Helen finds her new life horrid and unbearable, she soon learns the ways of this culture, and aspires to be one of the lucky four.  She gains weight to be more of a prize catch, as large women are considered beautiful, while thin women are considered undesirable.  She learns how to apply makeup in a much different way than is done in her native land of Scotland. No more corsets. The larger the stomach and buttocks, the more appealing she will be to the opposite sex. Helen is slowly transformed into a woman that belongs in Morocco, no longer recognizable as that young Scottish girl, even taking on a new name Aziza.<br />Along her journey to this highest of positions, she befriends one of the queens, Batoom, known as the Black Queen, who takes Helen under her wing. Helen also meets the head Eunuch, Fijil, a Scottish dwarf who was captured many years ago and is now one of the most notable men working under the Emperor.  Fijil finds himself in love with the lovely Helen, but he knows that his fate will never allow him to capture the love of this Scottish lass.  He hides his feelings for her as best he can, becoming one of the best friends Helen could possibly have in this new world of hers. Helen's only goal at this time is to become a queen, and she cannot see past the jewels and the wealth that would go with that title.<br />A wonderful tale of love, greed, and power, THE FOURTH QUEEN was a book that at first did not catch this reviewer's interest. But, as one continues with each chapter, it is easy to succumb to the charms of this story.  Debbie Taylor did an excellent job with highly descriptive particulars on what life in a harem was like.  She interspersed her story with the erotic passions that came with living in a harem. She wove highly illustrative details of the foods that were enjoyed by Helen, so that the reader could imagine tasting and eating them. One could feel the heat that bore down on Helen day in and day out, and could imagine the life that she led with the emperor, with whom she was consumed with a desire so strong that she could see nothing else.  <br />The fascinating aspect of this book is that THE FOURTH QUEEN was based on a person straight from history. Helen Gloag did exist, as did Fijil and the Emperor. History shows that there were indeed several Empresses of Morocco with red hair. Taylor took the liberties to write a story with these characters, and although they may not have co-existed in the same time period, Taylor did a good job making this story work.  It has truly ignited in this reviewer an already burgeoning interest in the world of the ancient Ottoman Empire. This book is highly recommended to lovers of historical fiction everywhere.	2004-03-26

(Harlequin Superromance No. 1174)	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Another wonderful romance by Inglath Cooper	Courtesy of WWW.LOVEROMANCES.COM<br />A WOMAN LIKE ANNIE<br />Inglath Cooper uses a unique story line in her romance, A WOMAN LIKE ANNIE, a story about a recently divorced woman trying to make a new start with her young son in the small town where her famous ex-husband grew up.  In this story, Annie McCabe has a rather unique job, that of Mayor of the small farming town of Macon's Point. She's taken over the job from her long-gone ex, JD McCabe, famous baseball star and the previous mayor.  Annie hopes to do a better job than JD, as well as make a better life for herself and her son Tommy, who is hurting from the divorce and missing his negligent father who had run off with a much younger woman to live in Southern California.  Annie could care less if she ever saw JD again, but for Tommy's sake, she wishes he would make more appearances. Even a telephone call now and then would make Tommy happy.<br />Annie is determined to do the best job she can to show the town that she cares. Currently, her biggest problem is dealing with Corbin Manufacturing, the town's largest employer.  Its owner, Jack Corbin is set on shutting down the plant due to financial reasons.  Annie's mission is to stop the closing of the plant, which would set off a wild chain reaction, as quite a few people in town could be left without a job, forcing them to move away to find employment elsewhere.  It is in the best interest of the town to keep the plant open.<br />Jack Corbin's mindset is different, however. He sees that the P&amp;L statements are showing major losses in the past few years, and he finds it very disturbing. This was his father's company, but now that his father and step mother have both passed away, it is up to Jack to see that the company is making money.  From the looks of things, Jack does not see any reason to keep the company going, although he knows how this could affect this small town, the town where he grew up.<br />Annie meets Jack for the first time at a local restaurant, and is shocked to find she is very attracted to Jack. She's even more astonished to find they seem to get along, at least most of the time. Annie brings Tommy with her to dinner, since she can't get a babysitter in time, and she couldn't afford to cancel this important meeting. Tommy could have been a detriment, but to Annie's surprise, Tommy and Jack end up getting along famously.  Annie sees hope for the town, but by the end of the evening she fails to get Jack to change his mind.  He is still adamant about the plant closing.  She leaves the restaurant feeling she's let everyone down, and is feeling awful that she is doing such a bad job as Mayor.<br />Annie does all she can to convince Jack to listen to her.  They decide to work together to figure out why the company has been losing so much money. This leads them to various adventures around town, sometimes taking on a comedic effect, other times taking on a rather heart-stopping effect, as they sneak around storage buildings and spy on various employees of Corbin Manufacturing. What Annie and Jack find out blows them both away.  <br />As they work together, the two form a friendship and a mutual respect, and of course we all know what follows after that! Complications set in when JD finds out about Jack through the newspapers, and decides to pay a visit to his ex-wife, who he still feels possessive about and does not like the idea of any man encroaching on what he thinks is his territory.  <br />A WOMAN LIKE ANNIE was another book by Inglath Cooper this reviewer enjoyed.  Cooper obviously has a love for small towns, and it shows in her books.  She also has a knack for creating likeable characters, which is important in a romance.  Her plot lines also tend to be a little more unusual than the norm.  The one fault may be too much emphasis on secondary characters, whose stories are almost as important as those pertaining to the main characters. But over all, this reviewer gives four stars to A WOMAN LIKE ANNIE, and is looking forward to reading more by Inglath Cooper.	2004-03-24

On his departure at the airport, he whispers to her that he will not be back, and to take care of their mother. This memory haunts her when they get word six months later of his death while trying to help out a fellow soldier who was shot down.  Thirty years later, when Teresa's mother Alicia informs everyone she has heard Jesse call to her, Teresa is more than just upset, and wonders if her mother is hallucinating or if her mother truly has these powers where she can hear from the dead.  <br />Then, in a surprising turn of events, they are informed that because of an error made by the government all those years ago, Alicia has $90,000 coming to her because of Jesse's death.  This seals the deal - Alicia informs the family they are going to DC to touch Jesse's' name on the wall.  It doesn't matter that Teresa is being sued by her husband's girlfriend for assault, or that Teresa is waiting to hear about her soon-to-be divorce from Ray.  Alicia says it will all take care of itself, and that they are all to go on this journey together.  Alicia's health is in jeopardy, but she is determined to do this, as the last thing she may do on this earth.<br />Duarte tells the story with flashbacks, the point of view coming mostly from Teresa, as she remembers her childhood with Jesse and her other siblings Priscilla and Paul, happy moments as well as sad moments that continue to bother her into the present.  She remembers her father, who was unfaithful to her mother Alicia, a man that Teresa had no respect for.  She also remembers the stories she heard from an old Aztec medicine man, Don Florencio, who talked about the ancient Aztecs, their heritage, about dead spirits and other things that Teresa wants to believe are true. <br />While the first half of the book is filled with mostly flashbacks and helps set up the story, the second half details the journey that the Ramirez family and friends take, as they drive in a caravan of vehicles to their destination in Washington.  They become the favorite of the media, thanks to the help of nephew Michael and his computer, even garnering the attention of President Clinton.  Relationships are mended and created as the trip ensues, while more and more people join the caravan, and when they finally reach their final destination, it is a moment of sadness and remembrance as they embrace those that have left them.  <br />This reviewer enjoyed LET THEIR SPIRITS DANCE.  The story of the Vietnam War and how it affected one family, as well as one group of people, the Hispanics, was eye opening.  The ending was expected, yet it also was climatic in that one had waited so long for this journey to end.  It was not truly a happy ending, but what made it happy was their realization that our loved ones are never really far from us, only separated by death.  Teresa's story involved one's questioning of faith and religious beliefs, and reconciling one's past with the present.  Her problems are resolved in a manner that surprised this reviewer, but it was a wonderful ending to her story as well as Alicia's journey in search of her son.  Some readers may find the politics in this book to be opposite of what they feel, as Duarte does not hold back on her views of the war, told through the eyes of the characters in this story.  Other than that, four stars for LET THEIR SPIRIT DANCE.	2004-03-22

It is a story of a family that is about to be torn apart by infidelity, but brought back together through illness.<br />Mattie Hart is a successful art dealer with the so-called perfect family: she has a successful husband, a darling teenage daughter, and a beautiful home.  But this family's foundations are not made of strong stuff.  Mattie and Jake married for one reason only: Mattie was pregnant.  And although they had fun times together and enjoyed each other's company, they would never have married if it were not for their soon-to-be born daughter, Kim.  <br />The book opens with Mattie being angry once again because she's found evidence that Jake is having yet another affair.  She is tired of being in a loveless marriage. Her husband Jake eventually moves out, but Mattie's troubles are not over.  She finds that she is having some physical problems, namely walking and using her hands.  It at first seems to be nothing, but her best friend convinces Mattie to be checked out at the hospital.  What Mattie finds out is devastating and if her world wasn't already falling apart because of Jake, this news changes everything.<br />For the most part, I enjoyed reading THE FIRST TIME.  There were a few issues I had with the book, mainly finding that I could not feel much sympathy for the main character Mattie.  She rubbed me the wrong way, as did her daughter Kim.  The story and the writing I was able to enjoy, and if it weren't for that, I would not have finished reading the book.  Although I didn't buy into how these characters behaved in some situations in the story, I found Joy Fielding's writing made it more believable for me.  I know, however, that if this were a real life story, the story of Mattie and Jake would have been a totally different book with a different ending.  I'm giving THE FIRST TIME 3.5 stars.	2004-03-14

THE SECOND DEATH OF UNICA AVEYANO by Ernesto Mestre-Reed<br />The novel THE SECOND DEATH OF UNICA AVEYANO, written by the highly acclaimed author Ernesto Mestre-Reed, is being compared to the works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Isabelle Allende, and rightly so.  In this novel, Mestre-Reed takes the reader into the world of Unica Aveyano, a Cuban immigrant now living with her family in the United States. She is also dying from cancer. Using techniques that are common in novels by Marquez and Allende, Mestre-Reed writes a vividly surreal-like story that moves back and forth between Cuba and the United States, told in dreamlike flashbacks and always returning back to the present.  This is the story of Unica and her epic life story, which starts in Cuba before Castro comes to power, and will end in America.<br />The story revolves around Unica's life, but is interspersed with the news headline of Elian Gonzales, the young Cuban boy that was found adrift at sea and rescued, finally taken to Miami to be with his American relatives.  His story parallels that of Unica's, for she is also a Cuban immigrant who left one member behind in the homeland, her son Candido. The book is a complex set of disjointed flashbacks, telling the story of three generations.  Each character in this book is unique, each one having a more quirky history than the next.  Together, they tell the story of Unica's life.<br />It takes a while for the reader to be able to put the pieces together to understand the complete story of Unica.  But it is well worth the effort.  It is a short novel, less than 300 pages, but Mestre-Reed is able to tell an entire life-story within these pages. This is not an easy read.  But, this reviewer found it time worth spent, and highly recommends THE SECOND DEATH OF UNICA AVEYANO.	2004-03-09

Annie Proulx<br />The winner of the 1994 Pulitzer for Fiction, THE SHIPPING NEWS is a story that stands out and will be remembered in this reviewer's mind as something that cannot be imitated or copied.  Annie Proulx created a set of unique and quirky characters and fit them into the setting that is the cold north of Newfoundland, centering on the sorry life of one man named Quoyle.  His life changes when he moves himself and his two young daughters from Brooklyn to the land that was home to his ancestors.  His memories of his own immediate family are not happy ones. But family ties are strong.  <br />Life for Quoyle was never good.  He never heard a loving word from his parents or brother.  As an adult, life was not great either. He goes from job to job, doesn't have many friends, and lives the life of an outcast.  One day he meets a man named Partridge at the local Laundromat, and the two become fast friends, despite their differences in background. When Quoyle is unemployed once again, Partridge helps him get a job at a local newspaper where he also happens to work, and soon Quoyle is working semi-regularly for this newspaper, but isn't doing that much better. He's not \\"getting it\\" and is not what one calls a great asset to the company.  He gets fired and rehired seasonally, and then Partridge and wife Mercalia announce they are moving to California.  Quoyle feels his life is about to end, his only friends leaving to move across the country.<br />Then, Quoyle meets Petal in a bar. Their relationship starts off on the right foot, but soon they are married and things fall apart fast. He now has a wife that cheats on him openly, a wife he loves with a passion but Petal looks down upon him with disdain. The more he loves her, the more she stays away, flaunting her lovers in his face.  And now with two children, Quoyle rarely sees Petal at all.  A few years of unhappy living, and he receives word from his father that both parents are on their last legs.  With the death of both mother and father, and a brother that doesn't seem to care, it is the last straw when Quoyle finds out that his wife has taken off with the kids.  Petal's car is in an accident, the children are missing, and his wife is dead. Quoyle is beside himself, and the last thing he wanted to hear was that the children had been sold to some man. What else could go wrong in his life?<br />Amazingly enough, this all happens within the first 26 pages of the book.  Quoyle soon finds his two daughters, and is now on his way to Newfoundland with them and his father's sister Agnis and her dog Warren.  The life they lead in his family homeland is quite a difference from what they experienced in New York. It's rougher, tougher, but yet Quoyle adapts.  With the help of Partridge, Quoyle is hired by the local paper THE GAMMY BIRD and as the reader discovers, Quoyle transforms from a pathetic loser to someone that has merit and credibility. And he also finds love. <br />THE SHIPPING NEWS was a somewhat funny look at a man who needed just a little push (or a big boost) in the right direction to get his life on track.  Written in a style that may put off some readers, this novel was enjoyable and the story always kept this reader wanting to read more.  It's a story of love, life, and the need to be loved back, all told through the story of Quoyle.  The interesting characters throughout the book enhance his story, and one comes to love each one.  This reviewer highly recommends THE SHIPPING NEWS but with a word of caution: although it can be a fast read, one needs to adjust to the style of writing that Proulx uses to tell this tale.	2004-03-07

LAST TO DIE by James Grippando<br />A wealthy woman leaves her estate to six people she had reasons to hate, in LAST TO DIE, a legal thriller by author James Grippando.  <br />Flashbacks tell the tale of Sally Fenning, a woman who was attacked and whose daughter was viciously murdered by possibly someone they both knew.  Sally's story does not end there, as she rises above the tragedy that was her life, to become a very wealthy woman, worth millions. When Sally is murdered on a public street, a murder that could have been planned by Sally herself, the rumors start flying.  Sally had supposedly hired someone to kill her, but the question now was, \\" Who really killed Sally Fenning?\\"<br />Enter Jack Swyteck, criminal defense lawyer and all around good guy.  His best friend is Theo Knight, a man that was once his client and was accused falsely of murder when he was a young man.  His near-death experience on death row bonded Theo and Jack for life, and Jack would do anything for Theo.  When Theo asks Jack to represent his brother Tatum when Tatum is named one of the six heirs to Sally Fenning's estate, a man that used to be a contract killer but has turned over a new leaf, Jack hesitates but agrees. What are friends for?  When Jack learns that Tatum had been hired by Sally to kill her, but turned the job down, it is up to Jack to find out who really did kill Sally Fenning.<br />At the reading of the will, all but one of the six heirs shows up.  What the other five heirs find out is that they were probably on Sally's most-hated list of people in this world, and her stipulation of this will dictates that only one will inherit it all.  The one that is left alive wins.  And with that announcement, the fun begins.  One by one, each of the six heirs are murdered. As the surviving members realize what is happening to their competition, Jack and Theo race to find out who is behind these murders.  Is it Theo? Is it Tatum?  Or is it someone else?  No one is safe until the murdereris caught.<br />This reader found LAST TO DIE an enjoyable, fast-paced book, and will return to read more by James Grippando.  Finding out who was the murderer was not obvious and there were plenty of twists and turns to keep this reader interested. The side trip to Africa felt a little out of place, although the entire section was valid to introduce a secondary character important to the case.  Otherwise, LAST TO DIE is recommended reading for those who enjoy a good who-dunnit!	2004-03-02

It's a mild flirtation, but it is obvious Alexander is smitten by this innocent of a girl who is not yet a woman, but no longer a child.  Tatania exudes innocence and purity, and this is what attracts Alexander.  She is different from the women he has pursued, different from the women that have chased after him.  <br />Tatiana has never been in love, but she finds that she is attracted to this soldier of the Soviet army, and to her dismay, she finds out later that he is the man that her older sister Dasha has been babbling about for days.  So as not to hurt her sister whom she loves dearly, Tatania and Alexander agree to keep their love from Dasha, while Dasha thinks her days as a single woman are numbered. <br />Meanwhile, the country is seized by war and Tatania and her family, who are all squeezed into a 2-room apartment, try to survive.  There is a food shortage, a fuel shortage, and people are barely keeping alive.  With the Metanova's, it is seven people living day in and day out in this tiny place, with no privacy whatsoever and the threat of death everywhere. Yet, Tatiana manages to keep her feelings about Alexander to herself, while her sister prattles on and on about a man she thinks she loves and loves her in return.  <br />The book is told in epic fashion, with the tragic story lines that are befitting to a tale of love and war.  A whopping 890 pages in the mass market edition, THE BRONZE HORSEMAN takes the reader to the cold harsh winter in war-ravaged Leningrad and to the warmer climates in the countryside of Lazarevo. The many twists and turns of this book did keep this reader on edge. However, the writing was somewhat lacking, and at times irritating.  The book could definitely have been shorter. The book is a fast read despite the length, but a warning to those who may find the writing tedious and sometimes redundant. In the long run, the story content helped save this novel, and this reader gives THE BRONZE HORSEMAN three and a half stars.	2004-02-27

Taking place in a wilderness area on an island in Quebec, the main character brings with her 3 friends (a boyfriend and another couple) and the four of them live on her family's old property, now rundown and in need of a lot of love and care.  While the four spend their time \\"roughing it\\", she goes about plotting on how to figure out where her father is, or whether he is still alive.  <br />This was a very difficult book for me to read. I'm going to say this straight out, that SURFACING by Margaret Atwood was a disappointment for me.  Although I'm not going to give it a rating lower than 3 stars, coming from an author that I consider my favorite, it was difficult to read such a book that I found was not her best work.  Some may disagree with me, but I found this book somewhat lacking, and that because this was one of her earlier novels, I felt that Atwood was still figuring out her style of writing.  The attention to detail to the Canadian wilderness was wonderful, however, and I could imagine myself there with these four adults, scrounging for food and fishing for dinner.  <br />I'm having a hard time describing how I feel about this book, as I had so much hoped for something better from Atwood.  I don't think any fan should dismiss this book.  It is a must read, if one would like an overview of Atwood's entire literary collection.  However, I would recommend that any new reader not read this book first, as it might disappoint and prevent one in picking up another Atwood book.  I still find that THE BLIND ASSASSIN is by far her best novel so far, followed closely by THE HANDMAID'S TALE.	2004-02-22

In this story, a young woman is discouraged by the dating scene, after being dumped by a boyfriend for not having sex with him throughout their entire relationship. She then meets the most gorgeous man ever, Cal Morrissey, soon after that breakup.  Their relationship grows through a series of bets, which puts Cal deeper and deeper into trouble with Minerva Dobbs, the young woman in question. <br />Cal and Min meet in the worst possible way - through a bet.  But as they get to know each other as friends, the two fall in love, but refuse to admit it to each other.  As their friends watch with amusement the charade that Cal and Min go through, pretending they are only friends and that they cannot stand each other, Cal and Min slowly realize that they can't live without each other.  But as their ex's try their best to keep the two apart, Cal and Min's best friends try to decide whether the two belong to each other.  <br />The book is told in the typical style that \\"chick lit\\" is famous for, with a humorous tone and a lot of comic relief. While I found this book to have gone on a little too long, I still enjoyed it and do recommend it to others who delight in reading books in this genre.  It's a fast read and although not the perfect book, I think readers will enjoy getting to know Minerva Dobbs and maybe even relating to her, as Min tries to find that perfect fairy tale romance and happy ending that all of us hope to find in our own lives.	2004-02-18

BEL CANTO by Ann Patchett<br />One of the more unusual books I've read lately, BEL CANTO by Ann Patchett takes place in an unnamed South American country during a hostage situation.  Its tale is one that will have the reader shocked, and surprised.  It is definitely not what I had expected, but I liked it a lot better than I had thought I would.<br />The premise of the story is a highly important businessman from Japan, whose business this South American country needs desperately, is flying out from Japan to celebrate his birthday.  The enticement to bring him here is a very famous opera singer that is the obsession of this Japanese man, Mr. Hosokawa.  The opera diva is named Roxanne Coss, and together they become the focal point of this book.<br />During the middle of the birthday party, where the guests are dressed in black ties and fancy dresses, terrorists appear out of nowhere to take the President hostage. What the terrorists failed to verify is that the President was nowhere to be found. Instead, he was at home watching his favorite soap opera.  (The terrorists later on acquiesce that this was highly understandable, as the soap opera was going through some interesting story line that had the entire country riveted. Of COURSE the President would rather be at home instead of this boring party! Who could blame him?)<br />Instead, the terrorists find the Vice-President at their disposal, but they want the President.  And they refuse to release anyone until the President is presented to them.  But now they have this hostage crisis on their hands and too many hostages to deal with.  It is a nightmare for these terrorists and it's the start of one blunder after another that leads the hostages into a four-month living arrangement along with the terrorists at the house of the Vice-President, whose house was used for this elaborate party.<br />BEL CANTO was a finalist for the NATIONAL BOOK CRITICS CIRCLE AWARD as well as the winner of the Pen/Faulkner Award, and was deservedly so.  Patchett writes a story that does not follow the news stories of our day. It is almost unbelievable of what happens to these hostages, the lives they lead for the four months they are held prisoner. Yet I found the ending shocking and true to life.  She pulls the reader in, making us believe in one ending, when it's another that happens.  I highly recommend BEL CANTO.  It will most likely appear on my top 30 list of books read in 2004.	2004-02-16

Translated from the Japanese by Mark Ealey, it is a tale of suffering and hard work, told from the viewpoint of a young boy as he grows from child into man.<br />Young Isaku is 9-year-old boy at the start of this story.  But for him, childhood is short-lived, and even as a young boy of five, he was expected to pull his weight and help support his family.  The village where he lives is isolated from the rest of the island, and to make ends meet, they resort to fishing and trading, depending on the season. The other option is selling oneself into servitude or bondage, in exchange for goods.  Isaku's father has sold himself, and at the start of this novel he is already living in another village working for his master.  <br />In the meantime, Isaku is the man of the house, and it is up to him to catch their food and to keep his mother and siblings from starvation.  Rice is hard to come by, and most of their meals are vegetables or grains traded for salt with the neighboring village.  He barely knows how to fish, so it is not often that they have anything substantial to eat. <br />Isaku eventually learns about the \\"ofune-sama\\", which is Japanese for \\"ship god\\" or \\"ship master\\", and it is this ofune-sama that helps the village thrive.  Every few years, a ship or two will ground itself upon the rocks that border their shores and the villagers will pillage and kill any survivors on that ship to take what they can to feed their families.  The villagers see no harm in this.  It is what they have done for many generations and it is how they live.  They know no other way, and Isaku follows his family in obeying their customs.<br />One year, a ship arrives that they think is \\"ofune-sama\\", but bringsbad fortune to the people of this tiny village. What happens to them is beyond description.  Is it karma that brings this ill luck to them?  Yoshimura's tale of life in this impoverished town does not point fingers, but serves as a parable.  <br />I found this book one of the most unique stories I have read in my entire life.  Not only did it describe a way of life that was totally foreign to me, but also it was done so to the minutest detail.  The first half of the book was dedicated in describing this lifestyle, so by the second half the reader has become quite familiar with the routines that are performed month by month that Isaku and his family had to endure to keep alive.  It is a trip into another world and another time, with a possible lesson to be learned at the end.  I recommend this book for those who are serious readers, and are willing to read \\"outside the box\\".	2004-02-10

BLUE SHOE by Anne Lamott<br />BLUE SHOE by Anne Lamott is a rambling story of a woman's search of her own identity and answers to questions about her childhood.  It was my introduction to the writings of Anne Lamott, which came across to me as somewhat poetic and ethereal yet at the same time grounded in a dark reality.<br />Mattie Ryder is not having a good life.  She's having a hard time letting go of her ex-husband Nicky, who she is constantly finding herself in bed with, despite the fact that he's living with another woman.  She suffers consantly from depression, is barely making ends meet, and her relationship with her mother is not what she would have wanted.  Her best friend is her brother Al, until one day she meets a man named Daniel at her front door step, who has come to help her exterminate the many rodents living in the walls of her house.  Her life was \\"running on empty\\" until she meets Daniel, and together they form a bond as best friends and soul mates.  It doesn't help that he is yet another man in a relationship, yet she finds herself falling in love with him.<br />In the meantime, Mattie's two children are adjusting to life without Daddy, and the signs of their maladjustment are everywhere.  Harry is rather headstrong and demanding, and poor little Ella has already started to chew on her wrists to the point of bleeding.  She is not even five years old.  Mattie sees in her children many similarities to her own childhood, when she and her brother Al were neglected by their parents, both of whom were too busy with their own dysfunctional lives to see to the needs of their children.  Al and Mattie go on a journey of discovery, as they slowly uncover the truth behind their parents and what really happened all those years ago.  This truth tears them apart, and threatens to break away the little bit of sanity that is holding Mattie together.<br />Mattie and Al are also dealing with an aging mother who was once a feisty woman involved in nearly everythingpolitical and socially correct, helping those that were less fortunate than they were.  Isa is starting to lose her memory, and her behavior patterns are driving Mattie up the wall.  When in the past they weren't the best of friends, things were certainly not getting any better.  The idea of putting Isa into a home is a thought that scares all of them, knowing how independent Isa had always been, yet Mattie and Al can no longer expect their mother to live alone without the fear of something bad happening to her.  When they hear reports of their mother wandering the streets in her nightgown, they know something is terribly wrong.  Isa, on the other hand, thinks they are out to get her and has no sense that she is ill at all.  Each time they are at the doctor's office,  Isa's mind is lucid and she seems to turn around miraculously.  It's an enigma that has Mattie stumped.<br />While I loved the characters that Anne Lamott created in BLUE SHOE, I found something lacking.  By the end of the book, there was no resolution to any of the problems encountered by all of them.  Things were left hanging, as if there should have been a next chapter but it was missing.  There was somewhat of a happy ending to an extent, if that could be said, but even that was lacking. I also felt that her descriptions of weather patterns could have been somewhat more effective, but for some reason I felt they were overly done.  I know she was trying to use them to help show Mattie's moods, but they felt disjointed to me, as if they were not necessarily part of the story. Having said all that, I think the book was worth reading because of the fully developed characters and the story line.  It was a complex story of a dysfunctional family, filled with dysfunctional friends and situations.  I think if she had added a different ending, I would have been satisfied. However, at this point I would give it a 3.5/5  rating.  It was good enough for me to prompt me to try another book written by Anne Lamott.  From reading other reviews, this was not considered her best book, and I believe it. I can see the potential in her writing and I would gladly read another.	2004-02-07

HIGH FIVE by Janet Evanovich<br />The fifth installment of the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich, HIGH FIVE brings back Stephanie as the inept bounty hunter trying to earn a decent living.  The large cast of characters is back: Lula the ex-prostitute, crazy Grandma Mazur, the sexy mysterious Ranger, and of course the some-time boyfriend Joe Morelli. And don't forget Rex the hamster!  He's back too.<br />In this novel, Uncle Fred has disappeared and it's up to Stephanie to track him down.  Was he murdered, or did he run off with one of his many girlfriends?  Auntie Mabel doesn't seem to be in the least upset about his disappearance. Instead, she's busy making plans for cruises, new furniture, and other fun things she's not been able to do since Fred was always the cheapskate when it came to their money.   He'd fight over a two-dollar discrepancy, even if it meant his money or his life. Stephanie is determined to find out if this was the fate that had befallen her uncle. <br />In the meantime, she has a run in with a \\"little person\\", Randy Briggs, who she tries to take into custody for the bond money.  Unfortunately, Briggs doesn't cooperate, and it's one funny incident after another as she does her best to try to get a hold of the little guy.  <br />And Benito Ramirez is back, the dangerous rapist who has threatened to come after Stephanie in previous installments.  This time, it looks like he's going to get pretty close.  And, don't forget her many adventures with her vehicles.  Does she yet again lose her car to a bomb? Or maybe someone steals it?  <br />As always, I was very happy to have read another book in the Stephanie Plum series.  These books are so much fun.  They are light-hearted comedies with a dark twist, but they always end up with a happy ending.  However, this ending left me wanting more. What REALLY did happen at the end?  In whose bed did Stephanie end up?  I will have to read the sixth book to find out!	2004-02-04

She is back only to seek the help from a specialist who may help her regain the full use of her legs.<BR> <BR>Wendy Monroe was on her way to being an Olympic hopeful, representing the USA on the ski team. Unfortunately, bad luck hit when she had a major ski accident right before the Olympic games, and her dreams were over.  Many years later, Wendy returns home to try to finagle a meeting with a specialist who had a new way of operating on those like her who have lost the use of their legs. She knows however that he is not taking on new patients, and the surgery itself is risky.  Some patients end up losing the total use of their legs.  Wendy CAN walk, but she wants to ski like a champion again, feeling that anything less means she is not complete. She is ashamed of her disability, and is tired of feeling that people look at her with pity.  She wants to return to the independent young girl she used to be, refusing to accept that she is now handicapped.<br />When Wendy left home to enter the Olympics, she had left behind the love of her life, Seth Castleman. Wendy and Seth had met when they were teenagers, fell in love, but Wendy was already on her way to entering the Olympics.  Seth remained at home when she went to Europe for the Games.  But, after her accident, she rebuked Seth's love and turned him away when he flew across the Atlantic to be by her side.  It is now ten years later, and Seth still carries a torch for his long lost love, but both he and Wendy have moved on.  <br />DANCING IN THE DARK is yet another novel in the COOPER'S CORNER series and I enjoyed this one as well.  Marton focuses on the personalities of the two lovers, and does a good job in writing a believable story. For those who love a good romance with a few psychological twists, I recommend this book.	2004-02-01

THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME by Mark Haddon<br />A wonderfully unique book, THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME by Mark Haddon is one of those rare books that comes around once in a blue-moon and changes your perception of how a novel should be written.  Haddon changes some of the rules and follows the heart of the narrator and main character, young Christopher John Francis Boone, as he tries to solve the mystery of a dog that was found dead in his neighbor's yard.<br />Christopher is a teenager, but not your average every day boy.  He is an autistic savant. He lacks the skills to blend in socially with the rest of the world, has no sense of humor, and can barely find his way around town despite the fact that he can read.  Yet, he is bright and shows a great compulsion for learning, especially in the fields of math and the sciences. In short, he's a genius. He can run quadratic equations in his head, using random variables to find solutions to various problems. He can talk at length about the cosmos, explaining the theory of relativity as if it was child's play.<br />When Chris discovers the next door neighbor's dog \\"murdered\\", he tries his best to search for the truth.  The police and Mrs. Shears accuse him of doing the dirty deed, but as Christopher always explains, he cannot tell a lie and tells the policeman that he did not kill the dog.  After an altercation that ensues due to the policeman touching him, Chris is consequently taken to the local jail, where his worried father comes to pick him up and take him home.<br />Thus begins the rather unusual telling of the story of the murder of a dog, and Christopher's search to discover the killer.  This is Christopher's book, and it is told in his own unique way.  Because of his love of prime numbers, the chapters are numbered with only prime numbers (1,3,5,7,11, and so on).  He intersperses the story with chapters on number games, puzzles, and other interesting facts that float inChristopher's head when he needs to get away from the rest of the world, which more often than not confuses him.  Yet, despite his fear of strangers and his inability to function in society, he ventures out and plays detective, asking neighbors if they had seen anything strange the night before the murder of this dog. <br />I highly recommend THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME.  As I had no expectations when I started this book, it was a lovely surprise to find this unusual style of writing in the form of fiction.  At times reading like a math dissertation, other times reading like a journal, it was a different approach to getting to know an unusual character, Christopher Boone.  And while he tells the story of the murdered dog, the reader gets to step inside this unusual mind, to discover what makes him tick, what makes him feel, and what makes him love.  THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME will definitely be on my list of the top 30 books read in 2004.	2004-02-01

THE DOGS OF BABEL by Carolyn Parkhurst<br />One of my favorite books read so far in 2004, Carolyn Parkhurst's THE DOGS OF BABEL is a slightly twisted tale of a grieving widower trying to reconcile the death of his wife.  It's one of the more unusual books to come out in the past few years, taking the reader into a somewhat unbelievable scenario that involves dogs that learn to speak.<br />Paul Iverson is a middle-aged linguistics professor that has a successful career and a loving wife.  When he calls home in the afternoon one day and finds an unknown man answering the phone, his life changes forever.  He returns home to find his wife has fallen out of an apple tree in their backyard and is found dead.  The police have declared this an accident, but something does not seem right to Paul. There are telltale hints all through the house that his subconscious perceives that his wife's death is not what it seems to be.  The only witness to Lexy's death is their beloved dog, Lorelei, the one to discover the body.<br />And so begins Paul's obsession to teach Lorelei to speak.  As a linguistic, he feels he has the know-how to train her to make human sounds and to tell the story of what really happened to Lexy. He takes a leave of absence from work, and lives and breathes this project to the dismay of his co-workers who now feel that he's lost it.  His home shows the neglect Paul has begun to live under, the piled up dishes, the stacks of newspapers, and the disheveled look that he presents to anyone that may happen to come to visit his home.  Paul's life mission now is to find out why his wife died, and he cannot rest until he knows the truth.<br />THE DOGS OF BABEL takes on a macabre turn, which will repulse many readers, dog lovers or not.  The point of the book, however, is not to frighten or to offend the reader.  The real story is the journey that Paul needs to make to accept the death of his wife.  It isn't until he talks to a TV psychic that he finds out what he needs to know, and if the reader was perceptive enough, the clues were there from the beginning of his story.  Paul unfortunately did not want to accept this knowledge, and continued in denial until someone helped him see the light.<br />I truly loved THE DOGS OF BABEL.  A remarkably short book yet full of insight and packed with information on the love story that was Paul and Lexy Iverson, it will probably be one of my favorite books of 2004.  It's not quite a love story, because it's told from a point of view of a mystery, but I personally saw this as a love story and a man's acceptance of the death of his cherished wife.	2004-01-28

HITTS &amp; MRS by Lori Bryant-Woolridge<br />HITTS &amp; MRS. by Lori Bryant-Woolridge is the story of a young successful African American woman who is torn between her ex-fiancé and her boss.  The story sounds simple but it is more complicated than that.  Melanie Hitts has just gotten out of her engagement to highly eligible bachelor Will Freedman, feeling that she's being rushed into marriage to a man she has known for only a few months.  Her sense of independence has been taken from her, and when she finds out that he has bought them a house as a surprise clinches it for her.  The fact that he didn't even consult her on this purchase was enough for her to call the engagement off. And she does this in front of the entire room full of friends and family at their fancy engagement party.<br />While Will tries to figure out how to win Melanie over again, Melanie moves back to New York City to continue with her highly successful career in interior design.  And it's through this job that she meets her soul mate, John Carlson, the head of the internationally known architecture company Carlson and Tuck.  Everything would be wonderful if only John was younger, John was not married, and John was black.  Melanie doesn't know which is worse, that he's married or that he's the wrong color.<br />Melanie and John grow together in their platonic relationship, but at the same time Melanie still loves Will. She's never stopped loving him, but she could not marry him under the conditions of their current relationship.  Something needs to change.  John was everything that Will wasn't, yet both had qualities that satisfied Melanie's needs.  With this in mind Melanie wonders if she can have it all, a loving friendship with John and a marriage with Will? As far as she's concerned, there is nothing wrong with that. She's not doing anything wrong, although she and John do love each other, but they have sworn not to push their relationship into the physical.<br />Although I didn't find this book the perfect book, I am rating HITTS &amp; MRS. 4 stars.  I enjoyed the story line and found the book such a fast read that I finished it in two days.  Some of the characters didn't' quite ring true for me, including John Carlson's wife Sharon, who I started out liking a lot but had my doubts about some of her actions at the end of the book.  The issue of racism obviously comes into play in this book, but it is so subdued and doesn't' really become an issue until the second half of the book that I think it should have either been written in as a main plot line, or not used at all.  I would definitely read other books by Lori Bryant-Woolridge and I recommend HITTS &amp; MRS. to those who are fans of romances, African American Lit, or both.	2004-01-23

And Anju, with her new life in America and her new husband Sunil, is looking for something beyond being just a wife and future mother.  While Anju looks for life outside the household, Sunil finds himself distracted by the presence of his sister-in-law, who he has always loved in secret since before he married his wife.  And Sudha is fully aware of this.<br />It's a complicated mess and life does not get any better for Sudha, and gets only worse for Anju and Sunil.  Although THE VINE OF DESIRE was not as good a novel as the original book, I still found myself wanting to finish this book to find out whether Anju and Sudha find the happiness they are seeking in America.  Is it true that the grass is greener on the other side?  Should Sudha have stayed in India and returned to Ashok?  The reader is left to find out what happens to both sisters.  I recommend THE VINE OF DESIRE to those who have enjoyed SISTER OF MY HEART.  For more by Divakaruni, I would suggest reading THE MISTRESS OF SPICES, which is by far her best novel yet.	2004-01-22

This was my first taste of the series, and so far I am impressed.<br />In this novel, we are introduced to the town of Cooper's Corner and Clint Cooper, the co-owner of the bed and breakfast called Twin Oaks.  He and his young son Keegan moved to this little town from the big city of New York after Clint's wife and Keegan's mother Kristin had passed away.  They would have stayed in New York, except for the fact that Clint noticed Keegan was starting to get involved with gangs. Clint's sister Maureen convinced them to move from New York to the small town of Cooper's Corner, and now she and Clint co-owned the bed and breakfast.<br />Beth Young is the local librarian in town, as well as the pianist on certain nights at the Inn.  Clint has always felt an attraction for her and Keegan figures this out.  The young pre-teen decides to play matchmaker, and somehow sets up a scam to get his father to meet Beth for dinner, and soon the two of them are embarking on something that almost looks like the start of a relationship.<br />In the mean time, unbeknownst to the rest of the town, Beth was in a horrific car accident two years ago and was an amnesia victim.  She never regained the memories of who she used to be.  Beth doesn't even remember her own name. The name \\"Beth Young\\" was given to her by a cancer patient named Addie who shared Beth's room at the hospital during her recovery period.  To honor her friend, Beth moved to Cooper's Corner and took over the name of Addie's deceased granddaughter Beth. Beth's memories go no further than that.  The only part of her that she knows is from her past is her ability to play the piano, playing music that she had written in her past. <br />There is a mystery behind Beth's past, a mystery that is tied to the music she plays on the piano.  She believes that someone is out there looking for her, wanting her dead, and that her car accident was no accident.  She fears that it really was a murder attempt.  Because of this belief, Beth is afraid to get close to Clint and Keegan, afraid to endanger their lives.  But it's too late.  Clint has fallen in love with Beth, and soon they both find that they are involved in something that may endanger their lives.<br />I recommend HER STOLEN PAST.  It was well written, highly enjoyable, and I found the plot interesting.  It was one of those books that I couldn't put down.  I am looking forward to reading the rest of the COOPER'S CORNER series.	2004-01-17

WAKING WALT by Larry Pontius<br />Here's a very different type of book that I found rather unique. WAKING WALT, by former Disney Marketing executive Larry Pontius, is a story that answers the rumors about Walt Disney and whether he was cremated or put under \\"cryonic suspension\\".  In other words, was Walt Disney frozen, to be \\"thawed out\\" later in time, and to be brought back to life when the timing was right?  Inquiring minds want to know! In WAKING WALT, Walt Disney is indeed brought back to life, and the adventures he goes through is what I think was the best part of this book.<br />The story is told in a humorous light.  Disney's buddies from the old days, calling themselves \\"The Circle\\", are waiting to revive Disney.  Walt \\"died\\" as a result of cancer, but he wanted to be revived when a cure was found. Unfortunately, Walt's awakening was due more to the fact that someone out there had found out the secret that he was still alive, and knowing that there was a major coup going down at the Walt Disney Company, someone did not want Mr. Disney revived to save the day.  <br />To make a long story short, in WAKING WALT, Walt Disney is brought back to life by his friends, if only to save his life.  A cure for cancer seems to be found, but there is research still being done on various cancer patients, and Disney is now one of them.  <br />In the meantime, what he and his old buddies go through to hide him and keep him from the media is a riot.  Along with the comedy, however, there is also a mystery to be solved, as Walt and his friends try to outsmart whoever is still trying to find Walt Disney and get rid of the genius before he takes over the company again. They also cannot figure out who is leaking out the news about Walt, and why they can only stay one step ahead of his enemies.<br />I found the entire idea of WAKING WALT rather interesting and fascinating.  It was a great concept and had some fun characters. However, I did find a few flaws with the book.  There were scenes that I felt were extraneous, or were out of place, and the characters did not always behave the way they should have.  I also didn't like the idea of having Walt Disney as a central character in this book.  While it was fun to see things through Disney's eyes, to make commentary on a world 40 years past his own death, for me the mystique of Walt Disney needed to be kept just that. Putting him in the thick of things made him less of a legend and more of a human being like you and me, which for my own personal tastes I just did not care for.  I would have preferred him to be more like a character that was seen from a distance, to keep that legend of Walt Disney intact.<br />With that said, I still would recommend WAKING WALT as a fun and different type of adventure. Larry Pontius has promise as a writer and I look forward to what he comes up with next.	2004-01-16

PARANOIA by Joseph Finder<br />Here's a book that caught me by surprise: PARANOIA by Joseph Finder.  I was expecting a typical \\"corporate thriller\\" type of book, but I got something better. PARANOIA is a fast paced novel that takes us into the world of corporate espionage, but this book is more than just that.<BR> <BR>Adam Cassidy is making a so-so living going nowhere at a high-tech corporation, Wyatt Telecom.  He hates his job but makes things a little more exciting by getting involved in scams such as the one that introduces him in chapter one.  He finds a way to throw a huge retirement bash for a fellow employee, a loading dock blue-collar worker named Jonesie, and by impersonating an important executive VP Adam gets this party thrown, company paid.  He gets a kick out of seeing these guys and their wives having the time of their lives, enjoying a company paid party on a scale that usually only the higher-ups get to partake in, but unfortunately all good things must come to an end.  Adam gets caught.<br />After a nerve-wracking meeting with the head of the company, Nicholas Wyatt, Adam finds himself a victim of blackmail, and in a big way.  Wyatt agrees not to turn Adam into the authorities, (so Adam is spared the likelihood of a jail sentence) if Adam helps Wyatt spy on a major competitor. Wyatt sees that Adam has a lot of great qualities that would make him an excellent spy, and because Adam has no other options, he agrees to do what Wyatt says. Adam is about to become a mole.<br />Adam's life is now turned upside down.  He no longer \\"works\\" for Wyatt Telecom, but is now on his way to becoming an employee of the competition, Trion.  He is trained thoroughly by Wyatt's assistants, down to the minutest details, so he can pass as a superstar employee that Trion desperately thinks they need to steal from Wyatt.  Trion has no idea that Adam is actually an employee that was on the verge of being fired.  It's a miraculous transformation that even Adam could be proudof.  <br />And, Adam succeeds and his life is changed forever.  But he does so well that he starts to lose himself. And soon his loyalties become confused.  He becomes close to the head of Trion, Augustine Goddard, and is treated as if he were Goddard's long lost son.  Wyatt, however, is pressuring Adam for more and more details about a secret project soon to be released by Trion, and is so relentless that Adam hardly sleeps at night, and can hardly eat during the day.  Soon, Adam wants out, but what he finds out too late is that there IS no way out, at least alive.  <br />While the story sounds like a very serious intense thriller, it also has a lot of heart.  Adam's relationship with his father is a subplot that helps explain who Adam really is.  The adventures Adam (and his old cantankerous father) has with various in-house nurses takes on a comedic turn when a huge ex-con named Antwoine comes into the picture. The scenes between Antwoine and Adam's father are a riot!  <br />I read PARANOIA towards the end of 2003, and it made my list of top 30 books read that year. I'm not one that often reads books in this genre, nor touts novels such as this, but I find that PARANOIA is one of the best novels I've read in quite a while.  The short chapters make this a fast read, and the plot is constantly moving.  The character development was excellent, what I found the best element of this book.  You want to know and care about Adam Cassidy and you may find yourself cheering him on. This reviewer highly recommends PARANOIA and I look forward to reading Joseph Finder's other novels.	2004-01-14

ATONEMENT by Ian McEwan<br />Shortlisted for the prestigious MAN BOOKER award, ATONEMENT by Ian McEwan is a complex story dealing with two things: a teenage girl who falsely accuses a young man of a crime he did not commit, and the impact this actions makes on those that are left to suffer for it.<BR> <BR>It is a few years before England's involvement in World War II. Briony Tallis is the youngest of the Tallis family, where at the start of the novel she is a mere thirteen years old. She's fond of writing; no, she's obsessed by it, and one of her favorite \\"things to do\\" is to write plays in which the family will enact when it is complete.  Briony is in the process of trying to get her family members, including visiting cousins fifteen-year-old Lola and the nine-year-old twins Jackson and Pierrot, to act out their individual parts, but Lola and the twins are not cooperating. Briony runs off in a huff, and soon finds herself out in the gardens, where she spies Robbie and her sister Cecelia.<br />Robbie is the son of one of the family's most dedicated servants.  He has no father, and so has been put under the wing of the Tallises. His education is paid for, and he is now going to University. There is some resentment towards him, as the reader will soon discover.  While Briony is sulking out in the garden, there is a scene with Cecelia and Robbie which Briony misinterprets, and from there she begins (in her immature and fanciful way) to imagine all sorts of horrors that Robbie may be inflicting upon older sister Cecelia.<br />With Briony it is one misinterpretation after another, all involving Robbie and her sister. It is obvious Briony is a very naive girl for the age of thirteen.  None of this would have been important, however, except that things start to snowball and Briony starts to mull these events over in her mind. She develops a one-sided opinion of Robbie, by assuming too many things and never finding out the real truth.  Then, one evening Lola is discovered by Briony, looking as if she has been beaten up and left to die. We are seeing this through the eyes of Briony, and the reader is left to guess what really happened to Lola.  However, Briony takes it upon herself to give a full report of this crime, regardless of the fact that she could barely see what was happening that night, stating that it was Robbie who had been the culprit and that he must be punished for hurting her cousin Lola.  Unfortunately, the adults believe Briony, not Robbie, and he is taken off to prison.<br />And thus, the story is set up for the reader.  The story moves forward, with the War in full force, Robbie is out of prison and sent overseas to fight for England. Cecelia is a nurse, waiting for Robbie to return, for they have pledged their love to each other.  Neither have any contact with the Tallis', but neither does Briony, who decides to become a nurse as well.  <br />ATONEMENT may seem to be a complex and difficult book to read.  Yes, there is not much dialogue and much more exposition.  However, if the reader is lucky enough to finish this book, one will have to agree that it was most highly deserved to be nominated for the Booker Prize in 2001.  This reviewer was totally surprised with the ending, and I believe I am not the only one. ATONEMENT was one of my favorite reads of 2003.  Highly recommended!	2004-01-12

WE WERE THE MULVANEYS by Joyce Carol Oates is a story of a once-happy family that seemed to have it all, but slowly falls apart after a tumultuous incident occurs to one of the members of the family.<br />The Mulvaneys are comprised of six persons: Michael Sr. is the head of the household, proud father and wonderful husband. He runs a roofing business in town, Mulvaney Roofing, which he is highly successful at.  His wife, Corinne, holds down the fort, spreading love to all her children and to the love of her life.  Her obsession over antiques adds to her other eccentric qualities, making her even more loveable.  Mike Jr. is the oldest child, the all-around athlete and is very popular in school.  Patrick is son number two, the one with the brains. He of all the children seems to be the one that likes to be alone the most and seems happiest with his thoughts and his books. Marianne is the only daughter of the family, the cheerleader type and all-around popular girl in school. Like her mother, she is a very devout Christian girl, and believes in the ideal of \\"turn the other cheek\\".   Last but not least is Judd. He's the baby of the family and also the narrator of this long intense drama that tells the tragic story of their family.  <br />Life is grand for the Mulvaneys. Home life is one busy event after another, as they live on a farm where they each handle various chores.  It's busy work from morning until night but it's rewarding. Everyone seems to be happy, and there doesn't seem to be a thing wrong.  But, on Marianne's prom night, something does go wrong.  And as much as she tries to hide this tragic incident that scars her for life, her family eventually finds out as well as the entire town.  <br />From this point on, life changes for the Mulvaneys.  The disintegration of the family is slow butsure, and it is hard to believe how far they get from that happy family they used to be.  Judd chronicles the story of their family in detail, focusing on various members at a time. The book can be difficult to read, as I found Oates' writing tedious at times.  However, by the time I reached the last page, I saw where she was going with this story, and I am glad I read it.   I don't recommend this book to everyone.  It's not an easy book to read, but for those with the patience to get through it, they will be rewarded.	2004-01-12

In this installment, Stephanie teams up with Lula the ex-hooker (who now works for her uncle Vinnie) and a transvestite musician named Sally Sweet to find her latest criminal-on-the-run. This time it's Maxine Nowicki they are looking for, who was charged for stealing her boyfriend's car.  However, there is more to this crime than meet's the eye.<br />In the meantime, Stephanie and Joe Morelli get closer (she moves in with him temporarily) and her ex-husband's indiscretion -- Joyce Barnhardt -- decides to become a bounty hunter too, to Stephanie's irritation.  Grandma Mazur also makes an appearance, but is not as big a participant in this one as she was in some of the previous novels.<br />I found this fourth book in the series just as funny as the others.  The character of Sally Sweet I found irresistible.  I find that as I read each new book in this series, her stories are becoming more and more \\"solid\\".  Practice makes perfect, they say.  Anyway, this book I give 4 stars, and am looking forward to reading the next one, HIGH FIVE.	2004-01-06

The story begins at the beginning of her fifth marriage, this time to an elderly well-traveled man named Ned whom she meets at a wedding. Besides the baggage she brings of her many marriages, she also brings with her a teenage son (Joss), who she has left in Africa while she goes on her journey to find husband number five.<br />The pace of the book is very slow, but at the same time there is an underlying tension that will keep the reader hooked.  The mystery behind Hannie's life and her strange son Joss is what keeps the book from getting too slow.  She alludes to something about his past through her narratives, but it isn't quite apparent what is wrong with Joss till much further along into the book.  <br />In the mean time, we watch Hannie treat Ned with contempt, turn her nose up at the well-meaning neighbors, and pretty much behaves like a selfish, self-centered woman.  It is obvious her need to use and manipulate others is her way of life, and the only person that is important other than her is her son Joss.  <br />After finishing the book, I could not find one redeeming quality of Hannie's that made me feel any sympathy for her.  At the same time, I think the book was well done, because it evoked such strong emotions in me as I read.  The fate of Joss is up to the reader to find out, and it is not what I had expected, but yet I guess I was not too surprised either.   I couldn't make up my mind whether to feel sorry for him or not.  But overall, I'm giving this book, my first read of 2004, a thumbs up and four stars from Ratmammy's Reviews.	2004-01-05
850072:US	51214937	R3S3DT9GYURXQR	0767907817	834442453	Bookends: A Novel	Books	3	5	8	N	N	Not a great book	BOOKENDS by Jane Green<br />BOOKENDS by Jane Green is the second book by her that I have read so far, and unfortunately, this book does not come close to the first one, BABYVILLE.  BOOKENDS is the name of the bookstore that the main character and a friend decide to invest in, but it isn't really the main focus of the entire book; I feel it's not the best title for this book.  It doesn't really describe what the book is all about, which is more like a book about friends.<br />BOOKENDS's main character and narrator is Catherine Warner.  At the start of the book, she and her friends are in college and she writes about their friendship. Back then, their group consisted of herself, her gay friend Simon (Si), Josh, and her \\"best\\" friend Portia.  In this part of the story, she relates to how Portia betrays them and because of this, the rest of them decide to shun her from their group, and they part ways. What I found almost annoying about this part of the book, was that this theme (which the back cover blurb makes the reader believe this is the main theme of the book, but it isn't) reminded me so much of Margaret Atwood's book THE ROBBER BRIDE.  One friend that everyone loved, but yet at the end she betrays all of them, and once she returns into their lives, she does it again.<br />However, there is a big difference with BOOKENDS.  Once Portia is out of their lives, the story moves one and we continue with the rest of the group, including newest members Lucy who eventually becomes Josh's wife.  The book goes on for quite some time, with Cath in search of that life and man that has forever alluded her, stories of Josh and Lucy's au pair Ingrid (who also reminded me of Portia), Cath's friendship with Si, and then finally Portia re-enters their lives.<br />The author did an unsuccessful job at writing a cohesive book.  She rambles on in sections, with the occasional dialogue sounding meaningless and comes across as rather too long. She also seems to be unable to keep to a single main theme. Not that all books have only one theme, but what she tries to do in this book does not work.  There does not seem to be any point to the book.  She has several major points in the story that I felt, for some reason, had no relationship to one another.  I also felt that writing this story in the first person probably made things a lot worse.  Because she didn't have a very good handle on tying the characters together, I think if she had used the third person the book would have at least felt a little bit more together.<br />Although I loved the characters that inhabit BOOKENDS, the book itself lacked something, and for that reason I am giving it a 3/5 rating. This book pales in comparison to BABYVILLE, which is unfortunate because BOOKENDS could have been a great book.	2003-12-29
860700:US	51214937	R2L7VXJG1ONGPW	0786868716	891971809	The Five People You Meet In Heaven	Books	5	13	17	N	N	The best book of 2003	THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN by Mitch Albom<br />Such a small book but what a big message it sends to the reader.  THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN by Mitch Albom is the follow up novel to his very popular TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE.  Both have similar themes - living and dying - but HEAVEN takes on a different approach.  <br />The book starts right off with the reader knowing that Eddie is about to die.  He's a simple man, worked nearly his entire life for the beachside amusement park called Ruby's Pier, and spent his time maintaining all the rides at this park.  He's in his 80's, lives alone and has lived alone for quite a long time.  He talks about his dearly beloved Marguerite, but his co-workers have never met her.  Basically, outside of the children that come to the pier and his coworkers, Eddie is alone in the world.<br />Eddie's life flashes before our eyes, the years rolling by as we see him \\"celebrating\\" one birthday after another.  These birthday scenes are significant, showing us what Eddie's life was all about, from the time he was five years old, till many years later in his old age.  At the same time, we also watch his death, how his co-workers react to it, and the preparations that take place for the funeral. <br />The third story line is what happens after Eddie dies.  He is taken to what he thinks is heaven, and before he can \\"pass\\", he is to meet five people that he made some important difference in their lives.  He doesn't even know some of these people.  But as their stories unfold, Eddie finds out why they were chosen to be his five people, how he touched their lives, and yet he cannot see why his life was so important, to them or to anyone. Not until he meets that last person, the fifth person in heaven.<br />For that is how Eddie lived his life.  He feels that his life was unimportant; that it meant nothing whatsoever to anyone.  He feels his life was a waste and that he probably wishes he had done things differently.<br />Without giving much of the story away (for this is a very short book), the moral of THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN is this, and Albom did an excellent job at getting to this point: NO person is unimportant on this earth.  We are all here for a reason, for a purpose, even though it may be so small that it is hard to see. In Albom's heaven, every person who has died meets their five people, and through these five people, they learn the significance of their lives on earth.  Even Eddie learns the meaning of his life, and it is far more significant than he could ever have imagined. <br />It is needless for me to say that I am going to probably give THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN the number one spot for books read in 2003.  It has an important message for all of us, and was written in such a way that it should make a big impact on anyone that reads the book and understands the message.  Mitch Albom once again has written a classic, and it will be enjoyed by many for years to come.	2003-12-18

THE WEDDING is the sequel to THE NOTEBOOK, the love story of Noah and Allie: a love that almost didn't happen.  Now, in THE WEDDING, we meet the next two generations of family members, and a somewhat complex story is told. <br />Noah is now living at Creekside, where he and Allie had moved toward the end of her life.  He spends his time feeding a lone female swan, distinguished by a dark patch of color on her chest.  Noah feels that this is Allie come back to him, and his children feel that he's lost touch with the world.  Noah, however, never gives up on his theory and insists that it is his dear beloved wife.<br />Noah and Allie's oldest daughter, Jane, is married to Wilson Lewis.  They've been married for nearly 30 years and have raised three children, all of whom are now adults.  Jane and Wilson's story is told in flashbacks, as Wilson remembers what brought him and Jane together all those years ago.  The reason for his reflections, though, is that he knows Jane is very unhappy with their marriage.  So unhappy, that she leaves town for a few weeks to spend with their son Joseph.  She doesn't say exactly why she left, but Wilson knows she needs to get away to think things over.<br />In the meantime, their oldest daughter Anna has announced that she and her boyfriend Keith plan to be married in a few weeks.  She doesn't want anything fancy, and plans to marry at the justice of the peace.  However, this is not what Jane wants for her daughter.  Suddenly, Jane shows a new interest in life, and with the help of Wilson the two of them proceed to organize the best wedding any daughter ever had.<br />As the wedding plans take shape, Wilson keeps Noah up to date.  During their visits, Wilson notes how Noah dotes on the swan, talking to her and sharing his thoughts with her. A few odd events almost convince Wilson that maybe this is indeed Allie reborn, but he always keeps these thoughts to himself.  And all through these visits, Noah reminisces about his wife, while Wilson remembers his own first love Jane.  <br />The title THE WEDDING is misleading, but this was Sparks' intention.  Yes, the entire book is about the family getting ready for the big wedding, but the reader will realize by the end of the book that the story is much more than just THE WEDDING.  The ending will surprise you, as it surprised some of the characters in the book.  The story of the swan helps round out this tale of eternal love and may turn even the most cynical of persons into a romantic.	2003-12-17

BABYVILLE by Jane Green is good chick lit.  Why?  It's not just some inane story about a 20-something working girl that is out there developing a career and finding Mr. Right at the same time and getting in to all sorts of trouble.  Instead, Jane Green writes three realistic stories that are connected by common characters and each story centers on the theme of having a baby.<br />In the first part, Julia is a career girl who finds her life falling apart due to an obsession over getting pregnant. She's not married, but she thinks she's got a great relationship going with boyfriend Mark, but for some reason she's not perfectly happy. She thinks that if they have a baby, their relationship will be solid and she'll be the happiest girl in the world. Unfortunately, her obsession about getting pregnant takes on a dark turn, as it affects her relationship and her job in a bad way.  <br />In the second part, Maeve, who the reader meets briefly during Julia's story, is a career woman who is just that - all career, nothing else.  She has no need to be married or to have a steady relationship, let alone a baby.  But, after only one fling that should not have happened, Maeve finds that her body is changing, and before she knows it, she realizes she is pregnant. What is a career girl to do?<br />In part three, Sam (Samantha) has her baby and her husband, but she is so fixated on her baby that nothing else seems to matter.  Because of her obsession, her husband is being neglected. She doesn't see this. All she knows is that she feels like she's stuck in the house with no one to help her, and yet she does not go out to seek friends, help, or anything else for that matter. What should have been a perfect family situation turns into something stifling and suffocating as Sam's obsession with her baby consumes her and makes life miserable for those around her.  When she finally meets her husband's co-worker Jill, as well as Jill's husband Dan, her obsession over her baby soon moves to Dan.  She thinks her troubles are over, but are they?<br />I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed BABYVILLE.  These stories were not the typical chick lit material. They had depth and I found that the characters were believable and somewhat likeable (I personally didn't care for Julia, but that's just my opinion! She was a bit too self-centered for me!).  I definitely recommend BABYVILLE!	2003-12-17

THE ROBBER BRIDE follows a similar theme as her novel CAT'S EYE, in which four girls form a clique of friendship, while one of the girls becomes the ring leader, tormenting one of the other girls endlessly till near-tragedy strikes.  However, in THE ROBBER BRIDE, we are now looking at four women, whose history begins in college.  <br />Roz, Charis, and Tony were acquaintances during their college years. Their one link was a mutual \\"friend\\" named Zenia, a friend that eventually turned on each of them later on in their lives and practically destroyed them in order to get what she wanted from them. <br />The book is very complex, as the author takes us back and forth in time, telling the story of each of the women and their relationship with each other and with Zenia.  What's interesting is that without Zenia, none of these women would have kept in contact. But as each one finds out what a snake Zenia can be, they bond and through the years they continue their friendship.  Zenia then dies, and the women feel they are safe and can move on with their lives.  But, then one day while they are out at a restaurant, one of them thinks she has spotted Zenia...<br />I found THE ROBBER BRIDE to be riveting and very intense.  I feel that out of all the books I have read by Margaret Atwood, this was the most powerful of them all in terms of emotion and passion.  This is not to say that her other books were any less than this one, but I remember feeling a lot of angry feelings as I read it.  Margaret Atwood is truly a talented writer, and what makes me want to read her other books is that each book she writes is different from the next.   She doesn't use a formula; she re-invents herself with each new book.  I rated THE ROBBER BRIDE five stars and I highly recommend it.  Margaret Atwood fans will love it.	2003-12-15
865460:US	51214937	R3S50WTDQ8CSIX	0385503857	264457638	Oryx and Crake: A Novel (Atwood, Margaret Eleanor)	Books	5	245	277	N	N	One of the year's best novels for 2003	ORYX AND CRAKE by Margaret Atwood<br />Shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 2003, ORYX AND CRAKE is Margaret Atwood's most apocalyptic story to date.  For those of you who have read THE HANDMAID'S TALE, ORYX AND CRAKE is a lot more grim and depressing, in terms of the plight of the human race.  It may be a challenge for some to get through this book.  Those who are fans of Science Fiction and Speculative Fiction, however, may embrace this novel as I did.  It is probably one of the best novels written by Margaret Atwood.<br />There are two main themes in ORYX AND CRAKE. First, the novel takes place in the distant future, where global warming has changed the earth so much that the coastal cities no longer exist, and New York is now New New York.  Going outside in the sun is a death sentence, so the wealthier areas of the world are protected under places known as compounds, although areas known as The Pleebands still exist, where people live and are still exposed to nature in all its glory. <br />The second major plot line has to do with three central characters. Snowman is the narrator, also known as Jimmy, who at the start of the book is the only known surviving human being on the face of the planet.  The book starts off with Snowman sleeping in a tree, barely alive, knowing that he does not have too much longer to live.  Food is scarce, the sun is so hot he has blisters all over his body, and the genetically engineered creatures the wolvogs and the pigoons that have escaped are now roaming the grounds. <br />While he tries to keep alive, Snowman also keeps watch over a group of humanoid creatures called the Crakers, named after his \\"best\\" friend Crake, who was somehow responsible over the creation of these people.  These Crakers are supposedly the ideal humans. They have no emotional desires, in particular no sex drives, except to pro-create.  There is no reason for war, with this new type of human being.  They are vegetarians, and do not desire meat.  They are verysimple people, and Snowman had promised to care for them if anything happened to Crake.<br />As Snowman goes back in time to reflect on the past, we learn more about Crake, who was an egotistical brilliant young man who had visions of a so-called better world. The third main character is Oryx, a woman whose history takes the reader to a third world Asian country where she was sold into a type of servitude, and eventually becomes a prostitute.  She then finds her way to the western world and ends up working with Crake, becoming part of his plan when he creates the Crakers. Their story is revealed in pieces, told while Snowman goes on an adventure to find food and seek out the compound where it had all began. Snowman wants to go back to this place, hoping to find answers and food and supplies, and to remember the reasons why the human race was nearly obliterated. It's the story of these three and their lopsided relationship that leads us to answers of why the world \\"ended\\". <br />The new concepts and horrors that are being introduced in the book may overwhelm the reader.  However, the most important theme to focus on is \\"what really happened\\"?  Why is Snowman the only person left on the planet? What happened to Oryx and Crake?  This is what drove me to finish this book. I could not put it down.  The reader is left in the dark until the very end, when it is finally revealed how the human race was nearly wiped out.  It is a very futuristic and depressing story of how mankind can go wrong in the search of a better world.  <br />I have always had a fascination with books that take on a type of apocalyptic theme.  Margaret Atwood's vision of the earth's future is not a pretty sight, but it was her story of Oryx, Crake and Snowman that made the book worthwhile.  I am giving this book 5 stars, and it will most likely be in my top 5 for 2003.	2003-12-14
866004:US	51214937	R1VUWQ8Z0EPKV0	0515131083	20771988	Plantation: A Lowcountry Tale	Books	4	6	9	N	N	My favorite Dorothea Benton Frank Book	PLANTATION by Dorothea Benton Frank<br />PLANTATION is the second book I've read by the author Dorothea Benton Frank.  I was not thrilled with her first book, SULLIVAN'S ISLAND.  But I already had PLANTATION in my pile of books to be read, and many have told me that this book was much better than her first.  So, I read it.<br />PLANTATION, like SULLIVAN'S ISLAND, is a story that takes place in the \\"low country\\" of South Carolina.  This area includes Sullivan's Island (outside of Charleston) as well as the ACE basin, the area where the Ashepoo, Combahee, and the Edisto Rivers join at St Helena's Sound. It's a picturesque area of beauty that only nature could create, and it is near the Edisto River on a plantation called Tall Pines Plantation that the bulk of this story takes place.<br />Caroline Wimbley Levine's search for happiness is one of the main themes of this book.  She's married to a man that was once her professor in college, and while at one time in her life she loved this man with a passion, she is now at a point where she needs her space. <br />The plot though is not as simple as that.  Caroline is fighting demons in her head.  She's grown up almost hating her mother for a past that started with her father's death.  When her brother Trip asks her to come home to check on their mother's mental stability, Caroline does just that. After being gone for so many years, the memories come flooding back, memories of her father, the only parent she thought she loved, and a mother that abandoned them emotionally after their father had passed on.  She becomes reacquainted with her brother and his wife, the lowly Frances Mae, who seems so uncouth that she embarrasses the entire family, including Trip.  Through it all, she finds that she can come back home again, finds that she has bonded with her mother again, and returns to New York a much happier person.<br />However, things in New York have not changed.  Upon returning she finds that her husband has been unfaithfulto her, and the scene where she confronts the two of them is something I will never forget.  Now that her marriage to her husband Richard has failed, her mother's warnings about marrying Richard haunt her.  It seems that no matter what she does, her mother never approves.  She can never live up to her mother's high expectations.  Now, with her husband left behind in New York, Caroline hopes to start a new life in South Carolina. With her son Eric, she moves back to Tall Pines Plantation with her mother.<br />Another theme of this book is the unforgettable character of Miss Lavinia, Caroline's mother.  She is a woman of southern class and is so outgoing and gregarious that she is almost a caricature of a woman of the Deep South.  Lavinia is loved by all, and even Caroline cannot help but love her mother, who outside of her faults, is such a likeable person, but a formidable force in the family and amongst those who live their lives around her. As the reader learns about Caroline's past, we also learn about Lavinia's crazy life.  <br />The story is told in the first person, changing narrators between Lavinia and Caroline.  Through this narration, we learn why Lavinia behaved the way she did and why she treated her children so horribly after losing her husband. We also learn about Trips internal demons, and how his father's death truly affected his life into adulthood.  PLANTATION is not a simple story. It's a complex tale of a family that is falling apart, but through it all Caroline and Lavinia find a way to keep them together, and they both find the peace that they have been looking for all their lives.	2003-12-13
872832:US	51214937	RF8E7SM5TGFJQ	0515134007	828660610	The Texan's Wager (The Wife Lottery)	Books	4	26	28	N	N	A very enjoyable historical romance	THE TEXAN'S WAGER by Jodi Thomas<br />Jodi Thomas' THE TEXAN'S WAGER is the first book in a trilogy of books that take place in - you guessed it - Texas.  These three historical romances take place in the state of Texas during the 1800's, when life was still rough and wild and civilization was considered to be back East.  <br />In this story, the reader is introduced to three strong women, Sarah, Lacy, and Bailee, who are abandoned by their wagon train and left to die because of prejudice, fear and ignorance among the rest of the settlers. The three make it back to a populated part of Texas, but along the way they murder a man to defend their lives. Because of this they are given two choices - go to jail, or be auctioned off to three lucky men who are looking for wives in a land nearly void of eligible women. Women, besides those that work in the saloons, are far from being plentiful in this part of the country, and it seems that nearly all the single men in the town of Cedar Point are in line to find them a wife.<br />It doesn't take long for the three women to find new husbands.  Sarah disappears with her husband, and her story is continued in the second part of this trilogy. Lacy's husband is away at war, so she goes with her future father-in-law to help him take care of the family business.  Bailee's new husband is a man named Carter McKoy, who is known by the town to be a very strange and different sort of man.  Carter rarely ever speaks a word, and as Bailee struggles to get to know her new husband, she learns why he is a man of no words. <br />The women's troubles are not over.  They soon find out that their lives are in danger when word is out that the man they thought they had murdered, Zeb Whittaker, is still alive and is on the warpath.  No one crosses him, especially a woman.  At the same time, Bailee and Carter take in an orphan child named Piper, and their lives are now complicated even more, with the child being witness to a train robbery and being the only survivor, her life is now in danger as well.  <br />The plot lines sound a bit convoluted, but Jodi Thomas does a good job at making the story as believable as one could make it. She also does a good job at creating such well-developed characters, which adds to the story's believability.  I was very impressed with this book and found it a surprisingly enjoyable one.  For those fans of historical romances, I highly recommend THE TEXAN'S WAGER.  I plan on reading the rest of this trilogy and will look forward to new books by Jodi Thomas.	2003-12-08

I found it a refreshing novel, taking the reader into the world of hip affluent African Americans living in Southern California.  <br />In CHEATERS, Dickey uses three voices: Stephan Mitchell, who is single and can't seem to be faithful to just one woman. He juggles a number of women, all of them oblivious to this fact, and so far he's doing ok with it. So Far.  Then there is Chante Ellis.  She's single too, and also seems to have problems with the opposite sex.  And finally there is Darnell, the lawyer who wants to be a writer.  He's married, but not happily, and his wife probably feels the same way.<br />Through these three, we get to know each of them but also are introduced to some of their friends and lovers.  Stephan's latest conquest is Toyomi, an African-Japanese-American woman who was becoming very needy. This didn't bode too well for Stephan, as he was also trying to spend some time with his other women.  Toyomi soon becomes the b***h from hell, when she catches him saying \\"yes\\" to her best friend on the phone.  I found myself chuckling as the battle between Stephan and Toyomi got uglier and uglier.  <br />Stephan's best friends are Darnell and Jake, who is single but is engaged to be married to the lovely Charlotte.  There is an obvious problem with the relationship, as Jake and Charlotte evade questions to \\"when are you getting married\\"?  <br />Chante's got two best friends: Karen, who seems to be a very negative person and also seems to have a cash flow problem.  Tammy is their famous beautiful singer/actress friend.  The three of them are tight, but their friendship starts to weaken when their true colors start to show. <br />Through a twist of fate, Chante and Stephan meet, and they bring their worlds and their friends together.  Chante and Stephan appear to be perfect for each other, or are they?  And Darnell meets Tammy and they find out they arekindred spirits. It's too bad he's married...<br />I really enjoyed CHEATERS. It was a combination of his writing style, his characters, and the outrageous story lines that had me laughing out loud as I read.  I am looking forward to reading more by Eric Jerome Dickey. My next book will probably be MILK IN MY COFFEE.	2003-12-03

In this book, number twenty-four in the series, journalist/millionaire Jim Qwilleran and his two Siamese cats Koko and YumYum are guests at the Nutcracker Inn located in the neighboring town of Black Creek.  While he is there, he learns of a floating body in the creek, and soon he and the cats are on the prowl, trying to solve a mystery in the way no others can.<br />Before the story ends, Jim discovers the hotel he is staying at is haunted, attends a showing of \\"The Pirates of Penzance\\", takes care of his friend Polly's cats while she is away on vacation, and gets to know his neighbors in the cabins that stand along the banks of Black Creek.  Amongst all this are clues that will lead him to the murderer.<br />As this is only my second book, I can't make a judgment on the entire series. But, from comparing this book and the previous one I had just read, it appears to me that her older works are better written, and worth reading if you are one that enjoys cozy mysteries.  In other words, don't expect too much action.  Expect cute antics by the two cats, and some amazing feats of sleuthing by the Siamese Koko, and a few witticisms by Jim and his friends.<br />I have to admit that THE CAT WHO series are not my cup of tea, but I would recommend these books to those who can appreciate these types of cozy mysteries.  The best advice is to start with the earlier written books, and wait till the very last to read the final books in the series.	2003-12-01
884614:US	51214937	R3HZEBPGI7J716	0440223202	785923114	Evening Class	Books	4	7	7	N	N	A good Binchy, but not her best	EVENING CLASS by Maeve Binchy<br />Here's a book that revolves around an Irish expatriate who left her home in Ireland to live in Italy for many years, and a night class where learning Italian is the goal of it's students.  EVENING CLASS by Maeve Binchy is yet another novel in which Binchy introduces us to a large cast of characters, and the reader gets to know each and every one of them in detail.<br />The book starts off with the story of Aidan Dunne, a very unhappy husband and father of two young adult women, who is waiting to hear if he is going to receive the promotion of school principal that he feels he most certainly deserves.  When the position goes to a rival, he is instead offered the task of setting up a new nighttime adult education school, where he is allowed carte blanche.  Aidan chooses to start with Italian language classes. It is a revolutionary idea, but he decides he wants to take a stab at it, and his love of Italy is obvious as he tries to make his dreams of living the life of Italy come true. <br />In the mean time, he needs someone who could teach the class, as well as enough pupils to keep the classes going.  Enter \\"Signora\\": an Irish woman who now calls her home Italy, because many years ago the love of her life decided to return home to Italy, and she followed him, despite her family's protests.  After several decades of living in a foreign country, she herself is now a foreigner in the country of her birth, a place that feels strange and uncomfortable to her.  Her acceptance of the position of Italian teacher for Aidan's night school is a godsend, and she puts her heart and soul into this project.  <br />It first appears that this is a short story collection, as Binchy introduces a new character in each new chapter.  However, she chooses to make this a novel, as she winds up the short stories by bringing them all together at the very end.  It is a clever gimmick, and although I think she pulled it off, I felt that she cheated a bit.  Thiswas not a true novel. Her ending was rather sloppy, I thought, but it was the happy ending I was looking for.  <br />EVENING CLASS to me was an uplifting book, with a lot of hope and wishful thinking among the many characters.   I found it one of the more enjoyable Binchy books so far that I've read, although not quite my favorite.  I recommend EVENING CLASS to any Binchy fan!	2003-11-28

In this installment, Stephanie works closely with ex-hooker-turned-office-clerk Lula as she goes in search of missing Moses Bedemeir, an elderly man who owns the neighborhood candy store.  The rest of the people in the neighborhood refer to him as Uncle Mo, with great affection, and it seems that Mo can do no wrong.  <br />As in the first two novels, THREE TO GET DEADLY is a tongue-in-cheek book about an amateur bounty hunter, Stephanie Plum who, in desperate need of money, goes after all sorts of shady creatures in order to get paid.  With the help of cop Joe Morelli and Ranger the Rambo-like bounty hunter, Stephanie goes after the leads that seem to point to a Mo that is not quite as friendly and sweet as the neighborhood thinks.  Along the way she finds her life endangered, is teased and tormented by Morelli, and of course who can resist Grandma Mazur?  I personally loved her interaction with her pet hamster Rex.  She may have convinced me to get one of my own!<br />Most of the laughs this time come from the antics of Lula and Stephanie.  To Stephanie's chagrin Lula manages to tag along with her during stake outs and break-ins, as Stephanie tries to find out what happened to Mo. Unfortunately, Lula has a hard time being discrete, and the adventures that the two get into had me laughing again as I read along.  <br />As with the previous two books, I am giving THREE TO GET DEADLY a big recommendation.  These books are so much fun!  I am looking forward to the fourth book, FOUR TO SCORE.	2003-11-22

TWO FOR THE DOUGH by Janet Evanovich<br />Stephanie Plum deals with dead bodies and mortuaries in TWO FOR THE DOUGH, the second book in the series created by Janet Evanovich.  In this sequel to ONE FOR THE MONEY, Stephanie cruises the town of Trenton with Grandmother Mazur in tow, as she seeks out the mortuaries all over town in search of clues to missing person Kenny Mancuso, who is accused of having shot a gas attendant in the knees. <br />Kenny is Stephanie's latest missing person in her new job as bounty hunter.  Kenny also happens to be a distant cousin of Joe Morelli, a vice cop that Stephanie has known \\"intimately\\" since childhood, and who creates all sorts of conflicting feelings within her.  As in the first book, Morelli helps Stephanie through this case.  In this sequel, however, Grandmother Mazur comes along for the ride, Stephanie's mother tries to set her up with Spiro the mortician, and at one point her mother thinks that Morelli is Stephanie's boyfriend. <br />I'm really enjoying these books by Janet Evanovich.  These are beach reads, not meant for serious reading.  I find myself chuckling as I read these books, following the crazy antics of Stephanie Plum as she tries her best to retrieve these missing criminals.  Her fear of guns always comes into play, and this time around Grandmother Mazur plays a big role as her sidekick.  (Grandmother Mazur is not afraid to use her gun)! <br />I give this book another big recommendation.  Expect nothing more than a few laughs and fun times, and you'll want to read the rest of the series.  For those looking for more seriously written legal thrillers, stick with Grisham and Patterson.	2003-11-16

The general theme that ties these novels together is that they take place in the small town of Bethlehem, New York, where everyone knows everyone.  In this novel, Multimillionaire Tom Flynn meets the gorgeous and successful Holly McBride, who also is known by the town to have a tarnished reputation.<br />Tom has just turned 40, and he's achieved most of the goals on his \\"to do\\" list, including becoming a multi-millionaire. The only two goals left to reach are \\"get married\\" and \\"fall in love\\".  When he sees Holly at his small private birthday gathering with best friends Ross and Maggie, he decides that Holly is going to be the one.   Now, if only Holly will cooperate.<br />Holly's philosophy has always been love them and leave them.  Never getting closer to a man than a healthy sexual relationship, she has dated and bedded nearly every man in town.  Tom has been one man that has eluded her, and she has an itch to get him into bed too.  Unfortunately, she soon finds out that Tom wants more than just sex, and she is not very pleased with this turn of events.<br />As Tom and Holly do their little dance of love and enticement, the rest of the town watches in anticipation.  In the meantime, Holly is dealing with her restaurant business and a new girl that she's hired out of pity, Bree.  Bree is more than any employer can handle, but Holly keeps her on for some reason.  Holly also is dealing with an alcoholic mother who keeps reappearing into her life at the wrong moments.  Both of them, though, agree - there is something about Bree that they can't quite make out, and they wonder if they have met her before.<br />FIRST KISS was yet another enjoyable romance by Marilyn Pappano. Her style is reminiscent of the series by Debbie Macomber, where each novel continues on with the stories of the people living in this particular town.  However, where Macomber's novels failed to spark anything in me, the Pappano novels I highly recommend.  They each are self-contained, but can be even more enjoyable if read in chronological order, so as to slowly get to know the people of Bethlehem, New York and the ties that bind them to each other.  I have not been following this advice; nevertheless, the books are just as enjoyable read out of order as they are in order.  Thumbs up for FIRST KISS!	2003-11-09

The reference to the copper beech is to a large tree that stands near the school grounds where the town's children grew up.  Many initials had been etched into this tree, representing many memories of those that had passed through this town and through the school.<br />While Binchy's latest book QUENTIN'S had a similar approach, I felt it failed as a novel in comparison to THE COPPER BEECH.  QUENTIN'S used a main story line, with short stories interspersed around the main plot.  It was choppy and forced.  With THE COPPER BEECH, Binchy succeeded in creating a feel for this small Irish town and for the people that comprised it.  As the reader reads each story, they become more immersed in the lives of the towns people.  References are made to previous characters, so by the end of the book, one feels that this was a satisfactory journey through the town of Shancarrig, and may want to visit it again.<br />Some of my favorite stories were about Miss Ross and Father Barry, and their \\"secret\\" friendship; the story of Dr Jims and his only son Declan who had to face the world without a mother and with a father that was emotionally distant from him; and Richard Hayes, the wayward nephew of Bill Hayes, and his illicit relationship with married Gloria Darcy, and the hard lessons he learned from her.  All the stories I found interesting, and it was one of those books that I didn't want to see end.  <br />As with all Binchy books, I think most fans will agree that she writes the type of novel that \\"feels\\" like home. Her characters are usually well rounded and full of depth.  Her style of writing, which to me resembles friends chatting, is very comfortable to me.  Some readers have complained about her books, saying they seem far too long.  But I personally enjoy this type of writing, and do recommend THE COPPER BEECH.  For those not familiar with her works, I suggest starting with TARA ROAD, which was an Oprah book selection a few years ago.	2003-11-09

THE HUNDRED SECRET SENSES by Amy Tan<br />THE HUNDRED SECRET SENSES by Amy Tan uses a similar pattern which her previous books seem to follow, in which she starts the story in America with characters that are full- or part Chinese, and have a relative or two that tells them stories of the old country. In Tan's most creative book, she introduces the reader to Olivia Laguni, whose father was Chinese and mother was white.  Laguni is her stepfather, her father having died when she was only a toddler.  Obviously, Laguni at one point adopts her and her brothers, giving them a new name and in essence wiping out her ties to her Chinese family.<br />Then, along comes Kwan. From that point on, Olivia feels tormented by this half sister.  By this time, Olivia's father has been gone for years now. But Kwan comes to America from China to become part of their family forever. A much older sister, Kwan brings to Olivia stories of the old country, for Kwan is the product of Olivia's father and his first wife, all of whom were living in China.  Although Olivia considers herself Chinese, her ties are with her birth country of America, and she finds it very hard to relate to her older sister who seems to be more mother than sister as Olivia grows into adulthood.  Kwan is there to take care of her while her mother is somewhat absent from Olivia's life. And part of Kwan's mothering is telling Olivia stories about a strange world - where she sees and talks to ghosts.<br />Kwan's impact on Olivia is obvious, in ways that Olivia could never admit.  But as the reader sees, Olivia's relationship with Kwan grows in strength as they grow older, and especially when they make a trip to China, along with Olivia's estranged husband Simon.  After years of listening to Kwan's stories of a previous life in 1800's China, this world comes to life as they explore this land that is Olivia's heritage. <br />THE HUNDRED SECRET SENSES was not my favorite Amy Tan book.  There were a lot of elements that madeit difficult to fully enjoy this story, including the paranormal facets that were part of Kwan's character.  Having said this, I ended the book understanding what Tan's message was in this story and I felt very satisfied.  It is not a book I highly recommend to all readers, but I feel that if one is patient enough to get through the stories that Kwan tells about her past life, one will be rewarded at the very end.	2003-10-29

In this first installment, we meet Stephanie who is currently out of a job and is desperately fighting poverty.  She's sold most of her appliances and furniture to bring in a few dollars here and there, but she knows that sooner or later she needs to get a job, fast. When her car is repossessed, that is the last straw. <br />Her mother informs her that cousin Vinnie has an opening in his office, so when Stephanie pays him a visit, she also finds out that she could bring in some big time cash if she worked for him in a different capacity.  Her old \\"friend\\" Joe Morelli is on the run and wanted for murder.  The challenge was calling out to her and because of some childhood memories she had of Morelli, bringing him in was even more enticing.  Stephanie knew that he was her answer to a new life and $10,000.  But first she had to learn the art of being a bounty hunter.<br />I found this book funny and very light-hearted, despite some heavy themes that were running through the book.  An aggressive boxer who craved violence helped give the book its atmosphere of suspense and fear.  But on the other hand, her attempts at making it as a bounty hunter helped lend a humorous feel to the book.   I am giving this book a thumbs up, as it's very entertaining and did not pretend to be more than what it was: a very humorous look at world of crime.	2003-10-29

In NOBODY'S FOOL, we find ourselves immersed in the small town life of Bath, located in the Northeastern corner of the United States. Sully (Donald Sullivan) and all the other quirky characters that fill this novel made it the most interesting read I've had this year so far.<br />Sully's life has no purpose. He drifts through life, doing what he feels at that point in time. He lives in a very modest apartment that is barely furnished, and spends most of his time either at Hattie's restaurant, the bar, or betting on the race tracks.  He gets the odd job here and there, mostly doing physical type of labor such as helping someone build a house.  This may sound mundane, but it's not. Not when Sully is behind it.  He can make the simplest task an outrageous event.  If there is some news in town that sounds almost too weird to be true, Sully is often behind it.<br />Sully's sidekick is a simpleton named Rub. He's short, and is the joke of the town.  But for some reason Sully likes having him around, especially when he feels like making fun of someone.  Rub sticks to Sully like white on rice, and it also appears that Rub is in love with Sully, but not in THAT way of course, as anyone could tell you. Just a lot of idol worship, that's what seems to be emanating out of Rub.<br />Sully's life is intertwined with his landlady, Miss Beryl, who was once one of his grade school teachers.  Now, they are both in their golden years. Their history is complicated. A lot of Sully is wrapped up in Miss Beryl's family, a complex series of relationships and events that caused her son Clive Jr. to hate Sully with a passion.  A rivalry that Sully is not even aware of exists between the two men, and it stems from a childhood that both Clive and Sully shared. <br />Miss Beryl's days are spent talking to her dead husband Clive Sr. and amask she calls Drivers Ed, which is another quirky story that fits the theme of this book.  All the characters in NOBODY'S FOOL are not quite normal.  Or maybe they are, but they seem to have little quirks that the average person would think rather unusual.  The charm of this novel is not the story, but the odd people that reside in this small town of Bath.  I found myself chuckling quite often, and at the same time I found the person that was Sully a fascinating character study. His life story is told in bits and pieces, from his childhood and dysfunctional relationship with his father, to his first marriage and his neglect for his own son Peter. <br />As one reads this book, it may be difficult to find the point of the story. But there is a point.  There are various points to NOBODY'S FOOL, but I felt the most important moral to this story was acceptance, and the courage to move on.  A lot goes on in NOBODY'S FOOL, and it may take some patience to get through the book. But I found it easy reading, although slow, because it's not a beach read, but it is a book in which one will remember the characters for a very long time.  NOBODY'S FOOL will most likely appear on my top 20 books of 2003.	2003-10-19
934858:US	51214937	R29SSHAL5H4YKI	0451204948	838594392	A Day Late and a Dollar Short	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Another fun book by Terry McMillan	A DAY LATE AND A DOLLAR SHORT by Terry McMillan<br />Here's a title that I think a lot of Terry McMillan fans did not discover when it first came out in hardcover (as attested by this reviewer, who got a lot of \\"when did THIS book come out\\" when reading the book in public). A DAY LATE AND A DOLLAR SHORT is a novel by Terry McMillan about a family that seems to be drifting apart. Viola Price is the matriarch of this black American family.  Her husband is living with another woman, she's got a lot of health problems, mainly asthma, and her four grown kids seem to be too busy to come together at the same time as a family.  The story is centered on Viola, however she is not the only important character to this story.<br />The story is told in many voices - someone different narrates each chapter, which allows the reader to get into each characters head. There is of course Viola, the feisty 50-something grandmother and mother who is trying to make a new life for herself without her husband Cecil. There's Cecil, the man with the out of style Jheri Curl and polyester outfits who is now in love with a much younger woman, who comes complete with her own set of children.  Paris is the oldest daughter of Viola and Cecil, and she's also the high achiever in the family.  Charlotte's the self-centered daughter who feels very neglected and unloved.  Janelle is dealing with a major problem with her husband and her daughter, something so terrible she can't talk about it.  Lewis is the only son in the family, and also the one that keeps getting into trouble.  With a genius IQ, he can't hold on to a job and finds himself in jail a lot.<br />And these are only some of the characters you'll get to know. There are nieces and nephews and ex's and best friends that come into play.  It takes a while to see where the book is going, but the overall theme is about a family that doesn't feel like a family anymore, and Viola somehow manages to bring them all together.  <br />I'm a relatively newfan of Terry McMillan, having read WAITING TO EXHALE last year and HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK a few years before that.  I enjoyed them both.  A DAY LATE AND A DOLLAR SHORT was not as good as these other titles, but I enjoyed reading it.  What changed my mind was the rather anti-climatic ending.  I felt that Ms McMillan did not know how to end this story.  The journey was fabulous but the destination was somewhat of a let down. I'm still recommending this book but I wouldn't recommend it as a first book for those how have not read her other books yet.	2003-10-19

Published in 2003, this is the very last book in the series, and it's a big disappointment.<br />This was my introduction to Lilian Jackson Braun's famous cat series, known for being very cozy mysteries with more emphasis on the \\"cozy\\" than \\"mysteries\\".  Jim Qwilleran is a very wealthy citizen of the small town of Pickax,  \\"located 400 miles north of everywhere\\", and is owned by two Siamese cats Yum Yum and Koko. <br />The big news in this story is that a famous citizen of Pickax, Thelma Thackeray, who left town decades ago to make her living amongst the movie stars of Southern California, has returned to live out her remaining years.  She has a nephew that still lives in Pickax, but he's not exactly her favorite person.  Nevertheless, she had loved her dear departed brother and had come home to set things right.<br />While the town goes into a dither over the return of their famous Thelma, Qwilleran notices that Koko, his male Siamese, is acting strangely. He seems to be trying to tell his owner something, but Qwilleran can't quite make out what it is.   It takes a while, but soon Qwilleran puts the clues together.  There is trouble in town, and it's connected to Thelma and her nephew.<br />My overall feeling towards this book is very negative, although I ended with the book knowing I will try a few of the other books in the series.  The book seemed to be written on a 1st grade level, and I was highly embarrassed to think this was supposed to be geared towards an adult reader.  I felt cheated, and also thought that the author was simply churning out anything to please her publisher.  There are also rumors of this book being ghostwritten, which would hardly surprise me.  Based on the many negative reviews of this book, Iam glad to know that I am not alone with my assessment.  Frankly, this series has run its course.  But that shouldn't deter anyone from reading the earlier books in the series.  I am certainly going to be reading them, as I already own a few!  Unfortunately, THE CAT WHO BROUGHT DOWN THE HOUSE will go down as one of my bottom 10 for 2003.	2003-10-07

Ellie Winters is a lawyer working in what she considers a very boring job for Snow &amp; Druthers in the heart of Washington DC.  She lives with her spoiled and manipulative pug Sally, and is dating yet another boring but sweet guy; this time the name is Eric.  She doesn't see any hope in sight, but she is not one to make waves. She therefore plods along, doing what she thinks everyone else expects of her, especially her parents.  The idea of becoming a lawyer was a way for her to make her father happy, since both brothers Mark and Brian refused to go into the family business (their father is a judge).  There was no other reason for her going to law school. She had absolutely no desire to become an attorney.  <br />Then, on a really bad hair day, (her hair was pink), Ellie is out with Sally when Sally is accosted by another dog by the name of Oscar, who is owned by none other than handsome Ted Langston, television anchor and eligible bachelor. Ellie and Ted start a rather awkward relationship, not really dating but not really friends either. And, there is something about Ellie that attracts Ted to her and he keeps coming back.  Ellie can't stop thinking about Ted, but she is afraid of falling in love with him when she may just be some passing fancy for him.  The other big problem is that Ted is only a few years younger than her parents are. And Ellie isn't sure she wants to start a relationship with someone this old.<br />In the meantime, she is dealing with a somewhat dysfunctional family, a best friend who has gotten involved with a guy Ellie does not like, and the frightening prospect of getting older.  I didn't warm up to this book at first, particularly after Ellie made a few derogatory comments about the baby boomer generation.  I was ready to throw the book away, but I kept reading and found this was not as bad a book as I had thought at first.  It was funny, and I enjoyed it so much that it took me only a day to read.  PUSHING 30's Ellie reminded me so much of Bridget in Bridget Jones Diary, and to me that is a good thing.  Whitney Gaskell's debut is a winner!	2003-10-03

Elliot thought he had it all, everything that his millions of dollars could buy.  He has beautiful sexy women at his beck and call, who give him all the sex he wants any time of day or night.  He has so much money that he's giving it away.  He tips waiters 50% at the finest dining establishments just because.<br />But yet, he has an ex-wife that he thinks about all the time, yearning for that special something they used to have. And, he has an only son who seems to want to become a Catholic, instead of preparing for his upcoming bar mitzvah. What's a father to do? What's a MAN to do?<br />Elliot has enough on his mind than have to worry about his son.  But because of his son, Elliot is now looking for respectability. Being the owner of a successful porn magazine, SWAGBELLY, does not help.  It's opened as many doors for him as it has closed.  But, if this magazine has brought him everything a man can want, should he throw it all away for a respectable publishing endeavor?<br />The book opens to a sex scene with Elliot as it's main participant.  The scene's hot, HE'S hot, and his girlfriend is pretty hot herself.  Welcome to the life of a porno magnate.  Life is grand!  (Needless to say, this was one of the best sex scenes I've come across in a book in quite a while.)  She's been the only love interest in his life since he's first had sex with her, and that's saying a lot, knowing that Elliot has probably slept with every centerfold that's come through SWAGBELLY.  For some reason that no one can figure out, Yvonne is special to Elliot.<br />She also has the bad habit of dressing like a hooker, not that she doesn't have the body for it. It also does not help that she looks old enough to be his daughter. But Elliot is trying to bring some class to his life, and when they go out on the town, especially to his favorite upscale Italian restaurant Tre Fiori, she damn well better look respectable. Unfortunately, as Yvonne and Elliot are dining at Tre Fiori that evening, Lauren the ex-wife and her muscle bound lover also make their way into the restaurant.  Words are said, insults are hurled, and Lauren informs Elliot their son is going to be baptized a Catholic.  This was not a good night.<br />Elliot's problems are only just beginning.  But, who said life for a multi-millionaire porno king was ever easy?<br />DJ Levien creates a multi-faceted character in Elliot Grubman.  Levien is also one hell of a storyteller.  While I started reading this book thinking it would only be filled with gratuitous sex, I was in for a big surprise.  There is a lot of depth to this story of the jaded Grubman, and if there is hope for someone like this porno king, there is hope for everyone.  I came to like Elliot, and am glad I took the chance to getting to know him.  SWAGBELLY gets 5 stars from this reviewer.	2003-09-30

It's the story of two people, David Powers and Clare O'Brien, and how their lives seem to be destined to come together, despite what social status dictates.  They grow up in the same small town of Castlebay in Ireland, travelling in different circles, since David's family is well to do, while Clare's is part of the working class.  But they eventually find their lives intertwined as they approach adulthood. <br />Clare's desire as she's growing up is to leave this small town, where she knows she would be trapped forever, expected to live out a life as traditionally as women have in the past - get married, have babies.  Clare wants more for herself, and with the help of her teacher Angela O'Hara, who had remained single so far into her adult life, she tries to meet her goal.<br />David's calling is to be a doctor as his father before him.  For him, his parents prefer something better than being stuck forever with a lower class girl like Clare. It is their hopes that he marries into a prominent Irish family and continues the family practice.  <br />But fate has something different in mind.  The story of David and Clare had me glued to this book, and as always Maeve Binchy tells a great story, filled with wonderful personalities that surround the main characters.  I highly recommend ECHOES as one of Binchys' best books to date. Don't be put off by the length.  It's worth the read!	2003-09-28
960220:US	51214937	R1GM6VAQN9Z1LG	0373711298	821463178	A Little Town in Texas : Crystal Creek (Harlequin Superromance No. 1129)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Crisis in Crystal Creek	A LITTLE TOWN IN TEXAS by Bethany Campbell<br />Bethany Campbell's A LITTLE TOWN IN TEXAS continues the saga of stories centering on Crystal Creek, Texas.  In this book, the town is up for big changes when a huge corporation headed by Brian Fabian decides it wants to buy up tons of Texas land to create a brand new housing development.  Crystal Creek is known for being a sleepy little Texas town that hasn't changed in decades, and the people are happy about it.  With a new housing development threatening to bring in more people, it spelled an end of an era.  <br />Kitt Mitchell was once a resident of this small town, but left years ago for New York and a career as a reporter, never once looking back. She had a secret she wanted buried, and had no desire to return to her hometown, despite the fact that Nora, her favorite person in the world, was still living in Crystal Creek.  Now, as a reporter and writer, Kitt is asked to travel back to Crystal Creek to find out what she knows about Fabian's plans for this small town. It's big breaking news, and her boss promises her a big promotion if she can pull this off.  Knowing that she has ties to Crystal Creek is no mere coincidence that she was asked to go.  Her boss knows she may have a way to get to the news-breaking story first.<br />In the mean time, Mel Belyle, a lawyer who has lived under the wings of Fabian for as long as he can remember, is asked by Fabian to help secure more land from the town's residents.  It's his job to do what Fabian asks, no questions, and he feels he owes everything to this very successful man for who he is today.  Mel has his own secrets that he's buried long ago, and he has also moved on from Crystal Creek and now lives in New York.<br />Kitt and Mel's worlds collide at the airport, both of them not knowing who the other is.  Kitt figures it out soon enough, but it takes a phone call at the airport restaurant where they are sharing a sandwich for Mel to figure out she's the enemy.  However,both cannot deny that there is a spark between them, no matter what side of this issue they are on.<br />Kitt and Mel do their research, and although they start out on opposite sides of this battle, they start questioning what is really right for this small town.  Would a new housing development bring in more people, thus creating new jobs and growth?  Would this be detrimental to the town and change it forever? Or is change good, as some people always say? <br />A LITTLE TOWN IN TEXAS was a well-written harlequin superromance by prolific Bethany Campbell.  Several subplots are followed in the book, including sibling rivalry between Mel and his brother Nick, the secret that has kept Kitt from returning home to Crystal Creek, as well as the main issue of development in a traditionally old-fashioned small farming town.  I was not disappointed with this book, and feel it was one of the better harlequin romances I have read this past year.	2003-09-28

It has been many years since she set foot in Canada, where she grew up moving from place to place, due to her father's career as an entomologist.  The story is told in flashbacks, as the story of her current life as a painter, on her second marriage, is told in-between the story of her childhood. Two plot lines run parallel to each other, until the very end when both the past and her present collide.<br />Elaine's first years were spent travelling with her family, never having a best friend.  It is all she yearns for, to have a real girl friend.  All she had during those early years was her brother, who as he grew older drifted away from her, leaving her alone to fend for herself.  When her father finally settles down and buys a house, she begins to make her first set of real friends.  However, how does one define a friend?  Elaine becomes part of a group of girls that seem to be living under the steel hand of Cordelia, the ringleader.  Cordelia treats them all as if she was a dictator and they were her subjects, but her treatment of Elaine is totally unforgivable.  Elaine is tormented to a point where her own mental health is jeopardized, and at one point one wonders how she ever survived.  <br />But survive she did.  As Elaine tells her story, we see how she developed from a very insecure and needy young girl to a woman who understands why she made the choices she did as a child, and became a very successful painter, secure in who she was and where she had come from.  The key to her understanding is her friendship with Cordelia, the young girl who treated Elaine like dirt, yet towards whom Elaine felt a type of longing for, years after she had last seen Cordelia.  It is a psychologically themed book, as usual,layered upon different levels of plots and subplots and characters.  Margaret Atwood is the queen of this form of novel, and it is no wonder she is one of the best storytellers today.  This was my fourth Atwood novel, and I will not hesitate to read my next.  Although not as complex as THE BLIND ASSASSIN, nor as prophetic as THE HANDMAID'S TALE, CAT'S EYE stands alone as a great book that is a must-read for any fan.  I give this book 5 stars.	2003-09-28

Roz Denny Fox's MARRIED IN HASTE is a story of two people who try to rebuild their lives after a devastating earthquake destroys their families, leaving two sets of orphans and two adults who don't know what to do.<br />Ben Galloway is a highly eligible pediatrician - good looking, smart, and has a reputation for being a lady's man. Abby Drummond is a schoolteacher and lives a simple life.  They meet through their respective jobs, and have been dating for about ten months. It's been a casual romance, nothing serious, but they are both having a lot of fun and are dating each other exclusively.  They are about to go on a skiing trip together, when tragedy strikes.  <br />Early morning while Abby is at school, an 8.0 earthquake strikes.  Living in Seattle, Abby and the rest of the city are used to small jolts, some as big as 6.0. But an 8.0 earthquake is massive and leaves the city helpless.  She does her best to calm her kids, and then hears word from a hospital that her brother Elliot has been taken to the hospital and she is needed there urgently.  Elliot doesn't make it, nor does his wife.  Their youngest son, Sam, is lucky to be alive. Thank goodness the rest of the family, two sets of twin boys, were at the school with Abby when the earthquake struck, and are safe. In the meantime, Abby learns that Ben's sister Marlo has also died in the earthquake, and has left two orphan girls.  <br />It is now up to Ben and Abby to take care of their nieces and nephews, and not knowing what it's like to have kids, the two think this can be easily done with some careful planning.  However, a few weeks later, they are still struggling to get a hold of the kids' emotions and are trying to deal with how to raise them.  Their relationship is put on hold, although they don't want it to be. They both help each other out with each other's kids, and it finally dawns on Ben that maybe they should get married.  With forces combined, it is possible they can get both families to survive and still find time to be together. <br />It's not quite the Brady Bunch. Things go from bad to worse.  But love always finds a way.  MARRIED IN HASTE may sound like an implausible type of situation, but Roz Denny Fox as usual does a great job making this story and it's characters believable, as well as likeable.  I was glued to this book till I finished it, and was very glad i picked this book up.  Thumbs up for MARRIED IN HASTE.	2003-09-24

In this novel, Yamanaka takes us into the world of Ivah Ogata, the oldest child of a family that has just lost their mother, and a father who can barely feed and clothe them, let alone give them the love and attention that was given to them by their mother.<br />Ivah is the narrator of this heartwarming story.  She looks after her brother Blu, a lost soul who is at a turning point in his life.  He could go down the wrong path, or find the right one, and is getting involved with the wrong crowd.  Maisie is the baby and for some reason has lost the ability to speak.  Because of this, there are many misunderstandings about her at school, including by teachers that punish her for wetting her pants. She's scared, and trusts only her brother and older sister.  On the peripheral of all this is their father, a custodian that lives in a fog since his wife passed away, and as he ages, Ivah worries about him, knowing that Poppy yearns to be with his beloved Eleanor. <br />The reader is given a glimpse of life on the islands, in particular the working class locals that are barely making ends meet.  Life is rough, filled with hunger, pain and violence.  A lot of Hawaiian flavor is mixed into the story, as not only are we told the story in the local pidgin, but we can also smell and taste the foods that are part of this unique Hawaiian American society.  We also feel the pain that is Ivah, who does not want to be stuck on this island, who wants more to her life than having to raise her brother and sister who need her desperately. It is a sad tale, but told with a voice filled with hope for a promising future.  The characters are endearing, and you will want to know more about them and how they fare once you are done with this book.  BLU'S HANGING is highly recommended.	2003-09-18

Kenny Swanson and his mother have just moved to town, and as any teenager would, he feels out of place. His one great love is the rodeo, and as this is a rodeo town he wants to ride. He promises his mother, however, that he'll wait.  Without any insurance, his mother is being extra careful with what her son does for fun. Promises are made to be broken, as Kenny finds his way to the rodeo grounds and slowly finds his way into the life he's always loved.<br />In the mean time, Cynthia Dustin is another teen going through a lot of emotional turmoil.  The relationship she has with her father is far from perfect.  In fact, it's almost non-existent.  What little communication there is between them seems to be filled with animosity and hate.  It is difficult to ascertain why this anger exists, and Cynthia deals with her father's feelings as best as she can. <br />Relationships become complicated as Lenna, Kenny's mother, starts dating rodeo star Roddy Moyers.  Kenny is very uncomfortable with this relationship, as it shows that his mother has moved on apart from his father, but it also forces Kenny to see his mother in a different light.  More complications are inevitable with the fact that Cynthia has been one of Roddy's many conquests, and it does not sit well with her that Roddy is dating Lenna.<br />As Kenny and Cynthia become better acquainted, she becomes a bad influence on him, as he starts getting into trouble with her father and also with the law. A confrontation with Cynthia's father leads to a confession from a family friend that helps Cynthia understand why her father has hated her all her life.<br />Other themes that are dealt with in this book are acceptance and forgiveness, as Kenny deals with an absent father who never is able to come through on any of his promises.  LOVE AND COUNTRY is not an easy book to read, yet at the same time, is written with a simplistic prose that shows the beauty of this land that Kenny grows to love.  While I didn't love it as much as I'd hoped, I still feel it deserves 4 stars.	2003-09-16

Poor Jackson has been in love with his fellow co-worker Genevieve for a long time.  Unfortunately, he's a geeky computer nerd and she's one hot babe.  She would never notice him in a lifetime, because he is simply not in her league.<br />But good fortune comes his way.  He is asked to go along on a business trip to the island of Maui with the big boss, Nick, along with Gen, who happens to be Nick's secretary.  This would be an over night trip, as they all live and work on the island of Oahu and Jackson is to attend a meeting with a client while Nick and Gen tend to \\"business\\".<BR> <BR>Gen has been dreaming about Nick for ages. She knows about his famous reputation for \\"love `em and leave `em\\" on his frequent business trips.  However, she feels that because of his deprived childhood, he is deeply misunderstood and is not really the cad everyone thinks he is.  He's every woman's fantasy, and she is determined to marry him.  <br />Getting invited on this business trip has put her in seventh heaven, and she prepares for what could be the most exciting weekend of her life. (If she only knew!) Her mother warns her, however, that this may not be a good trip at all. Her instincts tell her to stay home.  But Gen is determined to go and fulfill her fantasies.  Unfortunately, she finds out that geeky Jackson is coming along, and she hopes that his usual tardiness will make him miss the plane ride over to Maui.<br />What neither Jackson nor Gen knows is that Nick is up to no good.  He's plotting to embezzle millions of dollars from the company and that this is his get-away scheme.  Gen and Jackson are definitely not part of his plans.<br />What happens next is an adventure they will never forget, as Jackson and Gen miraculously survive the plane crash and team up to find a way off the deserted island that they're stuck on.  They also discover somethingelse - EACH OTHER!  <br />A cute romance with a lot of humor, A NERD IN SHINING ARMOR is not the perfect book. There were a lot of extraneous paragraphs all over the place, and at one point it got to be rather irritating.  Overall, I would like to give this book a 3.5 rating, but as Amazon only allows us to rate in full increments, I give this book a 4.  I don't know if I would read any other book by Ms Thompson, but this book was a fun beach read and is recommended as such.	2003-09-16

A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND by Elizabeth Young<br />Henry is Isabel Palmer's best friend - and he's a dog. He helps her land the man of her dreams in A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND, the latest novel by Elizabeth Young.  Another book under the genre \\"chick lit\\", it is probably one of the better ones I've read this year so far.<br />\\"Izzy\\", as many call her, is currently dating Leo, who happens to have some baggage attached to him. He's divorced, has children, and seems to spend more time with the Ex and the kids than Isabel.  But she perseveres, knowing that dating a once-married man means she will always be second to his children.  She doesn't seem to mind too much that he isn't always reliable to show up on a date, but she knows that he's got other important obligations. However, when Leo cancels at the very last minute a very important party in which he was to meet all her good friends, Isabel has a fit.  This is the absolute last straw! <br />So, Isabel attends the weekend sleepover party without Leo, and ends up meeting Nick, a very good friend of Rob, who is one of her closest and dearest friends.  Nick is the replacement for Leo in this costume/murder game party they are all invited to take part in, and despite the fact that he is good looking and has a great body, he still rubs Isabel the wrong way.  When Leo shows up unexpectedly, Izzy sees for the first time how jealous Leo can get, and this makes Izzy very happy. It surely must be a sign that things are going very well.<br />However, things don't go well at all.  She eventually finds out that Leo has been fooling around behind her back, and at this point the only male she can trust is Henry, her faithful dog. <br />I was at first very overwhelmed with the cast of characters in the first few chapters.  The chapters depicting the party at Felicity's had nearly every close friend of theirs described to a tee, and I couldn't keep up with who was who.  But, overall, the book was very entertaining and it did have a few sad moments, which is not usual for a chick lit book.  I'm giving this book 4 stars, and would consider reading other novels by Elizabeth Young.	2003-09-12

The novel continues the story of the Cherokee child named \\"Turtle\\" and her adoptive mother Taylor Greer. In this sequel, we find Turtle and Taylor living together in Tucson along with Taylor's boyfriend, a life that is not quite what would be called the most perfect of environments.  They live in poverty, barely making ends meet. Although Taylor does her best, her income is limited, but she gives Turtle a lot of love, and along with her boyfriend, Turtle has a new family. Turtle seems happy, and after years of being mute due to a history of abuse, she's learned to talk, and all seems to be going well.  <br />Unfortunately, Cherokee attorney Annawake Fourkiller accidentally discovers the existence of 6-year-old Turtle, and learns that Taylor had illegally adopted Turtle outside the Cherokee nation. Annawake is ready to rectify this problem.  As far as she's concerned, Turtle needs to be raised by the Cherokee.  Taylor, however, does not see this, and does what she can to protect her child.<br />Turtle and Taylor are now on the run, fleeing from their home in Tucson and leaving the boyfriend behind. They live from motel room to motel room, eating what they can afford.  It gets to a point where Taylor does not know what to do next, in fear that she and Turtle will be discovered and eventually Turtle will be taken away from her.  Yet, she wonders if what she is doing to Turtle is the right thing to do. When Alice Greer, Taylor's mother, gets involved, the story takes a surprising turn, and soon Turtle's biological family gets involved as well. I was glued to the book, wanting to know whether Taylor gets to keep Turtle, or is told to hand over the child to the Cherokee Nation.<br />Many important issues are brought up in PIGS IN HEAVEN. Should a child of American Indian heritage be allowed to live away from his or her tribe?  Should the child be allowed tobe raised among the white people, never knowing his true heritage?  Turtle was completely happy with Taylor, and she did not know any other mother or life. The issue of whether it was a moral crime to separate the two is a big theme, with a fitting conclusion at the end of the story.  <br />I really enjoyed this book, having already read THE BEAN TREES, which I loved as much as this one.  Both stories center on the welfare of Turtle, an endearing little Indian girl that will capture your heart.  However, after reading PIGS IN HEAVEN, I doubted that what Taylor did was right.  It actually gave me a different perspective on the first book.  <br />The two books should be read in sequence, but reading one or the other will not detract in the enjoyment of either.  I highly recommend both books.  For those that have read Kingsolver's POISONWOOD BIBLE or PRODIGAL SUMMER, neither book is comparable to these two.  The four seem to be written by different authors, simply because the style and tone of these books are very different.  I give PIGS IN HEAVEN 4 stars.	2003-09-08

This world that Hearn creates is filled with a touch of fantasy, as special people known as The Tribe populate the land, with the ability to do \\"magical\\" things such as disappear, or split oneself into two persons. Takeo learns in the first book, ACROSS THE NIGHTINGALE FLOOR, that he is part of The Tribe, through a father he does not remember.  Raised among the people called \\"The Hidden\\", Takeo has learned of a more gentle way of life by a people who believe in a new god, while The Tribe teaches him to kill and destroy.<br />GRASS FOR HIS PILLOW begins with Lady Kaede, a young woman betrothed to Takeo's adoptive father Lord Shigeru of the Otori, one of many powerful lords among the clans. Kaede, however, loves Takeo, but in this second book she is now on her own with her lady-in-waiting Shizuka, who is also part of The Tribe.  Kaede is no longer with Takeo or Lord Shigeru, and she must now find a way to fend for her life and help her sisters survive in this dangerous world they live in. Her father, Lord Shirakawa, is very old and weak, and he is the only protection she has from the other powerful men in the land who will try take away all that she has come to love, including her sisters.  Kaede, with the help of Shizuka, learns how to defend herself and learn the skills that traditionally belong to a man, because she knows that she can no longer trust anyone else, and she will certainly not trust a man again.  Her only love Takeo has been taken away and she does not even know whether he is alive.<br />Takeo is also unaware of what has become of Kaede. He has been captured by The Tribe, and will eventually become one of them, as is his birthright. Takeo has no desire to be with them, however, but is bound to them by heritage and apromise he made in ACROSS THE NIGHTINGALE FLOOR.  He also knows that if he tries to escape, they will kill him. <br />But escape he does, and Takeo is now on the run for his life.  His goal is to return to Lord Shigeru's people, The Otori, with the hopes that they will accept him as Shigeru's heir.  <br />Takeo and Kaede live day by day, yearning for each other and never knowing whether they will see tomorrow.  Their struggles and adventures are comparable to a cross between CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON and THE LORD OF THE RINGS.  The Tales of the Otori are written on an epic scale, and the conclusion will finally reveal whether Takeo and Lady Kaede's futures will be as one.<br />GRASS FOR HIS PILLOW is an adventure epic that is beautifully written and researched thoroughly by Ms Hearn.  Although this second installment of the Tales of the Otori is recommended, I found it was not as good as the first book. I found something lacking in this second one, but it does not mean I will not follow up with the third book.  It is still worth the read, and anyone that has read the first book should definitely read this one. One thing I did note was that GRASS FOR HIS PILLOW is a stand-alone book.  Hearn left enough information in this second book to fully explain what happened in the first.  Any new reader to this series will not feel lost if starting this series with GRASS FOR HIS PILLOW.  This reader gives GRASS FOR HIS PILLOW 4 stars.	2003-09-07

Sculptress Paige Mattheson is known to be as cold as ice, and during an art show two men place bets on whether the one can thaw her out.  Thus, Paige finds herself meeting Jesse Dallas, who in the guise of a chauffeur worms his way into her life.<BR> <BR>What ensues is a hot love affair that Paige never in a million years would have thought could happen to her, and Jesse finds he's won his bet but also discovers he's falling for the ice queen, something that should never have happened.  No promises were made between the two at the onset of this affair, and as Jesse starts to get the itch to leave, Paige convinces herself into letting him go.  Unfortunately, although she thought she could go on with life without him, she finds that she's fallen in love.  Jesse decides that he can't deal with commitments and attachments, and he attempts to continue with his life without her.  The two lovers part company, but only time will tell how long they can resist the urge to see each other again.  <br />SECRET OF THE STONE was at one time part of the Harlequin line of romance books called TEMPTATION. I wasn't in the mood for a romance so I was a little disappointed at first when I started reading this book.  I was hoping for a Barbara Delinsky novel akin to what she is churning out today.  However, as I am a big fan of hers, I continued with the book and found that the flavor of the story was a lot like the books she currently writes, but with a slant towards pure romance.  I am giving this a 3 star rating; unless you are looking for a straight romance or are a big fan of Barbara Delinsky, however, this book is probably not for you.	2003-09-01

MAYBE THE MOON by Armistead Maupin<br />Armistead Maupin does a change of scenery from San Francisco, which was the center of his six books collectively known as TALES OF THE CITY, to Los Angeles with MAYBE THE MOON, Armistead Maupin's first full-length novel.  Although TALES OF THE CITY had been written first, these books started out as newspaper columns and have a distinct feel to them.  They are more lighthearted and the characters are not fully developed.  MAYBE THE MOON is indeed a novel, the story of the life of a spirited woman who learned to deal with a type of disability.  It was with great pleasure that I read this book and got to know the character that was Cadence Roth.<br />Cadence Roth is a pint-sized person, legally classified as a dwarf, and although she is a very small person, her personality definitely is not minute or diminutive.  In fact, she packs a punch and from such a little human being, she can shock others with her foul mouth and assertive ways. <br />Maupin starts the novel with a blurb from a review: Mr. Woods (1981) C-112 m. ****.  It's the start of a movie synopsis from the movie critic Leonard Maltin's book \\"TV Movies and Video Guide 1992 edition\\".  <br />Thus, the novel begins.  Told via her journal, we are thrown into the world of Cady Roth, whose claim to fame was the starring (anonymous) role in the 2nd highest grossing movie of all time, MR. WOODS.  She played an elf that befriends a young boy, but because of the type of role she played, she is behind a mask the entire time. The real world never learns who the actor behind Mr. Woods really was.  She is forbidden to do any publicity for the movie except in costume, as the director feels the audience would lose the magic if they saw who actually played this beloved movie character.  While other actors build their careers upon a breakthrough role, Cady is doomed to have this one big character haunt her till the day she dies.<br />And so Cady lives on in frustration.  She finds whatever work is available, which is not very much since the average movie doesn't usually call for a character that is less than 4 feet tall. She at one point breaks down and takes a job with a small group of people who entertain the rich and famous at parties held in towns like Beverly Hills.  She dresses up as a clown, making children laugh at birthday parties and bar mitzvahs.<br />References to THE WIZARD OF OZ are often made, as she relates to other dwarves who have been exploited or made it in the world of show biz.   Her mother had a very important role in Cady's life, helping her become discovered and then pushing her on, making sure that her daughter's dreams were fulfilled despite the handicap of height.  When her mother passes on, Cady is devastated but eventually hooks up with a new best friend, Renee, who latches on to Cady in a welcome way and the two become roommates and best friends for life.<br />Cady's life seems to be on a downward spiral, as the jobs with the entertainment company become scarce, and there doesn't seem to be any hope in her securing an acting job, but she does not give up.  When news that there will be a big Star Studded tribute in honor of a major anniversary of the release of MR. WOODS, Cady feels this is her last chance at being recognized.  What happens on this big day leads to the climax of the book with an ending that I did not expect, although there were hints of it throughout the book.<br />MAYBE THE MOON is probably Armistead Maupin's best work yet.  The story of the life of Cady Roth touched me in many ways, and indeed I feel envious that Maupin knew the woman that this book was inspired by.  Whoever she was, she was indeed a very special person.  A story about people overcoming handicaps and differences in a world that abhors such people, MAYBE THE MOON gets five stars from me.	2003-08-29

As his mother supports and stands by the work Asher's father does, Aryeh Lev devotes his life to the causes closest to his people.  Most of his life is dedicated to preserving the culture of this Jewish sect, and also to helping those who are being persecuted in other countries. He travels often, sometimes to countries as far away as The Soviet Union to help out his fellow Jew. He's rarely home, and young Asher is often angry and upset, wishing his father had more time for him.<br />From a very young age, Asher has a deep sense of art, and learns to express his innermost feelings through his creativity.  As with any artistic genius, creating art is in Asher's blood and it soon gets in the way of his schooling and his religion and culture.  His parents are not happy with the way things are going with Asher, but they tolerate his strange obsession, thinking this is just a passing phase.  He will grow out of it, they think.  His mother in particular does not dissuade Asher from drawing, if only to keep him happy, hoping that he would reward her with better grades in school. And with the help of local storeowner Yudel Krinsky, Asher obtains the necessary pencils and other art equipment to continue his fascination with drawing.<br />However, his obsession with art does not die, as his parents had hoped.  The older he becomes, the more his passion with art drives a wedge between himself and his parents. He becomes more independent in the way he thinks, and soon his parents find they cannot control him.  The life of a Ladover Hasidic Jew is one of structure and daily prayer and obedience to one's elders, to one's Rebbe, and to one's God. Asher lives in direct conflictwith all this, although he tries to keep his daily prayers in his routines, and is often dwelling on things that pertain to his religious background.  <br />Torn between his great desire to express himself as an artist and the need to please his parents and in particular his father, Asher's life is full of torment and guilt.  But he is happiest when he is painting, or drawing, or walking amongst the masterpieces at a museum. When Asher takes up with a fallen Jew who also happens to be one of the greatest living artists in the country, Asher's artistic life goes into full swing.  He lives and breathes his art, as Jacob Kahn teaches young Asher all he knows. Jacob convinces him that in order to become a true artist, he needs to live in the secular world.  Again, Asher questions whether he is doing the right thing by following his passions and his God-given gift, or should he turn his back on art and follow the route of an obedient Hasidic Jew?<br />What more can I say about a book that has become a modern classic?  Chaim Potok wrote a truly powerful story in which a person is torn between two worlds.  A rare view into the world of a small Jewish sect, the reader senses the world of alienation and loneliness that comes to someone born into this society but living amongst the \\"goyim\\" that surrounds him. The author also makes the reader question whether it is better to be true to oneself, or to deny oneself the destiny that a higher being may have intended. There is no doubt that this book cannot be rated anything lower than 5 stars.  Highly recommended.	2003-08-26

SHOPAHOLIC TIES THE KNOT by Sophie Kinsella<br />The last in the three book series about Becky Bloomwood's insane adventures, SHOPAHOLIC TIES THE KNOT by Sophie Kinsella is yet another fun romp that showcases the crazy antics of this young woman who is consumed with the need to spend money.<br />Still living in America with her very successful (and rich) boyfriend Luke, Becky is now doing what she was born to do: she's a professional shopper at a famous department store in New York City and putting together wardrobes for very high end clientele.  Life couldn't be better.<br />Then, Becky's best friend Suze is about to get married to Tarquin (who happens to be Suze's cousin, but at this point no one is saying a word) and Becky sees how happy and in love Suze is.  At the wedding, in which Becky is the maid of honor, Luke and Suze conspire to have Becky catch the traditional bridal bouquet, and along with the bouquet is a note from Luke asking Becky to marry him.<br />The shock of the engagement doesn't last very long. Becky is soon shifting to high gear. With the wedding only months away (who needs a long engagement?), they need to figure out all the details of the wedding NOW.  But there's one problem: both mothers are planning the wedding, and neither mother knows the other is doing it.  And Becky hasn't the heart to tell her mother that she is getting married in New York, while she is very afraid to tell her future mother-in-law that her dear mother is planning a wedding in England. What to do?<br />Well, if you are a fan of Becky Bloomwood's, you probably have guessed that Becky's life is once again in turmoil.  As the wedding date approaches at breakneck speed, she tries to figure out how to fix this mess she got herself into.  You will want to throttle her neck as she comes up with one harebrained scheme after another. But as always, things work out in the end for our dear Becky.<br />SHOPAHOLIC TIES THE KNOT was not my favorite in the series. It could be because it's no longer fresh material, as the first two books were.  On the other hand, I still found myself wanting to read the book, wanting to find out how things would end for Becky. If a fourth novel was written, say \\"Shopaholic Has a Baby\\", I would certainly invest my money and buy that book.  I find the SHOPAHOLIC series as endearing as the Bridget Jones escapades were, and I recommend the books to all that love some light fun reading.	2003-08-17

THE PACT by Jodi Picoult<br />This is my first book by Jodi Picoult, and I'd like to preface this review by saying I had no expectations whatsoever, but by the time I was done with the book, I was a fan for life.  This was one hell of a book.  It started with a bang: young Emily Gold is dead, and by her side was her boyfriend and close childhood friend, Chris Harte.  As life-long friends, Chris should've been there to save Emily, but obviously he was not able to, and now their parents are asking, \\"what really happened\\"?<br />THE PACT is not only the story of two families torn apart by the death of one of their children, but it is also the story of a young girl who for reasons that are revealed in the book, has no reason left to live.  As the story unfolds, the reader knows that Emily died of a gunshot wound to her dead.  The police are not sure whether this is a suicide or a murder.  Regardless of what the charges are, the parents of both teens are distraught and are now trying to figure out why this happened, and if there was anything they could have done to prevent it.<br />The story then goes into flashbacks, with scenes from their childhood depicted with Emily and Chris being the best of friends since the day they were born.  The two were months apart, and the two families started their friendships before the two were even born.  No two families could have been closer than the Golds and the Hartes, and so it is shocking to see how their friendship is torn apart by the death of Emily.  Friends accuse friends and friendship turns to hatred, as the two families learn about what happened that night Emily died.<br />As the plot follows their pasts into the present, Chris is charged with the murder of Emily, and it is from here that the story line really takes off.  A book that can be taken from today's headlines, the murder trial is sensationalized and causes the little town of Bainbridge, New Hampshire to become the center of the universe as tabloids and newspapersdetail the murder trial.  <br />And with that said, I highly recommend THE PACT.  I can't say anymore about this book, which I found riveting and literally could not put the book down.  It will most likely be on my top 30 list of books read in 2003.	2003-08-17

As the title says, LIFE OF PI is the story of a man's life, Piscine Molitar Patel. \\"Pi\\" as he nicknames himself, narrates most of this book about his life so far, starting with his early school days, life at the zoo, and of course his time spent in the ocean.  <br />In the first part of the book, comprising nearly one third of the story, he talks about his beliefs and views on life in general, all of this taking place before his family's fateful trip to Canada in the hopes of a new life away from India.  He then proceeds to tell the tale of his adventures and amazing survival in the ocean. Over 200 days he lives alone on a lifeboat after the cargo ship he and his family were on sinks without warning.  He is alone, except for a few wild zoo animals including a human-raised Bengal tiger mistakenly named Richard Parker.  The rest of the book is comprised of his adventures on this lifeboat, as he tries to stay alive and to outwit the wild animals that are with him.  <br />I enjoyed the writing style of this book and found that the narrator was very amusing, making the tone of the book, especially his time spent in the ocean alone, full of optimism and hope.  His series of anecdotes of life at the Zoo, (his family owned a large zoo in India), was also very fascinating.  He was able to relate to each animal and anthropomorphised each one.  I enjoyed his stories of these zoo animals, as well as his tales of his conversion to Catholicism, Muslim, and Hinduism and found them all very funny. And although I did enjoy this part of the book, I was not sure why it was as long as it was, except for the fact that this book was entitled LIFE OF PI, as opposed to \\"THE ADVENTURES OF PI ON THE OCEAN\\".  I felt that Martel was trying to give us the essence of what young Pi was all about, and therefore spent a big chunk of this book getting inside Pi'shead.  By the time the reader reaches the part of the novel in which the shipwreck occurs, we can sympathize with Pi and understand more of how he was able to survive.<br />I don't feel I need to add anymore to this review, as there are hundreds of reviews of this book here on Amazon.  I do want to add that I enjoyed the book, but do have one warning: if the reader is not focused on the book, it can be a difficult and long read.  Because the bulk of the story is comprised of exposition and not dialogue, it can make it difficult for many readers to get through.  Popular story writing almost always focuses on plenty of dialogue, but as this is an adventure tale, and for the most part there is only one human being in the plot, there definitely is not much dialogue.  I give this book 4 stars, mainly because I felt I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as I would have liked.  I was easily distracted for some reason, and did not feel glued to the book as I have been with others.  This is not a negative review by any means, but simply the taste of this reader dictates this book a 4-star rating.	2003-08-10

This second book picks up where the first book, TALES OF THE CITY, left off.  The focal point is the apartment building located at 28 Barbary Lane, in the heart of San Francisco.  The books depict life and love in the town that Tony Bennett left his heart in.  The reader gets involved with a number of esoteric characters, and some ordinary ones too, that have somehow found their lives tangled together in the late 1970's.<br />Mary Ann, who moved to San Francisco from the Midwest in TALES OF THE CITY, now sees SF as home.  She and Michael (Mouse) have become good friends and they take off on a cruise together. Michael wants a lover, as does Mary Ann, and as they both happen to be two lonely adults they decide to hang out together and have fun in the sun.  It's Mary Ann, however, that gets lucky on the cruise, although her new lover does have one problem: he has amnesia.  Michael, in the mean time, is still pining away for his gynecologist love Jon, while Mary Ann and her boyfriend Burke get very cozy on the high seas.<br />Back home, Mrs. Madrigal, the landlady of 28 Barbary Lane, has a big secret that is revealed early on in the story. Her connections to her favorite tenant, Mona, and a prostitution house in Reno, seem rather far-fetched but it is one of the big shockers of TALES OF THE CITY. <br />Brian, another tenant, is in the midst of some weird love affair, where he makes contact with a woman in the building across the way while he spies on her with his binoculars. Who this woman ends up to be is another shocker.<br />The story of Dede Halcyon continues, and the mystery of D'orothea is also revealed, with her story and her relationship with her family gone into great detail.  The two women become fast friends in this book, with the promise of future appearances in successive books.<br />The book comes to a bang of an ending with MaryAnn and her lover Burke trying to figure out who he really is, and this mystery leads them on a very wild adventure involving a cult!<br />MORES TALES OF THE CITY is yet another fun romp in the lives of these quirky people from 28 Barbary Lane. I enjoyed it as much as I did the first book, and am looking forward to reading the third book in the series, FURTHER TALES OF THE CITY.  Armistead Maupin has a way of bringing these eccentric characters to life, which is the reason to read the rest of the series. Two thumbs up for MORE TALES OF THE CITY.	2003-08-03

This first book introduces the characters of Casey and Jackson Fontaine, a sister and brother that help run the farm with their parents, Duke and Angelique.  Casey is the heart of the sugar cane business in the family, and her love of the farm shows.  In the first chapter, she meets Nick Devlin, a good friend of her brother's, and also a successful businessman. His current project is a riverboat gambling casino, which he has just sold to a local businessman and is helping out with its grand opening.<br />Casey and Nick are very attracted to each other, but Casey sees nothing but trouble from him.  He seems to be a rogue and a lady's man, and after a disastrous relationship, she wants nothing more to do with men, or so she thinks.  Her aunt Esme, Duke's sister, is not very happy that Nick has entered into Casey's life, and she smells trouble.<br />In the meantime, problems are brewing on the farm.  While Duke and Angelique are away on a romantic getaway, one thing after another happens, accidents that seem to be more than just coincidental, and the lives of the Fontaines are put in danger. When Casey and Jackson hear of a horrible accident involving Duke and Angelique, there is no doubt that something is wrong, and that someone is out to ruin the family.<br />Despite the interesting setting and story line of CASEY'S GAMBLE, I had a very hard time with this book.  The writing lacked something, and the characters were not very believable.  They acted out of character in more than one scene, and I found myself wanting to drop this book and start over with another.  I hope the 2nd novel is a lot more promising than this first book in the  \\"Raising Cane\\" trilogy.  Usually I am not disappointed with the Harlequin Superromance series of books, but CASEY'S GAMBLE was one of those rare instances in which I wished I had not picked up this book.	2003-08-03

We return to the world of Rebecca Bloomwood, the obsessed shopper with her own London morning television show about managing one's money.

She spends like there is no tomorrow, and thinks credit cards grow on trees.  <br />In SHOPAHOLIC ABROAD, Rebecca finds herself in America, following her newfound boyfriend Luke, a very rich and successful business tycoon.  Once again Rebecca finds herself on countless crazy adventures as she tries to interview for American television, discovers shopping in New York City, and finds herself exposed on the news.  <br />I don't know why I enjoy these books so much.  I want to strangle Rebecca when I read about her crazy stunts and her silly adventures, but yet I can't help but laugh out loud.  And at the end, I am always rooting for her.  She's a BRIDGET JONES with a money problem, and has enough endearing qualities that I will come back for more.  I am looking forward to reading the third book in the series.	2003-08-02

Cara Lockwood's debut novel I DO (BUT I DONT) is a hilarious romp of a book that isn't very serious on plot line but is fun to read.  Lauren Crandell is a wedding planner, and she tells her stories about the botched weddings, the crazy weddings, and the outlandish weddings, including the two where she meets super gorgeous hunk fireman Nick Corona.  <br />Her dilemma occurs when she feels the sparks flying between herself and Nick, but after meeting several times by accident, and finding that they both seem to have a mutual attraction, she finds out later that he is the groom of one of her brides.  What is a girl to do?<br />Read along as Lauren works on some of these crazy weddings, figures out her own love life, deals with an aggressive boss and her aggressive cat Whiskers.  As far as chick-lit is concerned, I don't feel there is anything special about this book.  The narrator, Lauren, tends to get a bit chatty on occasion, but the story is fun and this book is a great summer read.  This reader recommends I DO (BUT I DON'T).	2003-07-27

Victoria (Vix) meets Caitlin as young schoolmates, and for some reason although the two of them are worlds apart,  Caitlin chooses Vix as her guest to summer with her family on Martha's Vineyard.  Vix has always been the quiet one, and Caitlin is the wild and crazy one.  And despite their differences, Vix seems to be attracted to Caitlin's life, including her family and Caitlin's' rather eccentric ways.<br />The story opens in the present (1990), with Vix receiving a call from Caitlin, saying she's inviting Vix to her wedding.  The brief prologue sets the stage, with Vix a bit perturbed by the phone call and torn between being angry with Caitlin, but also thinking \\"summer sisters forever\\".  It is obvious that there is a love-hate relationship between the two, or at least that is how Vix feels about her long time friend Caitlin.<br />Their summers together on Martha's Vineyard are full of fun and laughter. But as they get older, Caitlin's selfishness starts to show.  Vix however takes it all without too much complaining, always finding reasons to forgive Caitlin. Caitlin's selfish behavior is not obvious to all, but are subtle and often times happen in shocking ways.  <br />As the two start to meet and date boys, Caitlin's behavior in this department is directly opposite in the way Vix handles herself with the boys, and on one night, Vix celebrates her birthday with Caitlin and the boys and it ends up a disastrous moment for Vix. (Caitlin, on the other hand, sees nothing wrong with what she has done, and thinks it's all in good fun).<br />As the two girls become young women, their differences tear them apart.  Their friendship, which Vix always treasured, seems to be on a rocky road to disaster. Caitlin's father and his new wife are taken by Vix and try their best to mend the friendship, but Vix has been hurt enough.  She goes off on her own, and cutsher ties with Caitlin. Or so it seems.<br />SUMMER SISTERS was a great summer read. The plot kept my interest throughout the book, and the characters felt real and I cared about what happened to them.  Judy Blume did a good job with the story of two friends and their ever-changing relationship from childhood to adulthood.  It was also a good character study about two girls from different backgrounds, and the events and people that can shape a child into the adult she is today.	2003-07-27

Her story is intertwined with the present and the mythical past, as she explains how she came to be, and how she landed in modern day Oakland, California, where she finally ends up serving as a shop keeper selling spices to the Indian community.  In her present day life, she is an old woman.  She never leaves her store, which doubles as her home, and she sells spices and hands out advice as she deals with each of her customers.  <br />Deep inside, however, she's a young woman, full of life and energy, but forever trapped in this store and in this old body.  She yearns to be outside, but knows that it is her fate to make no real contacts with people, to live her life alone. <br />One day she meets a new customer, and this man is not of her people. He is an American, not Indian.  But he senses something about her, and she feels a connection to him, too. She cautiously strikes up a friendship with him, something that is forbidden, but as her past showed, Tilo was always reckless and never thought of the consequences. <br />As Tilo crosses the line over and over again, the clock starts ticking. What will finally happen to Tilo, because of her disobedience to the spice gods?  Does she dare to continue in her reckless behavior, as she had done in the past?  Or will she beg forgiveness, and stay content in living her life out as this old Indian woman, knowing no love or passion, only loneliness?<br />THE MISTRESS OF SPICES is a fantasy, mixed in with our contemporary world.  Once again Ms. Divakaruni writes with a lyrical pen, and creates a story a beautiful type of art. I found the reading fast and easy, and although half the story was pure fantasy, I found myself immersed in Tilo's anguish and sadness, as she deals with a life that she is not sure she wants.  It's a story about what is most important to one's life, and making painful decisions that could alter one's course for the better or worse.	2003-07-21

Caleb McCutcheon is a retired baseball player.  He would have been nominated into the Baseball Hall of Fame, if it hadn't been for an injury that cut his career short. Caleb has time to kill, and decides to invest his money (which he has plenty of) in an old ranch that was part of Indian-owned land in the Montana wilderness.  <br />Enter Pony Young Bear.  Born and raised on the reservations, she had gone away to college with the financial help of her lawyer brother Steve, and is now a teacher on the reservations.  She also takes in troubled children, who have nowhere to go because of varying hardships. This year, Pony has five young boys, all of whom live with her while she teaches them their lessons every day.  <br />When she finds out that she needs extra cash to buy school supplies in the fall, she is desperate to find decent work to help earn that money.  Word gets around that Caleb needs help on his new ranch, and Pony has experience with herding Buffalo. She proposes that she and her five boys work the ranch for the entire summer, giving the boys some experience and responsibilities, and at the same time allowing her to earn the money needed for the fall school semester.<br />Caleb, however, does not know that Pony is a woman.  He is in shock when he first sets eyes on her, and does not really believe she can do the job. But Pete, an old friend of Pony and Steve, convinces Caleb that Pony is his \\"man\\".  She brings along her five boys, and their adventures begin.<br />As Pony teaches Caleb the ins and outs of raising and herding buffalo, Caleb finds himself falling in love with her.  However, after a long talk about culture differences and how Pony feels that her Indian tribe is slowly becoming extinct due to intermarriages, Caleb is crushed.  How does one deal with issues of racial pride and intermarriages, when a man is desperately in love with a woman who believes in it?  <br />I always enjoy a romance with an unusual backdrop, and BUFFALO SUMMER fits the description.  Nadia Nichols does a good job of describing the beauty of the Montana wilderness, and learning about buffalo was a new one on me!  The story was well told and believable.  Thumbs up for BUFFALO SUMMER.	2003-07-20

Told in email format, we are introduced to Melissa Fuller, a young woman who works for a newspaper called the NEW YORK JOURNAL, is always late getting in to work, and in the opening chapter she is late once again, but with a good excuse!  Her neighbor was apparently knocked out cold by a would-be burglar, so Mel decides she needs to take care of the poor animals that were left behind while Mrs. Friedlander is being taken to the hospital (she is in a coma).  <br />This sounds like a somewhat serious plot, but it's not.  The book is one big gossip mill, with fellow employees and friends discussing Mel's problems, and as the book progresses, her adventures with \\"The Boy Next Door\\", John Trent, who she thinks is really Mrs. Friedlander's playboy nephew Max Friedlander.<br />Unfortunately (or fortunately), the two meet and fall in love. That is, John and Mel meet. But throughout their relationship, Mel thinks he's Max, as does everyone else, because no one has met the real Max, except for one of Mel's coworker's Dolly, and Dolly seems to miss out on the group gatherings where John (Max) are involved.  The REAL Max is vacationing somewhere in the Keys with Victoria's Secret model VIVICA (who also gets into the act and starts writing emails from Max's computer, of course using ALL CAPS, not knowing about email etiquette).<br />I haven't laughed this hard while reading a book in ages!  The plot itself was funny and twisted, but the email format makes the story that much more funny.  For those of you in the working world and familiar with emails from co-workers, Human Resources and bosses, this book is for you!  This is chicklit at it's finest but I don't think it should be relegated to just \\"chicks\\".  This reader gives THE BOY NEXT DOOR 5 stars!	2003-07-17

NAME DROPPING by Jane Heller<br />Jane Heller's NAME DROPPING is the tale of one average school teacher who discovers that there is yet another woman living in the same building with the exact same name, and finds that this other woman's life is a lot more fun and exciting and glamorous. What would it be like to live that sort of life?  <br />When Nancy Stern starts getting invitations to famous celebrity's homes, she knows something is not right. One invitation could have been a mistake, but getting mail on a regular basis that was definitely not HER mail was odd.  An American Express bill finally confirmed that there was another Nancy Stern in the building.  And this one was way out of her league.  The \\"famous\\" Nancy Stern was friend to the Stars. She interviewed them, and in turn was invited to gala events and had boyfriends with foreign sounding names such as \\"Jacques\\".  She was tall and glamorous and supposedly rich.<br />The \\"average\\" Nancy Stern was a preschool teacher who definitely did not go out on the town as regularly as the other Nancy Stern.  She spent many nights at home eating leftover pizza and watching television.  But when one of \\"glamorous\\" Nancy's many admirers calls and leaves a message, Nancy decides to follow up and goes on a blind date with him.  Bill has never met the Glamorous Nancy, but has a mutual friend, and being new to the city he seeks out Nancy on this blind date. What he does not know is that he ends up dating the \\"average\\" Nancy, and things start to get complicated as their relationship starts to blossom.  <br />As Nancy gets involved with Bill, other things begin to happen.  Her life is turned upside-down with a couple of attempted burglaries, a purse snatching and a murder!  She finds herself living a not-so-boring life and finds her own life in jeopardy.<br />NAME DROPPING was my second book by Jane Heller.  Not as good as FEMALE INTELLIGENCE, it still was a fun read and kept me hooked till the end.  As with all chick lit, itwas a book with a lot of action with some hard-to-believe scenes.  It's not real life, but a great escape.  This reader recommends NAME DROPPING.  A great beach read!	2003-07-17

CHEET is about a young woman who has one of the most interesting love lives I've read about in a long time.  She juggles many lovers by using separate colored cell phones to manage each person. At the height of this book, Kathryn, a London cabdriver by night, is dealing with five different lovers at the same time.  <br />She dates each one haphazardly, as she tries to find time for every one of them without getting them suspicious. Each lover has a distinct personality.  Jonny is the ex-rock and roll star who has fallen onto hard times.  Stef seems to be playing ball with the mobster crowd. Amy is her sexy lesbian journalist girlfriend.  Joel is her young stud muffin, barely in his early 20's.  Richard is a divorced man with a cute young daughter who both want to make Kathryn his one and only.  None of them know about one another, which leads to some very funny and exciting scenarios. <br />While Kathryn is working in her cab one night, she picks up a man that she finds of an immediate interest.  Does he become lover number six?  He doesn't, at least not immediately.  What happens between Kathryn and Craig is on a totally different level, and she soon finds out that he's not what he says he is.  That makes two of them, since Craig (or Twinkle as she calls him in her mind) does not know about all her lovers.  But he leads Kathryn to believe he's a very rich businessman, until one day when she finds out the truth!  <br />What makes CHEET stand out from the rest of the popular chic lit books out there? The first half of the book describes the hilarious antics that go on with Kathryn as she tries to make some sense of her chaotic dating world.  But, by the second half of the book, things start to fall apart.  It caught me by surprise, because what I thought would happen was that each lover would discover the other.  Instead, each of her relationships takes a turn, showing a darker side of life, including a death. <br />I recommend CHEET for its inventiveness and uniqueness in a world of same-old that is being seen out there in the genre of chic lit.  For those of you not totally into chic lit, this may be for you.  It is change of pace for those used to copycats of Bridget Jones' Diary and the Shopaholic novels.	2003-07-11

Barbara Delinsky paints a picture of life along the Monterey coast of California, where a middle-aged woman lays in a coma while her children, friends, and her ex-husband wait for her to awaken.<br />Jack McGill is a highly successful architect, designing resorts and casinos and other high-end projects.  His ex-wife Rachel is an artist, who moved to Monterey to seek the life she missed when she was married and living with Jack in San Francisco.  It is six years since their divorce, and now Jack is back to take care of Rachel, who was in a horrible car accident and now is in a coma.  Their two daughters Samantha and Hope are devastated, and are having a hard time adjusting to having dad back in their lives again.  Rachel's friends know about Jack, or at least they know Rachel's version of Jack, and they look at him with caution and suspicion.<br />But as Jack does all he can to support his daughters, and waits by his ex-wife's bedside, he looks back on all that has happened since Rachel left him, and through her friends, he slowly finds out why she had left him.  COAST ROAD is a story of memories and contemplation, as Jack finds out what is truly most important to him.  He juggles his priorities and makes new ones.  But most of all, he finds the family that he thought he had lost six years ago.<br />I have to admit COAST ROAD is not my favorite Barbara Delinsky book.  It is much different from the other books I've read by her so far.  While LAKE NEWS, ACCIDENTAL WOMAN and FLIRTING WITH PETE either have a mystery involved or have a lot of suspense, COAST ROAD has neither.  The main theme in COAST ROAD revolves around the marriage of Rachel and Jack, and what went wrong.  It's a book about making things right, and getting closure.  I didn't feel it was a fast read and it wasn't a  \\"can't put the book down\\" type of book.  However, as a fan of Barbara Delinsky and a fan of women's literature, COAST ROAD is not a bad book at all, and I did enjoy it.  As someone else here on Amazon put it, this is a love story, and I'm always up for reading one.  With that said,  I recommend reading this book.	2003-07-11

TALES OF THE CITY by Armistead Maupin is a story about a group of characters living in San Francisco during the late 1970's. Vietnam has just ended, disco is king (or queen?) and no one has yet heard of Aids.  <br />The book starts with the introduction of Mary Ann Singleton.  She's just moved to The City from Cleveland, Ohio, to the dismay of her parents.  We see the world of San Francisco through her eyes.  She first moves in with a good friend of hers.  Actually, she hadn't seen Connie since high school.  But she now lives in The City and so Mary Ann looks her up, hoping to find a place to live.  They become roommates, but after a few days of Connie, Mary Ann has had enough.  She eventually moves out and ends up living in an apartment complex at 28 Barbary Lane.  <br />The landlady is an older woman named Mrs. Madrigal, and she makes sure every one of her tenants feels right at home.  Mary Ann's first day there, she finds a note and a gift taped to her door, a rolled up joint.  It took some getting used to but Mary Ann soon feels right at home in her new surroundings. Life in the city was nothing like living in Cleveland!<br />TALES OF THE CITY covers the story of Mary Ann and her adventures in the City, but also introduces a ton of fun and outrageous characters, including Mouse (Michael) who becomes good friends with Mary Ann. He has his own set of problems, including boy troubles.  Mary Ann has to introduce him to her parents on the phone as \\"Michael is a homosexual\\" when Mom says, \\"...a strange man answered your phone.\\"  Beauchamp and Dede is a supposedly happy and successful couple, but upon closer look one sees a different story.  Beauchamp works with Mary Ann at her new job in The City, and his father is the big boss.  And Dede has her own problems, when she finds out her beloved Beauchamp may be fooling around! And Mrs. Madrigal gets involved with everyone's affairs, it seems, and is one of the central characters on Barbary Lane.  There are too many characters to list here, but all are unique and interesting in their own ways.<br />Reading TALES OF THE CITY for me was like jumping through a time warp and reliving an era in which I was a little bit too young to fully enjoy.  Growing up in the 70's, I was oblivious of what was going on in the adult world.  Yes, I listened to Disco, but that was probably it in terms of my exposure to all that was going on back then.  TALES OF THE CITY brings all that to life, and much more.  I finished the book with a smile on my face.  TALES reflected the happier times of a generation that was rebelling against authority and the government, while the rest of the world looked on. There is no real plot in this book, although the reader follows each of the characters own stories, hoping that they find what they are looking for.  I highly recommend TALES OF THE CITY and plan to read the entire series (Six books in all).	2003-06-14

Casey Ellis is a psychotherapist, and while her professional life is successful, her personal life is lacking.  Her main problem is dealing with a sad and bitter childhood and an absent father that passes away before she can make contact with him.  Her father, Dr. Cornelius \\"Connie\\" Unger, was a famous psychologist, and the book opens with Casey in attendance at his memorial service, although she was not invited.  All her life she has followed her father's career, and it is to his credit that she pursued the career that she did.  Despite her bitterness, she accepts the house that he wills to her upon his death, and she soon moves her office there.<br />The other woman in this novel is Jenny, but her story is told in a series of journals.  Casey finds these in her father's house, the house that she inherited upon his death, and as she finds each piece of the journal, she reads about a young woman who lives in fear for her life. According to the journals, Jenny lives alone in her father's house, while her father remains in jail for the murder of her mother.  She is a loner, and has been all of her life.  She tries to make a life for herself, but it is difficult for her, always feeling like the town outcast.  As she tries to move on with her life, she also knows that time is ticking. Her father is due to be released soon.  <br />While Casey reads about Jenny, she deals with her current situation of living at her father's spectacular townhouse.  She sees her patients there, some of whom seem to have problems that parallel hers.  She also becomes \\"friends\\" with Meg, a shy woman that was her father's housekeeper, and meets Jordan, her father's gorgeous gardener. At the same time, she dealswith her mother who has been in a coma for a long time, and Casey visits her every day, hoping that her mother will awaken.  <br />Without giving much away, the two stories of Casey's life and Jenny's life come together into one big climax at the end of the book.  They merge into one story, which at first does not seem to be possible, but clues are left here and there, allowing the reader to figure out what common ground both stories may have.  <br />FLIRTING WITH PETE was a book choice for my online book club, and I have to say that there were many differing views on this novel.  Half the group did not care for it, and preferred Delinsky's older style of writing.  I personally loved the book. What I loved about the story was that Delinsky was looking more into the reasons why the characters did what they did, as opposed to focusing on pure action.  Yes, there is a lot of action in this book, but I don't feel it is the main point of the story.  Delinsky was trying to tell the story of a man who did not know how to love his own daughter, and because of his fears, created a series of actions that brought Casey to where she was today.  It's a psychological thriller, to some extent, and I hope others like me will enjoy this novel.  I recommend this novel, more to first time readers of Barbara Delinsky. For veteran readers of her works, I want to warn them that this may not be the novel they are expecting.	2003-06-14

When Tomasu's village is pillaged and his family and other villagers are left for dead, Lord Otori saves young Tomasu's life and takes him away to his home in Hagi.  He is given a new name, Takeo, and a new identity, and Lord Otori decides to adopt him, despite the fact that Takeo was raised by the Hidden, a group of people who worship a new god and have been persecuted for doing so.  <br />Lord Otori and Takeo develop a bond, and Takeo pledges his loyalty to Otori for saving his life.  However, life does not get any easier under the protection of Lord Otori, for those who killed the people in Takeo's village are on the lookout for the young man, who had killed Lord Iida Sadamu's men while trying to protect himself.  Lord Iida wants revenge.<br />Takeo becomes mute after being witness to the massacre, and while his ability to speak is temporarily taken away from him, he notices that his hearing becomes very acute.  He can hear the faintest of sounds that probably only a dog can hear.  In fact, he is teased by one of Otori's friends, indicating his ears are as good as a dog's. Takeo is embarrassed by these accusations, but learns later that his unusual talents will come in handy. <br />Lord Otori introduces Takeo to Kenji, who discovers Takeo's talents and learns right away that Takeo is not just a product of the Hidden People, but is in fact one of the Tribe, a group of warriors that have almost magical powers.  The excellent hearing is just one of the traits that they carry, and Kenji helps Takeo learn other skills that are inherited by his father's people.  Kenji is in fact training Takeo to become a warrior.  This upsets Takeo, as he has learned while being part of the Hidden that killing is wrong, and nothing good will come of it.<br />In the mean time, Lord Otori is betrothed to a young girl named Kaede. Her father's enemies many years ago had taken her hostage.  In order to bring peace to several countries, she is commanded to marry Otori.  What she does not know is that Otori is secretly in love with someone else, Lady Maruyama, who is the most powerful woman in Japan. Lady Maruyama's feelings for Lord Otori are mutual.  However, due to political reasons, it is Lady Maruyama's duty to bring her cousin Lady Kaede to Lord Otori to be married.<br />As one can already see, ACROSS THE NIGHTINGALE FLOOR takes on epic proportions, as Lord Otori and his entourage make the journey to Lord Iida's land where the wedding will take place.  They encounter adventures along the way, and Takeo hones his skills of the master warriors of the Tribe, despite his abhorrence for killing.  His main focus is his loyalty to Lord Otori, a loyalty that will be put to the test before their journey is completed.  A story that compares to the likes of CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON and LORD OF THE RINGS, ACROSS THE NIGHTINGALE FLOOR is a book that will be enjoyed by young adults as well as older readers who enjoy historical based fiction with a touch of fantasy.	2003-06-12

Liz Ames is a family counselor living in Missouri, who finds a message on her answering machine from her sister the Pastor Rachel Howard.  The message wasn't your ordinary every day message.  Rachel sounded like she was in trouble, as if her life depended on getting through to Liz.<br />The police enter the scene, but they don't seem to be of any help, so Liz packs her bags and heads over to Florida.  She wants to see if she can find any clues to where her sister could be.  Liz finds tons of them, and she soon knows that her sister met with foul play, but no matter what she says, the police aren't buying it.  She also meets up with others that knew the Pastor, but they end up missing too.  The more Liz snoops into this mystery, the more dangerous things start to look.<br />While this is going on, a VP at a local bank is found dead, and a co-worker ends up missing as well.  Dead bodies start to crop up every time Liz thinks she's on to something, and the action doesn't stop. <br />I'm leaving out many details on purpose, so as not to give away the plot, but I want to say that I really enjoyed reading this book.  The only problem I had was the two very extremes that the author used to tell the story of good and evil.  The Church versus the Devil is such an old used theme, and although the story in itself was very exciting and had me on edge, I didn't appreciate revisiting themes that I had enough of in the past.  <br />Despite my negative comments, I am recommending DEAD RUN by Erica Spindler. It's an action-packed book from start to finish.	2003-06-11

Five women who live in the same neighborhood become life-long friends in ANGRY HOUSEWIVES EATING BON BONS, Lorna Landviks latest novel.  If you loved PATTY JANES HOUSE OF CURL, you will certainly love BON BONS.  Both books are very different, yet they have a distinctive Landvik flavor.<br />As the story opens, we are introduced to the women, who are sitting in a hospital room visiting Slip, who is one of the members of the Angry Housewives Eating Bon Bons book club.  The other members reminisce about their pasts: Audrey, the sexy one; Merit, the shy and beautiful one; Faith, the one with the many secrets; Kari, the older of the 5 women, widowed at a very young age. In this prologue, the reader is very aware that Slip is ill, and her friends watch vigilant, crying their eyes out.  <br />From there, we move back to the past, when Faith Owens first encountered some of the other ladies on the block known as Freesia Court.  Faith, who was still getting used to living in the cold Minnesota winter, finds herself without her husband one cold night, because he is out of town on business (again) and so shes left to fend for herself and her twins, Beau and Bonnie (mere babies).  All of a sudden, the power goes out and shes left in the dark.  As she freaks out, worrying about being attacked by a burglar, she notices that there are some of the neighborhood women playing outside in the cold snow: Four of them, in fact.  And to her horror, they are playing with snowballs and throw one right at her window, as she is looking out at them.  She goes outside to have a talk with them, but for some reason she decides to join in their fun, and before she knows it, shes having the best time ever.  <br />After their snowball fight, Faith invites the women into her new home, the first time shes ever entertained therein Minnesota, and from that point her friendship with these women begins.  And soon, they start a book club, where they meet once a month to share munchies, discuss books, but mainly to find an excuse to get together.  <br />Each chapter starts off with the book of the month, the book moderator for that month, and the reason why the book was chosen. Each womans personality comes across on those first few lines, and it becomes more apparent as the reader gets to know each of the five women better.  The five grow together, along with their children, and they go through myriads of events.  They cry together, and they laugh together.  They even fight together.  But the bottom line is, they are friends through everything, and they experience and grow with the changing times, from the 1960s to the 21st century.  <br />There isnt one main plot in ANGRY HOUSEWIVES EATING BON BONS. However, there are many subplots, each one involving each of the five members of the club.  I found that each story was interesting enough on its own, but they each added to the overall book about the friendships of these five women.  I recommend this to everyone who likes a good womens lit book.  Its probably not for everyone, but anyone who enjoyed THE SAVING GRACES by Patricia Gaffney will most likely enjoy this one!	2003-06-09

CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC by Sophie Kinsella<br />Now, THIS was entertaining reading!  Sophie Kinsella introduces the character of Rebecca Bloomswood in the first of a series of wonderfully funny books about a Shopaholic, in this case Rebecca.  Rebecca is totally hopeless. She's living totally beyond her means, doing all she can to work as little as possible to make time for those shopping sprees, and finds herself deeper and deeper in debt.  It sounds pathetic, but seeing it all through her eyes makes the whole situation funny. <br />Rebecca doesn't seem to have a clue how bad off she really is, and she lives her life enjoying what she does best: shopping.  It's an ironic twist that she's employed as a financial journalist by the magazine Successful Saving.  She fakes her way through her assignments, and somehow ends up doing press conferences for her boss, along with other financial journalists and experts, and still manages to spend hundreds of pounds a day on frivolous things such as a pen to help keep track of her expenses. And she seems to have impeccable taste.  Only designer clothes for her! It is no wonder her boss possibly thinks she's come into an inheritance, as there is no way she could live the she does on the salary she makes!<br />CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC is a very light read, but I found it was done so well that I highly recommend it.  I would like to compare this book to the Bridget Jones Diary series, as the main character in SHOPAHOLIC is as compulsive as Bridget was.  As I too was once a shopaholic, (I should say I am a recovering shopaholic), I was able to relate to nearly every purchase Rebecca made using all of her cherished credit cards.  Making excuses and justifying purchases, I felt it was funny, but yet scary at the same time, as I watched her dig herself deeper into debt. And Rebecca is a character you really learn to love.  She can drive you nuts, but she does find redemption by the end of the book.  I'm looking forward to readingthe rest of the series!	2003-06-05

In this book, Rick \\"Lucky\\" Hawkins is a professional racecar driver, who visits his father Clint and new wife Pam in Texas.  During the drive to the Jarrett Ranch where his father and Pam now live, he listens to the radio and hears the most beautiful voice.  What he does not know but finds out soon is that this voice belongs to Pam's younger cousin, Audra Jarrett.  He falls in love with this voice, while at the same time Audra hears stories of Clint's son Rick, and she instantly formulates an opinion of him, and it's not favorable.  <br />Audra is recovering from a horrific accident in which her date lost his life and she is paying for it with an injured leg and a string of nightmares.  When Audra and Rick finally meet, they clash, partly because of Audra's past history of rejection and tragedy.  Her fear to trust and make commitments is evident, and Rick does all he can to make her change her opinion of him.  <br />In the meantime, while Audra watches Pam and Clint in their newfound happiness, she finds herself slowly being caught up in the person that is Rick Hawkins. And amidst family turbulence that makes the Hatfields and McCoys seem like a day in the park, Rick and Audra work together to help Audra and the Jarretts come to terms with a tragedy that happened decades ago.  <br />Thumbs up for HOME TO COPPER MOUNTAIN.  This was yet another well-written romance, with a plot that was different from the usual \\"boy meets girl\\" themes.  I would definitely read another book by Rebecca Winters.	2003-06-05
1102419:US	51214937	R27ZPJBSNJLFP5	0373711263	291457897	No Ordinary Child (Harlequin Superromance No. 1126)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Mentally Challenged Child brings together two lonely people	NO ORDINARY CHILD by Darlene Graham<br />In this Harlequin Superromance by Darlene Graham, a 10-year old mentally challenged girl helps bring together two lonely people in NO ORDINARY CHILD.  Sam Solomon is a successful architect who has a fulltime career in Oklahoma, while his daughter Meggie lives with her mother in California.  Because Meggie has the developmental skills of a 3-year old, she lives with her mother full time, making it easier for Sam to pursue his career dreams.  Unfortunately Andrea, Meggie's mother and Sam's ex-wife, learns she has cancer and cannot care for Meggie on her own until the chemo and radiation treatments are over.  Sam has no choice but to take over the childcare, but he's in the middle of a very important project. His career is very important to him, and with his workaholic schedule, he does not have time to take on a child like Meggie fulltime.<br />Sam's mother Gayle steps in and finds a young woman named Christy Lane to help out. Christy is currently the part time nanny for another family and works part time at a Wal-Mart to supplement her income. But Gayle Solomon finds a way to convince Christy to quit both her jobs and help Sam out for a while, at least until Andrea is able to take Meggie back.  Promised fulltime work as Meggie's new nanny, Christy agrees. It would be a little more income, and would give her more time to work on her music, as she is an aspiring songwriter waiting for her big break.<br />Christy starts work with Meggie, and finds that Sam's home is not the environment she thinks is best suited for a growing family.  It is cold and sterile, lacking warmth in a home that should have exuded warmth and comfort.  But Christy fixes that, and Sam slowly notices a change in his house, as she brings to Sam and Meggie something that was missing from their lives - a women's touch. <br />One thing Sam doesn't know is that Christy remembers Sam from a previous life.  Christy had the biggest crush on Sam when they were in high school, but he didn't even know she existed!<br />I enjoyed NO ORDINARY CHILD.  It was well written and the characters were believable.  I also felt that the character of Meggie was portrayed in an honest fashion, and seemed very realistic and true to life. The plot line focused a lot on Meggie and how Christy tried to correct some behavioral problems that Meggie developed over the years, instead of focusing only on the romance between Christy and Sam.  This was definitely a plus for me, as it was again not the stereotypical romance novel that we've seen for the past 20 or 30 years.  Thumbs up for NO ORDINARY CHILD.	2003-06-02

The story takes place in late 20th Century India.  Anju and Sudha are two cousins who are born on the same day and are raised as sisters by their mothers and Aunt.  Both of their fathers died before they were born, but their \\"mothers\\" Pishi, Nalini and Gouri raise them up to be proper girls, making sure they get an education and are made ready as marriage material when the time comes.<br />The two girls are different as night and day.  Anju is plain while Sudha is beautiful.  Anju is the bookworm, whose dream is to manage her mother's bookstore when she is of age. Sudha's dreams involve designing clothes and becoming famous.  The two are inseparable despite their differences, until Sudha finds out about a horrible family secret that changes everything that came before.  With this secret weighing deep in her heart, Sudha withdraws and changes, and refuses to tell Anju what is wrong. And when Sudha is told that she has been arranged to marry a man she does not love, her life turns for the worse.  Anju's marriage takes her far away to America, and soon their lives seem to be on different paths.  But despite the distance and the secrets that they hide, their love binds them, as the reader will find out.<br />For a trip to modern day India and a wonderful story of sisterly love, read SISTER OF MY HEART.  The book had plenty of Indian fables and myths and traditions, along with plot twists and mysteries that will keep the reader wanting more.  When I finished this book, I did not want it to end.  I am glad to know that there is a sequel, THE VINE OF DESIRE, which I am looking forward to reading soon.  Thumbs up for SISTER OF MY HEART.	2003-06-02
1103690:US	51214937	R3LM2A1PFQYTSE	158567074X	384058796	Frida	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A creative take on the life of Frida Kahlo	FRIDA by Barbara Mujica<br />Here's another of the many books out there today about the life of Frida Kahlo, the famous artist and personality from Mexico.  In this version of her life, Barbara Mujica tells a fictional version of the story from the viewpoint of her sister Cristina, whose claim to fame is that she is the sister who had the affair with Diego Rivera, who at the time was Frida's husband.  <br />Cristina narrates the story of her life with Frida Kahlo as she lies on a bed talking to a nameless psychiatrist.  The reason for him analyzing her is not known and not revealed until the very end of the book.  In the mean time, the reader gets a vision of a woman that is torn between love and resentment toward a famous sibling that has always gotten more than enough attention. Although Cristina was obviously not at the scene for many of the events told in this book, she claims that she can easily imagine how things happened to Frida. Every major event from Frida developing polio to her horrific trolley car accident, Diego and Kahlo's wedding to Frida's pregnancies, all are accounted for in this story.  However, many fictional events have also been included, with fictional characters to go along with it.  Mujica's purpose for this book is to give the reader a general picture of what life with Frida Kahlo may have been like, and how a sibling may have felt, living in the shadow of such an outrageous attention-seeking person. <br />I enjoyed FRIDA, but always kept in mind that this is indeed a work of fiction.  It is not exactly known how Frida died, nor is it known what type of relationship she may have had with her sisters, especially with Cristina. That said, I treated this book as pure entertainment, and not as the bible on the life of Frida Kahlo. For a more accurate account of her life, Kahlo aficionados recommend the biography by Herrera Hayden.	2003-06-01

The story opens with Susan Hayes finding her husband in bed with a young girl who is so young she could be her own daughter.  This is a great scene in which Susan kicks him out of the house after helping him pack up some of his clothes and toiletries (what she does with his bottle of cologne I thought was ingenious!). It sets the tone of the book -- although the themes in the book are sometimes dark, the narrator tells the story with a sense of humor.<br />To help rebuild her life, Susan and her daughter Beth go back to Sullivan's Island where Susan's sister Maggie still lives in the house where they grew up in, but now with her own husband and children. As Susan spends time with her sister, they reminisce about their childhood, and the crazy days they had with their father who was abusive and had a hot temper that scared all the Hamilton children.  They remember their mother who was so depressed she often did not get out of bed.  And how could they forget their crazy brothers who always helped them get into mischief. Childhood tales abound in this novel, along with parallel stories taking place in the present.<br />SULLIVAN'S ISLAND is told in flashbacks, allowing the reader to find out slowly what really happened all those years ago when Susan and Maggie's father died. Ku Klux Klan and other fixtures of the Deep South are interwoven with their family history, and Susan obsesses on whether or not her father died of natural causes or foul play. Set in the beautiful area of South Carolina known as the Low Country, Dorothea Benton Frank's debut novel captures the essence of what life on Sullivan's Island and the rest of the Low Country is like.  It also depicts life of an era gone by, where innocence was more common than corruption, and when the focus was more on family and friends than monetary gain or careers.  <br />Despite what looks to be a glowing review, I had a difficult time with this book.  There was something about the way the book was written that made it difficult to finish.  I felt it was dragging in some parts and could not wait for the book to end.  On the other hand, I enjoyed the snippets of life in the Low Country, and the mystery behind Susan Hayes' father's death.  I just did not find myself caring whether I finished this book or not. I also found I didn't care too much about what happened to the characters. <br />I also felt that the author wrapped up the story too fast.  Things turned around for Susan much too fast for me, and I found it hard to believe she landed herself such a great job at the end of the book.  It seemed way too easy for me.  Also, the characterizations of the children did not seem real to me. For these reasons I am giving this book a 3 star rating, but I have heard many good things about her next book PLANTATION, her follow up to SULLIVAN'S ISLAND.  I plan on reading that book soon.	2003-05-28

The novel takes place in 14th century Persia, during the days of the Ottoman Empire, and initially centers on the daughter of a Jewish woman living in the Jewish quarters, a life full of poverty and suffering.  Rebekah is the daughter of this woman, and her mother sells her as a bride to a man called Jacob the Fatherless, thinking this will be a way to save her daughter from the same fate as hers.<br />Unfortunately, Jacob treats Rebekah as his property and creates a living hell for the young girl, who is barely 10 years old upon their marriage.  She never sees her mother again, and is trapped with Jacob to live out the rest of her life.  Before Rebekah goes to live with Jacob however, she hears a voice of a stranger, never sees his face, and thinks this is the man that her mother has promised her to marry.  Her dreams are shattered once she marries Jacob, but she will never forget that voice. She carries the memory through her days of suffering under the house of Jacob, who abuses her and nearly kills her.  Upon the birth of their daughter Gold Dust, Jacob brands Rebeka with a hot poker, angry that this child is not a son.  He starts to believe that this child is not his child at all, accusing Rebekah of adultery, and treats the child the way he treats Rebekah.<br />Rebekah, like her mother before her, wants only the best for her child, and through bravery and cunning, she finds a way to give Gold Dust that life.  Eventually, the young girl makes her way into the Shah's harem, and their lives are changed forever.<br />Ms. Mossanen paints a vivid picture of a fantastical life of 14th century Persia.  Part fantasy, part history, HAREM is a book that if nothing else, will stir up the reader's interest in a life that is totally different from that of the Western World.  She places a few historical events into the storyline, along with a few historical figures such as Timurlane, but there is a lot of fantasy mixed in as well.  A very enjoyable piece of historical fiction, this reviewer gives HAREM an enthusiastic thumbs up.	2003-05-20

As with FINGERSMITH, I came away from AFFINITY with a very satisfied feeling of having read yet another great book.  AFFINITY is a complex story set in Victorian England about a young woman, Margaret Prior, who has been suffering from bouts of depression and loneliness. She has just suffered from a breakdown shortly after her father's death, and because of a suicide attempt, her mother, with the hopes of making a full recovery keeps her secluded in the house and administered with medications.<BR> <BR>When it is suggested that Margaret visit the local woman's gaol (prison) as a form of therapy, she agrees and begins her frequent visits.  She is known as a \\"lady visitor\\", one of many that come to the prisons to read and talk to the prisoners as a form of goodwill and charity.  Soon she finds herself meeting and conversing with the various women that are being held in this gaol.  She meets women from all walks of life and sees the horrible conditions in which they now live.  And then she meets Selina Dawes. Margaret takes extra notice of this quiet sad woman. The reader immediately knows that she finds Selina special, and soon she becomes obsessed with the prisoner, and her story.  It is all she can think of day and night. It becomes her life.<br />Selina Dawes is a medium, who is able to talk to the dead and perform acts of the paranormal.  She is in prison due to the death of a friend of hers, Mrs. Brink, who allowed Selina to live with her as she helped Mrs. Brink contact the netherworld.  Mrs. Brink died during one of Selina's paranormal sessions, and is being charged for assault and fraud.  Learning about Selina's \\"crime\\", Margaret is in total sympathy with Selina and knows that Selina is in prison for a crime she did not commit, and soon the two become close.<br />The viewpoints of both womenare seen through the journals of each of them respectively.  Selina's journal-entries lead to the day of the supposed crime, while Margaret's journal takes us through the present story.  And, as the book becomes more and more complicated, the journals begin to reveal more and more secret thoughts of these two women. The ending, as with FINGERSMITH, will totally shock the reader.  Sarah Waters is the master of the double-twisted plot device, and although the story started on a slow note, the pace of the book picked up and did not let up until the very last page.  Beautifully written with subtle undertones of lesbianism, this reviewer highly recommends AFFINITY.	2003-05-18

Maggie Walsh (Garvan) was a happily married woman, married to Paul Garvan for many years, when she suddenly realizes that they weren't really as happy as she thought.  The opening line explains that she has just left her husband, and in flashbacks she tells the story of her marriage to Paul (or Garv, as she calls him).  Told in a somewhat sarcastic/light hearted tone of voice, Maggie goes over the events that led to the ultimate low point of their marriage, and why she finally decided to leave him, at least for now.  <br />Maggie, who is usually conservative by nature, at least compared to her crazy sisters, shocks everyone by announcing she is going to Los Angeles to live there for a month with one of her best friends, Emily. She leaves her husband, family and friends in Ireland, and makes that big trip to California.<br />Maggie's stay in Southern California is one of the craziest times of her life.  She parties, she meets new men, she lies out on the beach, and she slowly forgets about Garv, sort of.  In the mean time, she finds out how much fun she can have while being single, but it doesn't last. <br />In the mean time, Emily is working on that very important movie script, and it's her last chance at a life in Hollywood.  The antics and schemes that they go through to get this script bought are almost as hysterical as an \\"I Love Lucy\\" show. And when Maggie's family decides to take advantage of the situation and come down to Southern California for an impromptu vacation, things really get funny.<br />ANGELS is my introduction to the writing of Marian Keyes, and I have heard a lot of positive things about her.  Unfortunately, ANGELS is probably not one of her best works, as so many of these same people have told me.  My main gripe with the book is that although the story was entertaining and funny, I found that itwent on and on, and sometimes i felt it wasn't going anywhere.  I think this book could have been cut short a bit, but overall, it was an enjoyable fluff read. I don't recommend ANGELS as an introductory book to the world of Marian Keyes, but it is a fun book nonetheless.	2003-05-11

(Harlequin Superromance No. 1124)	Books	4	7	7	N	N	An abandoned child helps bring love to a lonely woman	VITAL SIGNS by Bobby Hutchinson (Harlequin Superromance)<br />Hailey is a pediatric nurse who has been yearning for children of her own for a long time.  But, although Hailey seems to be popular among the children at the hospital, Hailey feels she's out of her league when it comes to dating.  She feels that no guy would want to go out with her, feels very unattractive, and the few dates she's had over the years never amounted to much.<br />Then, Hailey meets Roy, a social worker who is put on the case of a young boy who was abandoned by his mother and is sent to the hospital, barely breathing and holding on to life.  Hailey happens to be the nurse that is in charge of David Rigg's recovery, and she is immediately introduced to Roy.<br />Hailey not only falls in love with little David, who she desperately wants to take home with her and be his foster mother, but she also falls in love with the social worker.  Their relationship starts out on a professional foot, but with the help of Roy's sister Nicole, who decides to play matchmaker, Hailey and Roy become more than just professional associates!<br />I found VITALS SIGNS by Bobby Hutchinson to be one of the best harlequins superromances I've read in the past 6 months.  As a novel, the book was well written.  Its characters are likeable and believable, and I was very happy with the ending.  But I also enjoyed the storyline and it was one of those books that I wanted to keep reading, to find out what was going to happen. Although labeled as a romance, I believe the central story line and the most important subplot of this book was the story of David, the little boy that was abandoned by his mother, and how the love of two strangers helped to make David's life a little better.	2003-05-06

Full of quirky characters, it takes place in Purvis, Mississippi, a stereotypical small rural town.  In the opening chapter, we are introduced to Willem Fremont, a successful businessman who also suffers from extreme panic attacks. He is on his way to Purvis to find his childhood home, in the hopes of remembering what caused him to have these panic attacks to begin with. So bad are these attacks that he finds himself sometimes fainting, or reacting in a manner that only an insane person would react.  In this scene, Willem is having a meal at a roadside restaurant, and a paper crown dangling from the doorway of the restaurant is starting to make him crazy. As this paper crown continues to move with the wind that is blowing from outside, he can only hold it in for so long when he suddenly runs to the door and starts to scream.  This is just one of his typical attacks.  The oddest movement or thought will set him off, and he has no way to control it. <br />In the meantime, the Till family back in Purvis are going about their every day lives.  They are the family that happen to live on the land that is next to Willems old family plot, but decades ago the land was abandoned for reasons unknown.  The Tills began to pay the taxes on this property, so now the descendants have legal rights to it.  It is this land that Willem Fremont is in search of.<BR> <BR>The Tills comprise of Bruno and Sonny, brothers both of whom live on this land.  Sonny lives with their mother Eilene, and to Eilenes disappointment, Sonny doesnt know the meaning of the word work.  He lies around all day, eating and working on a boat that he thinks will help him make some sort of living.  Bruno is a Vietnam War vet and he too sits around all day, claiming that a neck injury prevents him from doing anything, including sex.  His wife Leahtakes care of their farm, looking after the cattle and their crops.  She has no choice, as there is no one else that will do it.  And brother-in-law Sonny does everything he can to get out of doing any of the work on the farm.<BR> <BR>Leah becomes a pivotal character when she falls into a ravine while in search of a missing cow, and there she finds a whole new world, including the missing cow and a house that had been abandoned years ago.  She returns to this place often, and it is one of the places where the worlds of the Tills and Willem Fremont collide. <br />It would take too long to fully describe all the characters and the various sub plots of WILLEMS FIELD.  However, Id like to state that although it took me a while to fully get into the book, by the third chapter or so I was fully absorbed in the lives of the Tills and poor Willems panic attacks.  It isnt apparent in the beginning, but there is a point to this book, despite the different storylines that weave in and out of the story.  Once I completed reading the book, I was able to say that this was probably one of the best books Ive read in 2003.	2003-05-04

She was not financially rich by any means, but she could vouch that her family was a happy one, and her marriage was solid and full of love and laughter.  There wasn't anything she felt she lacked monetarily, and this was important to her, since throughout their marriage they had to prove to their parents that they could indeed make it financially on the type of dreams they were shooting for. She knew she was the envy of others, and would never have thought that this world that she was familiar with was about to come crashing down around her. <br />The book opens to a scene with Rachel sitting alone in her bedroom, wallowing in self-pity as she watches old home movies of her husband and her daughter Kate laughing and smiling.  It is a movie of happier times, before the baby was born, and before their daughter Kate started to change right before their eyes. <br />The reader knows immediately that there is something terribly wrong, as she is sitting in her bedroom alone in the dark.  Her husband no longer lives with her, and their daughter has not lived with them in quite a while.  All that is left in her life is baby Josh, and he is far too young to comprehend that anything is wrong with their family.<BR> <BR>The destructive events that occur that destroy the harmony of the family are centered on Kate, who by this time is a young teenager going through a lot of extreme emotional and behavioral changes.  Rachel is told that this is just a phase all teenagers go through, and Rachel believes it for a while, but when Kate's behavior becomes so hard to manage, Rachel is not sure what to think anymore. <br />The book is told in parallel - we see flashbacks of her courtship with her husband Ned and their early years together in New York.  At the same time we are back in the present day, where Ned and Rachel are worrying about the future of their daughter Kate, who is in an institution for troubled young adults.  I felt this method of story-telling helped keep the action moving, and kept my interest in the characters alive as I got to know them starting from their younger years together and through their current messed up lives.<br />The climax of events leads to a horrible accident that could have been prevented, and that event in turn leads to yet another horrible incident that causes the break up of the family.  It is a living nightmare that they are going through, and no one knows if there is any relief in sight.<br />FAMILY HISTORY by Dani Shapiro is a book that was so intense that it was probably the fastest read I've had in a long time.  It's one of those books that you can't put down.  I want to compare this book to Elizabeth Berg's best novels, which often center on strong women or women who are trying to find themselves and make new lives for themselves.  In FAMILY HISTORY, we have a woman that thought her love was strong enough to deal with any obstacle, but finds her love is tested because of a child that is ill. I'm giving this an enthusiastic thumbs up, and am willing to read any other book that has been penned by Dani Shapiro.	2003-04-30

The bulk of the story takes place in Clanton, Mississippi, Ray Atlees hometown and the place where his father had made a name for himself as the powerful judge of Clanton.  As he is waiting to die, Judge Atlee draws up a will to declare that the estate will be divided evenly between the two brothers, Ray and Forrest, with Ray being the executor.<br />However, when Ray arrives at the old plantation house, he finds his father dead. Ray also finds a huge stash of money in the house along with the will, but there is nothing in the will that indicates who the money goes to.  With Forrests history of drug and alcohol abuse, Ray does not want to let Forrest, or anyone else, know about the money.<br />From here the action begins.  Ray finds that someone is after his money and the threats become bigger and more surprising. Ray is on the run, going back and forth between his own home in Virginia to the estate in Mississippi, all the while dealing with his brother Forrest, and at the same time trying to find out the mystery of the money.<br />This was my first Grisham novel, and I have to say, I wasnt that impressed. I know hes been on the best-seller lists for years, but apparently this book was not one of his better ones.  I cannot imagine him becoming a popular author based on the quality of this novel.  The story was interesting, but there was something lacking. Ive been told that his earlier novels were much better, and to give him another chance.  THE SUMMONS is definitely not the definitive Grisham, so those of you who read this novel as your first taste of Grisham, you may want to try one of his earlier books to sample the master at his best.	2003-04-27

DALLOWAY by Virginia Woolf, I decided to tackle Michael Cunningham's THE HOURS.  Despite the fact that I did not enjoy MRS. DALLOWAY as much as I'd hoped to, I thoroughly enjoyed THE HOURS.  Michael Cunningham twists the original book by Woolf into a modern day version of the same, but he adds the story of Virginia Woolf herself, writing the original book MRS. DALLOWAY.  By changing the original characters slightly, and using a different series of crises, he creates an original story that totally threw me at the end of the book.<br />I am not going to go into the details, but wanted to comment that while reading the book I first found it only ordinary, and did not understand why it won the Pulitzer in the first place.  By the end of the novel, I clearly understood why it was such a brilliant piece of writing.  I highly recommend this book, but with a warning: please be patient and do not criticize too highly the fact that he took an original classic and twisted it around.	2003-04-20
1158145:US	51214937	R1QS7K18HJ46S0	0312195516	226874686	The Red Tent	Books	4	6	9	N	Y	Fictional story of a biblical character	The Red Tent by Anita Diamont<br />One of the more popular historical fictions of the past few years, THE RED TENT by Anita Diamont is the story of one of the lesser known of Jacob's many children, Dinah. Dinah is only mentioned in a few chapters of the book of Genesis.  However, while her brothers took a more prominent role in the Old Testament, in THE RED TENT the character of Dinah is given prominence. Her story is told in epic-like fashion that spans several decades, starting from her childhood with her four mothers and her father Jacob, to her days as a woman living in a foreign land.  The story of Dinah is the story of what it was like to be a woman thousands of years ago.<br />I am not an expert in the history of this time period, nor am I an expert of the Bible.  I cannot say whether any of the historical facts are accurate, and whether Anita Diamont followed the bible (she obviously didn't, if she decided to extrapolate and create a fictional life about Dinah, daughter of Jacob).  THE RED TENT, however, is more of a celebration of being a woman than it is a story of a biblical character from the bible. While most of the stories in the bible are focused on strong men, it is refreshing to read a story about a biblical character that is female and who overcomes many hardships to create a life for herself.  THE RED TENT was not my favorite book read in 2002, but I can say that it was one of the more unique and interesting books read that year.	2003-04-15

Fortune's Rocks by Anita Shreve<br />Every year the Biddeford's spend the summer months vacationing at a beachside resort in New Hampshire.  Their summer home at Fortune's Rocks becomes the center of their lives among the upper class during these summer months.  This year however, events that occur that summer cut their vacation short and many lives are ruined.  In FORTUNE'S ROCKS by Anita Shreve, the reader is transported back in time to the turn of the century, and to a young girl's first steps into the world of adults.  What she does that summer changes her life and the life of her family forever.<br />The story opens with fifteen-year old Olympia Biddeford walking along the beach at Fortune's Rocks.  She's out where common decency does not allow her to go, near the bathhouses among the men and boys who watch her as she walks by. She is no longer a child, and as she walks by the men, she senses that she is being eyed in a different light.  She feels the power that she has as a woman, and the reader senses that she is quite pleased with this effect on the men.<br />She does not attend school, but has been home-schooled for years by her father, who has taught her everything from literature to science.  One of their passions is reading, and he encourages her to read a book written by a doctor, John Haskell.  Haskell is to be the guest of honor at a dinner party they are hosting, and her father is quite anxious to show off his daughter by having her read and critique the book.  She is not interested at all, until she sets eyes upon Haskell for the first time.  <br />What happens between Olympia and John Haskell, who is married with children and nearly three times her senior, shocks the small resort town of Fortune's Rocks.  This plot line, plus the flowing writing style of Anita Shreve, helped me read this book in record time.  I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, and although I was not totally happy with the ending of the book, which I found a little bit contrived, I amstill recommending this book.  This was my first Anita Shreve book but it certainly will not be my last.	2003-04-14

I remember reading a number of harlequin books written by her when I first started reading them back in the late 70s and early 80s, and was pleasantly surprised to see that she is still writing them.  <br />In SARAHS BABY, we are introduced to Sarah Dempsey, a young woman who is living a life of guilt and anguish, due to a pregnancy at the age of 15 and the fact that her baby supposedly had died at childbirth.  The reason for her anguish is not only because of the loss of her child, but because the father of the child is not allowed to be told.  The father is her childhood sweetheart, Kyall McQueen, and because of his authoritarian grandmother Ruth McQueen, Sarah is forced to keep this secret to herself and to move away from her home.  Only Sarahs mother knows of this baby, other than Ruth.  It is a secret that probably killed Sarahs mother, and has kept Sarah from returning to Koomeras Crossing.<br />Along with Ruth, there are other Mcqueens to contend with.  Enid and Max are Kyalls parents, and Enid seems to be following in her mothers footsteps, a meeker version of Ruth.  Max, on the other hand, is a sweetheart but is dominated by the McQueen women, and has no influence whatsoever on anything that happens in the household, or on the huge ranch in the middle of the Australian outback where they all live.<br />Sarah returns home to the town of Koomera Crossing upon the death of her mother, and soon she is there to stay.  She is reunited with Kyall, to the dismay of the Mcqueen women and also to a young woman who had been promised Kyalls hand in marriage by Ruth.  But Sarah doesnt want anything to do with the McQueens, including Kyall.  She is still haunted by the memories of her baby, and of the love for Kyall that never went away.<br />Im giving thumbs up to SARAHS BABY. Although I did findthe prologue a little dry for my personal tastes, and the first few chapters I found were a little slow, once I got into the book I couldnt wait to finish it.  The big mystery is what happened to Sarahs baby, but Ill let the reader find out for herself. The next installment to the books in the Koomera Crossing series will be coming out later this year.	2003-04-14
1159584:US	51214937	R2LVKF55KJF0MP	0385722206	749687762	Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress: A Novel	Books	4	20	26	N	N	A Modern Classic	Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress by Dai Sijie<br />Last year I read Dai Sijie's BALZAC AND THE LITTLE CHINESE SEAMSTRESS, and I procrastinated on writing this review because I did not feel I could do the book justice. What fascinated me about the story was the idea of Mao's Cultural Revolution, which supposedly placed highly educated people in rural areas of China, so that they would be \\"re-educated\\".  The plot of BALZAC centers on two young Chinese men, sons of highly educated parents (doctors and dentists), who are sent to the countryside to work among the peasants, and through living the hard life of laborers are to be taught a lesson.<br />As the two worked the countryside and were put into situations where they were treated as low-educated laborers, they had to deny their educational heritage. Acknowledging the existence of classical music, for example, could mean punishment.  No books were allowed by any means.  They lived in constant fear, worried that the breath they took would be their last.<br />Then, their life turns for the better. They discover someone who has a hidden stash of western books, translated into Chinese.  They soon become obsessed with the books, and in particular one book written by Balzac.  If they thought their \\"re-education\\" was a turning point, their discovery of these forbidden books is yet another turning point in their lives.<br />The reason for the delay of this review is that although I enjoyed reading the book, I don't feel I truly understood what Dai Sijie was trying to convey to the reader.  To reveal the ending will ruin the book for many, but it is the ending that I fail to understand the impact the author tried to make.  Many readers have enjoyed this book that is destined to become a modern classic. But others like me fail to totally appreciate the meaning of the story of two men who tried to reclaim a life they had thought they truly lost.  I am recommending this book only because I feel this is a modern classic and is probably going to become recommended reading in literature classes in the near future. I think reading this book should be required.  Not only does the author have a gift of words, but also the content of this story is part of modern world history, and the knowledge of this should not be denied.	2003-04-14

WHEN YOU GO AWAY by Jessica Barksdale Inclan<br />A few months ago I read the uncorrected proofs of WHEN YOU GO AWAY by Jessica Barksdale Inclan. The book is about a mother who is suffering from depression and mental illness, and because she does not know how to deal with her problems, she runs away, leaving her two teenaged children and a younger physically challenged child alone to fend for themselves. <br />With Peri gone, the eldest daughter, Carly, takes over as she usually does when her mother can't seem to deal with their problems. The biggest issue is with the youngest member of the family. Brooke suffers from Cerebral Palsy, and cannot breath without a machine, is on tons of medications to help keep her alive, is allergic to so many foods, but despite all these problems she is a happy child when she is with those she loves. She cannot function at all alone - she cannot talk or walk or even move on her own. Carly or Peri need to regularly move Brooke from side to side to ensure she does not develop bedsores. Brooke also cannot speak clearly, but she speaks well enough so that the family understands her needs and wants.<br />Carly knows that Brooke will die if they cannot find their mother. So Carly, with the help of her brother Ryan, seeks advice and help from one of their neighbors, Mrs. Candelero, who also happens to be a nurse. Rosie does what she can, and then calls an ambulance. Brooke is in pretty bad shape by this time, and it does not bode well for Peri if she ever returns to California.<br />In the mean time, Peri is on her way to Arizona to seek out her ex-husband who has not acknowledged the children since their divorce. She receives no money from him, not even to help support their three children. Peri and her children are living in poverty because of this, and due to a falling out she had with her father, she does not let him know where they are when they are forced to leave their home and into an apartment.  Thanks to Mrs. Candelero, Peri's father Carl is located, and he is soon on his way to save the family. Or is he too late?<br />I'm going to give a marginal thumbs-up for WHEN YOU GO AWAY. I loved the premise of the story, with a very fast paced plot line akin to something out of today's headlines. However, what I didn't enjoy about the book was some of Inclan's characterizations. The children Ryan and Carly came out as rather stiff one-dimensional imitations of modern day children. None of the dialogue rang true to me, and it made the book that much less enjoyable. I also found that the book was rather uneven, as if in some parts someone else was writing the book for her. I don't know if this was because this was an uncorrected proof or not, but if it weren't for these irritating problems with characters and structure, I think I would have given this book a better rating.	2003-04-10

It is his parents' hope that the cooler drier climate may help clear up his tuberculosis and improve his health. <br />Stephen comes to the ocean-side town of Tarumi, expecting the worse. He is not happy that he is being sent away from home.  However, he adjusts to his new way of life, learning to love the solitude and peaceful life that their housekeeper Matsu has led for nearly all his life.  Through Matsu, Stephen learns to appreciate a different way of life, and finds that he enjoys being in Japan and learning about the people in the town of Tarumi, and in the nearby mountain town of Yamaguchi, where Matsu's dear friend Sachi lives.  He spends his days painting or taking walks along the beach or visiting with Matsu and his friends.<br />Stephen also befriends one of the local girls, Keiko, who is closer to his age than Matsu or Sachi are, and they develop a relationship that is rather tenuous throughout it's entire existence because of the war between their two countries. <br />In the meantime, the Japanese Imperial army has captured many key cities in China and are slowly making their way south, heading towards Hong Kong. Stephen feels the tension around him, as he himself is an outsider and is considered the enemy by those who know he is Chinese.  On the other hand, Stephen learns that despite the fact that he is living with the Japanese, he loves his new friends and does not want this war to come between them.<br />Gail Tsukiyama's story of Stephen and his experiences during his year in Japan is no more than a series of observations and reflections of a young man viewing life through a new set of eyes. Written in the form of a journal, THE SAMURAI'S GARDEN lacks a strong plotline and doesn't have much action. However, it is made up by the beautiful prose and commentaries that form the thoughts of young Stephen as he discovers love of a young woman in a foreign land, love of friends, and love of a foreign country that he will never forget. Having already read DREAMING WATER, THE SAMURAI'S GARDEN was another wonderful treat and I am looking forward to reading yet another novel by this author.	2003-04-09

Although I found the overall plot line enjoyable, there were many problems with the book. Unfortunately, someone forgot to edit the book, and I found so many grammatical errors, punctuation problems, and even typos that are normally found and corrected before a book goes to print.  Because of this problem, I can't give the book any more than a three star rating.  I do have to admit, I was racing to finish the book so I could find out who \\"dunnit\\".  The kidnapper was rather obvious to me, but this book was not a mystery book, it was a love story, and for that, I found the author did a good job.	2003-04-06

Gossip Hound by Wendy Holden<br />For fans of reading material that has come to be known as \\"chick lit\\", here's Wendy Holden's latest novel, GOSSIP HOUND.  It's a book that takes the reader into the world of London publishing and celebrity \\"A Lists\\" and the latest low-down gossip that is being spread across tabloids, bars, and celebrity bedrooms all over London and beyond.<br />Grace Armiger is a publicist who works for a small London publishing house called Hatto and Hatto.  It sounds like a glamorous job, but it's far from it.  Hatto and Hatto has gotten a reputation of never having books that make it to the bestseller lists, so their authors are never the ones that are treated like royalty at any bookseller festival.  In other words, it's a company that is going nowhere, and Grace is struggling to keep afloat.  To sum it up, the morale at work is only going in one direction: down.<br />Her latest protege, Henry Moon, has just written the book SUCKING STONES, all about his adventures with an aboriginal tribe, and she is quite anxious to get this book into the realms of the bestseller lists.  Unfortunately, no one seems very interested in the book, and she can't seem to sell it at any of the book festivals.  Even getting a book signing for Henry is like pulling teeth.  <br />In the meantime, in another part of the London publishing world, Belinda Black, the queen of newspaper smut, is on a tirade and is bent on landing the number one celebrity, Red Campion, as her latest interview conquest. The lengths this woman will go to get her man is hilarious and I couldn't stop laughing at all her antics.  Her adventures, believe it or not, and Grace's publishing career, collide during the course of this book, as they both become involved in the world of high-in-demand celebrities and fast paced living.<br />I don't want to give away too much, but I highly enjoyed GOSSIP HOUND.  Although I found it difficult initially to get into the book, once I got used to Wendy Holden's writing style the rest of the book went fast.  This book is not for the faint of heart, but for the lover of chick lit and name-dropping and fun trashy antics among the rich and famous.  It's fast paced and often times highly unrealistic. It also has a little romance tucked away, for those of you who like that sort of thing.  Read GOSSIP HOUND. You won't regret it!	2003-04-01

Then, one day her life is shattered when their son Ben is hurt in a serious car accident.  He is lucky to be alive.<br />From that moment on, life changes for the Matthews. Russell, Julie's husband, decides that it is time to go back to his roots and take his family to a totally different environment.

It is the start of Daisy Fay's story. The entire book is in the form of her journal, and we see life through her pure naive eyes. She writes from her heart, so we learn of all her innermost secrets, her hates and her loves.  Daisy Fay brings us into her world where she grew up in Mississippi and ends the journal in her eighteenth year. She does a lot of growing up and learns a little more about the world around her and the people that are most important to her in her life.<br />Daisy Fay's world is one of a dysfunctional family's, but in her opinion, she's having a blast. She doesn't notice what is going on around her and with her family. At least, it's not evident in her journal. With the help of her friends and her own imagination, Daisy Fay is having fun and enjoying life, as only she knows how.<br />For those who are fans of Fannie Flagg, I highly recommend reading DAISY FAY AND THE MIRACLE MAN.  Although this was not as good as her most famous novel, FRIED GREEN TOMATOES AT THE WHISTLE STOP CAFE, nor as good as WELCOME TO THE WORLD BABY GIRL, I feel that DAISY FAY was a very good debut novel.  It depicted what life was like growing up in the south in the 1950's.  Young Daisy Fay can teach us all a lesson that life is what you make it and anyone can succeed and reach his or her dreams.  Thumbs up for DAISY FAY AND THE MIRACLE MAN.	2003-03-25

Rowling<br />I have finally jumped on the bandwagon and decided to read the first installment of the adventures of young Harry Potter.  In HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE by J.K. Rowling, we are introduced to Harry Potter and his miserable life with his relatives, the Dursley's.  Harry is orphaned as an infant, and is sent to live with the Dursley's, who are his only known relatives.  For reasons unknown to Harry, he is treated less than a second class citizen is. He sleeps in a closet and is treated like dirt, while his cousin Dudley is spoiled rotten.<br />Harry's life was never normal. Strange, magical things would happen around him.  His Aunt and Uncle seem to have a strange fear of Harry, almost to the point of obsession, and it seems that these abnormal happenings are somehow tied to Harry.  His Aunt and Uncle are never sure what is really happening, but to be on the safe side they are constantly punishing Harry for anything that happens that seems out of the ordinary.<br />Then one day, Harry's life changes for the better. After a series of strange events regarding the postal service and a bunch of letters addressed to him, on his 11th birthday Harry finds himself being taken to a new home, a school for wizards: \\"HOGWARTS SCHOOL FOR WIZARDS\\".  A whole new world is opened up to him, and Harry finds himself finally happy and surrounded by many friends and admirers as he learns the way of the wizard's life.<br />His best friends at school, Ron and Hermione, along with Harry, learn how to become wizards. Ron's abilities as a wizard are somewhat questionable, but Hermione's quite the expert even in her first year.  Between the three of them, they have a series of adventures that is out of this world.<br />I am going to give a biased thumbs up for HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE, only because I had seen the movies first and read this book with the movie in mind.  I can't say for a fact that if i hadn't seen the movies in the first place, whether or not I would have enjoyed these books as much as I did. I do have to say that J.K. Rowling is a very gifted writer and I would find it interesting if she decided to put out a series of books for adults.  I currently have the entire collection of Harry Potter books at home, ready to be read, so I am hoping the rest of the series is as good as this first book.een the movies in the first place, whether or not I would have enjoyed these books as much as I did.

The same characters return to this book: Grace, who is a librarian at the local library at Cedar Cove; her daughters Kelly, who is a new mom, and Maryellen who finds herself drawn to a mysterious photographer whose artwork she sells.  Grace is also dealing with a missing husband, and has asked a private detective to try to track him down.  Then there is Olivia, Grace's best friend.  She's the favorite local judge of Cedar Cove.  Her daughter Justine has finally settled down and has married a highschool classmate, but is also dealing with a past lover who is still hanging around.  And, Olivia is still seeing Jack Griffin, who she met in the first book, and their romance is moving slowly but surely.<br />New characters are introduced, in the form of Zach and Rosemary. Their marriage is falling apart, and there doesn't seem to be anything anyone can do to help them out.<br />Again, I find the same problems with this book that I found in the previous one.  There are simply too many main characters, too many plotlines floating around. Debbie Macomber is a great writer and is famous for creating characters you can love.  But for some reason she's missing the mark in this new series of hers.  I am hesitant to read her next one, 311 Pelican Court.  I do have to say that both books 16 LIGHTHOUSE ROAD and 204 ROSEWOOD LANE were fast reads.  There is a good chance I will give it one more try before I give this series a rest.	2003-03-23

Female Intelligence by Jane Heller<br />Not having read anything by Jane Heller before, I didn't know I was in for a treat.  FEMALE INTELLIGENCE is a witty satire mocking the entire `self help' industry, in particular the MEN ARE FROM MARS, WOMEN ARE FROM VENUS school of thought.  <br />Lynn Wyman has perfected her method of \\"sensitivity training\\" to an art form, and has become a world famous celebrity.  She has best selling books, makes regular appearances on national television, and sees tons of clients to keep her busy.  She also has a successful marriage, with her husband being the prime example of a man that has learned \\"womenspeak\\".  Life couldn't be more wonderful.<br />Then things start to fall apart.  After Lynn confides in her four best friends that her marriage isn't what it seems to be, the secret is let loose and the media gets a hold of it.  Soon, the entire nation knows that Lynn Wyman's marriage is a sham, and now the famous Wyman Method is no longer respected.  If Lynn was failing at her own marriage, why would any of the men that used her method want to continue seeing her?  One by one, she loses her clients.  Not only that, the networks are no longer interested in having her on TV.  Her credibility was shot. And she's running out of money fast.<br />Then, Lynn reads a nasty article in Fortune Magazine about the worst bosses to work for, and number one on the list is Brandon Brock, the CEO of one of the largest food corporations in the world, Fine Foods Inc.  If she could secure him as a client and change him into a man who is in touch with his feminine side, her credibility will be back and she could continue on as before. What ensues is a lot of laughs and witty humor as Lynn takes on the most macho man she has ever met.  <br />I'm giving this book \\"two thumbs up\\". Jane Heller's FEMALE INTELLIGENCE is a book that makes fun of the entire science of sensitivity training.  After reading several other reviews on this book, I realized that a lot of the reviewers missed the point. Anyone who takes this book seriously is not getting it.  Take on this book as a light read and do not be offended with the stereotypes presented in the book!  This is fluffy book, not a book to take seriously. It took me only a few days to finish; I could not put it down.  I wanted to know if Lynn Wyman successfully converted macho man Brandon Brock into a pussycat. I wanted to know who leaked those rumors about Lynn to the media. But most of all, I wanted to know if Lynn Wyman was able to restore her reputation and go back to the life she had before.  This is not the last Jane Heller book I'll be reading. Highly recommended.	2003-03-23

Gabe Poston is a good friend of Colt's, and Gabe bumps into Isabella outside the reception hall and immediately notices Isabella and her sad eyes. He tries to help carry some items for her into the hall, but Isabella wants nothing to do with Gabe, or any man.  She is too wrapped up in her sorrows and the horrible images that keep replaying in her head.  She was the one that found her two children dead. She felt she was responsible for their deaths, because she was the one that drove her husband to it by divorcing him, a scandal in its own right in the Basque community.<br />For Gabe, however, it's instant infatuation, and he tries to find his way into her life.  He makes an impulsive business transaction and buys a sheep farm, which coincidentally happens to be located next door to Isabella's family's farm. Her father takes Gabe under his wing and starts to teach him what he needs to know about raising sheep.  It's hard work, and Gabe begins to wonder if he made the right decision. <br />In the mean time, the murder trial is about to begin for Isabella's ex-husband.  Isabella is a nervous wreck, and that is an understatement. Because Gabe is a lawyer, he is able to give her advice and helps her through the trial. Gabe would do anything to help Isabella, and to prove that he cared about her.<br />I highly enjoyed reading SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME. Roz Denny Fox did a good job of bringing the world of the Basque community to life.  I also enjoyed the story of Isabella Navarro and her triumph over a crazed ex-husband and her ability to move on with her life. Another great read from Harlequin Superromances.	2003-03-12

Genetically Engineered potatoes and a prodigal daughter are at the heart of the book ALL OVER CREATION, Ruth Ozeki's second novel.  Yumi, or Yummy as she is called, is the daughter of Lloyd Fuller and his Japanese War-Bride Momoko, who settled in Idaho after the war growing potatoes and other crops to earn their living.  Although the Fuller's are rather conservative people, their daughter Yummy grows up a little too wild for Lloyd's tastes.  After a falling-out when Yummy is 14 years old, she runs away from home and does not set foot again on her parent's property until 25 years later, after she receives a call from her childhood bestfriend Cass, who asks Yummy to return home to her parents. Cass herself had been caring for the Fuller's at this point, since neither of them could take care of themselves. <br />As Yummy deals with her feelings about her parents and her life as a whole, a group of protesters that call themselves THE SEEDS are slowly making their feelings known across the Midwest. They protest their sentiments against genetically engineered crops, in particular potatoes, and soon end up in Idaho and on the Fuller's farm.  Their intention is to meet Lloyd, who they feel is their guru in the war against this unnatural vegetation that will eventually hurt the environment.  The Seeds bond with Lloyd, and actually do him a bit of good, giving him a new lease on life. <br />I highly enjoyed ALL OVER CREATION.  Although the main themes about the environment are not typically what draws me to good fiction, I found that Ruth Ozeki did a great job with creating characters and situations that felt realistic to me.  She successfully created a series of subplots that all fit together and fell into place quite logically.  I also found her writing very easy to read, and I also learned something about the war on genetically engineered crops.   I am looking forward to reading her other novel, MY YEAR OF MEATS.	2003-03-10

The news made the headlines and ruined her life as she knew it. That woman was Lily Blake, and in AN ACCIDENTAL WOMAN the story now centers, to some extent, on Lily's sister Poppy, who lost the use of her legs after a terrible snowmobile accident over 10 years ago which also took the life of Poppy's friend Perry Walker. This second novel takes place only a few months after the ending of LAKE NEWS, focusing not just on another of the Blake sisters, but also on the story of Heather Malone, and the mystery behind her life.<BR> <BR>Heather had been a resident of the small town of Lake Henry for over ten years, and has always been greatly loved by all.  She and Micah had been living together for about four years, working the maple syrup operation handed down from Micah's father and grandfather.  His two young daughters Missy and Star looked up to her as if she were their own mother.  <br />The opening chapter finds Heather taken away by the FBI from Micah, Missy, and Star, and accused of murder and flight to avoid prosecution.  She is also accused of being someone else, Lisa Matlock, who supposedly murdered the son of a powerful politician, and Micah and the rest of the town are in shock.  What makes it worse, is that no one, including Micah, knows anything about Heather's past.  <br />In the mean time, Poppy Blake's \\"man\\" from LAKE NEWS, Griffin Hughes, returns to Lake Henry because of Heather's problem. It appears that Griffin, indirectly, is the reason for Heather's arrest.  With a lot of guilt, and an excuse to see Poppy again, Griffin is back in town. He seeks Poppy out, tells her the whole story of why Heather was arrested, and from there he and Poppy try to help Heather by finding out the real truth behind the murder case.  At the same time, Griffin's love for Poppy continues to grow, but now he has to convince Poppy that he's the man for her.<BR> <BR>I loved AN ACCIDENTAL WOMAN but I felt that LAKE NEWS was the better novel.  Although I loved the story of Heather Malone, I was hoping for more focus on Poppy's story.  It wasn't quite what I had expected.  However, I still highly recommend this book, especially for Barbara Delinsky fans.  Delinksy has a talent for creating three-dimensional characters in real-life settings, and doing it well. The characters are believable and the stories feel real.  She does not neglect on details in her books, and although she did go on too long regarding the making of maple syrup, her writing style will always brings me back to her books.	2003-03-08

Uninhibited by Candace Schuler (Harlequin Blaze)<br />A bohemian-looking CEO of a start-up cosmetics company meets a straight-laced suit in UNINHIBITED, one of the original Blaze Harlequin books that started the new line of Harlequins a few years ago.  <br />Zoe Moon has been selling her own cosmetics by word of mouth and is finally ready to go big-time.  She meets an elderly woman, Moira Sullivan, at a cosmetics boutique and Moira is ecstatic with the products.  She has money, or at least her grandson has money, and decides she wants to invest in Ms. Moon's creams and perfumes. However, the big drawback is the grandson - Reed Sullivan meets Zoe and thinks that a) Moira is trying to set him up with yet another woman and b) Zoë is a money-hungry voluptuous bimbo.<br />In the mean time, Zoë won't admit that she's very attracted to the highly attractive multi-millionaire bachelor. Reed, however, makes it pretty obvious that he's interested in Zoë. The sparks do fly, but both manage to keep their hands off each other till the very last minute, AFTER Zoë and Reed and Moira have signed all the contracts for their new cosmetics company, New Moon, making it a legal entity.  What happens after is left to the reader to find out, but now I can see how even a game of marbles can be hot and sexy!<br />I'm giving UNINHIBITED marginal thumbs up.  I loved the character of Zoë Moon.  She was a very unique person that listened to her own drummer and did not seem to care to follow the crowds.  But I had a problem with the story line and the writing style.  It could be my personal taste in books.  This was my first BLAZE novel and it may just not be the type of romance line I enjoy.  I prefer the Harlequin Superromances, which don't have as much \\"heat\\" but a lot more substance.	2003-02-28

Five Quarters of the Orange by Joanne Harris<br />Here is another wonderful book written by Joanne Harris that had me reading non-stop til the very end.  As with CHOCOLAT, Harris places this story in France, but unlike CHOCOLAT that had elements of fantasy sprinkled in, FIVE QUARTERS OF AN ORANGE was more grounded in reality. <br />Sixty-ish Framboise Simon is trying to rebuild a life for herself in the little French village where she grew up in before and during WW II.  It is difficult, as memories of her childhood continue to haunt her, memories that her children know nothing about. The story is told in flashbacks, where she talks about her family's involvement with the Nazi officers that were living stationed in her area of France.  She as a child, along with her brother and sister, were very involved with the officers, not realizing the consequences of their actions.  They spent their days trading with the Germans, and Framboise was secretly in love with one soldier in particular, Tomas, who she had secret fantasies about.  In her new life, her neighbors do not know who she is, for if they did they would probably have her run out of the country.  Instead, they know her only for her delicious baked goods that she sells out of her shop.  She is a harmless old woman.<br />The story is cleverly told, and is a much more complex novel than Chocolat.  The themes of betrayal of one's country and family relationships are intertwined, as we learn about Framboise's interesting past.  Her relationship with her mother is dealt with the most, explaining why Framboise turned out the way she did.  What I loved most though is Harris' fascination with food, and how she seems to find a way to bring it into the story line!  I highly recommend this book, as it was one of my top 20 reads of 2003.	2003-02-23

In a story of double-crossing thieves, Sarah Waters takes us back to dark Victorian London in FINGERSMITH, a beautifully written novel that is wonderfully intriguing, somewhat erotic, and kept this reader completely in suspense from cover to cover.<br />Two young women are orphaned early in life.  Susan Trinder is raised by a band of thieves, calling Mrs. Sucksby the nearest thing to a mother she ever had. They live on Lant Street in the heart of the London Boroughs, a dark and impoverished area of the city. From Sue's window one has a good view of the hangings from Gaol, where she is told her birth mother was hung for murder.  Her \\"friends\\" are Dainty and John Vroom and Mr. Ibbs, who all work and live together with Mrs. Sucksby and Sue, along with a number of babies that Mrs. Sucksby \\"farms\\" to make a living.  Sue was one of those special babies at one time, but Mrs. Sucksby kept and raised Susan as her own daughter, protecting Sue from harm's way, and helps teach her the art of stealing and thievery.<br /> Maud, on the other hand, lives with her Uncle Mr. Lilly in Briar, on a large estate in the countryside many hours away from London by carriage.  She spends her days reading to her uncle and doing things that ladies in her station do - absolutely nothing. She takes walks outside on the estate; she takes tea in her room.  She eats meals with her Uncle at the proper time.  In other words, Maud's life was a totally different world from that of Sue Trinder's.<br />Back on Lant Street, a scam is being laid out.  It is decided that Sue will masquerade as a maid for Miss Lilly, whose Uncle is a business associate of Richard Rivers, known to Sue and her friends as \\"Gentleman\\".  Sue's role in this scam is to help secure a matrimonial match between Gentleman and Maud Lilly, who stands to inherit a fortune upon her wedding.  Sue travels to Briar as Susan Smith with a totally made up identity, and works her way into the life of Maud Lilly, while Gentleman slowly woos his wayinto Maud's heart.  Their plan is to declare Maud insane after she is wed to Gentleman. Then, Richard will take the money that is inherited by Maud, giving a few thousand pounds to Sue as a reward.<br />However, things do not go as planned.  What ensues is a double-crossing upon double-crossing.  Both women find themselves in situations they were not expecting, and soon both are trying their best to rectify things without losing their lives.<br />This is only a trace of what FINGERSMITH is all about.  Besides the intricate plot and subplots that Sarah Waters creates surrounding the scam, Ms. Waters also writes a plot that is not all that it seems.  Written from the viewpoint of both Maud and Sue, the reader receives a jolt of shock when it's time to read Part II, where the story is now told in the voice of Maud Lilly.<br />There are also the wonderful characters that are assembled in this dark Victorian drama.  The two main characters, Maud and Sue, are of course the most integral part of the book, and their relationship while they are maid and mistress borders on erotica.  Then you have the lunatic asylums, the relationship between the different members of Mrs. Sucksby's household, and life at Briar, the dark and old estate that brings to mind novels such as Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed FINGERSMITH. It was a great story with beautiful writing and characters that jump out at you as if you were watching a film.  I plan on reading Waters other two novels, AFFINITY, and her first novel, TIPPING THE VELVET, soon. FINGERSMITH will definitely be on my list of top 20 books read in 2003.	2003-02-22

She claims she is one age, but Ruth knows she is another.  She claims that her mother is one woman, but Ruth knows it's another.  Seeing her mother fall apart leaves Ruth anxious and upset. And the fact that Art doesn't seem to feel this is his problem too, doesn't make it any easier for Ruth.<br />Ruth has problems of her own, mainly her life with Art and his two young girls, but with Lu Ling's health falling apart, she shifts her focus on her mother.  While going through her mother's belongings one day, Ruth finds a set of manuscripts that she remembers were written by her mother. As she starts to slowly translate the Chinese characters, she realizes it is her mother's life story.  <br />From this point, the book turns to Lu Ling's life in China as a young girl and what brought her to America all those years ago. We learn of Lu Ling's life with Precious Auntie, Lu Ling's first love, and the impact of WW II on China and her part of the world. The biggest impact on Lu Ling's life, however, was Precious Auntie, who was a bonesetter's daughter, a bonesetter being a type of medicine man.  It was Precious Auntie's death that helped Lu Ling learn about her true heritage, and how important the nursemaid was in her life.<br/>What happens to all of them is left for the reader to find out, but I would like to recommend THE BONESETTER'S DAUGHTER as one of my favorite Amy Tan books, next to The Joy Luck Club. Tan's novels about the Chinese immigrant ring true for me, and as a third generation Japanese American, I find that I can relate to the \\"Americanized\\" characters that Amy Tan creates in her books.  Regardless of ethnicity or background, I highly recommend THE BONESETTER'S DAUGHTER.	2003-02-12

Tademy, who quit her executive job with Sun Microsystems to write and research her family story, tells a fascinating tale about several generations of slaves and free blacks living in the bayous of Louisiana. She details each section with a segment of the family tree, photos of actual family members, and of course the stories of the men and women that made up her family, in particular Suzette Daurat, her daughter Philomene, and grand daughter Emily \\"Tite\\" Fredieu.  <br />Tademy was old enough to remember stories of her Grandma Tite, who died twelve years before Lalita was born.  It was the stories of Grandma Tite that encouraged Tademy to do a thorough search into the history of her family.  This book was not only a search of one's family and roots, but it is an interesting look at the life of Black America in Louisiana, a state that seemed to be a country of it's own, with social rules that were different from the rest of the South.  <br />Read CANE RIVER for what it is: a look into the story of one family, living through the various changes in American history.	2003-02-12
1235509:US	51214937	R3R1ELGZ8QTY0H	0373711107	553543505	The Comeback Girl: Those Sullivan Sisters (Harlequin Superromance No. 1110)	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Number 3 in the Sullivan Sisters Trilogy	The Comeback Girl by Debra Salonen<br />The third book in her three part series of the Sullivan sisters, THE COMEBACK GIRL is the story of Kristin, the triplet that didn't quite live up to their small town's expectations.  The three sisters were practically raised by the town of Gold Creek, but mostly by their great aunt Ida Jane, who by the third novel is having health problems, including memory loss and other signs of Alzheimer's.<br />In the mean time, Kristin has come back to town to stay, after having left for Oregon over ten years ago.  The reason for her departure was learned in the previous installment, when at the end of the book Kristin arrives in town with her son Zach. No one knew about Zach, let alone that Kristin had a child in the first place.  It was a complete shock to everyone, but as families go, the two other triplets Jenny and Andi, along with their husbands and their beloved Ida Jane, prepare for Kristin and Zach's arrival and welcome them both to the family.<br />As Kristin tries to make a new life for herself and Zach in the town that initially drove her away, she becomes reacquainted with an old love, Donnie Grimaldi, the deputy sheriff. He too has a son from a previous marriage, but is now raising Lucas on his own with very little help from the ex-wife.  Donnie never stopped loving Kristin, and knowing that she needs some help, he has a plan that could help the both of them, and their sons.<br />THE COMEBACK GIRL was yet another enjoyable novel by Debra Salonen.  I didn't feel, though, that it was as good as the other two in the series, but the book redeemed itself by the end of the story. I have a feeling that Salonen will be writing more about the sisters and the fictional town of Gold Creek, and I will be looking forward to reading them.	2003-02-08

The story is told from the viewpoint of Connie Danforth, the midwife's 14-year old daughter, and told in both the past and present tenses.  Interestingly enough, Connie grows up to be an obstetrician and the viewpoint we see is one from Connie as a doctor, and one from Connie as a young girl. <br />Sibyl Danforth had been a successful midwife, bringing babies into the world in the comforts of her patients' homes, instead of in a cold heartless building surrounded by modern machinery.  Sibyl never professed she had a medical degree, but she did say that she knew enough to safely help pregnant women give birth in their homes.  If Sibyl knew her patient's pregnancy would be difficult, she would always be sure she had a doctor on hand to help.<br />However, at the birth of Charlotte Bedford's baby, something goes terribly wrong.  In an effort to save the baby, Sibyl does an emergency c-section without the presence of a doctor or double checking whether her patient is alive.<BR> <BR>What follows keeps the reader in suspense until the end of the book.  The grieving husband, Minister Asa Bedford, starts a lawsuit against Sibyl, and soon the entire town is involved in the case.  Sibyl has the midwife associations on her side but so many others are against her.  As Connie continues to narrate the story, the reader will question whether Sibyl did the right thing or not. Did Sibyl make a mistake?  Or did Charlotte truly have a stroke before she gave birth to her baby?  The conclusion will either cause you to nod your head in agreement, or shock the hell out of you.  <br />I finished the book feeling angry, and was not sure I would read another novel written by Bohjalian again. Enough time has passed however, that I have decided I will read one more novel by him before I pass judgement.  He is a wonderful writer, but seems to enjoy manipulating his readers' feelings.	2003-02-07

Still trying to get over the horrible burning death of her mother, she finds herself in a horrible situation herself.  She is raped by four men, blind-folded the entire time so as not to see her attackers. Her brother Milo finds her soon after, but he can't make out what is wrong with his sister.  A few weeks later, she is throwing up in the flowerbeds, and tells her brother that she is feeling sick, nothing more. <br />The event that causes her pregnancy also causes her to stop speaking. Whether from shock or from choice, the reader doesn't really know.  We do know that she informs no one of her situation, and surprisingly, she gives birth to the baby with no one noticing.  Her baby is a boy, with the most beautiful blue eyes anyone has ever seen.  He looks like an angel. She leaves him on a stump in the forest, hoping to never see him again.<br />Years later, she comes to the House of Gentle Men, run by Mr. Olen and his strange daughter Louise.  This house is a place where men \\"service\\" women by catering to their every needs.  Anything is allowed, except penetration.  Only kisses and hugs and caresses are allowed in this special place for women.  Charlotte comes to seek solace, and requests a certain type of man to cater to her whims.  However, she accidentally comes in view of one particular man, Justin, who is there to seek atonement for his heinous crime of rape, and he faints immediately when he recognizes Charlotte, the victim in his horrible crime.  <br />However, Charlotte becomes obsessed with Justin, and insists on having him as her man in the House of Gentle Men.  And so they meet, against Mr. Olen's wishes, for he knows about Justin's past, and a relationship grows between Charlotte and Justin.But what Charlotte does not know slowly destroys Justin inside, until he feels he cannot go on further until he makes peace with himself and with Charlotte.<br />THE HOUSE OF GENTLE MEN by Kathy Hepinstall is not your average book.  Hepinstall writes with a lyrical style, and her tale is not one that totally sets foot in the real world, but of a fabled place that only exists in this novel.  For some readers, it may be hard to get past the idea of this house where sex is not allowed.  However, what Hepinstall does is tell a tale of redemption and forgiveness. There are several interesting subplots that are woven into the main story line, but they all come together in the end with a surprising conclusion.  I found the novel satisfying and probably one of the better books I'll read in 2003.	2003-02-06
1242129:US	51214937	R3JAGB534RVCDJ	0312421273	647099960	The Corrections: A Novel	Books	3	4	8	N	N	Epic of a dysfunctional family	The Corrections by Jonathan Franzen<br />What can I say about this book, that everyone else hasn't said yet?  Oprah's most famous book selection, which also caused the most controversy, THE CORRECTIONS is the book Jonathan Franzen will probably be most remembered by.  Here's yet another huge epic-style book about a dysfunctional family that you just love to hate.   <br />The Lamberts are originally from a small town in the Midwest, St Jude, and are going through a crisis.  Alfred, the patriarch of the family, is starting to show signs of dementia, and in the midst of all this, the rest of the family doesn't seem to be that sane either.  Enid, his wife, doesn't seem to want to face the fact that he needs help. Chip, their middle child and youngest son is a failure.  Gary, their oldest child, is having problems with his marriage and his kids, plus he thinks he's going insane.  And Denise, the one that I think is the closest to being \\"normal\\", seems to fall into very terrible and bizarre relationships.<br />The book is divided up into sections, with each section devoted to one person in the family.  We start with Chip's problems with his job, his screenplay that will never get done, and his lack of money. (When he goes off to Lithuania, his story gets pretty interesting).  Next section is devoted to Gary and his constant struggle with his wife and two of his kids. (His third child, Jonah, seems to be a saint).  Then we move to Enid, where she is on a cruise with Alfred, and here her story is told: Enid, the ever-suffering wife, who has to deal with a puritanical husband who is as rigid as a board. From this point, I began to understand what was really going on with Alfred, and felt some sympathy for her.  Next, we move to Denise's story, as we learn about her indiscretions with her father's employee, her pseudo-affair with another boss, and countless of other things she does to mess up her life.  <br />The book ends with \\"one last Christmas\\", where we finally see the entire family in one place at the same time.  This last scene ties up all the loose ends, and if I hadn't finished this book, I don't think I could have honestly said this book was worth the effort. <br />I bought the book because of the Oprah hype.  But I waited to read this book, hesitating because of the hype.  When I finally found my nerve to pick up this book, I was surprised to find how fast I was able to zip through it.  Do not be intimidated by the size of the book and the tiny print.  Although Franzen did not make this an easy book to read, for some reason I was able to read this book in less than two weeks (However, I stopped in the middle of the book and read another book in-between).  His long rambling paragraphs and nearly run-on sentences made me want to fall asleep, but I continued on.  I was rewarded with an excellent story of a dysfunctional family, and now I know what Franzen meant by \\"the corrections\\".  I can't say I highly recommend this book, mainly because it is not a \\"fun\\" book to read, and I believe he could have made this shorter.  But the reader will be rewarded by the time he reaches the last page of the book.	2003-02-03

And Dominick is there to rescue Thomas, as he's done their entire life.  Thomas is taken to a psychiatric hospital for close observation, but in the mean time, Dominick ends up meeting with the psychiatrists, who help Dominick deal with issues he has with his brother, and soon a whole slew of issues comes rolling off of his tongue.  It's an uphill battle, but through the help of the psychiatrists and his grandfather's journal, Dominick learns to deal with his anger and his frustrations over his life, and he comes to terms with a lot of things that he felt resentment over in the past.  <br />There is not enough I can say about this book.  It was quite the novel, with so much detail to the life stories of these people, covering three generations from Italy to America.  Yet it all helped to tell Dominick's story. It surely was not a light read, but despite the huge volume, I was able to finish this book in less than two weeks. It is fast paced and there's never a dull moment.  I'd say this is one of the best books selected by Oprah that I've read so far, and is part of my top 10 list of books read in 2002.	2003-02-01

Book number one, MY HUSBAND MY BABIES, was Jenny's story.  Book number two is Andrea's.<br />Andi, as she is known by all, is an ex-marine and of all the sisters, seems to be the most independent and strongest of the three.  She is currently helping their elderly Aunt Ida Jane run the antique shop that Ida Jane has owned for many years. Because of the affects of aging, the sisters feel that someone needed to help out Ida Jane, who was starting to become forgetful and absent-minded.<br />There's a new guy in the town of Gold Creek, and he's come to live and work for Sam, the sisters' future brother-in-law and Jenny's future husband.  But the spin on the new guy is that he has amnesia.  Who is this gorgeous man, Andi wants to know.  And as she gets to know the mystery man who calls himself Harley, she offers to help him find his past.<br />Debra Salonen has come up with another wonderful romance in WITHOUT A PAST.  As with her other novels, Salonen is able to create likable characters with depth and dimension, and place them in real surroundings that makes one want to go out and find these small towns on the map. She brings the fictional town of Gold Creek, California to life, modeling it after the small towns surrounding the Yosemite Valley and Oakhurst, California towns. I'm looking forward to reading book number three, THE COMEBACK GIRL, Kristin's story.	2003-01-31

Two main characters are depicted, two World War II heroes: Mather Rose, a Black American raised in France, and Lewis Hampton, a Caucasian man born and raised in the Deep South.  The reader learns about these two war heroes, two men who love their families, their wives and children, and who both have hopes and aspirations just like any person we would meet on the streets. But when their worlds collide, the horror and tragedy of racism is too ugly to bear.  The shock of what happens is, unfortunately, not foreign to our modern world. <br />ONCE TWO HEROES comes highly recommended by this reader. I believe this is one of the more important novels to be written in 2003, and should not be dismissed. For those of the faint of heart, be warned!  The book ends in a violent nature, and may not be appreciated by all readers.	2003-01-28

After a friend of her son's is tragically killed at school, Martha feels that the only way to protect Duncan from the same fate is to take him away from everything he knows, and hide out for the rest of their lives.<br />The novel opens with a conversation between the detective hired to search for Martha and Duncan, and David Warden, Martha's husband and Duncan's father. The reader learns that Martha and Duncan have just disappeared, and David is rightfully distraught.  His main concern is that Martha is not well, is \\"delicate\\" and is \\"crazy\\". <br />The next scene takes us to a burning car, as Martha and her son stand by and watch. They are in the middle of a Texas desert, near the Mexican border, and are far away from their home in Ohio, where David is waiting for their return. She feels exhilarated as she watches the car go up in flames, and happy that her son trusts her. No one at home trusts her, she thinks, and they all think she is insane.  She knows they are wrong.  She feels that taking her son away from the others is the right thing to do.  So, she and Duncan are now on their way in search of a cave in south Texas that she has learned about from a customer of hers at her flower shop.  With only his information to go on, she and Duncan continue their trek towards the Mexican border.<br />Martha creates a new life for herself and Duncan inside this magical cave.  Duncan misses his father but Martha soothes him by telling him that his daddy would meet them soon.  Duncan soon stops asking about him, as life on the Rio Grande becomes a routine of exploring, fishing, swimming, and daily reading lessons.  With enough rations for several months, Martha's only worries is that Duncan would learn that his mother had lied to him, and that David would eventually find them living in the cave.<BR> <BR>However, instead of David finding them, the detective finds them first, and he lies to Martha, giving his name as Andrew, which happens to be her father's name, and as he gets to know her, he starts to fall in love with her.  He stalls his return to civilization and David, and soon he too becomes a part of their every day lives.  <br />THE PRINCE OF LOST PLACES was another enjoyable read by Kathy Hepinstall. Under 200 pages, it took me only a day to finish. As with her other books, I found that her style of writing comes close to being poetic in her use of words and style of exposition.  The story line, however, was not as strong as with her other two books, HOUSE OF GENTLE MEN and ABSENCE OF NECTAR, but I still found this book worth reading, especially with the surprise ending. I would not recommend this to a first time reader of Hepinstall's works, but definitely read it after trying one of her other two novels first.  Kathy Hepinstall is one of the more gifted writers I have read in the past few years, and am looking forward to finding out what she has in store for the reader in the near future.	2003-01-23

Benny is a large over weight young woman, somewhat shy, and Eve is a petite girl who grew up as an orphan with a convent of nuns.  Together, they share life's joys and sorrows and experience what growing up is all about.<br />While a few chapters focus on their early childhood, the bulk of the book takes place in College.  Eve and Benny decide to go to school in Dublin, and while Eve gets to move out from the convent and into her own place, Benny ends up living at home with her over-protective parents.  <br />Despite the fact that she doesn't have as much freedom as her college-mates, Benny does make many new friends at the college.  Benny and Eve meet Nan, a beautiful young woman who befriends them on their first day of school.  The three of them become best of friends, and are always seen hanging out together. On the same day, they also meet Jack Foley, a very good-looking son of a local doctor, and soon Benny falls in love with him. These two and many other new friends become part of Benny and Eve's new life at college.  A lot of parties and lunches and good times are had by all.<br />As always, there is a huge cast of characters in this Maeve Binchy novel, along with complicated plot twists which all get resolved at the end.  The book takes us back and forth between the two towns, throwing in various subplots including the story behind Eve's family history, which could be a novel in itself.  The book's main emphasis, however, is friendship and betrayal, and the loyalties that one makes throughout their lives. Circle of Friends comes highly recommended from this reader.	2003-01-21

In this installment, Ben Foster has come to town in the hopes of finding and possibly meeting the daughter he has never met.  Twelve years ago, Ben had a brief relationship with a young woman whose future seemed to be going nowhere.  Not that Ben had any future that looked any brighter.  There were no hard feelings between them, but Ben did not want to stick around once he knew Berry was pregnant.  He was only 19 years old, and had no clue what he wanted out of life.  He left Berry to raise their daughter on their own.<br />Lynda Barone was a multi-millionaire lawyer that made her career her life.  There were no friends except for Melina, and no boyfriends for a good many years. Her mother was constantly nagging her to meeting Mr. Right, but all Lynda thought she wanted was to be left alone.  <br />The day the two meet changes their lives forever.<br />Marilyn Pappano paints a pretty picture of life in a small town, while at the same time tells an interesting story of love, romance, and doing the right thing.  The only complaint I had with this book was that I didn't know it was one of a series of books.  You have to get the next book in order to find out how things turn out with Ben and his newly found daughter, Alanna. But, since this book was enjoyable enough, I wouldn't mind reading the sequel or looking up the previous books in the series.	2003-01-21

Her close friendship with the newly appointed Cardinal Rossetti is misconstrued as something more, and the front page news headlines drives Lily back to the hometown of her childhood, Lake Henry, New Hampshire. <br />Starting her life over again is not easy, but Lily has no other choice. Her life in Boston is over.  Until this huge news story blows over, she could not return to Boston.  She is asked to resign from her teaching job and is also told that she has been replaced at her lounge gig.<br />Upon her return to Lake Henry, Lily meets John Kipling, a newspaper editor of the local newspaper who also happened to work for the local Boston paper at one time in his life.  Tired of the games large newspapers play, and having been badly burnt by the same man that betrayed Lily in the Boston papers, he returned home to Lake Henry to deal with a simpler type of news writing. The quiet life along the lake and the small-town news stories that he edits is a good change for John.<br />As Lily and John slowly get to know each other, the reader learns about their painful family histories and the loved ones that caused them such unhappiness.  To everyone's surprise, Lily takes an interest in the family apple business and hides out amongst the apple presses as the media slowly loses interest in her story.  And John tries to connect with his elderly father, and man that never seemed to approve of anything John did.<br />However, John is torn about his latest book project: he's writing a book based on Lily's experience with the press and he's falling in love with her.  Will this compromise their relationship if he went ahead with the book?<br />LAKE NEWS was a very enjoyable book for me.  It was far more complex that I had imagined it to be, with the story line of the news frenzy behind Lily Blake's relationship with the Cardinal, to the complex family dynamics that go on between her family.  And the story line concerning John and his bitter father ended with a complete surprise for me. LAKE NEWS was my first Barbara Delinsky book and will definitely not be my last.  Highly recommended.	2003-01-02

While the main plot revolves around the crazy adventures of Tom and Cathy and the new business, there are also various subplots.<br />Cathy is married to a successful lawyer, who also happens to be the son of her mother's former employer, The Mitchell's. Her mother-in-law hasn't quite recovered from her son Neil's marriage to the maid's daughter, but Neil and Cathy seem to be very happy, at least in the beginning.  Both are focused on their busy careers and their lives couldn't be more full.<br />Tom Feather lives with his beautiful girlfriend Marcella, who is aspiring to become a successful model. They seem oddly matched, but love is blind and opposites attract, or so it seems.  One of Tom's complaints is that Marcella continues to put on hold any plans of getting married.  Her career comes first, and Tom respects her wishes.  But, deep down Tom is wondering when Marcella will ever change her mind?<br />Another subplot involves Neil's niece and nephew, the young twins Maud and Simon.   Their parents are unable to care for the twins, due to one parent being on a drinking binge, and the other being mentally unstable, so Cathy's parents Muttie and Lizzie take on the job of being foster parents, and to everyone's surprise the arrangement works out.  Maud and Simon bring a lot of love and laughter to the household, along with some adventures too.<br />Tom and Cathy's lives are not easy while they work out the problems with their new business. With no emotional support coming from Neil and the business becoming very successful, Cathy starts to fall apart.  Tom begins to have problems with his own relationship too, and things come to a head at the end of the book.<br />We do have a happy ending with SCARLETFEATHER, and needless to say, I enjoyed every page.  I love getting to know the characters of a Maeve Binchy book, and with SCARLET FEATHER this was no exception.  Binchy is the master at creating well-developed and interesting characters, whether they are main characters or supporting ones.  This being only my second book written by her, I have a lot more of her books to look forward to. SCARLET FEATHER gets two thumbs up!	2003-01-01

MY HUSBAND, MY BABIES isn't the greatest title in the world, but the story I found was very fitting with the Christmas Spirit.  Jenny Sullivan O'Neal is one of three sisters: Triplets, to be exact!  She is married to a wonderfully funny and charming man, Josh.  They are happily married, but the only thing that keeps them from being complete is the fact that they did not have children.  Josh had testicular cancer as a young teen, and because of it, he could not have children.  Josh, who was always the one that was the take-charge person and always had a plan, decides that his brother Sam would be the sperm donor, and thus, Jenny gets pregnant.<br />The story takes a tragic turn when Josh's cancer returns in full force, and Jenny is left to care for the newborn twins.  And there to help her, is Sam.  <br />I found this book a very fast paced read, with a lot of interesting plot twists.  Don't be turned off by the title!  This was probably one of the best romances I have read this year.  I am looking forward to the next book in the series.	2002-12-31

THE BABY PLAN by Susan Gable (A Harlequin Superromance)<br />Jake Manning wants to have a baby.  He raised his younger brother and sister himself, and with them grown up and out of the house, he still feels the need to be a parent.  But with one bad marriage behind him, and a mother that had abandoned them for another man, he doesn't trust the opposite sex and believes that there is no such thing as a good relationship. He does not want to get married, but he wants to father his own baby and raise the baby on his own.<br />In walks Harley Emerson, living in poverty and with a police record. She is working as a car mechanic when he picks up his Mustang at the mechanic's shop and sees her working underneath his car.  Unfortunately, due to a misunderstanding, she is fired from her job in front of Jake's eyes as he tells the owner that someone stole his cell phone from his car.  With her police record, she is falsely accused of the theft.  Jake knows she's innocent - he feels it in his gut - but there is nothing he can do to persuade the owner of the shop.<br />Jake feels incredibly guilty for what happens to Harley, and as he starts to think of her fate, he realizes that she may be the answer to his dreams: he needs a mother for his unborn baby, but he doesn't want to get married either.  What if he takes Harley in, gives her what she wants (an education and a job), and asks her to have his baby?<br />The plot line seems a little implausible, but I found the book was well written and made things believable.   Susan Gable did a good job with developing well-rounded and likeable characters, and I thoroughly enjoyed the book.   I would definitely read another romance by her, and give thumbs up to THE BABY PLAN.	2002-12-24

Yes, it is mostly about the murder of his young son Adam Walsh, and John's obsessive search for the murderer, but it is also a book about John's life so far.<br />John's life reads like a novel.  He's never done anything on a small scale; he's done everything big.  He started life after college working as a cabana boy at Florida resorts, enjoying the tips and the sun and the sand, and spent a lot of time in the water scuba diving, which was his first love.  With the right connections, he moved on to bigger things, becoming a big hotel marketing bigwig, using his skills as a scuba diver to bring in clients.  <br />Things were going pretty well for him.  He had by that time met and married Reve, and soon they had their first child, Adam.  When Adam was abducted and murdered at the age of 9, their good fortune turned a quick 180, and soon their life became a nightmare.<br />What this book shows is how this single tragic event changed the life of John and Reve Walsh.  It motivated them to do something about the fact that there were no government agencies, local or national, which aided in the search of missing children.  Adam's death made them realize that there were hundreds of kids that go missing or are abducted every day, and no one was out there that could help the parents locate these missing children.  What is so amazing is how the Walshes turned a tragedy into something wonderful.  If anyone could truly be said to have made a difference in this world, it is John and Reve Walsh.  This book showed that Adam Walsh did not die for nothing.	2002-12-20

As many fans will know, Quentin is the name of a restaurant that appears in several of Binchy's previous books, including TARA ROAD and SCARLET FEATHER.  Along with the restaurant appear many characters that have appeared in other Binchy books.  We have the twins Maud and Simon from SCARLET FEATHER, who are always so much fun.  We have Tom Feather and Cathy Scarlet, also from SCARLET FEATHER.  And a number of other characters from other books as well.  <br />What is the point of this?  Mainly, Binchy decided to write a book comprised mostly of short snippets of life - stories of people that had something to do with the restaurant and how the restaurant came to be.   We have the story of the man called Quentin who founded the restaurant.  We have the story of the family that doesn't appreciate their mother enough to take her out to Quentins on Mother's Day.   And so forth, and so on.<br />And where do these stories come from?  A young woman named Ella is researching them. QUENTINS is partly the story of Ella and how she is researching the history of the restaurant, in order to create a film about it.  At the same time, QUENTINS is the story of Ella and how she becomes involved with a married man, the love of her life, only to find out that he has taken the money of many people that she knows and loves and has left the country.  To get over her misery, her friends ask her to help with the filming of a movie about Quentins. <br />I love Maeve Binchy's style, but I cannot give this book a 5 star rating.   It was very uneven, and I felt that the book was only a vehicle for her short stories.  I enjoyed the story about Ella, and I enjoyed the story of how Quentins came to be, but other than that, I think there was no real reason to write this book.  I suggest reading any of her other books, and get a taste of what Maeve Binchy is really all about.	2002-12-16
1303575:US	51214937	R3ORESBOSRLV0X	0312206070	128099275	Dreaming Water: A Novel	Books	5	19	21	N	N	One of the best of 2002	Dreaming Water by Gail Tsukiyama<br />The value of life and the shortness of it all: one of the themes that are touched upon in DREAMING WATER.  Gail Tsukiyama's style of writing creates a very beautiful story about a woman who is dying of Werner's disease, a disease that ages a person at twice the normal speed.   Hana Maruyama was born like any normal healthy child, but by an early age her parents, Max and Cate, noticed that her growth patterns were not normal.  There was something terribly wrong with her, and after much testing with doctors, by the time she is 13, they have diagnosed Hana with having Werner's disease. <br />Knowing that Hana's life would be short and that her parents would most likely outlive her, they treat every day as something precious, and every passing year as something very special.  And with each passing year, Hana's symptoms worsen.  She seems to be fine for many years, until she develops cataracts while in college, and from then on, her life becomes a roller coaster. She is no longer in control of her body.  Every day Hana wonders what new symptom would she experience, as her body ages faster than it should.  By age 38, Hana appears the age of an eighty-year-old woman.<br />The book spans a period of two days, but within those two days, the reader sees into the thoughts of both Cate and Hana and learns about their lives.  We learn about Hana's father Max, who was a second generation Japanese American, interned as a boy with his family in the camps during WW II.  Max, who had died only a few years ago, lives through the thoughts of both Cate and Hana, and we learn about his years spent at Heart Mountain internment camp in Wyoming, and how he dreamt of water and how much he longed for it.  Living in the parched dry lands of the camp, Max lived a life of imprisonment and shame. He brought this shame with him after the war was over and the Japanese Americans were released.  Max rarely talked about the camps with Hana or his wife. It was fromMax's father that Hana learned about her father's family and their time spent in Wyoming.<br />We learn about Hana's grandparents, and their love for their granddaughter.   Max and Cate's marriage was not approved of by either set of parents.   Cate's parents disapproved of their daughter marrying a Japanese American, and Max's parents had hoped their son would marry \\"a nice Japanese girl\\".  Max in turn told them, \\"But I'm marrying a nice Italian American girl\\".<br />But the birth of Hana, a few years after their wedding, helps unite both families together.  Both grandparents are ecstatic, and finally acknowledge the marriage that they had originally disapproved.<br />One of the themes of DREAMING WATER is racial prejudice, but the true story is about Hana.  She knows she only has a few years left, and so the story takes us into two days of Hana's life, her memories, and the people she loves.  The book is very short and concise, yet Tsukiyama was able to fit an entire story about the Maruyama family and their love for their daughter Hana.  It is a very moving story, and I consider this book one of the best books I've read in 2002.	2002-12-16
1312344:US	51214937	R12A7NNXD8FECT	0316973742	465404562	The Gospel of Judas: A Novel	Books	4	4	5	N	N	What if Jesus was not who we thought he was?	The Gospel of Judas by Simon Mawer<br />The backdrop is Rome, and Father Leo Newman undergoes several crises including betraying his priestly vows and experiencing a crisis of faith in Simon Mawer's THE GOSPEL OF JUDAS.  Several plots run throughout the book, all of them seeming to be centered on Leo at various times of his life.  However, the main thread takes us to the not so distant past, where Father Leo helps discover what could be a faith-shattering object.  A gospel written by Judas Iscariot, the apostle who had betrayed Christ to the Romans, is discovered and everything in it contradicts the other four published gospels.  If this document is released, Newman believes that the Church will go through a terrible catastrophe.  This gospel could change what the Church stood for these past 2000 years, and invalidate what the world believed about Jesus Christ.<br />During this same time frame, Leo has befriended a couple, Madeleine and Jack Brewer.  Jack is a British diplomat, and Madeleine his beautiful wife.  Madeleine invites Father Leo to their home for dinner one evening, and soon they begin to develop a friendship.  It is Madeleine, however, that becomes Leo's close friend and confidante.  What happens between Madeleine and Leo, along with the complications brought on by the gospel of Judas, shakes up Leo's world and changes his life forever.<br />Flashbacks take us to Nazi Italy, where we see a British woman and her Nazi German husband live their daily lives in luxury, complete with young son Leo and Leo's instructor \\"Checco\\".  There is obviously something going on between Gretchen and Checco, which eventually leads to betrayal and death.  This whole subplot is full of mystery, and what we learn about Leo at the end of the book helps explain who Father Leo Newman really is.<br />THE GOSPEL OF JUDAS was a very interesting story of a person's crumbling faith in the Church and in oneself.  Readers may miss the many references to Mithraism, which were interspersed throughout the book to help illustrate the possibility of the Church's attempt to hide or change the truths from its followers, both in the past and in the present. Mithraism is pure fact, but as far as I know, THE GOSPEL OF JUDAS is pure fiction. Despite the controversial theme, I highly recommend this book.  It is part of my list of top 20 books of 2002.	2002-12-08

Books	4	5	5	N	N	Take a wild trip into the mind of Frida Kahlo	The Incantation of Frida K. by Kate Braverman<br />Here is yet another telling of the fascinating life of Frida Kahol, done in an unusual way by author Kate Braverman.   The story is told by Frida while she is in a drug-induced state as she lays on her deathbed.  Because of her state of mind, the book seems to read like a hallucinatory dream, with spurts of reality mixed in.<br />Frida tells her life story in bits and pieces, from the first day she meets her future lover and husband, artist and communist Diego Rivera, to her own exploits as a celebrated artist and fellow communist, and the accident that left her a cripple all her adult life.   Since her memories are being told while in a drug-induced state, it is difficult to determine what is fiction and what is fact. <br />I found this a highly unusual book and rank it among my top 20 books of 2002.  It is definitely not the book to read for one that wants to know more about Frida, but it is more of a work of art.   Kate Bravermen takes the reader into the mind of an eccentric artist, and it is a fascinating journey.	2002-12-08

A wrong word or a wrong look - anything could set off Bobby's anger. A broken nose or a black eye -- Bobby lashes out at Fran in any way he can.  It seems to start out as a mistake, a fluke, but as the years go by, Bobby continues to beat Fran for the slightest thing, and does not see anything wrong in what he does to her. <br />The fact that Bobby is a policeman makes this a scarier ordeal for Fran.  Bobby knows that even if Fran goes to the police, no one would believe that he had beaten up his own wife.  His reputation on the force seems to be legendary. On the other hand, if Fran did try to go to the police, no one could protect her from his wrath after finding out what she did.<br />Fran keeps these abuses and fears to herself.  Her son Robert asks Fran, \\"how did that happen?\\" when he sees her with a black eye.  Fran always has an answer, always avoids telling him the truth.  And Robert looks the other way.  Although old enough to understand what is happening, he is still too young to want to accept such a thing happening between his parents.  So he chooses to pretend that everything is ok.<br />Fran could only take so much abuse. She takes their son Robert and leaves for Florida under the guidance of Patty Bancroft, a leader of a group that helps battered women like Fran by relocating them with a whole new identity, saving them from the men that are abusing them.  Fran starts a new life with a new name, and slowly things begin to fall in to place.  But, no matter what Patty tells her, Fran feels that Bobby will one day find them. And when he does, Fran knows her life is over.<br />BLACK AND BLUE was one of those books that kept me glued to every page.  What surprised me is that I did not cry once or feel any real strong emotions while I read this book except for fear. The book for me was more like a suspense novel, and secondarily a novel about spousal abuse.  The author focused more on Fran's attempt to forge a new life for herself and her son and on her every day fears that Bobby would eventually find her.  With that said, I highly enjoyed this book and would definitely recommend it.  It was an Oprah Selection, but for me it was not as typical a choice as some of her past books.	2002-12-02
1322149:US	51214937	R1NII247RZFF8A	1551668300	377209543	16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove, Book 1)	Books	3	33	35	N	N	Could have been better....	16 Lighthouse Road by Debbie Macomber<br />16 Lighthouse Road is a series of subplots within one book, where not one single subplot takes the lead.  There are several stories found in this Macomber title.    Olivia is a 50-something judge who presides over a divorce hearing and refuses to grant the divorce.  The couple in question is Cecilia and Ian Randall, who have gone through their own private hell - loss of a baby which leads to their mess of a marriage. <br />Olivia herself is the focus of a subplot.  She has been divorced for many years but has not remarried as her ex-husband has.  Then, she meets Jack Griffin, newspaper editor of the local paper, and she finds herself interested.  The feeling is mutual.<br />Another subplot is Charlotte, Olivia's mother, who is involved with many social groups including helping out at the hospital, where she meets an elderly man who cannot speak, because of a stroke.<br />Yet another subplot is the story of Justine, who is dating a much older man, and her mother is Olivia.  She has no desire to settle down, but then starts to have conflicting emotions when she meets up again with an old high school mate, Seth.<br />There is nothing wrong with having several subplots in one book.  The problem was that there was no main story, and the book reads like a soap opera.  Debbie Macomber can write, but I have a feeling the fault here is her editor.  There are repeated passages all over the book, where things could have been nicely condensed.  Transitions from one scene to another are not very smooth.   I would have enjoyed this book a lot better if someone had taken the time to proof read the book and do it right!<br />I have the second book in this series of books, 204 Rosewood Lane.  I am hoping to find this book a much better edited book. There was nothing wrong with the story content of 16 Lighthouse Road.  It kept my interest despite the irritating problems with the writing.   Because of these problems, I will have to give the book only Three stars.	2002-12-01

The Secret Son by Tara Taylor Quinn  (Harlequin Superromance #1057)<br />In Tara Taylor Quinn's THE SECRET SON, Erica and Jefferson Cooley are a happily married couple living and working together in the heart of our nation's capitol.  Jefferson is a high profile senator, and Erica works for him as his PR person, keeping his image to a standard that makes his constituents happy and gets him re-elected each Election Day.<br />Although old enough to be her father, Jefferson and Erica have a very satisfying marriage, being the best of friends, but unfortunately not the best of lovers.  Erica has never been in love with Jefferson, but with him being such a close friend of the family, and Jefferson's being in love with her made up for what passion Erica lacked for him.  <br />In walks Jack Shaw, FBI agent working for the Crisis Negotiation Team.  Erica and Jack meet during a business trip in New York, and they spend dinners together for a week, talking and falling in love.  Nothing happens, until their last night together.   The result: Erica is pregnant, but Jack doesn't know it.<br />And Erica has no plans of telling Jack, either.  Erica and Jack both agreed that after their week together, they would both go back to their own lives.  Erica loved Jefferson and felt she owed him loyalty, and Jack could no longer commit to a wife and family, because of a past that still haunted him, and the dangerous job he currently had.<br />When Erica tells Jefferson of her affair and of her unborn baby, he accepts Erica's baby as his own, and together they raise Kevin and live out their happy family life.   But Erica's past catches up to her, and 5 years later, an accidental meeting with Jack brings trouble.  <br />I enjoyed reading THE SECRET SON, but I felt the writing could have been better.  Although I enjoyed the story line, I felt that there were a few too many scenes that did not quite belong and could have been edited out, but over all, it was an enjoyable book.	2002-11-17

NIGHTS IN RODANTHE by Nicholas Sparks<br />Another love story by the author of MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE and other tragedy-laden romances, NIGHTS IN RODANTHE recalls an older woman's memories of a love lost, but not forgotten.<br />Adrienne Willis is 60 years old and is trying to help her daughter Amanda deal with the recent death of her young husband.  Amanda does not seem to be able to cope with the death, ignoring her young children's needs and falling apart before them all.  Adrienne decides to tell Amanda the story of a man she loved many years ago, but due to circumstances that kept them apart, they did not have a \\"happily ever after\\".  She hopes that this story will help Amanda with her own loss.<br />Fourteen years ago, three years after Adrienne's husband Jack had left her for another woman, Adrienne honors a request to help take care of a friend's Bed and Breakfast Inn while her friend goes away on vacation.  Adrienne has yet to move on with her life since the divorce, and time spent at the Inn may be what Adrienne needs.  There is only one guest that weekend, and it is Paul Flanner, a surgeon who is going through his own nightmare of a past, and happens to stay at the Inn while he conducts some business in town.  <br />Adrienne and Paul connect and as they get to know each other, they fall in love.  Paul, however, has already committed to spending time in South America and be with his son, who also happened to be a doctor. He tells Adrienne that as soon as his work is done there, he will come back for her and they would have plenty of time to be together.<br />Obviously, things did not work out for Adrienne and Paul, since Adrienne was sitting in her kitchen with her recently widowed daughter.  What happens after that week in Rodanthe is Adrienne's story to her daughter, and what Amanda learns from her mother helps bring her back to the world of the living.<br />This was yet another heartbreaking story by Nicholas Sparks and I highly enjoyed it.  I have read all of his books, and I still come back for more.  What I find interesting is that people he knows inspire him to write most of his books, and this book was no exception.  Inspired by his own courtship with his wife, Sparks yet again has written a winning book.	2002-11-17

However, Thomas Harris' RED DRAGON was not about Dr. Hannibal Lecter.   Instead, it centered round Will Graham, a man with demons of his own, and who helped put Dr. Hannibal behind bars.<br />Will is called out of retirement by the FBI to help solve a serial murder case.  Two families have been murdered, and they think that only Will has the knack to help them find the killer. Will takes the case, despite his wife and stepson's objections, and takes up temporary residence in Georgia, where the 2nd family, The Leeds', were murdered.  As he does a walk through of the family's home, he slowly sees how they were killed.  His highly intuitive mind is able to recreate each individual murder.  The murders are gruesome, and Harris does not hold back with the descriptions of each family member found dead in the house.  <br />While the movie let the audience try to guess who the murderer was during the early parts of the film, Harris tells the reader who murdered the two families within the first 100 pages.  Francis Dolarhyde is a shy man who works for a film developing company called Gateway Film Laboratory. He's got access to hundreds of home videos that come through their labs to be processed, and is then sent back to their original families.  An early scene of Dolarhyde finds him watching one of these home made videos, but he has spliced it with his own videos: the murders of these same families.   He watches these over and over, turned on by the gruesome scenes that show him modeling with the dead carcasses in front of the camera.<br />As the story progresses, Will visits Hannibal Lecter, who is now doing jail-time in maximum security.  With the help of Lecter's cunning mind, Will slowly finds the trail that leads him to Dolarhyde.  <br />Thomas Harris created a great monster in Hannibal Lecter but the stars of RED DRAGON are Francis Dolarhyde and Will Graham.  Harris created two very developed characters, giving the reader insight to what made both men tick.  A lot of flashbacks help the reader understand why Dolarhyde became the monster that he was in the present, and oddly enough, I felt a lot of pity and sympathy for this serial killer.   I found that I did not like the Will Graham character that Thomas Harris created in his book, preferring the movie version better.  Not that I found myself rooting for the killer, but it was an odd sensation finding myself liking a mass murderer and wishing that someone would save him.<br />Overall, I enjoyed this fast pace murder mystery.  For those of the faint-of-heart, this book is not recommended.  For those who love a great gory murder book, this is for you!	2002-11-10
1357464:US	51214937	R2CETJGF5EYP7Z	0316666343	784206304	The Lovely Bones	Books	5	11	12	N	N	One of the best books of 2002	The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold <br />Usually, one reads a book that is narrated by a character while events are happening. Other times we are seeing things as they happened years ago, and the narrator is telling the story in flashbacks.  And usually, this narrator is alive.  In THE LOVELY BONES, Alice Sebold uses a different technique.  The opening page reveals that the main character Susie Salmon was murdered on December 6, 1973, and is narrating her account of her own murder and what happens afterwards, as she sits and continues her \\"life\\" in heaven. She was 14 years old at the time of her death.<br />The book starts with Susie describing in detail her rape and murder.  The reader knows immediately who raped and killed Susie. It is a neighbor, Mr. Harvey, who always seemed harmless enough but was a little bit \\"off\\". During a cold snowy night, Susie is persuaded to follow Mr. Harvey into an underground shelter that he had built.  She says \\"I wish now that I had known this was weird\\", and goes into her feelings of hindsight, of how she should have known this was not normal, that she was in danger, but looking back she knew that she did not have a chance to escape.  She was only 14 years old and too small to have fought him off.<br />We see every little detail from Susie's point of view.  Only the reader knows what really happened to Susie.  There are no witnesses, and later, there is no body to be found.  Mr. Harvey, as the reader learns, did a thorough job of disposing all body parts so that no one would be able to find Susie or point to him as a possible suspect.<br />THE LOVELY BONES is a \\"whodunit\\" in reverse.  While we know who murdered Susie and how it was done, the \\"fun\\" part is watching the rest of the world solve the murder mystery.  On another level, THE LOVELY BONES is the story of how Susie's loved ones cope and deal with the tragic loss of a loved one.  We see how it changes and shapes her remaining siblings, one of whom was too young even to understand what death was all about.  We see how her friends and family move on, and how some of them cannot deal with her death, choosing to live in denial and run away.<br />After reading this book, I whole-heartedly agree with the many booklists that have officially proclaimed THE LOVELY BONES one of the best books of 2002.  It is one of those books that will be remembered not only for the story, but also for the way the story was told.  Alice Sebold did a remarkable job of telling the tale of murder and how it effects those that are left behind.	2002-10-30

The entrance of young Lomax into Noone's life is a godsend.  <br />Gabriel learns about Pete's hard life: being used and abused by his own parents, part of a child sex ring where Pete played a major role.  Pete now lives with a foster parent, and he is about to have his first major book published.  It is during this time that Pete and Gabriel become friends.<br />Their relationship grows into something akin to father and son, but with one catch: Gabriel never meets Pete.  They discuss everything under the sun: Gabriel's relationship with his father, with his ex lover, and about his writing. <br />Soon, seeds of doubt are planted in Gabriel's head.  During a phone conversation with Pete's foster mother, Gabriel notices a very big similarity with her voice and Pete's. After talking to his publicist, who is the one that is about to publish Pete's book, Gabriel is almost convinced that there is something wrong about Pete and whether he exists at all.  For one thing, Gabriel can't find a way to meet Pete.  There is always one excuse or another from either Pete or his foster mother.  <br />So, when one day Gabriel calls Pete and finds that the phone number is no longer in service, Gabriel decides to try to locate Pete.  With only a few clues, Gabriel makes the long drive from San Francisco to Wisconsin.<br />This was my first book by Armistead Maupin, and I have tosay that after I finished THE NIGHT LISTENER, I have become an Armistead Maupin fan.  I loved his writing style and his directness about a lot of issues that I find are normally skirted in every day life.  I finished this book in only a few days.  If I had more time I think I would have finished it in a few hours!	2002-10-30

Wonders Never Cease by Debra Salonen<br />Ben Jacobs is a police officer who is trying to create a canine unit in the small town of Bullion, California (near the town of Merced).  His dog Czar is his best friend and partner, and is trained to protect and defend anyone that Ben asks him to.  <br />So, Ben is shocked when Czar takes an instant liking to reporter Jill Martin.  Jill is on assignment and is supposed to interview the pair in regards to this new canine unit.  She is asked to put on a protective suit during this interview, and braces herself to be mauled by this huge dog.  It's love at first sight, and Jill totally enjoys the romp she has with the canine!<br />The article is printed in the local newspaper, but Jill finds that her words have been altered without her permission. The article makes herself look like she finds this new canine unit a horrible thing, when in fact she felt this was a wonderful idea and should be supported by the mayor and the city.  Jill begins to wonder if the article was tampered with for a reason.<br />An ex husband is in the picture, and Jill is not afraid to voice her opinions about Peter.  From mounting evidence that she has been collecting, she believes that he and his new wife Clarice are part of a bad business deal that is going to create a new community at the expense of the families that will be moving there.  Jill has found evidence of tainted water running underground, and knows that Peter and his business partners are aware of this.<br />As Jill continues her secret investigation of the project, things begin to happen.  Ben does not think at first that Jill's life is in danger, but when an apparent burglary attempt nearly costs her life and Czars, Ben knows that there is something terribly wrong, and does his best to find out.  <br />WONDERS NEVER CEASE is part of the Harlequin Super Romance line of books, and I was very surprised to find how much I enjoyed reading it.  The story was well developed and the characterswere a lot more developed than they would be in a \\"Harlequin Romance\\" or \\"Harlequin Presents\\" novel. The book did take an unusual twist, which I will not reveal here, but it certainly caught me by surprise!  The book read like a shorter version of a Mary Clark Higgins book, part romance and part \\"who-done-it\\".  I highly recommend this book for the romance reader that is looking for something a little bit more in-depth than a plain old fashioned Harlequin Romance.	2002-10-24

Taking place between the late 50's through the 70's, it's told in a rather light-hearted tone.  We see how they meet the loves of their lives, starting with Patty Jane's good-looking boyfriend Thor, who she ends up marrying and has the most wonderful time with, until she becomes pregnant with their first baby and things start to go downhill from there. One day, after a major fight, Thor disappears without a trace.  By this time their marriage has pretty much soured, and she immediately thinks that he's run off with another woman.  Reminders of Thor are everywhere, as he is the model for a famous breakfast cereal, and it's hard not to pass by the breakfast cereal aisle at the grocers without seeing his handsome face on a cereal box.<br />Harriet in the mean time meets the love of her life, Avel Ames, who they find out later is a multi-millionaire and owns the cereal company that eventually hires Thor to become their model.  Avel is no Thor, and in fact is inches shorter than Harriet and is not considered a very good-looking man.  But, what Avel lacked in looks, he made up in kindness and generosity.  Avel and Harriet are truly in love, and they plan to marry as soon as he returned from a business trip in South America, planned by his sisters who do not want him to marry Harriet.<br />Flashbacks describe their parents as alcoholics, parents who were not really there for their children, but it's all told in a rather funny and comical tone.   Because of this, it took me quite a few chapters before I even realized their parents had been alcoholics in the first place, probably because Patty Jane and Harriet did not know either.<br />As we find out, life doesn't ever go their way.  Harriet doesn't have her happily-ever-after, and soon drowns herself in liquor.  Patty Jane has lost Thor, but she puts her whole soul into a salon called Patty Jane's House of Curl, and their lives are now centered here.  All their friends and family are part of this salon, including Thor's mother Ione, and Patty's daughter Nora.<br />Don't think this is the end of the story.   There are plenty of surprises and laughs and tears to come. Harriet and Patty eventually find new loves to fill the voids left by Avel and Thor, but even then things don't turn out the way they want or expect.  The moral of this book: life goes on and you make of it what you will.  This is not going to be a classic by any means, but it's worth the time spent reading. A number of memorable characters and a somewhat convoluted story -- for a light read with some heavy issues, I recommend PATTY JANE'S HOUSE OF CURL.	2002-10-13

Maggie Stearn deals with the death of her husband with weekly group counseling sessions, and as the story opens, she is finally saying \\"goodbye\\" to Philip.  At this same session she, along with her other group-mates, learns that one of the group's members had just attempted suicide, and this leaves a heavy feeling of sorrow among the group.  Maggie goes home depressed with the knowledge of Tammi, but also knowing that Maggie's only daughter Katy is about to leave home for college.  The house, and her life, will soon be empty.<br />Maggie remembers something her counselor advised: sometimes one can help ease the pain of grief by contacting old friends from years gone by, rekindling old friendships from the past.  Feeling this is a good idea, she immediately telephones her best friend from her childhood, Brookie, and after all these years they reconnect.  It's been over 20 years since Maggie and her high school \\"gang\\" had been together in one place, and it was about time she called to tell them how she was doing.   As she pours her heart out to Brookie, Maggie feels happy again and she finds herself laughing over old times.<br />Brookie gives Maggie the phone numbers of all their friends, and soon, Maggie is talking to each one of them on the phone.  She finally comes to the last name, Eric Severson, who also happens to be her first love.  She forgets about the time difference and wakes up his wife and Eric who are fast asleep in bed, and with apologies to them both, she and Eric talk and start their long road to rediscovery.<br />Maggie loved her husband Phillip deeply, but Eric was her first love, and knowing he was a married man, she put thoughts of him out of her mind.  However, that soon becomes difficult when Maggie decides to move back home to Wisconsin to buy an old building and renovate it into a bed and breakfast.  An obvious turning point in her life, Maggie finds something to live for.  She puts her life with Philip behind her, and despite her daughter's protests, begins her new life back in her hometown, where memories of childhood and first love surround her.<br />Despite warnings from family, Maggie renews her old friendship with Eric, and with his help they rebuild the old historical home together, making plans and feeling energized and excited about the future.  Maggie knows her future lies alone, but is this what she really wants?  She does not want to admit she still loves Eric, and his place is beside his wife Nancy.  <br />I've read several LaVyrle Spencer novels, but I have to say this was by far my favorite.  For a romance novel, it wasn't the typical sappy sweet tale.  This story had twists and surprises, and it kept me in suspense until the very end.  Read about forbidden love in BITTER SWEET.	2002-10-03

She loses control of the car and ends up in an accident, losing consciousness.  If it hadn't been for volunteer fireman Taylor McAden coming to the rescue, she would have surely died.  <br />As Taylor is seeing to it that Denise is ok, Denise looks behind her car seat for her son Kyle, and discovers he is missing.  The back door is open, and Taylor admits he did not know there was a boy in the car with her.  She's in a panic, mainly because Kyle is not a normally adjusted child.  For some unknown reason, Kyle has a problem with language, and will not come if someone were to call out his name.  Knowing this, the search for Kyle would be impossible, especially since the car crash was near a swampy area known to lose people in normal weather.  The odds of finding Kyle were pretty slim.<br />Denise is taken to the hospital, while the search continues for the young 5-year old.  Taylor, who seems to have the gift of finding and rescuing people, miraculously finds Kyle hiding in a duck blind, unharmed.  Mother and son are reunited.<br />Denise and Taylor develop a mutual attraction for each other, and slowly they start up a friendship that soon becomes a romance.  Taylor seems to be the man of Denise's dreams, and to top it off he loves Kyle.  Most persons who have met Kyle are awkward with him, because of his speech impediments and his learning disabilities.  But, not Taylor.  He treats little Kyle as a normal healthy boy, and soon Kyle becomes attached to his mother's new friend.  Taylor is Kyle's hero and the father he never had.  Denise watches as Kyle begins to develop better language skills and he does things he never was able to do before.  He plays catch with Taylor.  He rides on roller coasters.  Kyle's life is totally changed.  He slowly comes out of his shell.<br />In the meantime, Denise and Taylor become closer.  Things are going wonderfully well until they attend a party held by Taylor's closest friends Mitch and Melissa. Mitch is his childhood friend and together they are part of the volunteer fireman group.  Melissa is like the sister Taylor never had, and she teases him throughout the gathering, asking whether he is going to marry Denise.  Taylor reacts by choking on his food, and becomes distant the rest of the evening. <br />Unsurprisingly, their relationship turns for the worse. Instead of seeing Denise every day and every night, Taylor uses work as an excuse for not coming by.  He shuts her out, just as he did with every other girlfriend he's had.  But, the difference between the other women and Denise is that Taylor really loves Denise, and he had felt that she was someone special in his life. So, why the change in behavior?  Denise spends many nights in tears, wondering what had happened to the relationship that she so hesitantly opened her heart to.  After years of not trusting any man to come into her life, she decided to trust Taylor.  <br />Obviously, there was a reason for Taylor's turnabout behavior.  No one knows why he is unable to commit to any woman, but Denise eventually finds out.  It's a tragic past that has held Taylor a prisoner, and it is up to those around him to set him free.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed THE RESCUE.  I've read a number of books by Nicholas Sparks, and I have to say that this is one of my favorites so far.  For those of you who enjoy a good romance and tearjerker, this one is for you.	2002-09-28

It's a novel that is based on the legend of the woman who, for a few years, became Pope of the Roman Catholic Church back in the 9th century.  In this version of the story, Joan is born to a Canon (member of the clergy) and a German heathen who was forced to convert to Catholicism when her village was pillaged and captured by the Roman Catholics.  At an early age, against her father's wishes Joan learns to read and write, and is favored by Aesculapius, a travelling bishop of the Greek Church, who encourages Joan's reading abilities and eventually finds a way to continue giving her lessons. <br />She is taken to a school along with her brother to be further educated.  Because she cannot live with the boys in their dormitory, she and her brother are invited to live with a nobleman named Gerrold and his family, and her life becomes intertwined with Gerrold's from that day forward.  She is only 13 when she meets him, and he is twenty-five, but Gerrold is attracted to her, to his wife's dismay. <br />After her brother dies in a Viking attack that kills many others, including Gerrold's wife, Joan runs away and decides to take her brother's place in the monastery where he was to receive an education, and in order to do so she disguises herself as a young boy.  From this point, she lives her public life as a boy, and later as a man, because as a woman she would never be able to live the life she had always dreamed about.  As a woman, she was expected to be married at the proper age and to bear children for her husband. There were no other options for a woman of her day.  But Joan had ambition and knew that the life of a woman was not for her.<br />Donna Woolfolk Cross tells a wonderful tale in the story of Pope Joan's short life and how she was able to work her way up to the top position of the Church.   Her life was extraordinary by any standards and how she was able to fool the public and become Pope is close to a miracle. POPE JOAN is an ambitious novel, telling the fictitious tale of a woman that history has not quite determined whether she exists or not.	2002-09-25

White Oleander opens with Astrid having a conversation with her mother Ingrid, alluding to death and oleanders.   It is a hint of what has just transpired.  We then zoom back to a few months, when Ingrid and Astrid are introduced to Barry Kolker, who becomes a pivotal person in their lives.  He unknowingly sets in motion a series of events that would change and rip apart their lives forever.<br />Barry falls in love with Ingrid, a free-spirited poet with a bohemian attitude, and despite the fact that they are from totally different worlds she falls for him.  Not at first --- it takes Ingrid a bit of convincing, or so we are led to believe.  But soon she is obsessed with him, and young Astrid starts to dream of having a real family, with a real father.  Ingrid never believed in fathers, and never explained to Astrid who her father was or why he left them.  And so Astrid begins to fantasize that Barry could be that father she never had.  It is surely a dream come true.<br />But, as all good things come to an end, so did Barry's infatuation for Ingrid.  It is never explained why he leaves Ingrid for another woman, but the fact of the matter is Ingrid cannot get over it.  She begins to obsess over him.  Her behavior worries Astrid, especially when she sees her mother mixing up a poisonous concoction of oleander and herbs and constantly talks of revenge.  <br />We then flash forward, and Ingrid is in prison, serving time for the murder of Barry Kolker, and Astrid is being treated for depression. Eventually, they place her in her first permanent foster home.<br />As she bounces from one home to the next, Astrid encounters different types of foster parents, different types of horrors that scar her, different types of obsessions that overtake her.  When she thinks she's finally met someone in her life that can bring her happiness, something happens to take that person away from her.  <BR>I found myself becoming tired and depressed each time I thought Astrid finally had found the family that would be her permanent home, only to have something ruin it. <br />While she is being bounced from one home to another, Astrid corresponds with her mother.  With each letter, Astrid's perceptions of her mother change.  Astrid had always loved her mother and worshipped her.  But, with each new letter and each new home, Astrid begins to see a different side of her mother. Her eyes begin to open with the help of the hard life she leads, and Ingrid begins to see that she is losing her hold on her daughter.  The relationship that they once had falls apart.  An older and wiser Astrid sees her mother now for who she really is, and with that knowledge, she begins to find herself.<br />I very much enjoyed White Oleander.  Although there was a section of the book that I found somewhat anti-climatic, overall the book moved fast and I found myself totally immersed in the person that was Astrid.  Her changing relationship with her mother, which was the main theme in this book, was what i found most fascinating.  Janet Fitch did a wonderful job showing the growth of a single character from a shy insecure young girl to a hardened young woman that was confident about where she came from and where she was going.	2002-09-20

Waiting to Exhale by Terry McMillan  <br />After having read HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK two years ago, I've been looking forward to reading another Terry McMillan novel.  WAITING TO EXHALE is about four thirty-something African-American women who have one problem: MEN.  <br />Savannah is an executive who is trying to find Mr. Right.  She always seems to think she's found Mr. Right, always on the verge of finding the man of her dreams, but she always finds out in the end that the guy is just another jerk.  <br />Gloria is a very overweight but stylish woman who owns a hair salon in Phoenix.  It's THE place for black persons to get their hair and nails done, and Gloria has done pretty well for herself and her young son.  The man in her past is her son's father, a man she never married, but it seems that deep down she wants more from him than just a friendship.  <br />Bernadine WAS married to a highly successful businessman, until he decides to take off with his young white bookkeeper and leave Bernadine with the house, the expensive car, and the kids.  <br />And Robin is this highly intelligent woman that keeps attracting losers.  Unfortunately for Robin, she has no idea they're losers. She seems to be totally blind to that fact.<br />There's a lot of humor and fun in WAITING TO EXHALE.  As each woman deals with her own man problems, their friendships keep each either from going insane.  I loved watching Bernadine as she set fire to her husband's BMW.  I crossed my fingers each time Savannah met yet another eligible bachelor.  I prayed that Gloria would find someone to share her life with.  And I wanted to smack Robin around a bit, every time she went back to her loser boyfriend Russell.  <br />I enjoyed this book a lot and had a good time with it.  What I enjoyed about it the most were the characters: Terry McMillan writes characters that are so vivid in my mind that they jump off the page and become real.  Even her most shy and most insecure characters seem to have such depth to them. I feel that she's got a gift that not all writers seem to share, and that is to make the reader want to know her characters, and if not that, at least we have a good idea what her characters are all about.	2002-09-18

Just as Johannes Vermeer painted this anonymous girl back in the 1660's, author Tracy Chevalier painted a beautiful picture of the world of 17th century Holland and the world of this young girl who eventually becomes the subject of one of his paintings.  <br />Ms Chevalier's story starts with the introduction of Griet, a young teenage girl who lives with her parents and younger sister in a very humble home in the town of Delft.  She is helping chop vegetables in their kitchen when her parents receive a visit from two stately looking guests.  Griet finds out soon enough that this couple is Johannes Vermeer the painter, and his lovely wife Catharina.  Johannes notices how Griet is separating the vegetables by color and his observation does not go unnoticed by Griet.  This first brief encounter between them is the spark that starts their new \\"relationship\\".<br />Griet learns then that she is expected in a few days to start working for the Vermeers as their maid.  Griet's father is no longer able to work due to an accident he had on the job, and now it is up to Griet to help the family out.  Her older brother has already left home, and is learning to make a living at what their father used to do: Make tiles. <br />A few days later, Griet is living with the Vermeer's and their children and servants.  They live lavishly for these times, and Griet soon becomes accustomed to her new life.  She returns on weekends to visit her family, but she has to stay with the Vermeers during the workweek. <br />Griet has many duties as a maid, including doing the laundry and helping out with the children.  She slowly bonds with the children, all except Cornelia, who seems to be a trouble maker and tries her best to get Griet into trouble with her parents.  This becomes especially evident when, for somereason, Johannes decides to make Griet his assistant, on top of all the duties Griet has to perform as their maid.  Because of Catharina's jealousies, his wife is not to know about this special role that Griet was about to play in the house.  With the help of Catharina's mother, Griet finds ways to secretly help Johannes \\"grind\\" his colors and do other necessary things to help him prepare for painting, in the hopes that Catharina doesn't find out.  <br />Griet falls in love with his paintings, and with him.  And soon, all she can think about is him.  Since she is now his special assistant, she is privy to his private world of painting, a world that even Catharina is not allowed to trespass.  Through the eyes of Griet the reader sees how Vermeer created his beautiful works of art, using a creation that was the forerunner of today's camera.  A new world opens up for Griet. Because of this, Griet also knows that she is headed towards danger of losing her job.  <br />GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING in my opinion was a literary work of art.  Maybe I was heavily influenced by the cover, which depicts the actual painting of this girl that Vermeer made famous back in the 17th century.  Regardless of the reason, I personally enjoyed this fictional tale of the creation of one of Holland's most famous paintings of the renaissance era.	2002-09-03

She's a lawyer, who along with her partner Mark Biscardi, make up the law firm of Rosato and Biscardi.  Business is going great.  Her love life isn't, on the other hand.  Mark, who was once her lover, is now dating one of their junior lawyers, Eve, and although Bennie's angry as hell, she doesn't have anything against Mark.  Eve, on the other hand, she does not trust one bit.<br />Soon, there is trouble at the office.  Mark informs her that he is planning on starting over by forming a brand new law firm, leaving Rosato and Biscardi behind.  Shortly after their argument, Mark is found dead in his office, and because he has named Bennie as his main beneficiary, she is the main suspect.  Before long, she is on the run and she doesn't know whom she can trust.  The law firm's success was bogus, and after much investigating she finds out that Mark had been planning to leave the partnership quite a while ago, bringing Eve along with him.  <br />Mark isn't the only one found dead.  Soon, there are others, and Bennie knows that the deaths are all connected.  Could they all have something to do with a case she had been working on?  It was hard to tell.  But as the newspaper headlines blare out her name on the front page, she finds that she is having a hard time coming out of hiding and returning to a normal life.<br />With the help of Grady, another lawyer from the law firm, she does a lot of researching and investigating, and slowly learns the truth of why Mark and all the others had been murdered.  <br />I'm not a big fan of legal crime dramas, but I did enjoy LEGAL TENDER.  I've read other crime novels, and found this one relatively easy to follow.  It was fast paced and it took me only a few days to read it.  I did feel that a lot of the plot was predictable, but this didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book.  It only helped to make thebook go that much faster.  I would highly recommend it, but do not think the typical fan of legal crime dramas would enjoy it as much.	2002-09-01

The Frog King by Adam Davies<br />The debut novel by Adam Davies, THE FROG KING is one of the most intense books I have read this past year.  When I say \\"intense\\", I'm not talking about physical events such as a highly detailed murder scene, or something out of a Stephen King novel.  \\"Intense\\" in this book was emotional involvement.  I found myself so angry at times that I have to give Adam Davies credit for creating such a real-life character.  <br />THE FROG KING centers on one person, Harry Driscoll, and his pathetic life.  Harry is an assistant editor at a high profile publishing house, PRESTIGE, but despite the fact that he has a JOB, he doesn't seem to get it.  He's constantly late, drinks on the job, and continues to fail the simplest tasks.  And he's been there for YEARS. <br />He also seems to fail at women.  He's dating a really nice gal from work, and he constantly jerks her around.  His whole life is full of lies, and no matter what situation he's in, he doesn't seem to know how to give a straight story.  This includes his life with Evie.  He is constantly unfaithful to her, but yet never comes clean when she asks him.  And, to top it all, Harry loves Evie with his whole heart and soul.  His life is all about Evie.  He just never learned how to love.  He can't even say the WORD love.   It was a wonder that Evie stuck with him as long as she did.  <br />His life at home isn't any fun either.  Because he barely earns enough money to make a living, he doesn't have much of a choice when it comes to living arrangements.  He lives illegally with a roommate that spends half the time threatening Harry.  A few times we see the wrath of this roommate, and eventually Harry needs to seek housing elsewhere. <br />The reader watches as Harry slowly spirals downward into self-destruction.  I personally had a hard time liking this character, and I still am not sure whether I wanted to see him self destruct at the end or save himself.  On the other hand, a novel that canmake me this angry at a character is a commentary on how well the writer portrayed Harry Driscoll.  The reader got inside his head and saw what made him tick.  We saw every ugly thing about him, but we also saw what few redeeming qualities he had, too.  It is these few redeeming qualities that save Harry in the end.<br />Do I recommend this book?

For fans of the Little House on the Prairie books by Laura Ingalls Wilder, JEANNIE, A TEXAS FRONTIER GIRL is a similar type of book written for children, depicting life in the wild untamed land that was Texas, seen through the eyes of a 12 year old girl.<br />Along with her friends, family, her horse Diamond and her loyal dog Ole Blue, Jeannie has adventures that bring her close to life threatening danger every day.  Encounters with American Indians, rattle snakes, and tornadoes are all part of every day life for a child of these times.  And Jeannie is a tomboy who would rather be outdoors climbing a haystack than sewing a dress indoors with her mother.  The character of Jeannie reminded me somewhat of young Laura Ingalls (based on the television series depiction of the author).  She has spirit and a curiosity that puts her in potential danger all the time, but her faith in God and her belief in prayer always saves the day.<br />JEANNIE, A TEXAS FRONTIER GIRL was a treat to read.  I had a few problems with incorrect historical facts (For example: Ms. Horan had the people celebrating \\"President's Day\\", but in fact \\"President's Day\\" didn't come about till the 20th century) but the story in itself would be fun to read for any child.	2002-08-26

The actual story takes place during one summer in the 1950's in a rural area of Ireland called Wicklow. However, through the ramblings in her mind, the reader is taken back to her past, where she goes over memories of her dear father, whom she has on a pedestal. <br />Her grand niece and nephew have come to stay for the summer, and so Annie and her cousin Sarah must deal with a big change.  Taking care of children isn't easy, especially for two elderly spinster ladies such as Annie and Sarah.  However,  the children take to Annie as it was meant to be, while Sarah hovers in the background and watches.  <br />It is Sarah's home that Annie lives in, so Annie helps out with the daily chores that need to be done in a rural area like this.  Daily chores include retrieving eggs from the hen house and hand-washing of clothes.  Making butter and bread is all done by hand.  (To Annie's disgust,  people in the city buy their bread and butter pre-made!)  Their life is a simple one, far from the modern contrivances of the day. <br />Annie considers herself a lucky woman for having a home despite being a spinster and having a hump on her back.   She was never considered marraige material and has lived with family members from year to year.  Sarah took Annie into her home after Annie's sister Maud had passed away and her widow decided to remarry.  Now, the threat of moving on is back.  It appears that Sarah is being courted by a neighbor, Billy Kerr, who Annie thinks is at least 20 years Sarah's junior.  This whole idea has Annie worked up and more flustered than usual.  She's appalled that this could be happening, and is worried about what the neighbors would think.<br />On top of all this, Annie has witnessed something strange going on between her neice and nephew, something that could be very inappropriate.  The wholeincident has Annie worried and troubled.  <br />I enjoyed reading Annie Dunne.  Although the story itself was somewhat lacking, for I felt there was not enough substance to this book, the book itself was beautifully written.  The beauty of this book was  Barry's descriptions of the beautiful pastoral world of Annie Dunne and the precise characterizations that made Annie and the other characters come to life. One could almost hear the pristine silence of the green Irish countryside and the laughter of children, and see the humpbacked image of Annie Dunne living in the beauty that is Ireland.  I recommend this book for those readers that yearn for books about the Ireland of long ago.	2002-08-23

History shows that Mary did exist; this book is a fictionalized tale of what her life could have been like.<br />The book begins with a brief explanation of the demise of her father, who decided to take part in the riots that protested the taking away of 11 days that year.  It was part of the process to correct the calendar, but many felt that this was an infringement of their rights, and Mary's father let his voice be heard.  His reward was prison, where he eventually died.  Mary was 5 years old. The book then fast forwards to eleven years later, and Mary Saunders is in the same jail, awaiting the same fate as her father's. <br />Mary's life was never easy, but it was all she knew.  Her home life was horrible after her father was taken to jail and her mother remarried.  Mary's stepfather favored only his own children, and so her own mother treated Mary terribly.  Mary is eventually thrown out into the streets and she never sees her family again.  She does learn one thing from her mother: one is born into one's station of life, and one can never change it.  <br />Mary learns the way of the streets with the help of her new friend Doll Higgins.  After Mary is thrown out of her family's home, Doll finds Mary lying in the alleys close to death, and nurses her back to health.  Learning from Doll, Mary begins to make a living as a slammerkin.  Mary's one weakness is her love of fine clothing, and in order to live the life she wishes, she needs to live the life of the slammerkin.  It is all in a day's work.<br />Mary and Doll live together for months, but due to a serious cough, Doll convinces Mary to move into a hospital where she would get free board and meals if she promises to follow the straight and narrow road.  Mary gets cleaned up, and learns a few new skills that could help her lead a life away from the streets of London.   She eventually finds her way to an old school friend of her mother's, Jane Jones, and Mary soon finds herself employed by the Jones' in their home and dress shop.  It seems that Mary's life is turning for the better.  However, Mary's restless spirit has other plans for her.  <br />I found SLAMMERKIN a very fascinating book.  The author made this book feel real and authentic, by obviously doing a lot of research into the life of the slammerkin and life in London of the late 18th century in general. Although the fate of Mary Saunders is pretty much known from the beginning of the book, the author wrote the book in a way that kept my interest at a peak throughout the entire story.  A very well written novel, I highly recommend Slammerkin for fans of historical fiction.	2002-08-18

GRAND AVENUE by Joy Fielding<br />Grand Avenue is yet another story about women friendships.  However, what makes this one different is the tone of the book, and the fast pace at which the plot proceeds.  Four women become friends years ago after meeting each other at a playground, each of them having babies somewhat close in age.  As the children grow, so do their relationships.  They become very close friends, although each of the women is very different.  Barbara was an ex-beauty queen who always appeared in front of her friends well dressed and perfectly coifed.  Her insecurities were always showing up on the surface, although her demeanor said otherwise.   Susan is going to college and by mid book, she is working for a magazine. Chris had a husband that seemed to be a little bit too uptight and controlling, and Vicki was the power-house of an attorney, the one that was in the spotlight all the time, at work and at home.<br />It all sounds like a very generic book, but it isn't.  As the reader finds out from the very first pages, something terrible happens to two of the women.  It is said flat out that two of them die.  And one is brutally murdered.  <br />And then the book begins.<br />I dont think I need to say much else about GRAND AVENUE.  It's one of the best books in this genre that I've read all year.  Fast paced and all the makings of a great motion picture,  I highly recommend this book to others who enjoy reading a \\"chick book\\" with the added variety of a murder.	2002-08-17

The book opens with Anjali waiting for her husband Prakash to pick her up at the train station to take her home. Prakash is very late.  On that fateful day on December 3, 1984, the gas explosion from the Union Carbide factory in Bhopal, India, only a few miles away from the train station, spews out gas fumes for miles around, killing or physically harming anyone that comes in contact with it. Hundreds die or are taken ill. Anjali feels a horrible pain in her lungs as she tries to breathe. She cannot fathom what is happening to herself and to those around her. She loses consciousness, and wakes up to find herself in a hospital bed.<br />The events from this day have a dramatic effect on Anjali's life.  Not only does she develop a horrible debilitating asthma that stays with her for the rest of her life, but also she finds out that the reason her husband was late in picking her up at the train station was that he was busy with a lover.  Despite Indian customs and traditions, and the fact that her parents strongly disapproved her actions, she divorces Prakash.   <br />Years later, we find Anjali happily married to another man, her second husband Sandeep. Her life with Sandeep is very complete. They are still in love after 15 years of marriage. They have a son, Amar, who is their pride and joy. But there is one problem --- because of the effects the gas explosion had on Anjali, Amar was born with so many birth defects that the doctors did not think he would live. He's had numerous surgeries to fix his ailing heart and lungs, but these surgeries are only temporary relief for this poor boy who is destined to live a short life. Despite his ill health and his inability to live the life of a normal healthy boy, Amar seems happy enough, enjoying each day as it comes. Anjali and Sandeepare very proud of him.<br />A chance meeting with Prakash one day changes Anjali's life once again.  She loves Sandeep, and nothing will ever change that.  But because of doubts that have been planted in her mind by her parents, she soon begins to wonder if she had made a mistake by not trying harder to be the good wife of Prakash.  On the other hand, she still feels deep anger at him and blames him for her poor health and the poor health of her son Amar.  Prakash as well finds himself angry that Anjali had left him.  He had also remarried, and he loves his wife, but now he finds himself comparing her to Anjali.  Who was the better wife?<br />Sandeep starts to doubt Anjali's love for him, thinking that she has loved Prakash all along. He keeps these feelings to himself, afraid to voice them.  Anjali senses something wrong, and becomes frustrated knowing that there is something big troubling Sandeep.<br />A BREATH OF FRESH AIR by Amulya Malladi is a great first novel.  Malladi uses the backdrop of India of the 70's and 80's to tell the story of a woman who was born to a society of strict morals, but learns to be independent and march to her own drummer. It is the story of how a major tragedy changed the life of one naive girl, and helped open her eyes to the real world. It took a life-threatening event for her to see what true happiness was all about. I recommend this book, especially to those who have read other fine fiction that has been set in India.  Having just read  A FINE BALANCE by Rohinton Mistry, I was very eager to read Malladi's book.  I was not disappointed.	2002-07-27

Young Leo Suther is about to turn 18 and is getting ready to find out what life outside of school is all about.  He's got a new girl, Allie Donovan, who he's desperately in lust with. Her father, Chick Donovan, soon becomes his mentor and he's offered a job to help Chick build houses.  It's Leo's first \\"real\\" job, and it makes him feel like a man.  With Allie by his side and a great job, life is looking good.  <br />His home life isn't all that bad either. He and his father live side by side, sharing their love of the blues every night and playing music along with their family friend Ryder.  Katie Faye, Leo's mother, had died years ago from cancer, and his memories of her have faded, but are being kept alive by his father's love for her.  Throughout the novel, references to Katie's life are made, and her story unfolds as Leo learns about a mother who loved poetry and whose biggest desire before she died was to go to Paris.  Her story helps shape Leo's future, as the reader soon finds out.<br />Leo is at a turning point in his life. With only one more year left of high school and a good job with Chick, Leo is ready to leave school and start a family of his own.  He fantasizes about living with Allie and their many kids.  This fantasy life of his puts blinders on Leo, as he finds out too late how Allie feels about him.   And with problems of her own, Allie soon turns her back on Leo, leaving Leo feeling alone and frustrated.  As their relationship hits rocky ground, Leo's life starts to fall apart, and he soon sees that not only has Allie's feelings for him have changed, but all around him friends and acquaintances are moving on.  Change is in the air, and Leo isn't sure if he's ready for it.<br />I can't really say enough about BLUESMAN.  It's a complex story composed of many layers.  Leo's issues with Allie, with her father, and even his mother, are at the root of Leo's story.  Political issues of the day are not the main focus, but help add to the story line. Communism, the Vietnam War, the attitudes of the late 60's, are all underlying themes of this book.   It's not an easy read but I would definitely recommend this for it's beautiful prose and descriptions throughout the book. It's a great coming of age story, and if nothing else will leave with the reader memories of a time in history that has left a mark on many today.	2002-07-27
1473496:US	51214937	R2A28C3CE7ZDRJ	140003065X	366389334	A Fine Balance	Books	5	7	9	N	Y	"This Tragedy is not  a fiction:  All is true"-----	\\"This Tragedy is not a fiction: All is true\\"-----<br />Honore De Balzac's quote from Le Pere Goriot opens the book A FINE BALANCE by Rohinton Mistry. <br />And what a tragedy!  This piece of fiction-that-is-true-to-life takes place during the State of Emergency, Indira Ghandi's attempt during the mid 70's and 80's in bringing about great change to a country that was ravaged by poverty and corruption.  The four central characters, Dina Dalal, Maneck Kohlah, and nephew and uncle Omprahkash and Ishvar, come together through fate, and change each other's lives forever.  The evidence of class differences among the different castes is obvious as we learn about these four characters and what brought them to this point in their lives.   <br />Dina lived the life of the middle class, living in relative comfort for a good part of her life.  Maneck grew up in the country, but his parents owned a store and they lived a modestly comfortable life as well.  The tailors, Omprahkash and Ishvar, lived the lives of the lowest levels, but sought to make something out of their lives by breaking tradition and learning a new trade, that of making clothes.<br />A whopping 600 pages, A FINE BALANCE is a story of the every day struggles of these four persons, who would probably never have met if it weren't for fate.  They start out as strangers, but after living together and working together to stay alive, they become good friends.   <br />The book starts with Maneck taking a train trip to town to meet Dina Dalal, a widow living alone and making a modest living as a seamstress.  She happens to be an old school friend of his mother's, so this seemed to be the perfect arrangement by renting a room from Dina.  The extra income was to help her make ends meet, as she could barely make enough money to pay the rent.  <br />Maneck is a college student, who was so unhappy living in the college dorms that his mother helped him out by contacting this old school friend of hers.  He was looking for somepeace and quiet, and a chance to finish his schooling and start a new life and career.<br /> The two tailors, Omprahkash and Ishvar, are trying to make a new life for themselves after a devastating tragedy causes the death of their entire family. They learn that Dina is a seamstress that is looking for workers, and so they travel to the city and run into Maneck before they even know that Maneck himself is searching for Dina's apartment.  <br />The reason for the length of this book is that Mistry chooses to go into great detail the background of each of the four main characters.  However, without this background, the reader will fail to learn the true meaning of what really happened in India during these troubled times of The Emergency.  Mistry is able to depict with great imagery the poverty and suffering amongst many of India's poorest citizens.   Whether Maneck's end is realistic or not, or the fate of the tailors is true-to-life, I cannot say.  But what I CAN say is that this book was so engrossing that it took me only eight days to read it.  Mistry has a fine talent for literature, and I will certainly read anything else he decides to put his mark on.  As an American, it is hard for me to truly understand the type of lives these four led in A FINE BALANCE. But it certainly opened my eyes to another part of this world, and that not all peoples are as privileged or perhaps as lucky as we are.	2002-07-16

Together, they live on a plantation called Roseberry.  The story is told from the view points of several family members from both sides of the family, in particular China, who in the beginning of the book, we are told, is old and waiting to die.   Her granddaughter Abolene is living with her across the road from Roseberry, along with Abolene's young baby daughter Cally.  <br />As China tells us her story, the reader slowly learns about the family's early days at Roseberry, and how Jennis Redd, a white man, fathered a child with Cally, a slave owned by Jennis. The child was named Cleavis, and due to a \\"misunderstanding\\", Cleavis is sold for stealing a set of abalone pearls that belong to Jennis' wife, and thus Cleavis is taken away forever.  In turn, Cally takes revenge on the white Redd's by stealing the pearls, which are then handed down from generation to generation, stories of superstition and luck surrounding the pearls.<br />As the story progresses, we learn of the different generation members that follow, until we end with Abolene's story.  At the same time, we follow the history of the white Redd's that ends with Coyle Redd, the son of an abusive father and a mother who China works for. <br />HOME ACROSS THE ROAD by Nancy Peacock is told in the same easy-going simple prose that made her debut novel LIFE WITHOUT WATER so charming.  Unfortunately, this same style does not work for her second novel.  I found this second novel lacking, and although the book had so much potential, spanning 5 generations from the days of slavery to the early 1970's, it seemed to fizzle out before it ended.  The story in itself was fascinating, but unfortunately the telling of the story was not.  However, because I so enjoyed her debut novel, this book does not discourage me from reading future books written by Nancy Peacock.	2002-07-14

Unlike her first novel, THE JOY LUCK CLUB, THE KITCHEN GOD'S WIFE takes place mostly in the past.   <br />Pearl and her mother Winnie have never had a very good relationship.  Winnie criticizes Pearl often, and makes it unpleasant for Pearl whenever they come to visit.  The book opens with Pearl, her non-Asian husband Phil, and their two young children making the drive to San Francisco to attend a family wedding.   <br />Everyone in the family is there at the wedding, including close family friends and relatives that have been a part of Winnie's life since her days back in China in the early `20's and `30's.  An argument breaks out between Pearl and Winnie at the wedding, but before Pearl and her family return home, she and her mother talk.  The story that Pearl hears from her mother is a story she has never heard before.  It is a secret that Winnie has kept from her daughter for decades, for fear of hurting Pearl. Pearl herself has a secret, but it becomes secondary as Winnie's story unfolds.<br />Winnie's modern day world was a lifetime away from her early beginnings in China.  She was born to a woman that was one of many wives belonging to a man Winnie knew as her father.  He was a stranger to her, never giving her the time of day.  Winnie's mother was beautiful and educated, and together they lived the life of the pampered rich because of her mother's station in life.  Winnie's life turns for the worse when her mother disappears for reasons unknown to the young girl.  Winnie finds herself losing the protective life she had with her mother, the home she grew up in, and placed in the home of a distant relative, to be treated like a second class citizen. Her life is never the same again.<br />Because of her new station in life, Winnie is destined to never marry, but through a fluke of fate, she ends up marrying a man thatshould have been destined for her cousin Peanut.  However, after they are married, Winnie finds out that this husband is not the romantic wonderful man he appeared to be during the beginning of their courtship.   From this point in her life, she knows only unhappiness and suffering.<br />Winnie has to endure much during this marriage, including abuse, countless miscarriages and loss of children to sickness and poverty, and with the outbreak of war in China, she does not know what her future will be like.  What finally brings her to America and to the husband that Pearl knows as her father, is for the reader to find out.<br />I highly recommend THE KITCHEN GOD'S WIFE.  Although this book is not as fast a read as THE JOY LUCK CLUB, I found that the history of Winnie was fascinating, taking me to a country that I know so little about.  The story of Pearl becomes second to Winnie's, but Winnie's story bridges the two stories together, as the reader finds by the end of the book.	2002-07-14

She's used to being the loner, the odd one out, the kid that always got picked last for softball.  Everyone likes her, but for some reason Myra always subconsciously pushes people away. <br />She spends her days working as a nurse for a temp agency, going from one patient's house to another.  Her patients' illnesses vary.  One old man, Dewitt, has a wound that needs to be dressed every day.  Rose is another elderly patient. She's diabetic and Myra helps take care of her daily needs along with administering her insulin injections.   Grace is a teenage mother, learning how to cope with a new baby and trying to decide whether to give her baby up for adoption.<br />And then there is Chip Reardon.  Chip is a cancer patient, but he also happens to be someone she grew up with and had a big crush on in high school.  Chip was the most popular boy in high school, so when Myra finds out that he has brain cancer, she immediately wants to be the one to help him through his last months. This is her chance to get close to him like she never did in high school. <br />As Myra and Chip get reacquainted, she starts to fall in love with him.  Things get complicated when an old flame of Chip's, Diann, asks to see him, and Myra offers Diann her extra bedroom, since Diann lives too far away to do an easy commute.  As one can imagine, this is not easy for Myra, but being the person that she is, she watches in the wings as Diann and Chip renew their romance from years past, and Myra fights back the jealous rage that she feels.  But it's not only jealousy that she feels, but sorrow, as Chip's life fades away before her eyes.<br />I enjoyed reading Never Change.  As always, Elizabeth Berg depicted characters with such depth that made them so real to me.  I was able to sympathize with the characters, and felt a great respect for Myra, who was able to deal with and cope with a friend's death.  This is another great book by Elizabeth Berg that fans will not want to pass up.  It's probably one of her best novels.	2002-06-30

The book centers on Amanda and her niece Ruth, and a mystery behind the death of Amanda's sister and Ruth's mother, Mathilda.  The story is told in bits and pieces, at times told by Ruth at various ages and other times by Amanda, also at various ages.  The reader learns from each character what really happened that cold winter night, as Ruth tries to remember her past and Amanda tries to forget it. For Ruth, it is a struggle to remember what happened when her mother died, because she was only a toddler.  Her memories are of water, a baby crying, and drowning with her mother.  But with Amanda's narration, we learn that there is a secret buried with the past, and only Amanda knows the true story.  For Amanda, this secret is so horrible that she tells no one. <br />Carl, Mathilda's husband, comes home from the War to find his wife has died, but he doesn't know how she died except for the lies that Amanda tells him.  He struggles to fit in, finding that Ruth is more attached to her Aunt than to him.  Amanda does her best to bond with Ruth, but as time passes, she settles in with the role that Carl plays in this little family, as if Mathilda never existed. <br />We watch Ruth grow from a very insecure child to a young adult ready to be independent and free.  She befriends Imogene, a girl that helps Ruth become accepted by their peers. But as their friendship blossoms, Amanda becomes nervous, afraid of a truth that may come out, but also afraid that she is losing Ruth to another.   Amanda's possessiveness alienates her from Ruth, and soon the secrets come out.<br />I highly recommend Drowning Ruth.   Not only did Christina Schwarz do a good job painting images of life in rural Wisconsin during the early 1900's, but she wrote a story in such a way that keeps the reader on edge till the very end.   I found the ending rather anticlimactic, because it was certainly notwhat I had anticipated.   Still, I was very pleased with the ending, and am looking forward to reading more by Ms Schwarz.	2002-06-25

Chocolat - by Joanne Harris<br />Here is a book filled with magic and smells and tastes that had me craving chocolate and sweets the entire time I was reading it!   Chocolat is the story of an unmarried woman, Vianne Rocher, her 6-year-old daughter Anouk, and their impact on a small French town called Lansquenet.  Lansquenet is a very Catholic place, and the townspeople (parishioners) are very structured in the way they lead their lives.  Church on Sunday, abstinence during Lent - only a handful dares to disobey these traditions.  Vianne comes to town with a mission  - to show these people how to live and love and enjoy life to the fullest.<br />Enter Pere Reynaud. He's the head of the local church, the shepherd for his sheep of followers.  He hides behind the cloth and believes that what he preaches is for the good of the church and in the name of God.  However, a lot of hate and prejudice underlies what he preaches in the chapel.  He instantly sees Vianne as the enemy (her being unmarried has Reynaud labeling her from the start). Vianne, with her instincts and sixth sense, sees all this, and decides to help the town overcome Reynaud's unhealthy grip on their lives.<br />She soon opens up a chocolate shop in the middle of Lent, shocking the townspeople and Reynaud especially, but soon she wins many of the townspeople over.   We are introduced to many interesting characters, all of whom become Vianne's friends and supporters, including Roux, a rough-looking vagrant gypsy, and Armande an older woman with the spirit of a younger one.  <br />The book heads towards a climax with the announcement of a Chocolate festival at Easter.  At first the town splits into factions, and the reader is left to guess who will win - Pere Reynaud, or Vianne Rocher.<br />Told in the viewpoints of two narrators, Vianne and Pere Reynaud, the reader learns slowly of Pere's darkest secrets and Vianne's deepest fears.  Pere's narration is told as he \\"speaks\\" to an older priest and apparent confidante, confiding in him his doubts and sinful feelings, revealing secrets that are probably left untold.  Through Vianne's narration, we learn of her past and the reasons why she fears Pere Reynaud so much.  <br />I highly recommend Chocolat for its imagery and beautiful writing.  I consider it light reading despite some of its heavier themes, but all in all, a great summer read.	2002-06-23

She has two young boys who keep her busy at home, and during the day she works part time for a magazine.  Throughout this novel, Clara makes observations about her life, her marriage, and what she could expect out of her somewhat boring future.  <br />I found myself laughing at some of her observations and antics, but overall, I didn't see where this book was taking me.  It is light reading, part of the \\"brit chick lit\\" genre that was made popular by Bridget Jones' Diary.  However, this novel is nowhere near the wit and style of Bridget Jones.   I found that this novel was going nowhere, and realized there was a point to the story only after I reached the last chapter.  I recommend this book only for the interesting characters that weave in and out of the book, but over all, I can only give it 3 stars.	2002-06-20

The past that Cassandra and Enrique want to forget comes flying in their face, and David helps bring it all together. A complex set of circumstances explains the relationship, as David seeks out a family he's never met before.<br />The Spaniard's Seduction was a very well written novel.

James McBride chose to honor his mother by writing this book about her amazing life, but at the same time he wrote about his own life, and what it was like growing up in a family of 12 kids whose one parent was Black and the other Jewish.<br />McBride chose to write the book with chapters that alternated between his point of view and his mother's.  In regular print was James' story - How he never really knew that his mother was Jewish. How it was always difficult to fit in because his mother was not black. What it was like growing up in poverty with 11 other siblings. And, never really knowing who he was, because he only knew his father's family, and never could get a straight answer from his mother about hers.   \\"None of your business\\", Ruth would always answer whenever James asked a simple question about her family background.<br />In Italics in alternating chapters, the story picks up with James' mother, starting with her family's escape from Poland during WWII and coming to America to make a new life.  Her life was never easy.  Being Jewish living in the Deep South was hard enough, but she also was the daughter of a very strict Rabbi, who wasn't the good father the outside world would have expected him to be.  Her mother was crippled with polio, and suffered in silence.<br />When Ruth decides to leave her family to move to New York, her life takes a turn.  James ponders whether his mother's life would have been better if she had stayed in the south with her family.   But for Ruth, there was no other way.  She made her new life in the black ghettos, fell in love with two very strong but different men, both of whom were black, and still continues to live her life with Black Americans, the only people she has ever felt comfortable with and accept her for who she is.  <br />THE COLOR OF WATER is definitely one of the better books I have read this year.  Although I found McBride's writing style to be somewhat lacking, what I did find powerful was his story.  The story of his mother comes from the heart, and is indeed a tribute to the most important woman in his life - Ruth McBride Jordan.	2002-06-08

There is nothing really wrong with her, but for some reason, she lacks the social skills that helps others fit in.  She is married to a wonderful husband Howard, who is as different from Alice as night is from day.  I couldn't understand why anyone would be drawn to Alice, but Howard obviously loved her.<br />The story opens with Alice in a panic, taking care of her two young daughters and her friend Theresa's two girls, while Theresa is out.  Alice obviously does not enjoy taking care of the kids.  Motherhood does not suit her.  <br />What happens next is what sets the tone of the book.  The younger of Theresa's two girls, Lizzie, drowns outside in the pond where the girls often played.  The reader and the characters in the book wonder, \\"Whose fault was it?\\"  The town has already made up their mind about Alice, and it is not favorable.  However, Theresa stands by her friend, despite the great loss she and her husband Dan have just gone through. <br />This is only the beginning of Alice's troubles.  Rumors start to circulate about Alice and her work as a school nurse.  What follows is a series of events that threatens to tear Alice's family apart.<br />From reactions I received from friends, and reading the reviews at Amazon, I've noticed that this is probably one of the more difficult books to get through that Oprah chose for her book club.  I'm the only person I know that actually enjoyed this book.  What kept me reading was Jane Hamilton's beautiful writing style.  That alone was worth reading this book.  The story is depressing and the main character is not a likeable person at all.  Despite this, I do recommend the book, but with a word of caution, that one needs to be patient in order to finish this book.	2002-06-08

The Handmaid's Tale - by Margaret Atwood<br />THE HANDMAID'S TALE is a frightening look at a not too distant future where sterility is the norm, and fertile woman are treated as cattle, to produce children for the upper class who cannot have any.   The narrator Offred, as she is called in her new life, is the Handmaid for a top Commander in the new government.  Once a month she is tested by a gynecologist to ensure that she is healthy, and then is taken to the Commander and his wife in the hopes of becoming pregnant.   <br />Offred, along with the other handmaid's, are not allowed to look directly at anyone else.  They all wear the same outfits; red long dresses and headgear that cover their bodies.  They live together, spend most of their time together, and are taken care of, in the hopes that they will produce children for this barren society.  In this society, most women are not allowed to read, and are treated as if they have no minds.  The government dictates their role in society.  If they disobey, they are punished severely.<br />Offred's memories often go back to a time when she was happily married to Luke, and with their daughter they were looking forward to a long and happy life together.   Things changed when a military group took over the government, and immediately their lives as they knew it were over.   Women lost all rights to ownership; bank accounts were frozen, land was taken away; fertile women were taken away from their husbands and families.  A handful of older women were made into `Aunts', and their duties were to instruct and guide the handmaids, reminding them of their role on this earth, which is to procreate.<br />I have to say that my feelings during this book were of shock.  In some sense, what has happened in this book has already happened in other parts of the world and can happen again.  The control over women is very much like that of the women in Afghanistan. The control over religious choice brings to mind Nazi Germany, as one of the issues in the Handmaid's Tale is the elimination of anyone that refuses to be as one with the new government - religious persecution is justified and encouraged. <br />The Handmaid's Tale is a horrifying story of a government fully in control of each person's life and totally out of control.  The book was so riveting that it took me only one day to read.  I highly recommend this novel.	2002-06-03

A Bend in the Road is the story of Miles and his son Jonah.  Missy was the love of Miles' life; they had a storybook love that was not destined to end on a happy note.  Missy dies early on in their marriage, leaving Miles to care for their young son Jonah.  The cause of death was a hit and run accident, but despite Miles' efforts to find the \\"murderer\\", there are no answers.   Miles works as the local deputy sheriff in a small town in North Carolina (where everyone seems to know everyone else) and he uses his powers to track down the person that drove the car that killed Missy.  <br />Then in comes Sarah.  She's a divorced woman from the big city, looking for a new life in a small town.  She ends up as Jonah's teacher in school, and through Jonah she meets Miles.  It takes a while, but Miles soon falls in love with Sarah and they begin a courtship.   Miles hasn't been happier, not since he lost Missy, but there is always that nagging mystery in the back of his mind: who killed her?  Was she murdered? Or was it an accident?<br />I enjoyed reading this book, but I have to admit it was not my favorite Nicholas Sparks romance.  MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE is by far his best work.  A BEND IN THE ROAD didn't seem to flow as easily as some of his other novels, and I guess I felt that the plot was a bit forced.  Still, Sparks knows how to write a good romance and I did want to find out how Missy really died.   It was a fast read, but if you are a first time reader of Nicholas Sparks, I suggest you try MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE or A WALK TO REMEMER.	2002-06-01

As I read the book, I pictured it in my mind, as if I was watching a black and white film.  The story is told in flashbacks, going from one time period to another.  The flashes are brief.  We'll get a scene here, another scene there.  And through this technique, we slowly learn the story of Ellen Van Bemmel, and her memories of a family that appeared happy to the rest of the world, but in reality was full of turmoil and unhappiness.  <br />Ellen had many happy memories of her father, sitting on his lap and laying her head on his chest, feeling safe.  No one could hurt her when she was with Daddy.  He had promised her.  And she loved her mother.  Her parents seemed so in love, at least from what she remembered. Her beautiful sister Billie (Sybille), her brothers Kester and little Carlos (Ellen's name for her brother) - they shared happy times, all those years ago.   But a tragedy happens on her 12th birthday - it was such a horrible day, that Ellen has blocked most of it from her memory.  It takes her decades to realize what really happened all those years ago.  It takes her that long to come to terms with her past.<br />I highly recommend A Heart of Stone.  The book held my attention the way a good mystery would.  With details revealed in bits and pieces, I found myself wanting to spend all my time reading this book until I reached the end.  A warning - this book is not for the faint of heart.	2002-06-01

ALL AROUND THE TOWN by Mary Higgins Clark is a murder mystery involving two sisters.  Laurie Kenyon is the younger sister, and her story starts with her kidnapping years ago when she was only 4 years old.  She disappeared for 2 years, only to be found again, but never to be the same happy child she once was.  Sarah Kenyon is her older sister.  She watched as her family fell apart while her parents tried desperately to find their  daughter.  With this in mind, Sarah becomes Laurie's protector, and vows to always be there when Laurie needed her.<br />The story revolves around the two women, as a murder mystery unfolds where Laurie is the accused murderer.  As the story progresses, Sarah, who is now an attorney, tries to save her sister.  But the more Sarah learns, the worse it looks.  Laurie is discovered to have multiple personalities, and could one of her personalities have been the murderer?<br />I've read many Mary Higgins Clark books, and this is probably one of her best.  It left me on the edge of my seat and was so riveting that it took me only two days to read it.  I highly recommend this book!	2002-05-29

On the surface, it appears to be a story about Amy, the teenage daughter that is prone to boredom and feels nothing but contempt for her mother.  Amy yearns for a closer relationship with her, but it seems that everything her mother does only irritates Amy further.  <br />However, the story is more than just that.  The stormy relationship between Isabelle and Amy reveals a typical relationship between mother and teenage daughter, but besides the problem of Amy and the relationship with her mother, the secondary story line belongs to Isabelle, and why she behaves the way she does.  What is the secret of her past?  It is obvious to the reader that she is hiding a past that she is ashamed of, and it is this reason that Isabelle isolates herself unintentionally from the rest of the world.  <br />Isabelle is a single parent, a hard working executive secretary in a factory mill.  She's been at the same job for many years, but despite this fact, Isabelle does not seem to have any friends at work, nor does she have any friends outside of the office.  She goes through life as if on automatic, day dreaming about being the wife her boss Avery should have, thinking she \\"belongs\\".  She feels she's above the social status of her co-workers, and feels that if she tried, the upper class women in this small town, such as Avery's wife Emma would accept her as one of their own. The fantasies that Isabelle has during all hours of the day and night is almost ludicrous, as the reader knows that Isabelle does not seem capable to see life as it really is. She does not seem to have a grasp on reality.  She also tries too hard to make friends, which often causes her embarrassment.  <br />Amy doesn't have many friends either, except for Stacy, who along with Amy, acts out as the rebel teenager, skipping classes, smoking where no one cansee them, and sharing stories of their miserable lives. Early on in the story, we find Amy dwelling on her fantasy relationship with her teacher, Mr. Robertson, and soon a real relationship blossoms.  It is this relationship that causes the greatest problems between Amy and Isabelle.<br />As the novel progresses, we begin to learn about Isabelle's past.  It is this knowledge that moves the rest of the book forward, and it culminates at the end of the book with the revelation of what happened to Isabelle in the distant past.<br />I greatly enjoyed this novel by Elizabeth Strout.  She has a wonderful way with words, making the scenes so vivid that I could imagine myself walking amongst the fall leaves with Amy.  I also enjoyed the story line and I know that I will be reading more of her in the future.	2002-05-19

How to Make An American Quilt by Whitney Otto<br />HOW TO MAKE AN AMERICAN QUILT is a patchwork of lives that make up a quilting group.  The ladies all live in Grasse, California, a small town outside of Bakersfield.  Whitney Otto wrote this short novel by interspersing chapters dedicated to quilting, in-between chapters dedicated to each of the quilters in the group.  What I didn't figure out right away was that each chapter that described the quilting related to the character description of the next quilter.  Each person was different and therefore each quilt that could be created by each woman, had different aspects to it. <br />I have to confess I found the chapters on quilting a bit dull, and it is probably because I am not a quilter.  I love to look at quilts; I love to feel them.   But reading these chapters on the process of quilting was trying my patience.  However, I understood what the author was attempting to do, to compare a quilt to a group of women whose lives were patched together and somehow made them one.  <br />The chapters that talked about the history of each character were very interesting, and I saw how they all were somehow connected to the others.  Reading the book was a walk through history, as the women were of varying ages and spanned generations.  We got to see Hy and Glady Joe as they are now, in their old age, but also what they were like in their younger years.  We saw Anna and her daughter Marianna grow and mature as black women living in a white society.  And then there is Finn, who is the narrator of the book. She is the one that is building this patchwork of people, helping to tell the story of women whose lives are somehow intertwined.<br />I found this book very easy to read, but I didn't find it as interesting as I think it could have been.  I feel the author missed her mark, although I give her points for the idea.	2002-05-07

She struggles with this crazed young man, and she later finds out that this intruder, who tries to rape her, is the son of Charlie's boss, Claude Wentworth, who happens to own half the town. Miss Gussie and Charlie are able to overtake the young man, and while he is still alive, they bury him outside in their garden.  They tell no one, fearing that Charlie would lose his job.  This son of Mr. Wentworth was a good-for-nothing boy, and if they kept their mouths shut, no one would be the wiser. <br />And so begins a novel that is full of surprises and some interesting characters.  Miss Gussie is the matriarch of the family.  She has two daughters, Dorothy and Clancy Jane, who are as different as night and day.  Dorothy is a very difficult girl, while Clancy Jane is the good daughter, and can never do no wrong, or so everyone thought.  While Dorothy ends up being the good daughter, in terms of staying on the straight and narrow, it's Clancy Jane that ends up leaving home, getting into trouble, and living a life totally different from the life she left back in Tennessee.  Clancy Jane's life takes her to the west coast, where she encounters a very bohemian lifestyle that changes her forever.<br />I found CRAZY LADIES a very fun book to read.   Although there were various serious issues that were covered in the book, I didn't find this to be a serious book at all.  CRAZY LADIES would be a great summer read, fast paced and easy.  I am looking forward to reading other novels by Michael Lee West.	2002-05-07

White Rabbit by Kate Phillips<br />WHITE RABBIT was Kate Phillip's first novel, and for a first novel she did a very good job.  This book is a day in the life of Ruth Caster Armstrong Hubble, an 80-something old woman who we find is obsessive, inflexible, and treats her poor husband like dirt.   The novel is plotted out to the minute, giving the reader a clear vision of what her daily life was all about.  <br />During this day in the life of poor Ruth, we slowly learn about her life story.  Her love of her life, Hale Armstrong, died decades ago, but she still held a torch for this man that taught her what love was all about. And, despite his death, he still owned her heart.   There didn't seem to be any love left for poor Henry, except she does love her dear grand daughter Karen, who is going through some marital troubles of her own.<br />Because of the minute by minute telling of this day, we see every little detail that she goes through, including bladder control problems, her irate attitude towards her husband Henry, every little thought process, even her daily ritual of throwing out the trash (and it goes into great detail).  <br />At the same time, she starts to flashback to younger days, and we slowly learn about why she became the woman she ended out to be.   Why did she marry Henry, for goodness sakes?  When did Hale die?  Were there other men in her life? What type of woman was she, in her prime?<br />As I read the novel, I found that little by little, Ruth's forgotten past was slowly revealed, and so by the time I got to the very last page, it was another AHA moment for me.   I felt it to be a very sad revelation of a life that had many choices, but because of the choices she did make along the way, it shaped her into the pessimistic old lady she was today.   <br />I found this novel to be a very fast read.   Ruth Caster had a very fascinating life, which was hard to believe given the type of old woman she became.   I felt that a book like this makes one reflect on ones own life, and makes one note more carefully the important choices one can make in a lifetime.	2002-04-22

What makes this book important, is that it is NOT just any story.   It is a story of incest and of one person's brave ordeal in telling it to the public.  <br />Ms Allen grew up in a family that seemed to thrive on lies.  And the biggest lies that surrounded the family were the problems they had with Daddy.   He was abusive to all of them: he constantly yelled at her mother; he tried often to physically hurt her.   Her brothers were treated a little better, but they too were filled with anger and fear for their father.  Charlotte, however, developed a \\"special\\" bond, that continued for many years.  Because of this abuse, Charlotte grew up with a number of neuroses and fears that followed her into adulthood.  <br />The book takes place in the present, with flashbacks starting from her earliest memories.  What I liked about the way the story was written, was that it helped us see how her past affected her present life.  She took the time to compare herself and her daughter, and the relationship they had, to what she had with her own mother, many years ago.   Her relationship with her father destroyed her ability to trust any man, and she shows the reader how she slowly over came this.  <br />I found DADDY'S GIRL, despite its theme, an easy book to read.  Ms Allen's style of writing enables the reader to see HER world through the eyes of herself as a child.  I think this is important because it helps convey what she truly went through.   What's most important is that she was able to tell the story from her point of view.   If it had been written from a third person narrative, the book would have been a more impersonal telling, and would not have come across as poignant as it did.  I highly recommend DADDY'S GIRL.	2002-04-17

It soon fast-forwards to her first working experiences, and soon she's introduced to Danny, a new employee at her company, and it is love at first sight.  Danny is smart, witty, charming and very good looking.  For shy Ria, it is a miracle that he only has eyes for her. <br />Things seem to go smoothly for Ria and Danny as they get to know each other, and before she knows it, they are getting married.  I should reiterate that things SEEMED to be going just fine, but if you read between the fine lines, there is some room for doubt.  Ria tends to brush things aside when there is any hint of a problem, and the reader is probably more aware than she is that her life is NOT as perfect as she wants it to be.  There are problems brewing, but they do not become apparent to Ria until much, much later.<br />In the midst of all this, their beautiful home on TARA ROAD is the center of their lives.  Danny and Ria focus so much on the house and what it means to them, that soon it seems that their marriage appears to revolve around it.  Their lives are centered on the busy life that they make, with friends and family constantly visiting, with the kitchen being the focal point of all visits.  Ria spends her days pleasing her family and friends who visit, always baking and cooking.  For Ria, this is all part of a happy family, and she cannot imagine any other life.<br />Ria goes along on her daily routines, and eventually by accident finds out that life is NOT what she had thought it was.  Danny was not the perfect husband, and their marriage was not the perfect marriage either.   When her world crumples in front of her, she does something absolutely crazy.  Danny moves out, and with him out of the picture, she decides to swap the house on Tara Road with someone's house all the way in the United States of America for the summer.   For a woman who had never left Ireland before, this was a BIG move.  She gets in contact with a woman, Marilyn, who also has a need to get away from her own life, and finally, they swap.<br />What Ria and Marilyn go through is a lesson in life.   With Marilyn being the recluse and Ria being the social butterfly, both of them not only swap houses but also swap lives.  Ria experiences what it is like to live a more solitary life.  Marilyn learns how to be the center of the neighborhood.   It is a trying experience for both, and what they gain from this experience is something they probably never would have learned otherwise.<br />TARA ROAD by Maeve Binchy was a very easy read for me.  I enjoyed her writing style and loved her characters. This being my first book by Binchy, I have no other to compare to, but I will say this much: I will certainly read more by her!  This book is recommended thumbs up!	2002-04-07

Each story revolves around a <BR>different main character.  <br />Deanna Wolfe is the first story (Predators) and she works for the US Forest Service, living alone in the mountains in south Appalachia.  Her disdain for most people keeps her isolated up in the mountains, where she happily observes nature at its finest.  Early on in her story, she encounters Eddie Bondo, a man of mystery travelling through the mountains, and despite her attitudes towards people in general, she falls for him.   <br />The second story (Moths) is centered around Lusa Landowski,  married into the Widener family and the wife (and soon to be widow) of Cole, the beloved son and brother of this large clan.  Their lives center on farm living, and although Lusa's dream as a child was to live on the land, she finds little happiness living on the farm with Cole.<br />The third story (Chestnuts) centers around Garnett, an elderly man who has lived in Zebulon county for decades, but is now a widower and is constantly battling it out with his next door neighbor Nannie Rawley.  He thinks she's nuts, and she sees him as an old fart.  <br />The problem I had with this book was that there didnt seem to be any remote connection between the three stories, except for the main theme of ecology and &quot;preseravation of this earth&quot;. I am a big supporter of ecological causes, but not to the extent where it is being shoved down my throat in a preachy tone.   Although I soon came to love the character of Lusa and her fellow Wideners,  I could not warm up to Deanna Wolfe, who seemed to have no heart and was written as a very cold person.  Her hatred and disdain for most people, I think, is what irritated me the most.   Her dialogues with Eddie sounded to me like a text book dissertation, not true conversations held by someone in her field. I enjoyed the Garnett and Nannie wars, as I would like to call them, but they too weren'ttoo likeable in the beginning.<br />Although by the end of the book the author ties up loose ends and shows how all three characters are connected in some way,  I found this book was merely a means to preach about the ecology, not to tell a story.  I think I would have enjoyed this book more if she had left Deanna's story out, and focused more on Garnett and Lusa's story.  PRODIGAL SUMMER was my third Barbara Kingsolver book (Poisonwood Bible and The Bean Trees being my first two) so I had been looking forward to reading this book.  Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations and so I only gave it 3 stars.	2002-03-24

Set in Chile and spanning several generations, it tells the story of Esteban Trueba and  his efforts to build an empire, so to speak, on his property THE TRES MARIAS.   The story is filled with many memorable characters, including Clara, the clairvoyant daughter of the Del Valle family, who marries Esteban despite the fact that she does not love him. Through her, he builds his family and his little empire.  <br />The telling of the story is a mix of comedy and tragedy.  Allende mixes the stories of Esteban and his family with the background of political upheaval, which Esteban gets involved with during the latter part of his life. The first half of the book is filled with crazy and memorable characters that help keep the tone of the book light, but as the story moves on,  the political plot line takes center stage.  <br />I highly recommend THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS.  It was not my first Allende novel.  I had already read DAUGHTER OF FORTUNE and loved it!  THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS and DAUGHTER OF FORTUNE are must reads, and if you enjoy both of these,  PORTRAIT IN SEPIA is another book you need to read!  It picks up where both novels leave off.	2002-03-24

It starts with a young James Piper marrying a very young Materia Mahmoud, against her father's wishes.  (She had been betrothed to another and therefore marrying someone else was an affront to the family and their traditions).  With her father disowning her, it is the start of a life of suffering and loneliness for Materia, and the start of nothing but terrible suffering for James and their children.  <br />Materia gives birth to four daugthers.  Kathleen, the eldest, becomes the love of James' life, in more ways than one.  Mercedes is the 2nd daughter, the first child that Materia finds any love for.  Frances is followed 11 months later, destined to become a trouble maker and brings nothing but anger from James. Lily is the 4th child that lives for only a few days, but is replaced years later by another Lily, presumed by most to be Materia's fifth child.<br />In between the births,  Materia is constantly fighting depression and unhappiness, married to a  man she had thought she once loved but now can no longer tolerate.  When James leaves the country to join the war efforts abroad (and to escape a forbidden love)  Materia experiences happiness for at least a short while.<br />The three daughters enjoy the relationship of sisterhood, but the three of them are different as night and day.  Things change for the worse when one of them suddenly passes on, and while the story was dark to begin with, things turn for the worse.<br />FALL ON YOUR KNEES is filled with forbidden love and taboos.  It's not your run of the mill soap opera, but a tragic epic spanning several generations. This book may turn off a few readers with it's dark themes and taboo topics, but I think the patient reader should find fulfillment by the end of the book.  I found this book well written and very clever in the handling of the story line.  It left me in suspense up til the veryending.	2002-03-24

We see her dealing with her not-too-perfect parents, with being unpopular in school, and with living as a child of divorced parents.  Life has dealt her a bad hand, and unfortunately she does not become strong from these unfortunate circumstances, but caves in while everything around her falls apart.<br />Despite such negative personality traits, Dolores comes across as someone you want to like.  You WANT to help her out. You feel empathetic towards her. However, despite how I felt, I found that through most of the story,  I did not like her at all, and although I loved reading about her, I found myself becoming more and more irate with Dolores and the situations she got herself into. Dolores finds solace in food, and as life gets tougher, she eats more and more.  <br />She does meet people along the way who have a major impact on her life, and through her eyes and theirs, we see her grow into a secure mature adult.  It takes a lot of work and a lot of time, but I found that by the end of the book, I liked Dolores Price, and I was glad to have gotten to know her.<br />I greatly recommend this novel, and am looking forward to reading Wally Lamb's  I KNOW THIS MUCH IS TRUE.	2002-03-10

Ruth is dying from cancer, and her best friend Ann is trying to cope.   We see things mostly through the eyes of Ann. Through flashbacks we find out how they met,  how they felt about each other and what brought them together. <br />Both are married and both have a child, but each of them are like night and day. Ruth lived life to the fullest and always took risks.  Ann seemed to be the more conservative of the two, but that didn't stop them from being friends.<br />The book was about how Ann and Ruth's other closest friends helped Ruth and each other prepare for her death.  Be prepared for a lot of tears, especially by the end of the book. I felt that this was probably one of my favorite Elizabeth Berg books, and as usual, I was not let down.	2002-02-21

LIFE WITHOUT WATER is about the childhood memories of Cedar,  and her years living and travelling with her mother during the height of the hippie movement.  Most of her growing up years were filled with memories of unstructured, unconventional living that was so popular with a number of people back in the late 60's and early 70's.   <br />Cedar's earliest memories of life is that of her parents,  Sol and Sara.  Her father wasn't even called \\"Dad\\", but was always Sol, his real name being Albert Massey.  Her parents weren't married, and when her mother gave birth to Cedar,  they had a midwife. <br />And so Cedar was born in their own home which they named TWO MOONS. Their home was in an isolated area in North Carolina, complete with barns and an outhouse. Cedar, who knew no other life than this, did not know that they were not part of conventional society.  <br />A few years after Cedar was born her mother, frustrated with Sol who was turning into a very irresponsible husband and father,  took Sara away from Two Moons and they lived on the road for a long while. After much travelling, they meet Daniel, and after a few months of living with him in his girlfriend's house (the girlfriend, by the way, was not expected to return for a few months),  the three of them move on back to Two Moons, and are joined by old friends of Sara's, Woody and Elaine, and their two children Roxy and Norther.  For a few years, they all live together in a type of commune setting, and Cedar's memories of these years are happy and warm.<br />Trouble starts with the entrance of another person at the commune, Topaz. The reader is led to believe that Topaz spells bad news, and we are right.  What happens from this point on I won't reveal, but life at the Two Moons does not continue idyllically forever.<br />I was very impressed with Nancy Peacock's first published novel, LIFE WITHOUT WATER.  Although this novel is very short,  Ms Peacock was able to successfully invoke a feeling of nostalgia for atime long gone.  She paints life among the hippies as a happy simple life, and I found myself longing for those days.  My only complaint of this book, specifically the edition that I bought,  is the back cover summary of the book. It is somewhat misleading and I feel inaccurately summarizes the book.  <br />Do yourself a favor and read the book for what it is:  a trip down memory lane, of a time of innocence amidst the backdrop of a turbulent war (Vietnam).  It was a crossroads for many of that generation.	2002-02-16

Books	4	44	44	N	Y	Dena Nordstrom's Search for herself	WELCOME TO THE WORLD, BABY GIRL is the second Fannie Flagg novel that I've read.   The first, of course, was Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe.   Welcome To the World, I have to say, is not as wonderful as the other book, but I think comparing the two may be a mistake.<br />The novel switches back and forth between the present, the 1970's, and the past, the 1930's and 1940's. Dena Nordstrom is a famous television personality of the 1970's, almost akin to what Oprah Winfrey is for us today.  She's' highly respected and well-loved by her many fans.  She brings ratings to her television network, and everyone just loves her. She lives in New York,  lives a fast life of parties and liquor and all the trappings that come with being a famous celebrity.<br />Then we switch to the 1930's and 40's.  We see Dena's roots, where she came from. We get them in pieces, in short scenes, because Dena herself does not know too much about her childhood or about where she came from.  Her mother was a mystery to her, and she knows hardly anything about her.  All she knows is that she once loved her mother very much, but somewhere along the way she stopped loving her.<br />The scenes of the 1930's and 40's take place in a small country town called Elmwood Springs, Missouri.   To modern day Dena Nordstrom, this is hicktown.  She has no desire in going back home.  Fannie Flagg paints a quaint, wonderful little town where everyone knows everyone else, and there is not one secret in town that nobody knows.  However, the biggest secret is something that no one knew, because Dena's mother chose to keep it secret.  <br />Dena has troubles sleeping and soon is forced to see a psychiatrist to help.  She starts with one psychiatrist,  Gerry, but he soon sends her off to another one, a friend of his,  Dr. Diggers.  She's black for starters, and she's a paraplegic. She gets around by using a wheelchair.  Dena learns to trust Dr. Diggers, and through the psychiatrist she and the reader start to learn more about Dena's past,and her mother's past.  What we find out at the end of the book caught me by surprise because it certainly was not what I had expected!<br />I highly recommend WELCOME TO THE WORLD BABY GIRL.   One hint of warning:  I did not find the first part of the book very readable, because I did not really see where Fannie Flagg was taking this book.  However, by the time I reached the end,  it was a big \\"aha!\\" for me and it made so much more sense.  This book was well done and I can see it made into a movie, as FRIED GREEN TOMATOES was years ago.  Be very patient with this book - you will be greatly rewarded with the ending.	2002-02-06

THE BEAN TREES is a novel about a young woman, Taylor Greer, who leaves her home state of Kentucky to find a life outside of what she knew - growing up to become barefoot and pregnant.  She wanted more than that, but she did not really know what she wanted.<br />She finally arrives in Tucson and meets a woman who wants to give Taylor a 3 year old child.  Taylor promises to take care of the little girl.  Whether the woman is the child's mother, we never do find out. But Taylor does find out right away that something is not right with the child.  Turtle, the name Taylor gives the child,  does not talk.  Taylor also finds bruises over the child's body while giving her a bath.  Maybe Taylor has saved this child from a horrible life, but now she is responsible for the welfare of this little Indian american girl.<br />But now what to do?  No money and no job, and she's got a kid she never planned on having.<br />Taylor and Turtle end up in a small town in Arizona and after meeting several nice people who help them out, they end up living with a gal named Lou Ann, who has her own story to tell.  The book is intertwined with the stories of both women so we get to know them both very well.  <br />Along the way they meet and get involved with a hispanic couple,  Estevan and Esperanza.  They are from central America, and their story is a mystery, except we know Esperanza knows very little English, and Estevan was an English teacher in his home land.  The four of them, along with little Turtle, become good friends, and soon Turtle is responding to the love she is getting from her new family.  But there is still the mystery of what really happened to little Turtle....<br />THE BEAN TREES is the 2nd Barbara Kingsolver novel I have read, THE POISONWOOD BIBLE being the other one.   This second novel reads quite differently than POISONWOOD BIBLE did, and I guess one reason is that THE BEAN TREES was written over a decade before.  Ms. Kingsolver's skills as a story teller greatly improved between these two novels, but that does not mean THE BEAN TREES is a poorly written book.  On the contrary,  I found it very well written and enjoyable to read.  <br />The feel of both books is very different.  While POISONWOOD had the feel of an epic,  THE BEAN TREES was a much more simpler novel (being a much shorter novel helped!)  I can't say whether one book was better than the other.  I liked both equally.  What I'm finding I really like about Ms Kingsolver's books is that she is very good at character developement.  She knows how to paint a character well enough that I was able to picture right away what these characters were all about.  They were not shallow one dimensional people, but people I could care about.<br />Obviously,  I am giving THE BEAN TREES a glowing recommendation.  It was probably one of the better books I read in 2001.	2002-01-27

Elizabeth Berg's THE PULL OF THE MOON is the story of Nan, and her search for herself.  She's in her 50's and has decided to leave her husband (temporarily) and travel the country, looking for what, she does not know.  She sends letters to her husband  Martin throughout this entire trip,   revealing to the reader what is going on in her head as she goes from town to town, doing things she enjoyed doing but felt her husband  never understood.  She finds joy in the little things, taking time to talk to people along the way.   <br />A lot of her letters are angry, some are sad.  She loves her husband, but as many women feel as they approach middle age, she feels burnt out and neglected.  She's been taken for granted, and she wants to change it all.<br />I think a lot of women will be able to relate to Nan and her journey to find herself.  It's an easy read; took me only a few days to finish.  I'm not 50 yet, but I could understand her frustrations.  Elizabeth Berg is the master of &quot;chick books&quot; I think, and I always come away from one of her books with a &quot;I can relate!&quot; feeling.  If you are an Elizabath Berg fan, this is another great read!	2002-01-12

The reader sees the view points of each woman, and the story unfolds in this manner.  <br />The Saving Graces is the name of their &quot;club&quot; of women, all of whom meet once a month to have dinner and discuss whatever topic they had chosen to talk about.  Through the years the members come and go, but the 4 main women remain the same:  Isabel is the oldest of the group and seems to be the one that keeps the women united.  Rudy is married to a very controlling husband and the other three are polite enough never to criticize her choice in marrying him.  Lee is the rock of the group, the one that tries to keep things organized and controlled.  And last but not least, Emma longs to be a writer and her story starts out with her growing crush on a married man.<br />What I found interesting with this book was the way the reader was able to get different perspectives on each character.  I think it was an usual way to write this book.  At the same time, I found it rather distracting, because with each new chapter I was seeing things from a different character's eyes, and it took me quite a while to figure out who was who.  <br />I dont think this technique of alternating narrators worked well with this book, but other than that,  I was interested in the story and what was evolving in the plot.  I wanted to know what happened to each of the women.  The author made the reader care about each character.  <br />I give this book 4 stars because of the content of the book, but if it had been written in a different way,   it definitely would have been a 5 star book for  me! I definitely recommend this book.	2001-12-16

She is born a bastard and left on the doorstep of a rich British family's home in Chile.  She is not adopted by the brother and sister,  Jeremy and Rose Summers, but is still raised like she was one of their own. Neither sibling has children of their own.<br />Eliza is never treated completely as if she were their daughter, but she is given a good home and education to allow her to marry into the best of families.  However,  along the way Eliza falls in love with a lowly clerk and follows him to California, a land where gold has just been discovered and many were rushing to this place in search of wealth.<br />Eliza goes to California with the help of a chinese doctor named Tao Chi'en, who also happened to be a friend of her &quot;uncle&quot; Captain John, who happened to be Rose and Jeremy's brother.  She is stowed upon a ship and she and Tao Chi'en  sail to California. From this point,  the story diverges to tell the story of Tao Chi'en and his humble beginnings.  His story is epic in nature as well.<br />The story of Eliza is a story of a woman's journey towards self-discovery and love.  I found &quot;Daughter of Fortune&quot; to be wonderfully written, an epic full of adventure and romance.  I found myself glued to this book as I read it from cover to cover.  I highly recommend it.	2001-12-16

She writes of her time spent there, and each chapter is either a separate essay on another aspect of her time there, or an essay talking about how that time of her life affected her present life (25 years later).  <br />As a study on borderline personality disorder,  it was an interesting read. However, as a book I found it  a little disjointed. I also didn't feel anything for the author, because of the way she wrote the book.   I find I could feel something for the main character if the book is written well.  but i couldn't feel a thing for the characters in this book.  <br />Susanna goes into detail the different patients at the hospital where she stayed for nearly 2 years.   Some of the scenes described are very intense.  What i found interesting is that she was narrating what she experienced first hand.  This is the story of a part of her life that changed forever who she was and what she was meant to become.<br />I give it 3 stars because although as a whole it was not what I considered a great book, each chapter was interesting unto itself and kept me wanting to read more.

Nico finds he's dead broke and spends the rest of the novel trying to get himself out of this mess (big time gambling debt).  Fontaine in the meantime is trying to rejuvenate her London night club, while at the same time ignores all advances from Nico, although deep down she is very attracted to him.<br />For a quick light read and some trashy writing,  THE BITCH is recommended.	2001-10-27

Kathy Hepinstall's second novel, THE ABSENCE OF NECTAR, has to be one of my favorite books of 2001. It starts off with a bang, when the main character and narrator, Alice, describes a scar on her face which was formed when her step father Simon Jester burned her with a hot spatula. <br />Immediately we know there is something horrible going on in this family. Alice soon starts to talk about Simon's plot to kill her and her brother Boone, but the reader (and their mother) will have to be convinced first.<br />The story is told in the present, but also uses flashbacks to recreate scenes that slowly show the reader what really happend.  We learn about how they met Simon (he saved their mother from drowning) and soon learn that his own wife and child died while drowning. I found that the use of the flashbacks was very effective, and it kept me on the edge of my seat as I was trying to piece together the puzzle of who Simon Jester really was. <br />There is a third element of the story,  the notorious murderess Persley Snow, who escapes from prison every now and then, only to be caught and taken back. She has a following of fans throughout the country, people who think she shouldnt' be imprisoned. Boone, Alice's brother, is secretly in love witih Persley, and eventually his dreams come true during one of her escapes from prison.<br />The theme of nectar comes from the bees that their mother Meg raises and uses to make a living. They are referred throughout the book, and I believe they symbolized what was happening to the family. Meg loves the bees, and notices early on in her relationship with her soon to be husband, that the bees are slowly dying...<br />I highly recommend this book. The characters were likeable, and the person of Simon Jester made a great villain.  It is also fast paced and well written, and now I'm looking forward to picking up her first novel.	2001-09-11

THE GOOD MOTHER is not just the story of Anna Dunlap and the love she has for her child, but it's also the story of why Anna behaved the way she did and why she made the choices she did in her life.<br />Anna is a divorced woman with a young daughter, Molly. She will do anything for her daughter. But throughout the book, Anna's focus is not always on Molly. She &quot;forgets&quot; Molly. It is while Anna is trying to deal with some important issues that she makes some very foolish mistakes, mistakes that could have been avoided if she had been paying more attention. These mistakes ultimately changes her relationship with her daughter,and her lover, Leo.<br />The first part of this book goes into great detail the story of her childhood. Without this first part, the reader wont understand totally what makes Anna tick. Everything from her piano lessons, to her relationship with her mother and her mother's clan, help explain why she did the things she did as an adult. Her love of her aunt Babe was a big influence from her childhood. Babe was a very eccentric young woman, and represented to Anna unconventionality and in some ways Freedom. Anna herself seemed to want to be uninhibited, but could not totaly be that way without feeling the guilt that was handed down to her by her mother's family. <br />The second part of the book dealt with the custody battle that Anna had to fight with her ex husband.  The pace was fast in this 2nd part of the novel, and i found that I could not put the book down.   I wanted to know what happened next.<br />I enjoyed reading this book, but give it 4 stars because I felt it could have been written better. The book I think was a bit choppy, with the first part totally being devoted to her childhood. I think it would have read better if the book was written in flashbacks. <br />I also had a hard time liking this character, Anna Dunlap. As with Sue Miller's WHEN I WAS GONE, i again felt that the main character was totally unlikeable and i didn't feel too much sympathy for her. But I think that is what kept me reading this book. I wanted to find out how Anna resolved her problems. Maybe creating an unlikeable character helped make this book a fast read for me.	2001-09-11

Landon Carter reminisces back to 1958, when he was 17 years old and getting ready for college.   His best friend is on the football team and he seems to spend a lot of time hanging out with his buddies.   <br />Jamie is the daughter of the local minister, and spends all her time reading her bible.  She is the butt of all the kids' jokes, because she sticks out like a sore thumb. Being a goody goody doesnt make one popular in highschool, and even Landon pokes fun at her behind her back.<br />Then,  he finds himself roped in to be part of the christmas play with Jamie.  Jamie's minister father had written this play years ago, based on the story of his wife (who died during childbirth) and therefore the fact that Jamie plays the lead role has important meaning to everyone.<br />the play transforms Jamie and Landon's relationship, and he finds himself falling in love with her.  He is embarrased at first, but as he gets to know Jamie, he finds that he realy loves her.<br />Things turn for the worse, and as always it's a tearjerker in this Nicholas Sparks novel. I dont want to give anything away, but i think this book is one of those that you can't put down, especialy if you love romances.	2001-08-02

Nikki happens to be outside her uncle's home when he is murdered, but Nikki's bad luck is that she was stealing something from Bill right before the murder takes place. <br />Nina Reilly,  an attorney who has had some bad luck of her own,  is called to take this case.   Nina's son Bob, a close friend of Nikki's,  is actually the one that brings Nina in to help Nikki, and Nina's gut tells her that Nikki is innocent. But how to solve it?  The only clue left at the scene is a prized sword that belonged to Bill, which was used as the murder weapon - Bill's face was slashed to pieces as if in revenge for a plastic surgery gone wrong.   Blood left on the sword seems to point to Nikki as the murderer, but it is not quite a perfect match.   <br />A seemingly coincidental event that happens the same night Bill is murdered, was the accidental death of Bill and Beth's only son Chris, who dies in a plane crash.  Chris had been on his way home to Lake Tahoe to visit his parents.  Nina felt that it was way too coincidental for both deaths to have happened on the same night, but with only a few clues,  the two deaths seemed only to be that - coincidental.<br />Nina brings in Paul Van Wagoner, a private investigator and former lover, to help her find out who truly murdered Nikki's uncle.  In the mean time,  we learn more about Nikki's mother Daria, who seems very irresponsible and without a brain. Or was that a charade?   And Beth, Daria's sister and Bill's widow: had her marraige to Bill been as happy as it had appeared to the outside world? Or were they hiding something too?  Throw in some stolen opals and a number of interesting cast of characters, and you have a full blown whodunit.<br />One of the subplots is the relationship between Paul and Nina.  There was a past romance between them, which I'm guessing has been covered in previous novels.  I couldn't really  get into this part of the story; Maybe it was because I couldnt' see why someone like Nina Reilly would fall for a jerk like Paul Van Wagoner.   Most of the novel, however, covers the murder mystery, so for me the relationship story was only a minor distraction.<br />I can't say that I'm disappointed with this book, although I think it could have been better.   Another reader read my mind: some plot twists were too damn coincidental to feel authentic, but at the same time there were a lot of surprises too. I recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a good mystery. I think the book is worth reading.	2001-07-28

RANGE OF MOTION by Elizabeth Berg is the story of Lainey, whose husband Jay is in a coma due to an icicle falling on his head and knocking him out.  Lainey sees the humor in all this, and at the same time tries to deal with a future that may not include the love of her life. Her emotions are up and down and she prays and hopes that he will awaken one day.  She tries all sorts of things to bring him out of his coma, bringing to the hospital things from home that may stir his mind and help bring him out of the coma.  She also spends a lot of time reminiscing about time spent with Jay, the romantic things, the every day things.<br />At the same time,  Lainey notices how her two children are dealing with this tragedy.  The oldest Sarah does not seem to be coping well at all, and at times refuses to even see Dad.<br />Lainey struggles with her emotions, and gets support from her neighbor Alice, who is going through some rough times of her own.  The book gets into Alice's troubles, where she is worried that her husband is having an affair with someone at work.  The conclusion to this subplot was rather interesting, and I was glad that it got resolved! (The reader was not left hanging).<br />I think this is my 4th book by Elizabeth Berg, and as with the others I enjoyed reading it a lot.  However,  I don't feel this is my favorite of her books.  I was expecting something with more substance.  The book was well-written as all her books are, but I felt that she could have delved more into Lainey's past with Jay and maybe got more into detail about the relationship with the two daugthers.  Overall, though, this was a good read!	2001-07-08

Lethal Seduction puts Madison in the spot light,  with her search for the truth about her father and his past.  What prompts her search is the death/murder of her mother, Stella, but she learns that Stella was not really her biological mother.  So we have a story line that has Madison in search of her roots, and she learns a lot about her father, things she really did not want to know.<br />Another minor story line has Madison trying to get over a relationship and is trying to start a  new one (with Jake Sica, who was also introduced in the &quot;LA connection&quot; series).  Along this storyline is interwoven another subplot, that of best friend Jamie Nova and her relationship with her husband.  Jamie finds out something that upsets her, and seeks to find revenge against her husband.  I have to say this story line wasn't realy resolved, but I'm guessing it'll turn up in another Jackie Collins novel.<br />I think the best new character in this book, however, was Rosarita, who was scheming through the entire book to have her famous husband (soap opera star Dexter Falcon) killed.  she's outrageous and crazy and a bitch!  I think only Jackie Collins knows how to write these smutty books and keeps her readers entertained, wanting more.<br />I gave this book only 4 stars, mainly because I felt the book needed more structure and there were too many unanswered questions at the end of the book.  My guess is that Ms Collins either lost interest, or plans on continuing all the storylines in her next Madison Castelli book.	2001-06-25

BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY is one of the funniest books ever.  Written in the form of a journal,  Bridget starts each entry with a set of statistics: alchohol consumed; cigarettes smoked; current weight; etc...   You can watch her alchohol and cigarette consumption go up and down as her moods change day by day.  <br />Bridget's journal chronicles life as a 30-something single gal living in London and living alone.  She's wishing she has a steady boyfriend.  She finally gets involved with her boss Daniel Cleaver, and we watch as they progress from madly in lust to &quot;ho hum&quot;.... of course she later learns what a scum bag he is and so she's back to square one.  She also is fixed up with child hood friend Mark Darcy, who annoys her to no end.  <br />Besides trying to find that Mr Right, she's also dealing with a mother who is going through a mid life crisis and that's a story unto itself.  And her on-going struggle with self improvement schemes is a riot.<br />Bridget came across to me as someone who has a lot of self esteem, but at the same time is desperately trying to convince herself and others that she's ok the way she is.   She's very vocal about her opinions, never gives up either when things are looking down.    I really liked Bridget as a character, and saw a lot of her in me.   Maybe that's why I liked this book so much.	2001-06-02

Her  mother Amelia is recovering from cancer surgery when she receives a letter that Lacey intercepts. The letter is from a relative, Vinnie, who is the sister of Amelia's deceased mother Ida.  From this letter,  Lacey's search for her roots begins.  She travels to Harper's Ferry where Vinnie and other family members reside, and soon Lacey finds out the many secrets that her mother kept all those years.  <br />The main secret is a possible murder, the unsolved murder or disappearance of Lacey's father Brad.  No one seems to know what really happened.  Was he really murdered?  Or did he just disappear without a trace?  His involvement with Amelia's sister Ardra was what caused the disappearance, but no one wants to talk about it.<br />Lacey gets deeper and deeper involved, befriending a family friend and historian, Ryan, whom she falls in love with.   Between the two of them they unravel the secrets that lie at Harper's Ferry.<br />I enjoyed this story a lot, but had a big problem with all the characters.  I didnt' like any of them, except for the outsider Ryan. All the characters were either too uncaring, or too soft (no backbone) and I couldn't sympathiZe with any one, including the main character.  The storyline however is what kept me reading, because I really  DID want to know who killed Brad!	2001-05-24

As someone else mentioned,  i too had problems with some of the dialogue that ran throughout the novel.  It read like the characters were reciting from a travel brochure.  However,  the story itself was interesting to me and read like a typical Phyllis A Whitney novel.<br />AMETHYST DREAMS is about the mystery behind a missing person,  Susan Trench.  An old college friend of hers,  Hallie Knight, is summoned by  Susan's grandfather Nicholas Trench, to help figure out who killed Susan,  and from there the novel begins.  We learn about the people that meant most to Susan, and what Susan was all about.  Who wanted her dead?  And why?<br />Among the sub plots are Hallie's troubled marraige,  Nicholas's relationships with his wife Anne, who was a famous artist now living on her own, and other various persons that lived on Top Sail Island and were somehow connected to Susan.<br />I wouldnt' recommend this as a first novel for those who haven't read other books by Phyllis A Whitney.  but as a fan, I would definitely recommend it.  Ms Whitney has always been able to create characters that I like, and I find myself wanting to read more simply because she knows how to tell a good story.	2001-05-12

This is not my first Mary Higgins Clark book,and nor will it be my last.   She consistently writes mystery books that I find I cannot put down til I am finished.   This book is definitely no exception.<br />I'LL BE SEEING YOU centers around Meghan Collins,  a television news reporter who in the beginning of the novel is covering the story of a stabbing victim, a woman that happens to look very much like her! Pure coincidence?  Or is there a connection?<br />At the same time,   Meghan is dealing with the disappearnce of her father, Edward Collins, and because of the circumstances,   no one knows whether Edward was murdered, or had just plain disappeared along with a huge sum of money.   Both Meghan and her mother cannot move on with their lives because there is no body recovered from his supposed drowning off the Tappan Zee Bridge.  At the same time, Edward is accused of murdering a woman that all had thought was a reputable scientist at a in-vitro fertilization center.<br />Between the death of the mystery woman and Meghan's father's disappearance,  there unravels a complex story of a man with a double life,  a newstory about the in-vitro fertilization center, and the facts that tie all of them together.  And eventually, Meghan learns the mystery behind the stabbing victim.<br />This is a definite must-read for all Mary Clark Higgins fans!	2001-05-12

Doing so, however,  brings her life back in danger, as the murderer tracks her down.<br />The entire book is filled with suspense as the reader tries to find the answers to Isabelle's murder and what Isabelle knew about her daughter Heather Landi's death in a fiery car accident.  The ending came as a surprise to me and was well worth the wait!  This is yet another great mystery by Mary Higgins Clark.	2001-04-16

In this novel,  the heroine, Regina (Reggie) Mallory, is a young woman who is bent on making Nicholas Eden love her, but because of a series of misunderstandings,  they fight and quarrel and she soon learns to hate him, although deep down she loves him still. Because of an indiscretion,   she suggests to her uncles that Nicholas marries her, and this is where everything starts!   <br />Reggie is a character that is spirited and aggressive, and does not like to conform to the ways of her day.   Nicholas Eden is a rogue, and is used to getting his way with the women, but he is damned if he is tied down to one.  He in time falls for Reggie, but it takes them months before they actually get in sync and figure it all out.<br />There are also a number of uncles that look after Reggie, and each one is different from the other.  I found the character of James Mallory, the pirate,  a very interesting character indeed!   And there is also tony,  Reggie's favorite uncle, who is bent on making sure no one marries her (he is too picky!).<br />I enjoyed reading this book, and am looking forward to reading the rest of the Mallory series.	2001-04-08

Mitch accidentally comes across Morrie on television years later, on Ted Koppel's NIGHTLINE, with Morrie being interviewed on national television.   Mitch had not seen or talked to Morrie since graduation day, and it is years later, spurred on by that Nightline show,  that Mitch seeks out Morrie, and from there they spend the last months of Morrie's life talking about a lot of different topics of importance:  &quot;Money&quot;, &quot;Regrets&quot;, &quot;Fear of Aging&quot;... the list goes on.  Every Tuesday they meet and talk about different subjects, as Morrie slowly succumbs to the disease. We watch with Mitch as Morrie slowly dies in front of our lives, but at the same time Morrie's need to reach out to others does not decline.<br />This was such a wonderful book. Through the eyes of Mitch Albom, who throughout the entire book has a lot of guilt and self doubt about his career choices,  his neglect in keeping touch with old friends,  his family relationships,  we see what a good person Morrie Schwartz was.  Despite his illness (Lou Gehrig's Disease),  Morrie's attitude is always one of positive outlook and hope.   He is the mentor that I think everyone should have had some time in their lives.  He's the father that we all wished we had. <br />Morrie Schwartz did not let death scare him.  He faced it head on, and knowing what he knew, that his time was limited, he lived those last months of his life to the fullest, by letting Mitch Albom record his voice every Tuesday,  discussing life's most important lessons.	2001-03-25

I did enjoy what I read previously.   I wasn't sure I would like this novel, and had a hard time getting into it. It wasn't til I had read past the first few chapters of the book that I could understand where the plot line was going.<br />Once I started figuring out what was going on, i found that although there wasn't much of a plot,  I enjoyed the individual characters:   Roger the dog (and his nemesis the toad);  Puggy, a homeless man that works part time for two russian transplants who use a bar as their cover;  and a half dozen other miscellaneous characters that add to this crazy story that takes place in Miami.  <br />Don't expect a detective novel. Expect some amusing scenes that only Dave Barry could write.   I think that fact that I wasn't a true fan of Dave Barry's helped me enjoy this novel more, because I realy had no expectations.  If you are a fan,   go in knowing this is NOT the best Dave Barry book you will read.	2001-03-20

She's just lost her mother to cancer, her father beats both her and her sister Diane, and she feels often that she's all alone.  She misses her mother terribly,and often envisions seeing and talking to her mother as if she had  never passed away. The book is written from her point of view, so the reader learns about Katie from a more personal perspective.<br />The plot line in Durable Goods is thin, I thought, but the author created a very likeable character in Katie. The first half of the book builds up the character and introduces her relationships with her father (abusive) and sister (sometimes friend, sometimes enemy) and her best friend CherylAnne, who is two years older and is very wise and womanly for her age.  <br />Katie is a strong person for her young years, and that is what makes her so likeable.  Dealing with the death of her mother and her confrontations with her father show how strong she really is. Whereas Dianne tries to escape from her problems,  katie tries to deal with them.<br />This is Elizabeth Berg's first novel, but it was not the first novel of hers that I've read.   I think it was an impressive first novel and  would be a good place to start for anyone new to her books.  Other books I'd highly recommend is Joy School, which continues the saga of katie, and What We Keep,  a story about an older woman who is trying to deal with her past.	2001-03-12

The novel starts with an old man reading out of a notebook, and the story he reads is his story.   We meet Noah, a simple young man who falls in love with a girl who is visiting town for the summer, Allie  Nelson.   They have a brief yet intense romance.  Their love was not meant to be, however. Allie's family comes from upper class southern roots, and they do not approve of her dating a man of Noah's background. The two are forced to separate and over the years they live out their lives, not knowing that they still loved each other.<br />But as Noah had predicted, destiny brought them back together, and we meet the two again years later, with Allie engaged and about to be married to a highly successful lawyer (Lon), and Noah living alone in a house he had told Allie years ago he would fix up and restore.  He lives alone, and still dreams of Allie. When Allie sees this house in the newspaper, she goes to find him on a whim.  What happens between them after being reunited is what dreams are made of. <br />The story in the notebook ends before the reader can know what really happened between Lon,  Noah, and Allie.  Did Allie stay true to her promise and marry Lon?  Or did she choose Noah?   The reader does not find this out til the last chapter.<br />I found this book a very fast read.  This is my second Nicholas Sparks book, and as with MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE,  I enjoyed THE NOTEBOOK very much.  Both were tear jerkers.   I really can't say which book I enjoyed better, but I will certainly read his other books. This book is a definite MUST READ  for all those who love a good romance.

His focus soon turns to Kathy and his need to protect and save her.<br />The three become intertwined as the house becomes the focal point of their existence.  I felt the book took a while to get started, but the more I read the more I was hooked.  As the three of them spiral downward towards a tragic end,  I found I could not put the book down.  The characters are not likeable, I'm afraid, but this does not mean the story is not fascinating to read.	2001-03-04

Their story starts when they are in highschool,  growing up in Kansas in a small town called Bosewell.   Nick Angelo comes from a broken home and lives on the wrong side of the tracks.  Lauren has a home life that seems to be perfect. Yet the two meet and become star crossed lovers.   Tragedy breaks them apart, and years later they meet up again.  Both had moved on, yet neither of them had forgotten the other.   <br />In between the story of Nick and Lauren,  there are other sub plots:   Nick's step sister Cyndra and her struggle to become a famous singer;  an accidental death; and of course the usual sex and drugs that comes with any Jackie Collins novel.<br />I enjoyed this book very much.   I'd say this is one of Jackie Collins' better novels. It read well, and I liked the characters she portrayed in the book.   I wouldnt' mind reading a sequel to this novel.	2001-02-27

AN ISOLATED INCIDENT starts with the murder of Tara Breckenridge, a  gruesome attack on a young teenage girl who was beloved by all.   The story takes place in a small town in the state of Washington,  Seward Island.   Nothing this horrible has ever happened on the island until now, and fingers are pointing.  The townspeople begin to learn what fear is, not knowing anymore who to trust.<br />There are a number of people who are targeted as suspects. Police chief Ruben Martinez is thorough, and with the help of his department, including a young cop named Ginger Earley,   they proceed to eliminate the list of suspects.<br />As the story progresses, we learn that there is more to this town than most want to admit.   Ruben and Ginger encounter  hatred among the towns people,and soon a teacher is accused of being the murderer.  Is it all purely circumstantial evidence?   Or did he truly kill her? And what were his motives?   On the surface it did not even appear he could be the murderer.  But even Ruben and Ginger were convinced that he was.  <br />The teacher is of jewish descent, and this makes the towns people happy,knowing that it wasn't &quot;one of them&quot; that committed this heinous crime.  Racism rears it's ugly head as we see a bad side of the people of Seward Island as they wait eagerly to see the teacher pay for his supposed crime.<br />There is also a romance going between Ruben and Ginger, which I found very sweet.  It also showed the underlining hatred of minorities amongst the towns people, including by Ginger's own mother.  <br />I found the book fast paced and riveting.   The reader may or may not be shocked to find out who the murderer really is.   I found myself guessing til the very end.	2001-01-28

CONNECTIONS is actually 4 separate books combined into one paperback.  Each segment reads as a separate book, as they were originally published as a 4-part serial.  <br />The main story line throughout all 4 segments is a series of murders that affects in some way all the main characters.  There is Kristin, the expensive call-girl who is trying to support her sister who is in a coma;  there is Sally, the big chested super star who is really a down-to-earth simple gal who  happened to become a celebrity;  there is Madison, the journalist, who accidentally meets Sally and finds herself involved in the coverage of a murder; and a host of other fascinating characters, all bigger than life.  And in between the murders there is plenty of sex, violence, and other trash that keeps the pace moving.<br />What I like about Jackie Collins books are the characters.  They are never dull and are always living on the edge, no matter what their profession.  L.A. CONNECTIONS was no exception. The problem with this book was that it read like 4 separate books, when i had been expecting one. It also seemed to have an abrupt ending as if Ms Collins wanted to get this book over with.   This is not to say I didnt enjoy the book. I did, and it was fast reading from start to finish.  But I think this book could have been  better, if the ending was done right, and the 4 separate novels (Power,Obsession, Murder,and Revenge) were re-written to be published properly as a single book.	2001-01-20

In Danticat's novel, Sophie Caco lives in Haiti for the first twelve years of her life, and is raised by her Aunt Atie, the older sister of her mother.  She knows no other life than what her Aunt had been able to give her.<br />At age 12, Sophie's mother instructs that her daughter be returned to her to America.  Sophie leaves her distraught Aunt, the only mother she has ever known, and travels to a far away land to live with a stranger.  She knows her mother only through cassette tapes of her mother's voice, sent to the family in Tahiti periodically as one sends letters.  But as far as she's concerned,her mother is Aunt Atie.<br />When Sophie meets her mother, she finds that she is not what she had expected.  Her mother looks tired.  America was not the land of luxury and opportunity that her mother had thought  it would be.  She works two jobs to make ends meet. She lives in the poor part of town and drives a car that barely runs.  She is terribly thin, too thin, and at night she screams at the demons that try to kill her.   <br />Her mother's emotional well-being is tested every day through nightmares and demons of a past that Sophie was never aware of, until slowly she learns of her mother's story:  Sophie is the result of a rape, when her mother was a very young girl.  Her mother's  world is a world of sexual and mental abuse, and it is passed down to Sophie, through &quot;tests&quot; that leave an emotional scar on Sophie, to the point where she too begins to have recurring nightmares.<br />Sophie learns to resent her mother. She falls in love with the neighbor, an older man who is a musician, and he returns her love.  She finally leaves her mother by running away and eloping with Joseph.<br />Her marraige is not easy, however.  Sophie again runs away, this time to Haiti 6 months after the birth of their daugher Brigitte, seeking the only family she has known.  Back home again, she is reunited with Tante Atie and her grandmother, who only talks of death.  It has been 6 years since Sophie had left Haiti, and she returns as a grown woman and with her first child.  <br />BREATH,EYES, MEMORY is more than just a story of a Haitian girl being uprooted to America.  It's a story of discovery of self, and about the recovery from childhood abuse and forgiveness.  Young Sophie learns to deal with her past and her  mother's history, and we see her grow as a character who eventually is able to break free of the cycle of abuse handed down from generation to generation.<br />I highly recommend this book.   I enjoyed reading about the life that Sophie lived in Haiti, a world totally foreign to me, but at the same time was brought closer to it with the imagery that Ms Danticat painted on these pages. The story of abuse and reconcillation was convincing and real to  me.   Am looking foward to reading her next novel.	2001-01-14
2141683:US	51214937	R2F0PM29TPXCH2	0440068495	346345862	The Passion and the Fury	Books	3	2	2	N	N	The passion and fury of Reconstruction in the deep South	Never judge a book by its cover.   This book that I hold in my hand has the typical book cover of a romance novel:   a man and a woman in each other's arms,   windswept hair,  etc.   Even the blurb on the front cover was deceptive, giving me the impression that this book was a cheap romance.   Guess again.<br />THE PASSION AND THE FURY is a historical/fiction novel about reconstruction, and how it affected people in this part of South Carolina.  There is no romance, not much of it anyway.  The central characters are two men:  Jackson Devere, and Lance Broadthorn, who grew up together on a plantation, one man white and the other black.   E.J. Devere is Jackson's sister in law. His brother died by accident,thrown by a horse (but we later find out that he was murdered) and between the three of them, we have a story.   <br />E.J. doesn't figure prominently in this book, except that she belongs to the Ku Klux Klan until she finds out how violent some of their members have become, and she bows out.   She grapples with the idea of freed slaves (she does not feel this is right, to have these slaves living on their own unprotected).  Jackson owns a newspaper, and with it he tries to spread the message that all men are equal and that we cannot live in the past.  Lance is half white and is torn between his loyalties to Jackson and his newspaper,and his own true background, one of slavery.<br />The book had several violent scenes which may not have been necessary for the book to get its message across.   The scene that stands out is  a KKK cross burning.   Very graphic and violent.  Another scene has Colonel Handie, the head of the KKK,  abuse his daugther Bette Lee.  I found it very disturbing in some respects, and wasn't sure if this type of scene belonged in this book.<br />As a novel, I give it 3 stars, mainly for being an interesting read on Reconstruction.   My history is faulty, so I dont know how much of it was true.  But if you were picking up this book to read a romance, you will be very disappointed.	2001-01-13

Johnnie Mae blames herself for the drowning, because she was supposed to be watching over Clara as they were playing in the waters of the Potomac River, and the story continues as we see Johnnie trying to make sense of Clara's death.  The girls were swimming in the dangerous waters of the river because they were not allowed to swim in the public swimming pool, which was for Whites Only.<br />Although one would think this was a story of a family trying to come to terms with a death in the family, it is not.   This book is a series of disjointed snapshots about various friends and family members related to Johnnie Mae, and through these snap shots we get a broader picture of what life was like in Georgetown in the 1920's, if one was black.   <br />Water seems to play an important part in this book, although again somewhat disjointly.  Water was what killed young Clara, but water was also what brought joy to Johnnie Mae, who excelled at swimming and finds freedom when in the water.  Although the book is more of a snapshot than a cohesive story,   one can say that there is a theme involved where water is such a force that it can destroy, or build.<br />I can't give this book a 5 star recommendation, but I did enjoy the images that Breena Clarke painted in each of the chapters.	2001-01-08

The story is told from the viewpoint of young Francis Mccourt, from the young age of about 5 or 6 til he hits the age of 19, and we see him age before our eyes as the writing style changes from chapter to chapter.<br />   Frank's mother is Angela, and she suffers daily trying to keep her children fed and clothed, trying to make ends meet because her husband is so lazy and full of drink that she can never depend on him to do a full day's work for pay.  And when Malachy McCourt does get paid,  he ends up at the local taverns and pubs,  drinking his weekly pay.   Angela has to resort to finding the odd job, or worse yet, to begging at the welfare offices.<br />Frank and his family start out life in America, but move to Ireland to escape the poverty they knew in America, thinking they would find a better life in Ireland. They were wrong. The McCourts live a life of extreme poverty in their new homeland, but the book is told in the voice of someone who sees life in a different light.  You want to laugh with Frank when he describes the terrible conditions they live in - an entire section alone was devoted to the stinking toilet that they had to share with the rest of the neighborhood.   It was a hard life for them all, but from the tone of young Francis, the reader does not always get that impreession.  All he and his family knew was poverty, and they existed in this way as best they could.<br />ANGELA'S ASHES won the PulitZer Prize and it was well deserved. Frank Mccourt's masterpiece on life in Ireland told in the voice of a young Irish American boy is haunting yet real. It's a serious book, but the tone is light-hearted.   The spirit of young Francis McCourt shines through each page, and you root for him when he inches his way toward his goal: to buy a ticket to America.	2000-12-23

THE RAPTURE OF CANAAN revolves around a young teenage girl, Ninah Huff and her life in the &quot;compounds&quot; of the Church of Fire and Brimstone and God's Almighty Baptizing Wind.  The church itself was founded by her grandfather, Grandpa Herman (her mother's father), and Grandpa lays down the law for all those who live within this rather extreme religious group.<br />She and all the others live a very segregated life, away from the modern world. They are not allowed to associate with others outside their faith, including other Christians who are not deemed as good and pure as they are.  They live strictly by the bible as Grandpa Herman reads it, and are punished for the slightest &quot;sin&quot;, no matter how little or trivial the sin is.  They are not allowed to take  medication or see doctors, they work in the fields and raise their own food,and they are not allowed to touch persons of the opposite sex, including their fiances, until they are married. <br />As Ninah grows older, she starts to question the practises of her group. She keeps these thoughts to herself, but confides a little with her prayer partner, James, who she has had a crush on for some time. He reciprocates her feelings, and soon they start to  &quot;sin&quot; during their prayer time together, believing they are making love to Jesus through each other.<br />Ninah eventualy finds herself pregnant, and her world turns upside down.  She is punished for her behavior (dunk under water in the river, irregardless of her being pregnant) and it is amazing that she and her baby arent' harmed by this treatment.  <br />Soon the church is divided, with one side backing Ninah and appalled with the harsh treatment her grandfather instructs to be directed at her.  She is not allowed to see anyone during the rest of her pregnancy, and without her permission her baby is taken away from her.  The rest of the church believe that Grandpa Herman is doing the right thing by using Ninah as an example and showingthe others how they should live without sin, else face the consequences. <br />I highly recommend this book.   The content of the story may be a bit extreme for some, but I found that I could not put this book down.	2000-12-17

Although he's married,  Katie imagines herself dating him and they soon develop a close friendship.  <br />Life couldn't be more complicated, until katie finds out her housekeeper is in love with her father!   what more could go wrong?  <br />I enjoyed Joy School.   Elizabeth Berg is becoming one of my favorite writers. Her characters are always people you wouldn't mind meeting,and you find yourself caring about them.  I thought the book was too short, and wouldn't mind reading a sequel.	2000-12-16

He was her second husband,  after she had been married to an abusive drifter named John Woodrow, who she met on her father's farm.  <br />The story starts with Jack reminiscing about Ruby, and then goes into detail the life she lead and how she met Jack.  Ruby's life as a child was one of ease, since her father owned a farm and they were comfortable. But she chose to marry one of the migrant workers on the farm and from there her life turned for the worse.  Her first husband was abusive emotionally and physically and finally left her for a girl much younger than Ruby.  She meets Jack shortly after her husband dies.<br />The book starts with her death (from lung cancer) and back tracks to her childhood,   her first marraige, and then to happier years with Jack.  Each chapter has a different narrator,  switching back and forth between Ruby and Jack.  I liked this method of story telling, although at first I found it confusing.   <br />I recommend A VIRTUOUS WOMAN for the story content and the writing style.	2000-12-16

Molly was given away for adoption as an infant, and has only known her adoptive parents.  However, sheer chance brings her into contact with the man who is about to marry her twin sister, whom she never knew to exist.  Filled with doubt,  Molly follows Charles Landry to South Carolina to meet the family she never knew.<br />As the story progresses,  Molly learns about her biological family, and finds that there are some deep secrets that may have eventually led to her adoption years ago. The big shocking secret is that her adoption may have been a result of a kidnapping, and for some reason the family seems to know about the crime but refuses to shed light on it.<br />As she learns about these family secrets, her life starts to take a turn for the worse, as she finds herself in danger and a target for murder.<br />I really enjoyed this novel by Phyllis Whitney.  I've been a fan of hers for over 20 years now, and her novels still have the same impact they had on me way back when.  She hasn't lost her touch.  Ms Whitney knows how to write a good romance mystery and is probably the best in the genre.	2000-12-14

There doesn't seem to be any way that they could clear their name.   Then,  slowly, as the two get to know each other,   they figure out what connects the two of them to the murdered man, and Fiona learns that her childhood and the father she thought she knew, were all a bunch of lies, and with help from Ace, she learns who her father really was.<br />This was my first Jude Deveraux book.  I found it a fast read, with a lot of suspense and adventure and romance mixed in with it.   Although I enjoyed reading the book, and was looking forward to each chapter's new twist in the plot,  I found a lot of what happened to the characters was a little far-fetched and almost too convenient, for lack of a better word.  There were too many twists and turns that somehow almost did not make this story believable to me.  I would recommend this book for the exciting story line and fast read.	2000-11-23

Despite the theme of divorce, I felt it was a much lighter book than the first book of hers I read, WHAT WE KEEP.

Jackie Collins always knows how to write a fast paced book,and this certainly is no exception.  <br />Hollywood Husbands main characters are:   Jack Python, whose one hour weekly talk show is THE show to watch on tv; Howard Solomon is the head of Orpheus Studios and has a lot of power behind the camera; and Mannon Cable is an actor who is still in love with is ex wife Whitney, another super star in her own right. However,  Mannon is currently married to a bimbo named Melanie-Shanna, who he married to make Whitney jealous.   <br />The plotlines revolve around these characters, with a cast of many others including a dynamic character named Silver Anderson. Her storyline alone makes this book a good read!  <br />I had a hard time getting into this book when I first started reading it. It wasn't that the pace was slow,  but I couldn't figure out where the plot line was going.   Too many characters to keep track of in the beginning,  but I soon found myself immersed in the story lines.  <br />This may not be my favorite Jackie Collins novel, but I hope those of you who chose Hollywood Husbands as your first Jackie Collins novel try one of her better books, such as the Lucky Santangelo novels, and you'll see why Jackie Collins' fans are hooked.	2000-11-02

Uncle Mike lives not too far away, but for some reason does not really want to have a lot to do with Harley and his sisters.<br />Harley holds down two jobs to make ends meet.  They barely survive on his income, eating meals such as hot dogs or pizza for dinner, if anything.    All of them are obviously emtionally on edge and things get worse as Harley slowly finds out what really happened to dad.   <br />In the mean time, he gets involved with Jody's best friend's mother, who happens to be married,and this leads to more troubles at home.    <br />Although this story seems to be pretty convoluted and over done, I found it yet another great pick by Oprah.   I really liked the character of Harley and felt very sympathetic to his situation.    He has a good heart underneath it all, and this is what I think kept him going.  The book may be a bit too much for some readers, but I found the storyline kept me interested til the very end.	2000-10-28

I bought this book around the start of my relationship with my fiance.    After being through several unsuccessful relationships,   I thought it would be interesting to read this book and see if my fiance and I were following the rules established by John Gray.  I found his advice very helpful, and at the same time felt reassured as my fiance and I had already been following the patterns set down in this book, which should lead to a successful relationship and subsequent marriage.<br />John Gray's series MARS AND VENUS are all excellent books, and this is no exception.    He gives examples on what to do and what not to do, and it's all written in plain english.  I found all of it interesting and fun.<br />The reason for only  a 4 star rating is because I personally did not agree with everything he said in the book, but this is my own personal opinion.  The book is well written and is a must-read for any one about to pursue a new relationship.	2000-10-28

As always,   Jackie Collins has done a great job in writing a fast paced novel.  The &quot;Lucky&quot; Books seem to be her best and this is no exception.    Great characters all around too.

We root for Lucky as she tries to find the killers and as always there is that happy ending!   You wont' be disappointed with DANGEROUS KISS.	2000-10-22

The public only knows her as Lara Cameron, powerful real estate developer.  She leads them all to believe her father was also a rich real estate developer from Scotland, but the truth is,  she grew up with an abusive father who was only glad to be rid of her.  <br />But through the contacts she makes early on in her life, she learns how to become independent and leaves Canada for a new life in the States.  And from there her empire takes off.<br />Within the story is a mystery -   as Lara gets  more powerful,   she notices &quot;things&quot; starting to happen.  She befriends a man that she suspects is affiliated with the mafia, and they start an affair. At one point she suspects foul play (to her advantage) in the development of one of her buildings, and she starts to think that  Paul Martin is behind it.  She does not know if she can trust him.<br />As the story progresses,  we learn more about the people who are close to her, and it is not until the very end that the mystery is unravelled and we learn who had been the one behind a number of accidents and other unscrupuolous dealings to help Lara build her empire.<br />I liked this book.   It's one of Sidney Sheldon's better novels. As always, it was fast reading and well written.   The characters are all memorable and you can always sympathize with the main character.    A must-read for all fan.	2000-10-22

TELL ME YOUR DREAMS starts out with the introduction of three women, Ashley, Toni, and Alette.  All three are very different, and only two of them know each other.   A few chapters and several murders later, we find out that all three women are the same person.   It's a story centered on multiple personality disorder, and I found it fascinating.  The controversy behind this disorder is one of the main themes of the book - does it really exist?  Are there truly people out there that ARE made up of several distinct personalities in one person?  <br />TELL ME YOUR DREAMS is one  of many Sidney Sheldon books I've read over the years.  This novel, however, is written in a slightly different format.   Although this novel was great,  I felt that it could've been treated as two different novels, because there are actually two different &quot;endings&quot; to this story: the conclusion of the trial is one ending, and the afterward that goes into Ashley's psychiatric case is another conclusion. It read like TWO books,  with the 2nd part of the book being an &quot;addendum&quot; to the first; a follow up story to what happened to the woman with the split personalities.   Although both parts of the book were interesting enough for me,  I dont' feel this is one of Sheldon's better novels, in terms of structure.  <br />But as always,  he knows how to tell a good story!  I could not put this book down and it created an interest to look further into cases of multiple personality disorders.  I recommend this book, especially to fans of Sidney Sheldon.	2000-10-21

CALIFORNIA GOLD is the story of Macklin Chance, who like many others of his day,  journeys to the land of California with the hopes of finding a new life and fortune.   It is the start of the gold rush, and Macklin, along with thousands of others,  help build the state of California in the late 1800's and early 1900's.   <br />Macklin starts from the bottom and works his way to the top,and along the way he encounters the men that helped build California:   Leland Stanford,  Randolph Hearst, to name a few.   <br />As in all John Jakes novels,  CALIFORNIA GOLD is filled with a lot of history and a lot of great characters.    I thoroughly enjoyed this book, although I do not feel it's Jake's best.   I felt the ending was a little disappointing - can't explain it but it felt wrong to me - but otherwise this was one of those books that I couldn't put down.   A must-read for all John Jakes fans!	2000-10-20

I'M GOOD ENOUGH, I'M SMART ENOUGH, AND DOGGONE IT, PEOPLE LIKE ME!, is a year in the life of Stuart Smalley, the character created by Al Franken,  seen on Saturday Night Live.   The book is written in journal format - each day is a daily affirmation, and Stuart gives us advice and tips on various subjects as he works his way along the road to recovery (he belongs to several 12 step groups).<br />The book had me laughing so hard -  especially the references to the 12 step lingo - he refers to his higher power constantly - and his affirmations themselves are funny unto themselves.   Each page is a new day, and a new problem to tackle: social problems, ex boyfriends, jealousies,  insecurities...  at one point he becomes the executor of a will, of all things!  And the book reads as one big gossip-fest....  he rambles on in his journal as if he's talking, and THAT'S okay!!!<br />I am having a hard time describing this book, but all i can say is READ IT.   It had me in stitches!!	2000-10-20

During the flight to California, she remembers the events that lead up to her mother's departure. Ginny was 12 years old when she last sees her mother, and we see the events through Ginny's 12 year old eyes.  And although the 12 year old Ginny does not fully understand why things happened the way they did,   the reader will note things that the young inexperienced Ginny could not understand.   The adult Ginny finally is able to understand, and it takes the reunion with Ginny, older sister Sharla, and their mother Marion to help her realize why her mother left them all those years ago.<br />This was the first time I read a book by Elizabeth Berg and I was very pleased.  I found it to be a fast read. Her descriptions were so vivid that I could imagine the characters as if watching a movie.  I also found her characters to be interesting and real. I could relate to them and understand them.  I am looking forward to reading more by Elizabeth Berg.	2000-10-14

He also writes about his relationship with his wife Rosalyn and their children, his relationship with his parents, and what he has been doing since he left the White House in 1980.  <br />Although I am not a religious person,  I was still able to enjoy this book because it gave me insight to Carter's character - a good hearted person who lives and has lived with good intentions and a purpose to help others.  This book is a must-read for any one that is an admirer of Jimmy Carter.	2000-10-14

Jefferson is a young black man that is accused wrongfully of a murder he did not commit. His crime? Being in the wrong place at the wrong time. But because he is black, and there are no other survivors to this crime,  he is locked up in prison and sentenced to die in the electric chair.<br />Another black man,  Grant Higgins, is asked to talk to Jefferson in his jail cell.   Grant is to help Jefferson become a dignified person before he is put to death.   Jefferson refers to himself as a hog, because that is what the white men call him when they sentence him to death.   So,  Grant's aunt who is a friend of Jefferson's godmother, known as Nannan,  asks him to intervene.  Nannan wants to know that Jefferson dies with dignity,as a man.<br />Through Grant's eyes we see what Jefferson goes through as he prepares himself to die.  We also witness what life is like for the black man in a segregated world.  Jefferson had no chance of proving himself innocent.  In this world of Loiusiana, circa 1940, the black man was guilty because of his color.  No one fought this verdict. It was accepted.  Even Grant Wiggins, who was educated (rare for a black man in his day) and taught in school, did not try to prove Jefferson innocent.  <br />I found myself reading the book with acceptance, knowing that it was Jefferson's fate to die in that chair. But when I came to that last chapter,  the idea hit me hard and as other reviewers have noted,  it is a 3 hanky chapter.  <br />A Lesson Before Dying, in my opinion, is destined to become a classic.	2000-10-07

Read it for what it is - a fun romance that's light and airy and meant to take you and your mind into a world away from today's every day grind.  <br />Stella decides to take a last minute trip to Jamaica, and winds up having the time of her life and meeting the man of her dreams, a man a LOT younger than she is!  But who cares?  Stella does at first, and fights this battle all the way til the end.   She falls madly in love with Winston, who is barely in his 20's, but he's the kind of man she's always dreamed of, and they &quot;click&quot;!  <br />I loved the style of the book - the rambling sentences that took us into Stella's mind.   I loved the time she spent in Jamaica, and the fact that she had the guts to do this trip (it is something I've done myself, on a similar whim!! I can totally relate!).   Stella teaches us that you dont' have to be stuck in your rut and conform - go and do  what makes you feel good!    Have fun!!	2000-10-07

On The Beach is the story of the results of a nuclear war and the last days left for those that survived it. The war pretty much has annihilated the Northern Hemisphere, with the remaining population living mostly in Austrailia, where most of the story takes place.   We watch as these people, knowing that their time is limited due to the &quot;nuclear cloud&quot; that is slowly drifting towards the southern hemisphere,  live their last months to their fullest.   We have the Navy, headed by the Austrailians and one American, sailing to the north in search of survivors of this war.   We have people like you and I,  living in Austrailia,  going about their every day lives, living as if there IS a  tomorrow, as if there IS a next year.   The tension increases as the story heads towards the end, and the reader knows there is no mistaking what that end would be.  <br />There is no blood or gore in this post-nuclear war story.   If you want that,  rent MAD MAX.  This book is about people living every day,knowing that their lives are about to be cut short. It's about people dying with dignity.  And it's about the devastation of war, and the stupidity that can cause a nuclear war in our own futures.<br />Nevil Shute's ON THE BEACH is a classic.   If you want to read a great nuclear war/end of the world  book written before the end of the Cold War, this is it.	2000-10-07

I found that the book was written well, but it was hard for me to have any sympathy for the main character, Jo Becker: a 50-ish woman, married, three daughters, and had a thriving career as a veterinarian.  <br />But despite the good things in her life, she is drawn to her distant past that she had kept secret from her children for decades.   She meets and reacquaints herself, through one daughter's professor in college,  with a man she hadn't seen since the 1960's, a man whom she shares a terrible secret.   <br />The book is written in the present, but takes a u-turn into Jo's past when she meets this old acquaintance, Eli, and then relives the rather bohemian lifestyle when she lived with a number of housemates a year or two after leaving her first husband, a college sweetheart.   The past reveals a different side of Jo, a side that her daughters are not aware of, and a side that her current husband, the father of her daughters, cannot comprehend, but had accepted, or so Jo thought.  <br />What I didnt' like about Jo was that it seemed that throughout her life, she was running away from her problems.   She ran away from her first husband by joining a group of people and living a bohemian life.   Even as an adult she was running away, if not physically, at least mentally and emotionally.  I find that distasteful in a person, and therefore I had a very hard time liking Jo.   <br />Despite this fact,  I  enjoyed the story for what it was:  a psychological look into a person and how tragedies in this person's past shaped her and changed her to what she became in the present.  Despite the many negative aspects of the story (dont' expect a happy ending),  I found this book to be very enjoyable on a different level.   I didnt' like Jo, but I found myself very interested in what happens to her, and what happened to her in her past. For this reason, it didnt' take me long to finish this book.   I almost couldn't  put it down.<br />I recommend this book, but with a warning -  you will probably not like Jo Becker.  Be prepared for that!	2000-10-07

Donna German is the queen of the bread machine books.  I have never gone wrong with any of her recipes and with this in mind, I purchased her Focaccia book.   I was not disappointed.   The first section of the book explains exactly what you need to know about making focaccia bread, and for one that does not bake much at all,   I found this book very helpful.  I was successful with my first focaccia bread I baked, and my fiance is the proof.  He asks for this bread every weekend.   <br />The recipes are simple, and allows one to be creative as one bakes.   I follow German's basic recipe, but I often add my own blend of ingredients as I go along.<br />Baking bread is fun, Donna German style!	2000-09-27

I started out viewing the Evelyn Wood videos (3  videos), which showed me the basic principles on speed reading.   But Peter Kump's book was filled with more exercises than the three videos could have gone over with the viewer.   <br />I found that even without the background I already had in the methods that Evelyn Wood teaches,   the Peter Kump book is excellent and stands on its own.   The exercises are explained thoroughly and not only does he teach rapid reading but also teaches comprehension techniques as well.<br />I was able to triple my speed in a matter of hours.  With diligence I should be to able to increase my  speed 5-fold,maybe 10-fold.   The only other thing the reader should have is a timer or stop watch to help time oneself during the exercises.	2000-09-25

I chose to read Poisonwood Bible because it was listed as an Oprah Book Club selection. Having never read a book from her list before,  I was intrigued by what she would be recommending to her readers.  I was immediately impressed.   <br />What I found most interesting is the fact that this book had not one, but 5 different narrators.   I felt that writing the various chapters with different voices was a great way to develop the 5 characters, who were united in some way in how they felt about the father of the family, a baptist minister stubborn in his need to save the African peoples from damnation.<br />The book is written on an epic scale, spanning several decades as we watch the 4 daughters change and grow,  created by the life they live in the Belgian Congo.  The four daugthers and their mother  go through devastating tragedies during their years in Africa, and what they see and experience shapes them into the adults they later become.<br />I think this book is a &quot;must-read&quot;, but be warned - it's over 500 pages if I recall properly.	2000-09-25
