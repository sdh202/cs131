12681:US	50669529	RFWATOUJ2DBID	0689859376	755887514	The Seeing Stone	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Bought a set each for my nephew and niece	For some reason I've started to enjoy children's literature more than I ever did as a kid. I found the Spiderwick Chronicles recently and decided to try the first in the series. I thoroughly enjoyed the Field Guide, so I decided to get the others as well.<br /><br />The Seeing Stone carries the children a step farther in development.  When one of the twins is given the ability to see the fairy world that he inhabits, he begins to run afoul of the various forces of that world.  He begins to learn their power and when his twin is kidnapped he goes off in search of him with the aid of the stone and his sister's skill with the fencing foil.  The sibblings learn to trust and understand one another just a little more than earlier, and their relationships are somewhat better by the end of the book.<br /><br />One of the things I like most is that the children are children as they really are, rather than children as adults would like them to be. Their squabbles, juvenile diplomacy, and united front against a common \\"enemy\\" are very realistic.  My only concern is that some of the situations might need parental discussion.  For instance, it might be a good idea if your child were aware that if a sibbling is kidnapped, going after the culprit by him or herself is not a good idea.  It might be better to find the nearest responsible adult known to the child to report the event and start a proper search.  Otherwise, the authorities might be looking for two children.<br /><br />The books are nicely bound and would make a lovely addition to a child's own collection. The vocabulary of the book is very accessible to most children at third grade or above. Smaller children will probably enjoy it as a read-to-me book. It might be nice for an older child who already reads to share with a younger one who can't yet or is still a beginner. I could see it as a nice series for a childrens' reading room in a public library with a volunteer reader.	2005-10-06

I also like seeing children come to appreciate their sibbling's abilities and value.  The book also devels however lightly with the issue of growing up and with not wanting to compete with someone you like.<br /><br />The plot is very active--not that the others weren't.  It carries the reader through the adventure and sets up the tension for the final volume, making it very evident that they are all of a whole fabric.<br /><br />Again, the book is very nicely bound, the illustrations are very nice, and the price is reasonable enough that it may be easily added to a child's own library.	2005-10-06

Unlike some stories, the Spiderwick Chronicals have a finish.  This has allowed the author to have a beginnig, middle and end that makes sense.  The continuity shows, when the children are able to resolve the difficulties of the fairy world and help their great aunt to come to terms with a loss of many years' standing.<br /><br />The story confronts the issues of parent's relationships with one another, with the loss of people important to one, with the realities of adulthood, and growing up emotionally whole.  It does so gracefully and with panache.<br /><br />A fun book.	2005-10-06

My own was extremely eccentric, but the children's Great Aunt Lucinda is rather dear.<br /><br />In this volume, the children have already learned what they're up against and to what extent their invisible neighbors will go to obtain the book their great grand uncle compiled.  More worried about what they don't know than what they do, they decide to check out their great aunt to find out what she knows.<br /><br />By introducing this lady, the authors have developed the history of the book, the neighborhood and the fight for control.  It becomes a more rounded story that sets the children firmly on a family tree.  For younger children, this may be a good time to introduce family relationships.  Just how are people related to one another and what does it mean in terms of themselves and others?<br /><br />Again, a nice book to add to a child's own library, a good addition for a public reading room in a library with a volunteer reader.<br /><br />Another delightful trip into the mysteries of the Spiderwick chronicals.	2005-10-06

I found the Spiderwick Chronicles recently and decided to try the first in the series.  I thoroughly enjoyed the Field Guide.  The concept of hidden things and hidden places has always fascinated me, and the book offers plenty of those.  Having visited in childhood the rickety and spooky old Victorian mansion in which my Great Aunt Blanche resided, I can relate to the children's experience completely.  Everyone should have a Great Aunt Blanche in their life.<br /><br />One of the things I like most is that the children are children as they really are, rather than children as we'd like them to be.  Their squabbles, juvenile diplomacy, and united front against the common \\"enemy\\" are very realistic; it's delightful.  I suspect that this aspect of the book will appeal to most young readers, since they can usually smell a \\"lecture\\" however appealingly presented a mile away.<br /><br />The books are nicely bound and would make a lovely addition to a child's own collection.  The vocabulary of the book is very accessible to most children at third grade or above.  Smaller children will probably enjoy it as a read-to-me book.

Talk about putting the post Roman period into perspective!<br /><br />Both books are old ones, Leslie Alcock's Arthur's Britain (1971) and Eleanor Shipley Duckett's Alfred The Great The King and his England (1956). Both are superb, but of the two, Alcock's is the more thorough.  Although there are doubtless things which have come to light about the time period of the two, roughly 400-900 A.D., I suspect that the general content of the history of the period is still unchanged by virtue of the lack of any substantially new information.<br /><br />For Arthur there is still little more than the later medieval legends that we still enjoy hearing to illuminate his character.  Whether he was a Romanized Britain serving a local king in the fight against invading Angles, Saxons, Juts and others, or a king as he is described in the later chronicles, we will probably never know. Even whether he was one man or a composite is up for grabs, although Alcock makes no bones about where he stands on this issue.  Arthur's significance in his own time was dictated by the needs and interests of the period; his significance in ours is his model of a true and heroic king.  These two aspects have little to do with one another.<br /><br />What Alcock does in lieu of concrete data on Arthur the man, is to define with great clarity the character of his time.  Alcock  is an archaeologist and it shows, for he brings to life the information produced from habitation and defensive sites in a way that makes silent stones speak.  His study of the character of pottery finds, their distribution, source and manufacture through time, suggests that the England of Arthur's time had lost much of its native industry and returned to local cottage industry.  The absence of coinage suggests that a money economy had evaporated as the Roman Empire pulled out of the country to defend itself closer to home.  The failure of cities suggests that they were no longer needed and that the population wasn't there to require them.  The integration of economy, education, elaborate political and judicial structures could no longer be supported and it disappeared.  Without the core of Roman establishment to support it, society returned to simpler forms perhaps even declining in numbers<br /><br />He also points out that the tale of carnage and barbarity that the history of the time portrays may not have been quite the reality of those living then, but more the convention of heroic poetry.  Like many archaeologists, he questions the motives of the sources for the period.  Little evidence in the form of burned and destroyed layers in settlements suggests to him that the time was as violent as it has been believed to have been.  Instead, the movements of continental people into England are envisioned as having been of some long standing, beginning in the time of the Romans as a matter of defense against the same areas of military difficulty that presented William the Conqueror with problems in his time: Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.  That the inhabitants of England moved back and forth between the island and the continent is surely suggested by the fact that when prospects arose for adventure and advancement in Europe during the decline of the Empire, the young men of England crossed the channel.  That Vortigern was able to encourage continental people to move to England to settle and defend the land suggests that a great deal of exchange was possible.  It also suggests that Vortegern felt he could trust these people and that his greatest concern for the safety of his society came from the same sources it had always come, from Scotland, Wales, and Ireland.  Certainly the concept of a national identity in this region was well in the future, and allegiance was more to the person and character of an individual leader than to a set nationality.  Even in Alfred's time almost 300 years later, individuals tended to collect at the court of a victorious and virtuous leader.<br /><br />Alfred on the other hand is an historic figure about whom a fair amount of information is at hand.  Professor Duckett does an excellent job of pulling together the events of his reign, making a coherent story of the defense of England against the Danes.  Here we make an about face of some note.  Instead of being the dreaded pagan outsiders, invaders of the island, and despoilers of British society, the Saxons are seen as the center of society, defenders of the realm, supporters of the faith against the pagan Vikings.  In something like three hundred years, the Saxons have become the people of England.  That there were battles between Britains and Saxons during Arthur's time is very likely.  But there were battles between individual British kings as well.  It was an age of struggle between leaders of various groups to see who would serve whom.  It was sort of the \\"wild west\\" of Europe.  By Alfred's time, these issues had largely been settled.  The island had been subdivided into kingdoms, whose borders fluctuated with the abilities of the reigning monarchs vis a vis one another, but for the most part, society itself was stable.  Enter the Vikings, however, and again things are up for grabs.  It seems likely, although Duckett doesn't mention it, that the climate of the period had changed enough to bring about population movements.  Certainly the political climate of the northern countries had changed, which she does mention, as Harold Fairhair began to reorganize them into his own large domain.  This left a large body of people at lose ends and brought trouble to the shores of both the English isles and to the coasts and fluvial plains of Europe.<br /><br />Duckett is an historian and classicist.  As such she focuses on the written history of the Angles and Saxons.  It would have been enjoyable to have had more information about the material remains from the period, a la Alcock, to throw the story of Alfred into greater relief against the background of what remains.  One would especially like to have known if the violence and destruction was really as wide spread as suggested and if the people living in Dane held and Saxon held lands were really as distinctive as their national identities suggest.  Were they treated any differently by their masters.  Did they mix more freely than indicated, etc.  This type of information is likely to come from archaeology than from written records, most of which come from biased sources.<br /><br />Altogether two wonderful books that go a long way toward making a murky period clearer.

It's also a ray of hope.<br /><br />I've often thought that many of the needle arts, particularly the lace making types, have gone out of fashion simply because we have so little use for them any more. Furthermore, not many people appreciate the sophistication of technique and time that is required to produce them. Ms Morton's book definitely shows that notion to the door.She also shows where the needle arts are really headed these days. When you read a book like hers, you see that it isn't the art itself that's \\"tired\\" or \\"useless\\" but the way we use them.<br /><br />If you're looking for an imaginative way to use tatted motifs, I'd check out Tatting Patterns by Lyn Morton.  The book illustrates designs that even the beginning tatter can do, including simple daisy chains and designs for snowflakes.  The author also uses a wonderful palate of colors that liven up her patterns and show that tatting needn't be grandma's ecru table cloth or white doilies.  Here too are a variety of suggestions for cards, jewelry, wall and window hangings.  For those of you interested in beading, she also includes designs with beading included in the motif.<br /><br />Truly a joy.	2005-08-17

I first ran into a copy in a library in Arizona while visiting my mother and brother.  I copied some of the designs to try out and found them so satisfying that I ultimately purchased the book itself.  It's one of my more treasured tatting books.<br /><br />Some of the designs are overwhelming, not because of the technique involved so much as for the time involved. I have little disposable free time, and a project of any great magnitude is likely to take an eternity. Some of the designs are very useful for tatted snowflakes, which I've made by the score for Christmas cards and tree ornaments. These projects are brief, the equipment small enough to fit into a pocket or purse to be done in spare moments--I've discovered I've the patience of a saint waiting in doctor's and dentist's offices or in line for anything--and are appreciated by most of the people who receive them as gifts.	2005-08-17

None of the designs is particularly difficult from the perspective of technique, but for those of us with very little free time on our hands, the amount of time and patience that would be required to produce some of them is just plain too much, especially for the uses that the author suggests.<br /><br />I've often thought that many of the needle arts, particularly the lace making types, have gone out of fashion simply because we have so little use for them any more.  Furthermore, not many people appreciate the sophistication of technique and time that is required to produce them.  If anything Ms Austin's book only confirms that suspicion.  Most of the uses to which she put her designs seem forced, almost desperate.  Why would anyone spend hours tatting something for a teddy bear?  Most of the illustrations have a tired look about them, but perhaps this is the outcome of the nostalgia motif of the book itself. The antique d&eacute;cor and the keepsakes from bygone days are pretty much where most of the patterns belong.  Certainly the cotton bed spread type threads used to create some of them didn't help.<br /><br />If you're looking to learn tatting, I'd try another book on the subject.  Or better still find someone to actually show you how.  It's a little difficult to catch on to at first, because the natural tendency is to pull the wrong thread tight and end up making knots rather than slip stitches.  If you've already tried unsuccessfully to tat with a shuttle,look at a book or two on needle tatting.  You may find this easier to do.  After learning it this way, you may find that shuttle tatting is easier to do.<br /><br />If you're looking for an imaginative way to use what you've already learned, I'd check out Tatting Collage, by Lindsay Rogers.  She shares splendid ideas that even the most beginning of tatters can do, and she also shows where the needle arts are really headed these days.

Furthermore, not many people appreciate the sophistication of technique and time that is required to produce them.  Now comes Ms Rogers and her delightful little book and new hope arises. The author shares splendid ideas that even the most beginning of tatters can do, and she also shows where the needle arts are really headed these days. When you read a book like hers, you see that it isn't the art itself that's \\"tired\\" or \\"useles\\" but the way we use them.  While the smaller tableau are clever and delightful, my favorites are her Bonsai Tree Collages and her cards for special occasions.  You can't beat these.  If you're looking for something refreshing to do with your tatted motives.  This is the book.	2005-08-17

The only negative I have to offer is that it comes--in a growing tradition--grossly over packaged.  Although described as \\"hardbound,\\" in fact it is a soft bound book of 64 pages inserted into a hardbound cover which includes a huge plastic pack that would easily accomodate about 200 sheets origami paper.  There are only 25 sheets, however.  While I admit that this would allow the enthusiast to store additional sheets safely, I feel that the intent was more to impress the purchaser.  That always irritates me, irrational as that may seem.<br /><br />That said, however, I have to admit that there is very little to complain about.  25 sheets of origami paper might easily cost a dollar or two, depending upon variety, so the book, it's admittedly attractive packaging, and the paper are very reasonably priced.  Most of the designs are rework of those seen elsewhere, but the updates are attractive.  Even more attractive are the author's suggestions for use.  So often one finds very clever folding patterns with little apparent application.  I admit that to the purist, the challenge of the design is an end in itself, but I'm one of those practical types who needs to find a \\"use\\" for most crafts.  Ms Gross seems to have the same turn of mind, for she has presented a wide variety of suggestions.<br /><br />There is something here for almost everyone.  For the flower enthusiast, there are several floral arrangements, and several clever containers for them.  For the card maker, there are a number of very clever objects intended for cards, placecards and envelopes.  For the scrapbook crafter, there are a number of items that might well decorate your pages. For the purse maker, there is a lovely handbag, a little coinpurse, and a small book suitable for an address book.  For the book crafter, there is a design for a small book that might be made to any size desired. For those who like making their own ornaments, there are several items that would make delightful Christmas ornaments.  If you enjoy making clever toys and moveable objects there is a totally magnificent \\"slinky.\\"<br /><br />All in all a delightful little volume.Christmas ornaments.

Not by a long shot.  Even counting the endpapers, the book is only 168 pages in length.  Admittedly it's in 10 pt font size, but it's filled with photos--lovely ones--and there's no way you could write an encyclopedic work on origami in so limited a space.  There's just too much to say about it, and most of it would probably bore the average person to death.  One suspects that they've running out of unused descriptive titles for books on origami, and  \\"encyclopedia\\" had not been used yet.  For something a little closer to an encyclopedia--although even here it's moot--I'd look at Origami Omnibus or Origami for the Connoisseur, both by Kunihiko Kasahara--the latter book with Toshie Takahama.  These at least integrate something of the geometrics and mathematics of origami.<br /><br />The next negative.  The cover photos are magnificent.  It's what encouraged me to purchase the book in the first place.  There were so many incredible designs illustrated, and I'm always looking for something new, especially in natural looking animals and in masks.  Unfortunately, many of those illustrated on the cover are not described in the book other than in the \\"gallery\\" of works by masterfolders.  True, only the very experienced folder might be able to do some of these,and they will probably be able to figure them out from the photos, but it might be nice if some of us were given the option and the help to try.  In this category I'd place:  the lovely little squirrel by La Fosse, the moose by Lang, the magnificent elephant by Brill, the several toed frog by Land, the very lifelike dog by Yoshizawa, the delightful mouse character, incredible seahorse and the masterful masks by Joisel.  Especially for the latter artist, there really are no superlatives impressive enough to describe his work.  It has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />These issues aside, and I admit they are small ones from the perspective of the beginner, those things I did like were quite a few.  I liked the design for the fish.  It's one I hadn't seen yet.  The Baggi box and the triangular box, both of single pieces of paper, were also new to me.  I'm more accustomed to seeing the modular forms for boxes, like those of Fuse, the patterns for one of whose square boxes is also presented.  I liked the ten-point star for its impressiveness despite its utter simplicity.  I also liked the 5 pointed star, the open cube, the skeletal cube, and the bear model.  The CD case appealed to me because it had such obvious immediate and versatile uses.  The square dissection puzzle left me a little cold until I realized it would make a great frame for a photograph.<br /><br />As I say, the book has much to recommend it, but if you're looking for a reference work on origami, you'll be disappointed.r, those things I did like were quite a few.

I've had a copy of this since it came out in 1969, and it has some of my favorite models.  Years ago I made a mobile with the fish model and was pleased enough with the results to repeat it several times for friends.

The book is more of a journal of one man's quest to experience the realities of the Eastward quest of the early Americans during the last of the Ice Ages.  While I admit the book has many exciting moments that will appeal to those who enjoy risky adventures, I don't think those of us who hoped to learn more about the Joman culture and about it's possible peopling of the Americas.	2005-08-07

In fact they share many of the same faults-no pun intended.  As with The Big One, I don't quite know what to say about it.  For one thing it's difficult to pinpoint for whom the book  was written.<br /><br />The average adult with only the very meagerest background, if any, in geology and natural sciences might well enjoy the book.  Again like The Big One,  the title and the cover blurb are designed to attract such individuals.  If what you want is information about geology, you might be better served by spending the money on a general text on geology or earth history.  For those interested in the history of the US in the early 19th century, there are probably more tightly written books that would provide the same information without so many digressions.<br /><br />Jay Feldman, the author, is primarily a journalist.  He seems to have done a thorough job of research on earthquakes, on the history of New Madrid in particular, and the social and political history of the early 19th century.  Unlike Officer and Page's book which delves deeply into the basics of geology and tectonics to fill out the book, Feldman's tends to offer lengthy discussion about a variety of historical topics.  He discusses, among other things, the early history of New Madrid and the Louisiana purchase area, the iffy characters of some of the political figures in early US history, the American Indian Wars under the leadership of Techumseh, the build-up to the War of 1812, and the decline of some of Thomas Jefferson's more off-the-wall relatives.  The author juggles all of these topics somewhat haphazardly, and one tends to forget from time to time what the point of the book really is.  I had the distinct feeling, as I did with The Big One, that the author had only a slender amount to say about the earthquakes and padded the volume out with a chatty discussion of early U. S. history.<br /><br />Again as with The Big One,  I certainly can't imagine a professional geologist reading the book when most of the information contained in it can probably be found with more precision and detail in professional journals. As with the latter, I'd recommend the book to libraries that provide books on scientific topics for young people. For advanced students of middle/junior high or interested senior high, the book would be a splendid introduction to the topics of seismology and the geosciences.gain as with The Big One,  I certainly can't imagine a professional geologist reading the book when most of the information contained in it can probably be found with more precision and detail in professional journals.

Certainly it produces some magnificent results.  Some of the more ornate 90 and 180 degree cards are incredible works of paper architecture.  This little book, now--at least--in a kit, while it is vastly over-packaged (see my photos) is an excellant introduction to the art.  It requires only a pair of scissors, some type of origami suitable paper and patience to fold as directed--this last no greater than required to make oldfashioned snowflakes.  While some of the more advanced forms require very sharp cutting knives, metal edged rulers for perfect cuts, and the patience of a saint, ergo suitable for adults--because of the sharps, not the patience--the book by Hwang can be used by anyone.  As I said, the little 20 page pamphlet is packaged in a very large box, accompanied only by some sheets of standard origami paper, which makes it a little disappointing.  I admit this is unfair, since it is not terribly expensive, but one expects more from such a box.  Just remember, it's the chance to learn something new and to create your own ideas, and you'll overlook the initial disappointment.  A charming, although way too short book.	2005-08-07

That said, I have to admit that anyone who didn't purchase a copy of that volume at the time is indeed lucky to have the opportunity presented to them again in this book.<br /><br />Kasahara jumps the student right into some very elaborate models.  Most are purely delightful.  I am particularly impressed with the masks and plan on making some of them in large paper for wall decore for friends this Christmas.  Many of the designs are presented in other books on the subject, but Kasahara frequently goes one better or beyond.  The Persian cat is probably one of the nicest models of a cat I've found.<br /><br />One of the interesting things about this book is the author's marriage of origami to geometry and mathematics.  The book has some of the most comprehensive discussions on the relationships of three dimensional geometric objects to one another that I've ever seen in an origami book.  While I was more interested in the artist's rendering of new models and didn't get as deeply into the geometrics of the art, I have to admit, the discussions were very cogent and would be an asset to a math teacher.<br /><br />Probably the most magnificent of the book's presentations is one based precisely on the above topic.  The author presents an ingenious box which opens out successively into smaller boxes that create a huge tableux of fall, winter, summer and spring, complete with animals, trees, boats, mountains and houses.  How better to reveal the true volume of a cube than by this means!	2005-08-07
137808:US	50669529	R6O7W9A2CJW3J	0670882062	602368479	Origami: Inspired by Japanese Prints from the Metropolitan Museum ofArt	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Absolutely lovely	This is a beautiful book.  Although it is certainly designed with the beginner in mind, it has much for the collector, certainly a collector familiar with the Met's collections of oriental art--someting worth the trip to NYC just to see.<br /><br />For the beginner, there is the obligatory introduction to origami.  This includes a survey of the history of the artform, a description of the standard method of illustrating folds, and the basic folds themselves.  A brief overview of all the models in pictorial form is part of the table of contents, and it is easy to see that the beginning folder is well supplied with easy objects to try.  The first four of the 34 designs are dedicated to folded projects that even a preschool child might be able to perform, even memorize.  The first 11 would be easily folded by K to 3rd graders.<br /><br />Those models 12 to 34 might are a bit more challenging.  They certainly require a bit more grasp of three dimensional forms.  They would be a supurb method for introducing solid geometry to individuals who have difficulty thinking in terms of x-y-z directional planes.  Just familiarity with manipulating the designs might help develop that type of spacial thinking that can be difficult for some individuals to grasp when it's introduced in the cold, dry principles of textbook solid geometry.<br /><br />The most difficult design is probably the last in the book, the umbrella.  Although an experienced folder should have no difficulty, it is rather involved, and may pose a challenge for the novice.  It is, however, quite clever and well worth a try.  Done successfully once, it should be easy to repeat.  I think a perseverant 6th grader, especially one familiar with the art, would be more than capable of mastering it.<br /><br />Most of the designs are old standbys, like the cup, fan, kimonos, lantern, crane, and frog.  I've seen all of the more unusual ones, singly or in pairs, in other books.  This is a nice collection of some of the more unique models.  There is a lovely butterfly pattern, and probably one of most realistic goldfish I've seen so far.  (Frequently what's labeled \\"goldfish\\" looks more like some other fish entirely.)<br /><br />The real treat of the book, for me at least, was the lovely watercolors and woodblock prints by some of the Japanese masters.  Kitagawa Utumaro's (1753-1805)wood print of two noble ladies is lovely, and his Lion Dance captures the joyfulness of a new year's celebration.  Of course the wonderful artwork of Utagawa Hiroshige (1797-1858), with its color and its activity, captures the essence of life during his era with a brevity of line that is almost modern.  The descriptions of these pictures and the addition of origami that helps capture Japanese culture for the folder is also enlightening.

I realize that many will find it less joyful than the earlier books in the collection.  Viewed from the perspective of an adult,  it doesn't seem like a \\"children's\\" book ought to be.  What a child thinks on the matter, however, will probably be quite different.<br /><br />Whatever the case, I thought  it quite good.  It's definitely much less for or about  younger children than the earlier ones.  You might almost say that the collection  are a set of \\"to grow up with books,\\" each to be read at a different stage of a child's life.  They certainly seem to progress in sophistication with respect to the vocabulary, sentence structure, and content from one book to the next.<br /><br /> It's amazing really.  I can't decide if the author's style is simply maturing, or if she actually intends the progression.  It seems to me as though she's writing the books for a specific child or group of children , tailoring each to the concerns of a stage of life defined generally by a year of matriculation.  \\"Sort of a guidebook to growing up.\\"<br /><br />Anyone who has lived with a growing child knows how much they change during a school year.  That toddler concerned with keeping siblings out of \\"his or her\\" things is suddenly going to school and facing new challenges.  The next thing you know they're getting married and you're a grandparent-like when did that happen? They soak up information so quickly  that it would put an IBM computer to shame, and their problems are ones that no computer yet built could work out appropriately.  Trying to help them navigate the shoals is a major task for any parent, and it's always nice to find books that help them help their youngsters in an entertaining and attention getting way.<br /><br />The most recent Harry deals with a wide variety of teen problems.  It delves into the moodiness of friends, boy-girl relationships, sibling relationships, \\"finding\\" someone, trying not to be \\"different\\" or learning to deal with being so,  trying not to be seen as still a \\"kid\\" when everyone else is trying to be \\"grown up,\\" having your best friend \\"fall\\" for your sister-of all things-or worrying about falling for your best friend's sister and possibly ruining a long friendship, how friendships change during adolescence as adult roles are assumed, the fact that they will change whether you like it or not, the fact that the world is a hard place that gives little quarter to anyone even the young, that beloved role models can be wrong, that they can die.  Well, you get the drift.  In short, it may be full of magic and mystery, but it's still about \\"growing up.\\"<br /><br />The book also takes  parents pretty much out of the picture, which I think is the way it really is for teens.  We don't all go to a private school; we certainly aren't all learning the art and lifestyle of a witch or wizard, but we're more subject to  our peers and what they think and expect, and to our teachers control and influence.

It takes the reader from the most simple instructions to the more elaborate designs within a slim 66 pages of brightly colored and very clear photos.  The folds are never in doubt, as they can be in books that depend more heavily on line drawings and simple sketches alone.  Considering its very reasonable price, it's a steal.  The models cover a wide range of objects:  flowers, fish, birds, animals, furniture, architecture, boxes, and ornaments.<br /><br />For the beginner--or even for the individual with more randomly acquired expertise--the book is ideally arranged in a logical succession of the \\"bases.\\"  Sakata begins with instructions for folding the base itself then progresses in a very logical manner, showing what objects can be folded from the base.  Not only does this help the beginner learn from a strong foundation, it allows the advanced student who learned in a less organized fashion--like myself--to see just how all the objects they learned to fold are related.  Although I have books that have said,  \\"this is the bird base,\\"  or whatever, I have not seen one as carefully arrnaged to visually show how the models evolved from a common design.  For the advanced student this careful organizational chart might actually assist in creating models of your own, since it permits you to see just how the manipulation of a single line, fold or pocket, can produced amazingly different results.<br /><br />For the advanced student \\"Origami\\" has very little new except organization.  For a beginner, however, this is probably THE most solid foundation on which to learn the art that I have ever come across.	2005-07-31

Earthquakes, volcanoes and tsunamis, all of which are interrelated phenomena, are particularly intriguing as they so often impact human society where ever they occur.  Probably one of the most poetic and stirring artifacts of this very fact are the ancient footprints of two of what are believed by some to be our prehistoric ancestors, preserved in the ash of a volcanic eruption at Leotoli inTanzania, Africa.<br /><br />De Boer and Sanders' book, Earthquakes in Human History goes a long way to pulling together the geology and sociology of various seismic events through recorded time. Without a doubt the frailty and vulnerability of the human being is graphically demonstrated in the face of these catastrophic events.<br /><br />The authors begin by examining ancient literature for evidence of earthquakes and earthquake damage in human terms.  They look to the authors of the Biblical narrative for evidence of seismic activity in the Levant, and it's effects on the course of history there.  Although many of the stories they analyze are very likely to have seismic components irrespective of their ultimate cause, I think that some might well be attributable to volcanic explosions as well.  Although not familiar with the geologic activity in the area beyond its part in the rifting activity in the Afar triangle in Africa, I believe that volcanoes are customarily associated with such rifts.  Certainly they are in the mid-Atlantic system of which Iceland is a part and in the Rift Valley in Africa itself.  Although the Levant/Dead Sea portion is considered a \\"failed\\" arm of the rifting system, it might still partake of volcanism.  Whatever the cause, the geologic activity in the Levant had a major journalistic impact on the narrators that witnessed them, and on the redactors that structured the Bible as we know it today.<br /><br />DeBoer and Sanders also discuss the various earthquakes and geological phenomena in the Greek world of the pre-classical and classical authors.  Both the Trojan epics and the historic narratives of Herodotus and others are examined for the effects of geology on mankind and the course of history.  Although they discuss several episodes, they missed my favorite, the massive tsunami that swept away a sizeable portion of the Persian land army when it was about to attack a coastal city-Potidea, as I recall.  Seeing that the city was fortified everywhere but on the seaward side from which the sea was rapidly receding, the general determined to attack the city for that side.  No sooner did he embark on the attack than a massive wave swept them all away.<br /><br />The authors discuss modern era quakes in England, the southeastern colonial US-an area most of us would consider tectonically quiescent-San Francisico-everyone's favorite earthquake story--Peru, Chili, Nicaragua, and Japan.  All these stories are placed into retrospective history with a discussion of the social and political events of the times, and how the earthquake derailed things one way or another.  My guess is that most of the changes would have occurred anyway, they were just hurried along by the unexpected intercession of mother nature.<br /><br />I was disappointed in that nothing was mentioned of China, whose quakes can be formidable and have caused some greater devestation by virtue of the fact that China achieved a denser population at an earlier stage of its historical career.  It is also interesting, because a quake prediction that turned out correct, saved thousands, if not millions from death.  Oh well, another book, perhaps.<br /><br />The volume discusses the geologic aspects of each of these quakes as they are presented.  I found it particularly interesting that some of the epicenters for very serious quakes, like that which occasioned  the destruction of  Lisbonand of San Francisco were actually located out at sea and far under ground.  These of course also included tsunamis which sort of \\"topped\\" everything off and produced more widespread devastation.

Lloyd Wright's hotel in Tokyo was a brilliant case in point.  The fact that most of the civil supports such as water, electricity, power, communication, emergency care and effective fire control can all be hampered or even prevented is of great concern, as most of the cities that have been hit in the past with such catastrophic effect, are still where they were and are now much more densely settled.  The authors point out that many schools, hospitals and even nuclear plants have been built on the San Andreas Fault, despite the fact of the quake of 1906, and the very strong likelihood that it will rift again with a magnitude like that of 1906 or higher.  It will certainly cause more damage.<br /><br />This is a very interesting book.  It is accessible to anyone who can read at grade 5 or above.  Since the world seems to be sustaining a fair number of earthquakes recently in heavily populated areas with little or no quakeproofed buildings, it seems appropriate that the population of the world recognize the danger of unpreparedness and of disinterest.  Furthermore, just because it doesn't occur in your own back yard, doesn't mean it doesn't have some kind of impact on you, as the authors occasionally point out.ction of  Lisbon and of San Francisco were actually located out at sea and far under ground.

I've enjoyed origami since I first folded a paper fox in kindergarten in Honolulu.  Since then I have learned a number of designs and am always on the look-out for new ones.<br /><br />Ms Gross' book is a beautifully illustrated volume of designs, both old and new, with many novel ways of using them.  In fact, I'd say that the information on uses makes the price of the book more than worth it.  The ideas for paper folded jewelry were especially interesting to me as was the information on preserving such articles from damage as might arise in wearing them.<br /><br />Since I am particularly fond of boxes, I enjoyed the photo fame, useful purses, and the card cases, especially.  The boxes she presents are the standard design from a single piece of paper.  If found her technique of folding them a little awkward, however, so if you have problems with folding one, I'd check one of the other books for a box with a different folding method.  It's in the order of the folds, not in the box itself that the problem arises.<br /><br />Her method of folding the paper bowl, however is very clear.  I've seen the bowl done in other books that make it far too confusing to follow the folds.  These books have several lovely designs, however, so it may be that having folded Ms Gross's version of the bowl, one might find the others' designs easier to understand.  The more exposure one has to different methods, the easier all origami becomes.<br /><br />Since I am starting an origami project for my 5 year old nephew, Drake, I found the introductory designs for what amounts to paper dolls particularly useful, and I plan to incorporate them into it.<br /><br />Overall, a lovely book with lots of useful information and patterns.	2005-07-22

It is especially nice in actual use because, while it has a hard bound cover, it has a spiral binding inside which opens the volume out flat for viewing.  I also appreciated the photo index of stitches in the front.  It permits the user to compare several similar patterns at once.  The index arranges selections in sections listed as \\"knit and purl,\\" \\"ribbing,\\" \\"cable,\\" \\"bobbles,\\" \\"lace,\\" \\"fair isle,\\" and \\"intarsia.\\"<br /><br />The system of presenting the pattern instructions was a little confusing at first.  I am more accustomed to the old system of \\"knit 2, purl 2\\" etc.  The book presents the pattern in graphic form.  You see the pattern as it would appear from the front, but the knit and purl designations change their character every row.  Essentially while a dot may represent a purl in one row, it may represent a knit in the row above it. This confused me for a while.  After using the system for a pattern, though, I started to make sense of it.<br /><br />The methods of illustrating vairous techniques--knit three in the same stitch, for instance--required a frequent referral to the key until I could remember it, but this is no different from the pattern key that is often included in many common sweater patterns.<br /><br />The illustrations featuring the sample knitting are lovely--I should knit that evenly!--and delightful just to look at on their own.  The fair isle and intarsia patterns were especially lovely.  My favorites were the \\"Interlocking Swirls\\" on p. 207, the \\"Inca Stitch\\" on p. 201, and the \\"Snowflake\\" on p. 203.<br /><br />A nice little book	2005-07-20

The most important thing I learned from this book is that I'm not ready for this book!  I inherited my mother's table loom some time ago and have not had time to look into weaving until recently.  To get myself started, I purchased a number of books on weaving so that I could build up to tackling her loom.  I found both \\"Weaving Without a Loom\\" and \\"You Can Weave\\" very helpful for a beginner.  They taught simple terminology, basic weaves, the use of a variety of materials not only for weaving but for looms, and the use of patterns.  Chandler and Redding's book, \\"Learning to Weave,\\" looks to be an excellent resource for weaving on my table loom, but just perusing it's pages, I realized that I still need to work a little with the simpler looms before getting on to the main task.  In reading the book, I found the notion of samples a fine idea.  I started making them with some of the simpler looms, and have even found a use for some of the samples I've made.  The suggestion regarding practice color combinations was also helpful.  In looking forward to the daunting task of warping or dressing my table loom, I suspect that the authors' suggestions with respect to managing the warp threads and the alternative suggestions with respect to approaching the physical task itself will make my first experience much less frustrating.  But first we have to build up the courage!	2005-06-08

Although not a professor of history,  Linda Simon is associate professor of English at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York, and it shows.  The book is well researched and very informative, but more importantly, it's very readable.<br /><br />I have to admit it took me a while to figure where we were going in the enterprise.  At first the book seems like a biography of Edison.  This would hardly be surprising given the subtitle of the book:  Electricity and Anxiety from the Telegraph to the Xray.  Edison is almost Mr. Electronics himself.  The Wizard of Menlo Park, as he was known at the time, was responsible for major improvements in telegraphy, electric lighting, and phonographic sound, among other things.<br /><br />The author's jump to Beard, one of Edison's brief partners, lost me a little.  This was mostly because I had never heard of the fellow.  Reading on in Simon's book, however, was very enlightening.  Apparently Beard had been instrumental in expanding US medical practice into the emotional sphere.  Rather less famous than the European experiment with it in Freud's work, Beard never the less brought the effects of stress in modern life into public focus with his articles and his own work in physiological cures with the use of electricity.  I had no idea the extensive use to which 19th century medicine had put what it referred to as \\"electrotherapy\\" in treating anxiety and depression.  Most of us know about electroshock therapy in this context, but Beard worked with electric \\"baths.\\"  Simon's discussion of the man's financial interests in this therapy make it sound like the man practiced nothing less than charlatanry, but as many workers in the health care profession know, part of the treatment of any condition involves the patient's own belief in its effectiveness.  Furthermore, recent treatments for depression and anxiety have in fact turned to electroshock by \\"pacemaker\\" type electrodes placed into selected nerves.  Even obesity might one day be treated in this fashion.  Makes Beard seem positively psychic.<br /><br />Speaking of which, the book also delves into the public interest in spiritualism at the time.  The subject is never without its proponents in any age, but apparently the 19th century was particularly concerned with the topic.  Simon notices the connection between the loss of so many family members by much of society during the Civil War and the introduction of new technologies based on unseen \\"forces\\" and \\"fields.\\"  Placing the two in juxtaposition certainly makes the interest seem much more rational than it might.  It also explains why figures famous for their scientific contributions or for their scientific training might become involved in the movement in some way.  Alfred Russell Wallace, the naturalist who with Darwin was co-discoverer of the theory of evolution, was one such as was Arthur Conan Doyle, the author of Sherlock Holmes, who was trained in medicine.  Elisha Kent Kane, an arctic explorer and doctor, was involved with Margaret Fox, one of the women who started the movement in this country.<br /><br />All in all Professor Simon's book is very intriguing and well worth reading.  It inspires the reader to look for other books on the 19th century and its culture.  What more can one ask from a book?cted nerves.  Even obesity might one day be treated in this fashion.

This is a lovely book, filled to the last page with wonderful ideas.  I was lucky enough to have inherited my mother's table loom and am just now beginning to do a little background research on weaving before tackling the rather daunting equipment my mother left me.  I found this title among those I was browsing and decided that it would be a good place to start.  There are several techniques which are mentioned also in Weaving Without a Loom, another book I would recommend for beginners, but Monahoghan and Joyner's book goes several steps farther.  Burningham introduces paper weaving, but these authors show visual techniques, similar to Escher's style of tricking the eye, introduce modifying frames, interwoven photos, and basket making to their repertoire.  They show stick weaving, but introduce the use of straws to make the process smoother and color changes to add interest to the bands.<br /><br />I was particularly impressed with the depth with which they showed techniques, particularly in tapestry work with colors added to create pictures.  The Japanese braid work was also interesting as was some of their beading information.  I particularly enjoyed the brief discussion of plaid and undertook the weaving of a small square which I used to make a passport bag for a friend going to London this summer.	2005-05-30

The author provides a readable background of the political and social environment of the time.  He describes the preliminaries to the Battle of Culloden and its aftermath and the freedom that removal of the twin threats of the return of the conservative Stuarts and the violence of the highland clans had on economy and creative thought at the time.<br /><br />This unique place and time brought together a small group of creative geniuses that turned the face of the world totally around.  These were the intellectuals who were the ultimate founders of the industrial revolution and of much of modern science.  Black, Clerk-Maxwell, Watt, Hutton, and others shared a camaraderie rare among individuals one normally pictures as jealous of their intellectual property and prestige.  The mutual support, close friendship, and collaborative efforts were phenomenal and very productive.<br /><br />It was primarily because of this mutual respect that Hutton's contributions to science, especially geology, are still remembered at all.  Using diaries, letters, biographies, and scientific papers, the author manages to present the portrait of a man of congenial temperament, insatiable curiosity and patience.  While many of the founders of the neophyte science were losing their way trying to make their observations and theories fit, not only the Biblical narrative of Genesis, but the chronological machinations of generations of Biblical scholars all trying to place the events of creation on a time frame, Hutton remained free of preconceived notions.  A naturalist from childhood and a farmer by choice, he made careful observations throughout Scotland, Ireland, England, France and Italy, gathering data for his theory of the earth.  His observations of soil errosion and of rocks in their natural setting--rather than as depicted or described by others as was the custom--laid the groundwork for his claim for the great antiquity of the earth.  Several of the skeptics in his circle were converted to his thesis when the evidence of the earth's own strata were presented to and interpreted for them on field trips.<br /><br />Not everyone, however, was willing to admit defeat.  Many opponents, unwilling to concede that the Biblical narrative of the creation of the earth was not literally true, continued to find fault with Hutton and his data.  After his death and those of several of his supporters, the anti-Huttonian faction almost literally buried his work.  Living beyond him, and having the ear of the young scientists of the time, they were able to bring ridicule and obfuscation to the effort.  Only with the rise of another young scientist, Charles Lyell, whose book Principles of Geology became the definitive book on the topic, did Hutton finally receive credit and general recognition for his remarkable observations.<br /><br />A nice little book on an often neglected subject.d or described by others as was the custom--laid the groundwork for his claim for the great antiquity of the earth.

The Age of Stonehenge was originally written in 1980.  Colin Burgess subsequently left the field of the early prehistory of the British Isles for work in the Mediterranean on the Phoenicians and the Sea Peoples.  The book has subsequently seen new editions in 2001 and 2003, which suggests that the material is both well presented and well researched.  If it is any indication of his thoroughness one can only regret his early departure from English pre-history and his early retirement from the academic world in general.<br /><br />While I found the first few chapters a little difficult to get through because they deal primarily with pottery styles, I enjoyed the book as a whole.  It filled in a great deal of information with respect to the culture of the age of Stonehenge, and corrected several misapprehensions I had acquired from other reading.  Most importantly, it presents a fine overview of modern archaeology as applied to a period that many people think they already know!<br /><br />I was particularly impressed with the introduction of more recent information on the character of early settlement and subsequent culture change.  Early books on the topic accredit population movements, invasions, and total replacement of one culture by another.  Having taken some archaeology classes on European archaeology within the past 5 years, I had become aware of professional doubts on this topic.  The tendency of past researchers to think in terms of nations, ethnic groups, etc., probably because we live with these social structures today, had produced a map covered with tribal names and arrows of migration that is now being discredited.  As the author notes, it is more likely that culture and populations remained stable for centuries, in contact and exchanging cultural variables among them along shared borders.  The archaeology of the British Isles bears little credence to anything like massive invasions.  He does note the movements in the period of the Sea Peoples in the Mediterranean and suggests that during this time considerable movement of people may well have occurred in the British Isles as they did elsewhere.<br /><br />What surprised me particularly was the degree of organization of property and control over land and people.  One has the impression of &aacute; relatively open society with everyone living much the same as everyone else and of mass efforts to erect major monuments for which the group felt the need.  It is abundantly apparent that the building of Stonehenge and other major works required a large labor force, but one does not necessarily carry that idea forward to the conclusions that naturally would arise from shear numbers.  What kind of life did these people live?  How were they organized on a day to day basis?  Was there a cooperative effort across geo-political borders? Etc.  The author answers many of these questions.<br /><br />Among the specific data Burgess provides, I was most surprised by the apparent lack of artistic sense among craftsmen of the day-he noted that most of the artifacts found are very functional with little or no decoration.  That pragmatism seems counter intuitive, since evolutionary studies seems to base the very concept of \\"modern\\" man on artistic criteria like the cave paintings of Spain and France, the Venus figurines and other artistic products:  the difference between \\"modern humans\\" and \\"anatomically modern humans.\\"  I was also surprised by the apparent lack of a weaving/spinning tradition in the Isles until the 1st millennium.

The first few chapters are actually dedicated to a brief overview of early Chinese political history.  It discusses the ethnic mix of the country, the rise of a centralized state, the struggle among early dynasts for control of power, and ultimately the central characters involved in overseas exploration.<br /><br />Unlike Menzies' 1421 A. D., Levathes' book focuses on China's rapport with countries closer at hand, concentrating on routes between China and SE Asia, India, and Africa.  There is no attempt to integrate archaeological finds throughout the world with what is known of Chinese exploration activities, which leaves the author on much firmer ground from a historical standpoint.  For most of her documentation she relies on government records, family histories, historical romances, and poetry, and these are outlined and discussed in some detail in the notes to the chapters.  Although she speculates about early contact with North and South America, she does not make this the central focus of the book.  In fact her primary theme seems to be the social and political causes of the sudden interest in the outside world and its equally sudden reversal.<br /><br />While Menzies' book is more intriguing and examines the Chinese experiment with overseas exploration from the standpoint of a seaman and navigator, Levathes approaches it as a historian.  1421 A. D. gives one a sense of the wonder of exploration and its possibilities; When China Ruled the Seas makes sense of both its occurrence and its cessation.  I'd recommend reading both.	2005-05-18

Essentially it brings together under specific headings much of what has been learned by various mind/brain researchers through fMRI and PET scan studies, and does it in a very readable and understandable form.  A neurologist and neuropsychiatrist  at George Washington University Medical Center in Washington D. C., Restak  has published 18 or more books on the topic of mind science, putting it into public formats like books and popular television programs.<br /><br />Among the more interesting topics, I found that on the plasticity of the brain the most significant.  I started out my career in nursing on a neurology ward, and at the time it was almost a given that damage to the central nervous system was irreparable and deficits that arose from it irreversible.  The goal for most of the patients with strokes from occlusion or cerebral bleed was rehabilitation of the functional side of the body and learning to deal with whatever communication problems remained.  It was often repeated that whatever deficits had not resolved after the subsidence of cerebral edema would be permanent.  The new research indicates that this is not only not true, but that focusing on strengthening the \\"good\\" side actually prevented the \\"bad\\" side from healing properly.  The marvelous sense of hope that the new data provide is incredible.  As those familiar with the efforts of Christopher Reeves to overcome the deficits with which he was left by his accident will know, exercising the weaker portions of the body to the extent they are able with the help of others and of mechanical and electrical stimulation seems to show considerable hope for rewiring the damaged nervous system.<br /><br />The information on attention deficit and technologically driven changes in the wiring of the brain and function of the mind were also interesting.  To the extent that it predicts the direction of the human nervous system and behavior, I'm not certain that technology is such a good thing after all, but then I'm not going to be around when life has changed to the degree that such predictions indicate will be the case.  I found it intriguing that the biofeedback we receive from our own technology has as much an effect on us as we on it.  Certainly, familiar as I am with the notion of early human evolution and tool use/production, I should have found this natural outgrowth unsurprising.  Somehow, though, such things \\"should\\" be something of the \\"past\\" rather than the \\"now.\\"  After all, we feel we are the \\"finished\\" product of human evolution.  Just how untrue this is, is very obvious when you read this chapter (3) of Restak's book.<br /><br />Being a part of the health care world, I found the chapter on Cosmetic Psychopharmacology eye opening.  Of course when one considers the emotional pain and crippling character of depression one sees the pharmacological interventions as mostly to be desired.  With Restak's discussion of the extreme of designer personalities and of simply not feeling or being anything, one can see that use of these chemicals to alter brain chemistry is perhaps not the best plan over all.  The problem is, where to we draw the line, who draws it, and for whom do we set these limits and why?

For those of you who haven't studied biology for over 20 or 30 years, it will come as something as  a surprise how greatly the \\"lower\\" levels of life's tree have changed since you went to high school.<br /><br />Most of those interested in paleontology are aware of the conundrum posed by the apparent lack of evidence for the early stages of life's development.  The pre-Cambrian was literally a blank slate for most of the decades since Darwin first suggested that soft bodied forms probably preceded the fossilized life forms we find in the geological record.  Most of you will also be familiar with Stanley Miller's research which produced molecules similar to those expected of pre-life in his famous flask experiment.  With this and the growing information arising from DNA studies and with the discovery of halophiles and thermophiles in out of the way places, even more has been detailed.  The relationships of various extant and extinct life forms has been clarified to a far greater extent.  A revamping of the earlier Linean tree of relationships and a clearer surmise as to the stages through which first pre-life and then prokarytoes passed on their way to eukaryotic forms is also much clearer.  The author gives a very lucid explanation of the chemistry of life with respect to the earth's early atmosphere and ocean chemistry.<br /><br />Although some of the information is a rehash of material, the author has had the advantage of working in regions where early life forms were probably first developing and in regions that had been off limits to western researchers in the past.

My mother was a remarkable artist and craftswoman, who taught herself how to spin and weave.  I often wish I'd taken the time to sit with her and watch so that I might have learned, too, but as usual with adult children, I was too busy with my own life to do that.  Since inheriting my mother's spinning wheel and table loom, however, I'm inspired to learn more.  I decided to start with a survey of weaving techniques, and this book, Weaving without a Loom, by Veronica Burningham, seemed like a good place to start.<br /><br />I have to admit, it covers a little of everything and does so in a logical, practical style.  Right from the beginning, the author has the reader working with paper weaving to familiarize with terms, procedures and end products.  As many of you may recall from kindergarten and early grade school, paper weaving produced those placemats and baskets one made for Mother's Day and other similar holidays in \\"art\\" class.  Beyond this, the reader also learns about  \\"tabby\\" and  \\"twill\\" weaving patterns and what happens with colors.  In examining the book a little further, one also learns that the paper with the slots in it is a \\"warp,\\" while the strips of paper (or ribbon) woven through it is a \\"weft.\\"  Technical terminology can't get much simpler.<br /><br />After this initial exposure to weaving on its most basic level, the author introduces a variety of techniques, requiring nothing more expensive than sticks, paper forms, embroidery hoops, dinner forks, and picture frames.  At each stage, the reader gets closer to weaving on a formal loom and the principles of \\"sheds\\" \\"heddles\\" and beaters.  The products that the beginner is able to complete are remarkable for their individuality and beauty.  The tam made on a piece of cardstock, and the carrying bag made on similar material are truly lovely and should lend themselves to individual experiments, even at the beginner level.  While little hands may need some help with making weaving equipment, most of the woven work should be very easy for them to manage and should produce pleasing results.  Although at times the instructions are a little confusing, the color photos show clearly what the author is trying to teach, so that anyone can enjoy the craft.  Learning some of the terminology and techniques at this basic level should help the more adventurous move to more complicated forms of weaving like inkle and table or floor loom work.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to any school system, school or public library or children's room.  The museum in the city where I live has a family room where children can work with some of the media that artists do.  This would be a wonderful addition for such a room in any museum.  It also minimizes the need for expensive equipment to teach the art.  The author and publisher give express permission to reproduce designs for individual use and for charity purposes, so copyright is not an issue.of the woven work should be very easy for them to manage and should produce pleasing results.

The author, who is a historian of Victorian period England, is also a journalist with publications in popular magazines, which promises a readable text. While the book's  graphic eye catching title definitely lives up to its promise, the story has more to do with the outcome of social and political inequity and with conflicting cultural mores.<br /><br />Popular and legal culture at once acknowledged that medical practitioners required cadavers for research and training while at the same time making it almost impossible to fulfil the demand without breaking the law.  The simple economics of supply and demand almost guaranteed that at least some of those living on the margins of starvation would undertake considerable risks to supply the body trade.  They would do so with stolen corpses when available but if incentive were great enough, with the murdered wretched, lonely and unclaimed of their own class when they weren't.  In studying just the one episode in London's body trade, the author is able to point out the interaction of simple supply and demand, the dehumanization of lower classes, and the desperation that went into creating the event.<br /><br />The author goes to considerable efforts to describe the London of the time.  There are a number of photographs of the buildings of old London taken just before their demolition in the next century.  There are also newspaper illustrations of the buildings and individuals at the time of the proceedings to help the reader envision the ambiance of the drama.  The character, background, and interrelationships of the various individuals involved are also described in some detail.<br /><br />Williams, for one, had already acquired a record and prison time prior to the events of the Italian boy.  He had learned a trade while incarcerated, but in order to practice it he needed a license which he could not afford.  Progress in penal philosophy afforded him an education which he would not have had, but it did not also afford him the license he needed to actually carry on the profession he had been taught.  When he was caught practicing without a license, instead of making arrangements by which he could pay for the license over time when he was able, the tools by which he might have made a living were confiscated.  In short, he was in a no win situation, and society with the best of intentions had shot itself once again in the foot.<br /><br />Given the social conditions of the time and  the failure of Parliament to accord the working class a voice in government--as it did in this very time period--Williams and the other disenfranchised like him had very few choices other than breaking the law in some way.  The trade in the dead was so lucrative that a man with little or no education, who was willing to risk reputation and health, if not life itself, to resort to body snatching could make, with one theft, the same as a year's wages for the average factory worker. With several a year, he could earn the same as one of the better paid servants or trades people.  In short, one could for all intents and purposes go from poverty to the lower middle class by the simple means of disposing of the dead to medical schools.  That the three resurrectionists did not achieve that ultimate social transition probably had to do to some extent with their rampant alcoholism.<br /><br />The book is exceptional. If nothing else, The Italian Boy proves that society reaps what it sows.  If people are not given the means to be productive in socially acceptable ways, they will survive and flourish in other ways.  If they are not given a voice and some legal power in the state of which they form the bulk of the population, then they will have no stake in supporting laws that disenfrancise and victimize them.  The same can be said formodern society.e can be said for modern society.   <br />     <br />	2005-05-03

In this critique of 18th century morals and values, Austin attacks society's sacrifice of depth of feeling and honesty to hedonism and personal gain.  In short, anything is acceptable providing the neighbors don't find out.  Despite this, the story moves more slowly than the others and is less a joyful look at society's foibles.<br /><br />Austin has gone to considerable effort to illustrate that over indulgence, lack of responsibility, and a sense of entitlement can ruin a young person's life.  While each of her sponsor's children have been given a superior education and introduced into a society that values wealth, beauty and rank to exclusion of all else, Fanny herself has learned the value of devotion, honesty, and service to others.  It is only with the disastrous behavior of her cousins that the Bertrum family learns how \\"poor\\" they are compared to their young ward.<br /><br />Far more central to the story are the characters of Mary Crawford and her brother, Henry.  Their talents and social abilities encapsulate the essence of what was considered \\"desireable\\" among the upper classes of the 18th century.  Musically inclined, able to carry on a witty conversation, eager to engage in romantic games, mindless of repercussions, they involve themselves in the lives of the Bertrams and their ward, ruining Maria's marriage, almost ruining Edmund's happiness and career, and bringing Tom to physical collapse.  To all of this Fanny's character is the antithesis.  She steadfastly refuses Henry's advances, is not taken in by his clever sister Mary, and grieves over Edmund's ultimate loss of innocence.<br /><br />To some extent, Fanny is a \\"Cinderella\\" figure.  She has even been assigned to an attic room.  Aunt Norris, constantly reminding the girl how lucky she has been to be given the advantages she has been by the Bertrums, also reminds her that she must remember she must always be the last and the least.  Although cousin Edmund is a somewhat dull prince charming, he shares much in common with Fanny, and one can well believe they will live happily-ever-after, once all the hurtles between them have been leaped.  And as always, the \\"bad guys\\" get their cumupence.<br /><br />The book has a lot to say for itself, and despite it's almost 200 years, it has a lot to say to us.he advantages she has been by the Bertrums, also reminds her that she must remember she must always be the last and the least.

I've done most of the fad diets, diet clinics, and diet groups. I've read diet books and health magazines and reports in popular science magazines.  As the author, Dr. Walter C. Willett, points out in his introductory chapter pf Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy, most health information is a confused, contradictory mess which almost seems \\"like reading pages torn at random from a book (p. 27).\\"  The first thing that comes to mind is, \\"Then why should I believe you?  Aren't you just adding to the confusion with another book?\\"  The answer is no.<br /><br />While there's very little about healthy eating in this book that your mother hasn't told you a million times already--avoid sweets and starches, avoid greasy foods, eat your vegetables, get some exercise, take your vitamens--what is new is that the author covers nutrition and health issues as a whole and underscores his information and suggestions with sound research.  Almost every fad is covered, every disease issue discussed, and each class of nutrients gone over carefully, all with reference to scientific research.  The Nurses Health Study (of which I was a part), The Physician's Health Study, The Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, and the Iowa Women's Health Study are all sizeable, fairly long term research projects conducted on nutrition and disease.<br /><br />Doctor Willett makes more evident, something that most of us don't really know, namely that the US Department of Agriculture, which created the food pyramid that most of us first learned about in health class as kids and which everyone sees on cereal boxes and other places, is not a disinterested research group.  It is dedicated to supporting the agricultural segment of our society.  The Harvard study group, which contributed to the book and some of the research underlying it, has no hidden agendas other than the promotion of health.  While he does not take issue with the efforts of the institution to achieve some standard approach to nutrition, the author notes that the USDA pyramid was devised when little or no research on nutrition and health had yet been conducted.  He would therefore redefine the pyramid, taking recent research into account.  Toward this goal, he discusses some of the misunderstanding, misinformation, and attempts to help us lose weight with \\"artificial food' and replaces these with more current information and helpful suggestions.<br /><br />There are a number of very surprising things that the doctor introduces in the book, including the calcium \\"problem,\\" the \\"good fat/bad fat\\" problem, and the newer information on vegetables verses supplements.<br /><br />This book is filled with important information that every person interested in living a long, healthy and active life should have.  It would make an excellent course text for high school health classes, for home economics courses, and for nursing education courses on nutrition.le he does not take issue with the efforts of the institution to achieve some standard approach to nutrition, the author notes that the USDA pyramid was devised when little or no research on nutrition and health had yet been conducted.

284126:US	50669529	R2IW1GGBAP0V01	0670033375	635086986	Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Fantastic!	Jarred Diamond's name on a book is a certain guarantee of quality work.  Guns, Germs and Steel was among the most complete analyses of why history worked out as it did between the \\"old\\" world and the \\"new\\" that I've ever read.  Almost every aspect of their differences was examined, providing an extremely creditable recitation of what happened and why, and even a degree of predictive value.  I was so much taken by the book, that when I found Collapse:  How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, I bought it immediately.  I was not disappointed; here again Professor Diamond has looked at critical events in the past and proved them of more than passing importance to modern society.<br /><br />Although a little difficult to get into-mainly because the first chapter has to do with modern and current history in which I am less interested-the book is again a very decisive description of the perils inherent in human use and misunderstanding of the environment.  The first chapter makes it evident that through past choices and lifestyle traditions in Montana, modern society there is confronted by environmentally unfortunate outcomes, which have made change and consensus urgent.  Both maintenance of a human compatible environment as well as of the beauty of the state itself are at risk because of industries that have historically been welcome in the state and a source of pride.  Furthermore, the conservative and independent character of the culture has made governmental involvement with regulation of these industries unwelcome until recently.<br /><br />To clarify issues facing Montana and modern society in general, the author discusses several ancient and recent societies, selecting from throughout the world for his prototypes, and notes the response to environment, to change in that environment, and the resulting success or failure of each instance.  He notes in particular the eight to twelve environmental and cultural issues that determine outcomes.  Among those included are the character of the soil, the sustainability of it's fertility, the climate changes after initial settlement, the rigidity of cultural identification with a select suite of behaviors and beliefs, the number of vested interests in society, the presence, size, and management of forests, the \\"top-down\\" verses \\"bottom-up\\" management of problems in society, etc.<br /><br />The author notes that no given society is destined to fail but does or does not do so by virtue of the choices it makes.  He points out, too, that it is not always obvious to those making decisions at the time that they have set their society on the path to extinction.  Even when it is obvious, the problem of short-term gains as opposed to long-term losses is not a new one just involving modern CEOs but has been around for a long time.  In looking at the latter, Diamond makes it evident that the degree to which the decision maker is invested in a long-term, environmentally sound outcome often makes the difference between the collapse and sustainability of the society.  Especially when such a decision maker is able to achieve a positive personal gain and to avoid the unpleasant consequences of his actions, he is most likely to undertake a course with disastrous results to the environment and to anyone living in it.<br /><br />On the flip side, it is interesting too that where society is itself insulated from the negative economic effects confronting an industry, they often bring about negative decisions and the outcomes they least desire.  This is illustrated with the author's discussion of the economic realities of the mining industry in Montana, where costs often exceed profits by an enormous margin if environmental clean up is added to their expenses without being passed on to the consumer.  The virtual invisibility of the products of mining, because of the number of middlemen involved and the ubiquity but often hidden nature of resulting manufactured goods, removes the sense of urgency that would make the consumer willing to pay more for what is bought.  Unlike, say, gasoline which everyone knows they require to run their cars to get to work every day, the parts of that same car owed to the copper industry are less evident, though no less vital.<br /><br />The actual type-sites are of immense interest.  I was amazed at what has been discovered of the early settlement of the Pacific Islands, especially that of Easter Island.  Having read Kon Tiki as a girl, I find Easter Island's pre-history quite fascinating and was surprised at how much information has been gleaned from recent archaeological work there.  The collapse of Southwest American Indian agricultural societies was not new to me, but was well chosen as an illustration, as was the collapse of the Maya.  Discussions of the Japanese, Papuan, Haitian and Dominican management of their respective forests was especially impressive.  It made me particularly aware that governments of different types can be particularly effective at environmental management, despite their reputation in other areas of management.<br /><br />Among the more recent events the author discussed, I found the Rwanda debacle the most informative.  I was among those who believed the entire thing to have been an \\"ethnic cleansing\\" of the worst sort and was truly surprised at the degree to which economics rather than ethnic origin played a part in the disaster.  The notion that such an event could be seen by insiders as an unavoidable and acceptable solution to what were basically population and environmental issues is scary! It has direct and vital pertinence to a world that is clearly becoming more and more interconnected economically, growing in overall population, and facing an environment which may become less conducive to life \\"as usual.\\"<br /><br />A truly impressive and pertinent work.hat would make the consumer willing to pay more for what is bought.

I tried to get into this book years ago when my brother sent me a copy.  At the time I had difficulty because it seemed just pointless chatter.  Recently I had the opportunity to view the old series on DVD and thoroughly enjoyed them, so I read The Restaurant at the End of the Universe.  The book is wacky and fun, and has more than a mild amount of social criticism concealed in its pages.<br /><br />Since I'd enjoyed Restaurant, I returned to Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy and again found it difficult to get into it.  I was well into the tale  before it seemed worth the effort.  Even then I found patches that were dull.<br /><br />Despite the on-again/off-again interest, I did enjoy it over all, partly because I was familiar with the characters from Restaurant.  As a first book, it's not bad, but I'm glad I read Restaurant, or I might again have given up on this book.<br /><br />My favorite character here, as in the second book, was Marvin the depressive robot.  Most of us probably know someone just like Marvin; I know I do.  In fact I've known several.  His poorly disguised attempts to gain sympathy and his unwillingness to take it even when it's offered, lest it decrease the satisfaction of his \\"martyrdom,\\" is very funny precisely because one does know people like him.<br /><br />I didn't care much for Beeblebrox, but I don't think you're intended to.  (I've known people like him, too.)  He's an extreme, the other end of which seems to be Arthur.  Because of this, they're both memorable types.  Ford on the other hand, after  the brief stir created by his introduction, seems so middle of the road that one either confuses him with Arthur or Bebblebrox, depending upon what he's doing or saying at the time.  Trilliam, too, gets lost after her introduction.  She's very bright but she's just there.  She's not independent as a personality.  She's a \\"straight man\\" for Beeblebrox and support for Arthur.  If she were removed from the book, I don't think it would make the slightest difference, which is too bad.  More could have been made of her character than was.it would make the slightest difference, which is too bad.  More could have been made of her character than was. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-04-02

Okay, so I'm a latecomer to this series.  My brother actually sent me a copy of the first book, and I just couldn't get into it at the time.  It just seemed foolish.  Recently when I was in a silly frame of mind, I decided to try the series again, and purchased this book.  I have to admit, it is remarkable.  Some of the delightful comments by the narrator are truly apropos, particularly about those who want to govern and middle men.  Although the book seems to ramble quite without direction or purpose, once you suspend any desire to force the text into a traditional mode of literature, you begin to see that there is direction and a distinct purpose.<br /><br />Douglas Adams' style reminds me of a comparison made between G. G. Shaw and Henrik Ibsen.  Ibsen looks at social  problems and says \\"Oh dear, me, what's to be done?\\"  Shaw looks at the same problems and says, \\"How silly, why do we do this?\\"  Adams is more Shaw than Ibsen.  As social commentary he has us laughing at ourselves through out the book.<br /><br />For THOSE WRITING PAPERS in literature, social science, history and political science:  What is Adams' saying about our culture?  Do you think his criticisms are valid?  Do you think there are reasonable solutions?  Read other comedic writers on the world state; you might look at Greek and Roman play writes.  Read a book whose express purpose is social criticism and compare the style with Adams'; you might look at Collapse by Jared Diamond.  Which book is more effective commentary?  Why?  Which is clearer on solutions?  Are there solutions?	2005-03-30

Her sense of materials suggests someone who is very responsive to the artistic possibilities of fabrics.  She keeps scraps from earlier projects just for the visual satisfaction that they give and occasionally buys fabric just because of its beauty.  Omiyage certainly reveals that joy in color, texture, and design.<br /><br />Omiyage is a stunningly illustrated book of a fiber art related to quilting and will probably appeal most to those of you who are already into the latter.  Those of you who, like me, purchased the book because it looked like it might relate more to origami, will probably be a little disappointed.  There is very little of paper folding technique in the practice.  It is a fascinating craft, however, and well worth trying.<br /><br />The book is a visual delight; even the end papers are beautiful.  Instructions are clear and concise, and diagrams are easily followed.  While most of the objects are best made as the author describes them, some of them, like the boxes, might be as easily made with glue or fusion fabrics for those with less time on their hands.<br /><br />While all of the designs are delightful, not all of them seem useful or pertinent at least to those of us who participate in the broader US culture.  I don't mean to denigrate the Japanese culture by any means; the loss is strictly our own.  I've often enough watched people tear through visually satisfying gift packages that have taken considerable time to prepare just to get to the gift inside so that they can go on to the next package.  When it costs only a little money for gift wrap, it makes no difference; when it's taken time, patience and creativity, it does.  We have just too much \\"stuff.\\" I think that's where Japanese culture is considerably more refined and sensitive than Western culture is.  Here, the smaller decorations would be wasted, which is a sad commentary.<br /><br />Similarly, I cannot see many middle class women carrying the delicate little purses described, or US children playing with anything as non-computer or mechanically oriented as the lovely fabric Tamari balls, though very young children will probably enjoy the little dolls and animals.  The sewing box, pin cushions, oghi and round boxes would probably be very well received, as would the small pocket bags for jewelry and other small valuables.  Especially those of us who enjoy craftwork ourselves would appreciate the receipt of any of these pretty items.  Those who enjoy collecting craft objects or dolls might also appreciate some of the designs.  In sum, I think that, as the author says in her introduction, you have to know the recipient well enough and fit the gift to their personality.<br />Similarly, I cannot see many middle class women carrying the delicate little purses described, or US children playing with anything as non-computer or mechanically oriented as the lovely fabric Tamari balls, though very young children will probably enjoy the little dolls and animals.

I have to admit that I wasn't interested enough in it at the time to recall if he did it or even actually planned to do it.  I do, however, have a sense now of what it must feel like to make that kind of leap, because the authors of Why God Won't Go Away carried me over an impressive one!<br /><br />First let me defend myself from the religious readers who may suspect me of atheistic prejudices.  I believe in a spiritual being greater than the self--sorry Steven--but I also acknowledge that this is by personal preference and not by reason of scientific proof.  I even realize that for many people--like Steven--this just doesn't make sense.  That's okay.  I'm alright with that; it doesn't have to.<br /><br />With that said, I can go on to say what I enjoyed about the book:  Their look at the functioning of  neuro-biology, the theories of the origin of religion that they introduced, the fact that they tended to stay aloof from endorsing any specific religion, and their willingness to get off the usual track of studying speech, language and movement.  Certainly finding a biological and evolutionary basis for religious belief makes abundant sense.  It does appear that it has a strong inherent foundation, or it would not persist.  That it provides the population that possesses it with survival advantages seems reasonable.<br /><br />Now for the minor criticism:  Their discussion of how the \\"self\\" arises was interesting but rather simplistic.  Brain/mind studies is, I know, a relatively new field, but the authors did not discuss any of the other theories out there or how their own theory related to the research going on these days.  Although Damasio, Gazzaniga, Ramachandran and Pinker are all listed in the bibliography, not much is made of them and so much could have been.  The works of Blackmore, Dennett, Dawkins, Marcus, and Penrose  weren't even listed.  These are serious omissions. The authors were not studying the self; they were proposing how a self arises and how it might therefore perceive an internal event as god.  If they had made as intensive a study of the literature as they indicated in the first chapters of the book, they should have made more of the \\"experts\\" than they did<br /><br />Now for the most important issue.  In their final chapters and summation, the writers used faulty reasoning to make a case for a higher plane of existence more \\"real\\" than the material world.  I won't go so far as to say they tried to prove the existence of god, although the title might have implied it. This suggests a very basic misunderstanding of what science, let alone religion, is about--and this despite the fact that they themselves point out that difference.  They just ignore it.  Let's look at it.<br /><br />One may, as the authors did, study the effects of mediation and prayer on the human brain.  There have been enough studies that prove that they do have an effect; they're not all good studies, but they're there.  One may, as they also did, form theories as to how these electrochemical changes effect the perception of those who experience them.  One may even legitimately suggest how these electrochemical changes in human brain tissue may have led to the formation of and belief in various religions. It goes a long way toward explaining why, even today,  people are willing to murder \\"outsiders\\" based upon their religion alone<br /><br />To leap from these tenuous and rather preliminary scientific findings and the possibilities they suggest to a conclusion that these same tenuously proven  biological faculties \\"proves\\" a higher plane--let alone god--exists, is definitely not.  Just because someone's mind perceives an experience as \\"real\\" while in an altered state of consciousness does not constitue \\"proof.\\"  That doesn't mean they are dissimulating; it means that it is their own subjective response to an internal experience.  But does a person capable of this type of experience require proof to believe?<br /><br />Now for my pet peeve: The authors drag in poor Einstein and Schr&ouml;dinger, as so many others before them have, as \\"witnesses.\\" They imply that the great authors of Relativity and of Quantum physics respectively would have approved and agreed with their proposal.  This suggests that the authors don't have quite the handle on either man's character or on the theories of Quantum and Relativity physics that they think they do.<br /><br />Both scientists did indeed have a powerful sense of the majesty and mystery of nature and of the universe, a sort of \\"cosmic religious feeling,\\" as the authors note.  I'm not certain, however, that one could say this awe of nature was quite the same as the transcendentalism of meditation or of prayer.  If you stand in front of a tsunami or a tornado, I can guarantee you will experience a type of awe, but it won't be the same experience as meditation or prayer provides.<br /><br />Again, if  presented with the suggestion that there was a \\"higher plane of being\\" that one could only attain by merging with the \\"One,\\" I suspect both Einstein and Schr&ouml;dinger would have raised an eyebrow or two!  More importantly, it wouldn't have mattered even if they had  believed it.  Using their names in support of a contention--even if they had personally agreed to have it so--is a technique called \\"persuasion by endorsement.\\"  It's used as an advertising method all the time.  It's used because it works.  Humans are social animals, and we tend to get on the band wagon, especially if it's driven by someone famous.  In fact, it's very hard to resist it. But it's not scientific proof either.<br /><br />Now I don't want anyone to think that I'm saying that there is absolutely no higher plane of existence reachable only by meditation or prayer.  I certainly wouldn't say that the personal experiences of those who practice these disciplines are false.  I'm simply saying that whether it exists or not, science is unable to prove or disprove it.  In fact, it's not really the purpose of science to do so.<br /><br />The purpose of science is to describe the workings of the material world as precisely as possible, given the technology of the time.  It acknowledges that this is never a perfect description and that the fate of many theories, and even laws, is to be disproved or at least modified.  Science is a self correcting system of thought.  While individual scientists may stray from the principles of the discipline, science as a practice over time does not.  The authors patently mislead when they accuse science of the arrogant statement:  \\"All that is real can be verified by scientific measurements, therefore, what can't be verified by science isn't really real (p. 171).\\"  In fact, what can't be verified by science is not the province of science.  God and the higher plane may be real; they simply aren't repeatable, testable, or quantifiable.  No scientist worth his salt would ever claim otherwise.internal experience.

While Professor Snyder says neither \\"nay\\" nor \\"yea\\" to Arthur's objective reality, he does  bring out the very real effect the legend has had on people world wide and through out time.<br /><br />Instead of dwelling on the insolvable problem of Arthur's existence, a contention that has too little data to clarify it, Snyder covers the archaeological and written records of the period, subjecting both to a critical analysis.  He does this, however, to create for the reader a sense of the time in which a person like King Arthur might have lived.  The types of political, military and social events with which he would have had to contend, and the nature of power and of place in society are discussed using what material is available.<br /><br />With respect to the written material, Snyder discuses a number of problems confronting historians.  The contemporaneity of these sources  with their subject--or lack thereof--is thoroughly described for the reader.  As with Biblical studies or biographies of Alexander the Great and other early people, many of the sources are very much later, even centuries later, than their subject.  The introduction of an author's opinions and cultural biases, let alone their own agendas, may well distort any real information that he had at his disposal.  Snyder makes this very apparent by discussing these authors and the events of their own time with respect to their \\"take\\" on Arthur and his life.  Hagiography, the use of biography as a source of moral teachings or for other purposes, is a legitimate writing technique but not good history.  An early author might also read too uncritically the material of his predecessor, and thus passed on as fact--probably after further distortion--stories that had no basis in fact to begin with.  The task of \\"getting at\\" any core material that may exist becomes almost impossible, and such documents are rightly used with great care.<br /><br />Snyder also discusses the effect of the cultural biases of modern day students of Arthur.  Every culture has a Gestalt of its own, one of which the practitioners of the culture are not always aware, and what such a student perceives in written sources and artifactual evidence is filtered through this world view.  Arthur therefore becomes something different for each culture and even for each culture at different times in its history.  The author makes this point by discussing the changes in the Arthuriana that occurred in France and England and even throughout the world through time.  He even discusses the variations in the Arthurian story that appear in modern cinematic presentations--the bards of our own time--in different countries and in different decades and how these interpretations are borrowed for various contemporary purposes.  The Kennedy era \\"Camelot\\" is a case in point for modern US history.<br /><br />With respect to the archaeological material Professor Snyder notes the effect of climate and geology on preservation, lack of research into key sites, misinterpretation of sites and data by earlier excavators, the biases of excavators, the effect of cultural orientation of excavators, recent improvement of excavation technology, etc.  More than anything, the lack of any concrete data makes putting a definite \\"paid\\" to the task of identifying an individual Arthur a difficult one. The various stories surrounding sites associated with the legend through time, while lending the spice of intrigue and mystery to the Arthur legend, provide little material evidence of his having existed there at all.  Even suggesting probabilities one way or the other are not really possible based on the data.<br /><br />One thing the author does and does thoroughly for those who \\"really want to believe\\" is  present an excellent overview of the individuals who might have served as a prototype for Arthur if not the man himself.  He points out events in the lives of these historical individuals that might connect each with later legends and suggests that a composite of their personal characteristics and/or of their deeds may have gone into the creation of the legendary figure.<br /><br />Whether Arthur or someone like him existed, the myths surrounding the character certainly have had far greater impact on the world's societies than any real person could have had.  In short according to the author, it hardly makes a difference whether he existed or not so potent has his legend became.  Snyder traces the impact of Arthur throughout history, surprising the reader with the vastness of his contribution to the world's people.  Even the modern concept of romantic love is ascribed to the evolution of his legends in Mediaeval Europe.<br /><br />This is a very enjoyable book.e points out events in the lives of these historical individuals that might connect each with later legends and suggests that a composite of their personal characteristics and/or of their deeds may have gone into the creation of the legendary figure. <br /> <br />Whether Arthur or someone like him existed, the myths surrounding the character certainly have had far greater impact on the world's societies than any real person could have had.

Willing to try anything new,  I decided to learn what I could about the art, its techniques and its requirements to prepare myself for trying it.<br /><br />Although I looked at a few magazines, I found that they didn't really help me as a beginner. Often the simple projects they offered for the beginner were nothing I really wanted to make.  I also perused some of the books on the topic, but while I found they offered information about beginning technique, they then went on to show projects way too complex for me.  They did make excellent art books, however, as many of the projects presented  were truly impressive.<br /><br />Simple Glass Beading by Dorothy Wood, offered more of what I had been looking to find.  Just the introduction itself shows the variety of fabrics possible with beading, and makes it evident that the art is related to some extent to  weaving in some of its techniques.  The discussion of tools and materials in the first few pages also makes this point.<br /><br />Even in this book some of the projects are complicated, not to mention requiring the patience of a saint!  I can't imagine myself doing a beaded fabric cover for a book anytime soon.  While I can see that a project of this sort might be very relaxing, I'm not sure I'd be willing to spend the time it would take.  I have too many other things I like to do with my free time.<br /><br />The book is a mine of  techniques and uses to which one may put them. The methods for making woven beaded bands, for making jewelry, and for creating embroidered embellishments are well illustrated.  Certainly anyone who enjoys craft work will find the book satisfying and a great addition to their library.<br /><br />The basic needs of the craft are few--beads, beading wire, needles--and even some of the more advanced equipment--embroidery hoops, beading looms--are probably not difficult to find or expensive to purchase.<br /><br />This is a great book to begin your knowledge of beadcraft.ding looms--are probably not difficult to find or expensive to purchase.   <br /> <br />This is a great book to begin your knowledge of beadcraft. <br />	2005-02-28

An interactive book that she could read with her son seemed just the thing, and origami forms to illustrate it seemed a splendid and simple way to go about the project.<br /><br />Although I have several books in my library that include origami plants and animals they are a little on the old side (some dating to the 1960s), so I decided I'd see what new had been published.  I selected three origami kits out of curiosity: Origami Made Easy by Irmagard Kneissler, Origami Jungle by Michael G.

368000:US	50669529	R1K85LZNA7P9ME	1852854227	628975648	Murder in Shakespeare's England	Books	3	8	8	N	N	Murder in the Samuel Pepy's England	Murder in Shakespeare's England is not quite what you might expect.  For one thing it is not really set in the England of Shakespeare but in that of the Stewart kings, the era of the Great Fire of London, of the later plague years, of war with the Dutch, and of Pepys' Diary.  As lurid and suggestive as the title is, the book is actually a well researched study of the social mores and expectations of the average person of 17th Century England.<br /><br />As the author, Professor Vanessa McMahon, suggests these are individuals not always given a voice in other sources.  They tend to be people whose lives are difficult to access in the general way of things.  Many were probably only marginally literate, most held no distinctive political or social posts in society.  The author cleverly manages to create at least a shadowy image of life for these men and women by looking at the documentation of inquests and of murder trials where the depositions of average people shed light on the life of their time.<br /><br />To a great extent, the book merely verifies the picture presented in general texts on the period.  Legal documents are very terse, and in many cases the deponents are not really given the voice the author suggests, because significant redaction was done by the clerks responsible for presenting the data.  Also the records tend to be incomplete, so outcomes are not always recorded.  Much of the profile of contemporary people the author presents is therefore stilted.  Women, children, servants and the elderly are characterized as subject to routine household violence by males who are expected to be violent by virtue of their \\"nature.\\"<br /><br />To some extent this is true even among the world's cultures and social classes today, but to make a broad generalization from the few responsible for the violence and the victimization to all people would be as unrealistic as denying that such events occur at all.  In the instance of Murder in Shakespeare's England, the nature of the data source would be expected to skew the profile in the former direction.  The author does point this out in the text, but I felt that the picture was still a grim one.  My observation of cultures where women, for instance, are viewed as oppressed by westerners-as in the Middle East-suggests that the dynamics of the culture are such that it is not always experienced from within in quite the way that outsiders suppose.  This would be true of life in the 17th Century as well.  That is not to say that a modern person plunked down in the 17th Century wouldn't experience major cultural shock.  In fact they would.  Experience and expectations form a major portion of our sense of \\"right\\" and \\"wrong.\\"  Technology and living conditions also play a part.<br /><br />The author makes the maximum use of every scrap of data she has mined from the records at her disposal, and the bibliography and notes reflect this.  So does the text, which tends to repeat some facts and conclusions in several places, giving the reader a feeling of deja vu.  I have the distinct feeling that this is a dissertation presented as the author's first offering to the \\"publish or perish\\" gods.  If so, it's not bad.  She captures the imagination by painting a picture of the life and times of the 17th Century that is replete with interesting characters: feisty neighbors, pathetic and helpless social outcasts, irritable servants, difficult wives, soldiers away from home and family, etc.  The setting has the novelty of the past, with the familiarity of a culture that is distantly ancestral to our own.

372405:US	50669529	R2564UXKP824XD	0873513932	520118567	The Story of Cole Younger (Borealis Books)	Books	5	44	47	N	Y	His own take on history	This was a surprising book.  I'm not sure what I expected of it.  My exposure to this phase of history was mostly by way of Saturday afternoon movies and television westerns which I shared with my father when I was a kid.  I was aware of the character Cole Younger and his \\"brothers\\"-they were usually not named-but the \\"bad guys\\" always seemed of limited dimension and intellect, avarice being their single most defining characteristic; that and, I suppose, a profound underlying wickedness that actually found satisfaction in doing evil.  I had long since given up westerns and their \\"black hat/white hat\\" mentality, and probably wouldn't have given a book about Cole Younger a second glance in the ordinary way of things.<br /><br />I found the autobiography, The Story of Cole Younger, tangentially when reading about the Civil War and its outcomes.  A book I had already read on the James brothers made it quite clear that much of what happened before and after the war in Missouri and Kansas had set the tone for the later history of the \\"Wild West\\" and for the American character in general.  It reminded me once more that history is not just a disconnected series of interesting vignettes, despite the fact that it's often studied, taught and written about in that fashion.  History is a linear and multifaceted continuum that helps to structure, define and direct the present and the future in a much more profound way than most people realize.  What was surprising about this book was the degree to which the author himself was aware of that fact.<br /><br />Even more surprising was the erudition and insight with which Cole Younger  wrote about his activities.  I had expected a less literate individual, a flatter, less multidimensional figure than I discovered.  It would appear that although he did not receive a great deal of education, he did receive some.  It would also seem that he was a reader.  He was made librarian at Stillwater Prison for many years, and I suspect made good use of the facility.  While time in a 19th century prison may well have weighed heavily on many men, it would appear that Younger made good use of it.  It would also seem that he was smart enough to realize that obeying the rules and conforming to the lifestyle would make his life easier and more satisfying than railing against the system.  It was certainly central to his having been paroled rather than left confined until his death.  It was also probably responsible for his having lived as long as he did (he died in 1916).  Removed from a hostile environment and protected by the law itself, he lived considerably longer than others of the kind, as for instance Jessie James who died in 1882.<br /><br />While I agree with some of the statements of Marley Brant, who discusses the author's personality and history and his relationships with his family and with the James brothers, I am not so certain that Younger was quite as intentionally devious as Brant suggests.  I believe that in common with most mature people-the author was almost 60 when he wrote the book-Younger desired to appear in a good light.  Certainly the lengthy philosophical summing up of life, both his own and life in general, suggests someone who has given the events that shaped the course of his personal history considerable thought.  Certainly until he wrote his own thoughts down for posterity, nearly everything written about him had been penned by individuals with their own personal agendas, usually with a profit motive heading their list.  While he may have fudged to make himself and his motives appear in more favorable light, I suspect that much of what he wrote he believed was true.<br /><br />Whatever the case, I agree with Brant that Younger seems distinctly aware of his own place in events. His was a life forcibly shaped by where he was born, to whom he was born, by what happened to those he cared about, by his choice of sides in the Civil War and the cultural, moral and normative definitions that that choice signaled.  Had the South won the war, he may well have achieved important financial and political status, as he himself suggested, while other disaffected young men in the North became the \\"bad guys.\\"<br /><br />Interesting too was the realization that my notion of the \\"wild west\\" and that of the time period were two different things.  I doubt that I really gave much thought to the fact that Minnesota-Northfield and its environs-and other mid-western states had been the \\"wild west\\" at the time of the bank robbery.  Raised in the mid-west themselves it was here the James and the Youngers as well as other disenfranchised and disaffected young men, enured to violence by their early introduction to warfare and catapulted into adult roles by virtue of the attrition among more mature men, made niches for themselves in a postwar environment and a frontier setting that was conducive to it.  Just as after most wars when youths of 18 to 20 have lived a larger than life existence, post-civil war soldiers became \\"misfits and adrenaline junkies\\" as my husband Mark says.  (He made the comparison with the WWII pilots who founded the Hell's Angels.)<br /><br />What made it an especially intriguing time was that things were changing and changing rapidly, as Cole and his brother Jim discovered after 25 years in prison.  They were paroled after 1900, and plunged into a 20th century world that had made them essentially historical figures.  One of the stipulations in their parole was that the brothers could not use their notoriety to make themselves side-show characters for a curious audience.  This was a time when real cowboys and real Indians were appearing in Wild West shows, most notably Wild Bill's and beginning to find employment in early western movies.  So different was the early 20th century from that of the post-Civil War period, that those who had made a name for themselves during the war were a source of considerable wonder.  The change in expectations and life styles caused so sudden a transition that Jim Younger committed suicide after only a short period of freedom.<br /><br />I found the book very enlightening, quite believable and wonderfully entertaining.  Although the author of the modern introduction points out there are points where the story is probably more fabrication than truth, it's still well worth reading for anyone interested in the Civil War Era, (pre-, during, and post,) and in the transition between 19th and 20th century life.definitions that that choice signaled.

376642:US	50669529	R1FG13J8Y5KR01	0152001034	156246716	Lives of the Artists: Masterpieces, Messes (and What the Neighbors Thought)	Books	3	16	19	N	Y	Art book without art	I have mixed feelings about this book.  I enjoyed it because it puts some of the humanity back into a subject many of whose personalities have been so lionized that they have become icons, non-people.  However, I'm not certain to whom I might recommend it.<br /><br />To begin with, the book has the direct, simple style of books written for children, grades 4-8.  The language is a little too complex for those under age 8, the style a little too simple for those over age 13.  Since I occasionally read children's books anyway, this did not stop me as an adult from reading the book and taking satisfaction from doing so.  Nor would I have had any problem with recommending the volume for a school or public library, except....<br /><br />I enjoyed the book primarily because I had already had a rather extensive exposure to art of all types through my mother, who was a working artist herself.  Our house was littered with books about artists and their art works, and I started visiting museums in her company from the age of six.  When Lives of the Artists: Masterpieces, Messes (and What the Neighbors Thought) discussed Rembrandt, I already possessed a pretty clear impression of his style and of some of his more famous works.  The possibility that the he did not paint Man with a Golden Helmet surprised me, because I have a very clear picture of the work-one of my favorite Rembrandts-in my head.  Someone who didn't would find it difficult to care; it would be just another bit of free-floating information.<br /><br />In short, the book fails to fulfill a goal as a vehicle of teaching young people-or any people-about art because there are no illustrations of it. While there are entertaining anecdotes about a nice selection of famous people who perform a variety of styles of art, they might be anyone with eccentric behavior.<br /><br />I'm not certain where the fault for this glaring defect lies.  Perhaps it arises from an attempt to produce an interesting and attractive book that is still affordable, especially for children.  Perhaps it was a matter of inability to procure a right to reproduce a work of art belonging to someone who has exclusive rights over it.  Still, I find it difficult to believe that the museums of the world would be unwilling for their masterpieces to be represented in a book on famous art, especially for children, if only because it represents free publicity for their establishment.  Certainly if any given museum is unwilling, there are other works of art from which to choose: therein lies a certain degree of leverage.<br /><br />Whatever the reason for the lack of art in an art book, I can only suggest this book to schools that provide a thorough grounding in the subject.  An art teacher might give lectures on periods of art, their characteristic works and personalities, and suggest that this book might be fun to read.  For a young person who has been prepared, this might return \\"great\\" art once again to the realm of human endeavor.tive book that is still affordable, especially for children.

K. Rowlings best yet.  The first four of the series were a little uneven in their quality-however fun they might have been-but with this, her fifth of a proposed seven, Rowling seems to have hit her stride as a professional writer.  The book is longer than even book four, but unlike the latter, book five uses every page to advantage.<br /><br />Book four started out magnificently, capturing the interest and bringing the reader to the edge of his/her chair in the first chapter, only to bog down thereafter.  It became a ponderous tale that seemed to have difficulty defining its direction and purpose.  Book five, on the other hand, sets a fast pace with an active, intriguing tale and does not slow down until the end of the book.  One literally has difficulty putting the book aside.<br /><br />The plot is carefully considered, well designed, and carries the reader logically forward through the story.  There is hardly a plot turn or character that is out of place or that does not have a significant purpose in forwarding the tale to its conclusion.  This requires careful attention to detail and great forethought, and illustrates the maturation of the author's style.<br /><br />In earlier books the characters of Potter, Weasely, and Granger are somewhat like pasteboard cutouts. typical little boy hero, typical little boy best friend, typical little girl best friend.  And their conflicts, while realistic, are dealt with in a formulaic manner.  Not so with the Order of the Phoenix.<br /><br />In the Order of the Phoenix the characters are well constructed and very three dimensional.  We are familiar with them from our previous introductions to them, but here they are confronted with more serious problems often without real solutions.<br /><br />Here is a Harry Potter who is a difficult and moody young man in the early stages of adolescence.  He's tired of being the subject of abuse and insults from his relatives, tired of being an object of curiosity to his peers, tired of being the target of scorn and ridicule from his foes and his least favorite teacher.  He's surly with his teachers and even with his mentors.  He's even difficult with close friends.<br /><br />Here is a young man dealing with his first real crush, and the problems of dating and of male-female relationships.  A successful child who finds that taking an unpopular stand can require even more courage than facing physical danger.  A young person who must deal with the fact that his beloved father in whose image he has striven to model himself, was not always the perfect person he supposed him to be and that the male teacher whom he has despised and mistrusted over the past several years has real reasons for the grudge against his father.<br /><br />More significant, I think, is the more thorough development of collateral characters with whom we are familiar at least by name.  Now Ginny Weasely is not just a little girl with a crush on Harry, she's a Quidditch player, a person with opinions, an individual willing to take risks for what she believes in.  And little Neville is not simply a frightened little boy with little faith in himself.  He has grown in maturity and courage also.  In this book, more than any of the others, we are introduced to Harry's peers as the up and coming \\"younger generation.\\"<br /><br />For modern children and young adults who are themselves going through many similar challenges, this is a great book.  It discusses the different communication styles of boys and girls.  It teaches that one must think for oneself, take stands on issues, suffer the consequences of negative outcomes to ones actions-of whatever good intent they may have been-that people may not believe you despite your honesty, that others have motives that don't always make sense, and so forth.<br /><br />One word of caution, however.  While the book is superbly written and delightful fiction, it is not what the others were.  It is not as lighthearted.  Just as children go from naivety to realist as they mature, so too do these stories.  As the citizens of Hogwart's grow and mature, they too become more serious.  For those who have grown up reading the stories and have matured over the years with the character, these changes will probably seem quite natural.  Such a reader may well be oblivious to the change in the emotional environment of the stories.  For those of us who read them as adults and certainly for those of us who-like Dumbledore-can just barely remember what it was like to be in early adolescence, the loss of the sense of joy and innocence-that pasteboard cut-out tone as I have referred to it above-may outweigh the appreciation of the mature writing style.  I leave it to the individual reader to decide for him/herself.lightful fiction, it is not what the others were.  It is not as lighthearted.

Remembering the old saw that \\"If you don't use it, you lose it,\\" I tried from time to time to improve my reading skills by taking up a book that I knew I had enjoyed in English.  Although still difficult to find, books in French are becoming more common than they used to be and less expensive too.  I found this one with little difficulty on Amazon, and have added other books in the language from the site to my wish list.<br /><br />I was so successful in reading and understanding the simple French of Harry Potter, that I was almost at my normal reading speed.  Although there were sentances and phrases that did not always make sense to me, I found that if I pronounced the French words in my mind rather than trying to translate the material into English, I often understood much better.  I also found that the next time I ran across a new or difficult word that I had found in one context, I recognized its meaning much more quickly in another.  Just as in learning to read English as a young person, I find that reading persistantly is the key to developing a vocabularly.<br /><br />Though I don't ever expect to be a fluent French speaker and will probably never sit down and write my reviews in any language but English, I really, really, really enjoyed having an opportunity to re-read Harry Potter, this time in French.  I recommend the series to parents of children learning to read French and adults who wish to improve their language skills.	2004-12-03

I could understand that it provided the author with a structural framework with which he could bring in information on various topics, but it also seemed to use up space.  By the middle of the book, after reading the umpteenth lengthy quotation from someone else's work and after trying to figure out the significance of yet another unidentified photograph, I felt that Professor Calvin had needed to get something into print, and he chose this way to do it.  By the last few chapters I was certain of it, because they are mostly a rehash of ice age and other climatic changes and their impact on human cultures, material one might find in one of Fagan's books.  Certainly the material on the climatic impacts of the Little Ice Age can be found in the book of the same name by the latter author.<br /><br />A little disappointing.  I'd suggest something less chatty.	2004-11-29

Although I sort of went crazy and bought several books on handmade books and paper crafts, when it came to actually selecting designs I wanted to try for Christmas gifts for my friends this year it was Book Arts:  Beautiful Bindings for Handmade Books by Mary Kaye Seckler that had the most novel and attractive designs.  Some of the ideas were similar to those illustrated in other works, but Ms Seckler's actual presentation was impressive.  While some of the more elaborate designs in other books were attractive and clever, they left me as a major beginner a little daunted.  Book Arts allowed me to produced satisfying results despite my status as novice.<br /><br />Some of the actual patterns for weaving the signatures together were a little confusing to me.  I'm used to fiber crafts like tatting and bobbin lace which have very complicated designs, so I felt that had the illustrations been a little clearer it would have been easier to do.  Where the needlework was more straight forward, however, I found the assembly of the book more easily accomplished.  Although I've yet to try all of the patterns, I hope to make each one at least once.<br /><br />Of all of the styles offered, my favorite was the Geisha's Hideaway.  It includes a small pencil box and a novel closure.  I made a practice run with scrap paper and cardboard backs from tablets during a quiet episode at work and managed to complete the thing in about an hour.  I've since made three others using brocade fabric and taking more pains over the precision with which I cut the covers and pencil box, and each took considerably longer, about three hours with gluing and clamping the materials. The results, however, were stunning.<br /><br />I modified the author's version of the Chinese Star Book by making it a little larger and making a changeable story out of it by placing alternate outcomes from which the reader could chose into pockets at each stage of the story.  I got the idea for the story from another book on making books, but chose Ms Seckler's design for the actual book.<br /><br />By learning the basic techniques of each of the books and altering them to suit a desired purpose, the student should be able to come up with hundreds of clever designs.

Since it seemed plausible, I accepted it as possible and felt some fascination for a grandfather whose life spanned a period from the \\"wild west\\" to walking on the moon!  In reading the book, however, I discovered that the event occurred a few years before Grandpa Chester was born (1880).  The author's comments about the gang's stopping on a farm near Dundas to get water to wash wounds, though, leaves me wondering if my great grand uncle did indeed play some small part in the drama at Northfield.  This makes the story of the outlaws' exploits a little more personal for me, so Mr. Stiles' book Jessie James:  Last Rebel of the Civil War immediately caught my attention.<br /><br />I'm not quite certain what I expected of the tome; probably a pulp fiction type work on the violent career of Jessie James full of colorful detail.  What I got was a surprise.  I have to apologize to the author, a fellow Minnesotan, because what he has produced, while a colorful account of a violent career, is also a wonderful history of the Civil War and its aftermath.<br /><br />With due respect to the feelings of the anonymous author of the negative review of the book and of Mr. Mock, I really don't think Stiles is \\"anti-southerner.\\"  The history of Jessie James appears to be well documented, despite his life in hiding and his efforts at misinformation.  Especially those individuals who survived him--in fact survived their own time and place in history to become anomalies and curiosities in the 20th century-and including his elder brother and his own children, ensured that much of the history of Jessie and his peers were made known and kept alive for later generations.  While they were obviously motivated by personal agendas to embroider these tales and to aggrandize their own part in them, there is no reason to assume that their memories of events need necessarily be in error.  They were, after all, there.  Where there is outside evidence that the witness is fabricating, the author makes this known.  Certainly there have been stories that James survived beyond his documented demise and lived incognito in various other states.  DNA studies have already laid these legends to rest.<br /><br />The true value of the book lies, not so much in the story of the James brothers and their gang members, as in its look at the Civil War from the point of view of a single state, most importantly a border state and on its effect on the history of a family, two of whose members became well known.  Here was a microcosmic example of the national conflict that makes the event and its impact on those alive at the time very real.<br /><br />Too often books on the Civil War limit their discussions to descriptions of battles, to the careers of generals, and to the politics of North and South.  A tip of the hat is given to the divided loyalties that extended to families, often in the form of \\"brother against brother\\" rhetoric.  A discussion of the \\"common soldier\\" is limited to quotes from diaries.  Certainly all of this helps create a mental picture of the conflict, but it remains very superficial.  Furthermore, much of Civil War literature remains focused on the events of the Eastern front with a digression to the West only in so far as events there clarified Grant's career and bring him into the picture.  Stiles' biography of Jessie James corrects this lack of intensity and humanness.<br /><br />The state of Missouri more than any other is noted as The State that suffered Civil War atrocities long before the actual conflict began.  As the US expanded westward following the Mexican American conflict that added territory to the country, the issue of \\"slave\\" verses \\"free\\" loomed large.  It was not merely a problem of whether slavery would extend tothe western states, but whether balance of control of the US Congress would tip to North or South with the introduction of slave or free states into the union.  The confrontation was intense.  Exchange of blows on the senate floor exhibited the emotional intensity of the period and the degree to which feelings could be and were acted upon.<br /><br />Stiles' study of the James family illustrates the issues of the day:  lack of women's rights, slavery, the degree to which families that lost male head of household were at risk of poverty or exploitation, the sense that Missouri and Kansas were at the center of political conflict between North and South even before the war, and the effects of these social issues on the mental and emotional character of young people growing up at the time.  Stiles especially points out the difference between the personality of Frank James who was significantly older during the conflict and that of his brother Jessie who was still a boy at the time it started.  His discussion of the \\"violenization\\" of Jessie James by members of the bushwackers' gangs, rings of sociologists' studies of big city gangs in the late 19th and early 20th century.  The desensitization of very young individuals to violence, to brutalization of helpless victims, and to the upside down value system that made heroes of the most vicious perpetrators of such violence sounds a lot like the behavior of gangs in Chicago, Detroit, and New York, even today.  As some of the other reviewers note, it is also reminiscent of the behavior of modern day terrorists, members of fundamentalist groups world wide not excluding our own Christian brand.<br /><br />Probably more than most books on the conflict, Jessie James:  The Last Rebel of the Civil War makes it evident that the social problems of the country that brought about the conflict did not simply go away after the official end of the war.  More than most books on the topic, it becomes evident that one doesn't change attitudes and lifestyle mores by winning a war.  It's the old saw, \\"you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink.\\"  Even now conflicts over these issues continue, despite the passing of almost 150 years.  If feelings can still run high over civil rights here and now, whether between black and white or Christian and Moslem, than war was and is not the answer to the problem.<br /><br />A superb book, well written, and well thought out.y would extend to the western states, but whether balance of control of the US Congress would tip to North or South with the introduction of slave or free states into the union.

Stiles especially points out the difference between the personality of Frank James who was significantly older during the conflict and that of his brother Jessie who was still a boy at the time it started.  His discussion of the \\"violenization\\" of Jessie James by members of the bushwackers' gangs, rings of sociologists' studies of big city gangs in the late 19th and early 20th century.   The desensitization of very young individuals to violence, to brutalization of helpless victims, and to the upside down value system that made heroes of the most vicious perpetrators of such violence sounds a lot like the behavior of gangs in Chicago, Detroit, and New York, even today.  As some of the other reviewers note, it is also reminiscent of the behavior of modern day terrorists, members of fundamentalist groups world wide not excluding our own Christian brand.  <br /> <br />Probably more than most books on the conflict, Jessie James:  The Last Rebel of the Civil War makes it evident that the social problems of the country that brought about the conflict did not simply go away after the official end of the war.  More than most books on the topic, it becomes evident thatone doesn't change attitudes and lifestyle mores by winning a war.  It's the old saw, \\"you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink.\\"  Even now conflicts over these issues continue, despite the passing of almost 150 years.  If feelings can still run high over civil rights here and now, whether between black and white or Christian and Moslem, than war was and is not the answer to the problem. <br /> <br />A superb book, well written, and well thought out. <br />	2004-11-24

In this book he needs all of this literary artillery, not because he is arguing any contentious issues-in fact he's probably preaching to the choir for most readers-but because the work is lengthy, covers a wide range of topics, and does so in considerable detail.<br /><br />The clever format of the work is a Chauceresque \\"pilgrimage\\" to the ancestor of all life, hence the title.  Just as individuals join Chaucer's tale of Canterbury and entertain us with their personal tales, so too do the various life forms who join our trip back into time.  The author picks certain species to clarify what new is introduced to the complexity of life ways at each bifurcation on the genetic tree.  Throughout, he makes it very evident that this is not a tale of organisms but of the genes they contain, and he does a superb job of it.  The reader is never allowed to forget what the point of the migration is.<br /><br />I found some of Professor Dawkins' points particularly illuminating because he made things I thought I understood even clearer still.  I also found the author's capacity to arrange such a massive amount of information in such a logical order, weaving in important details at key points, amazing to me.  Although I know quite a lot of the information, I doubt I could have arranged it in anywhere near such a comprehensible order as the author has.<br /><br />The problem with the work is that it is almost too detailed for the average reader-and this despite the fact that the author does not get drawn into discussing material he has covered in earlier works.  With frequent references to his own titles and to those of others on specific topics, he manages to keep to his specified goal.  Still, the work is a lengthy 614 pages, and it covers a lot of territory.  It is almost encyclopedic.  I have to admit, though, that should a beginner make an attempt to get through it, he/she would have a very clear and comprehensive understanding of the workings of evolution.  For those with only a casual interest, this is probably more than you want to tackle.  I am a fairly fast and persistent reader, and I had difficulty staying on track.  I read the book in small increments, sometimes stopping in the middle of chapters.  It required time to digest the new material or the new way of looking at old material.<br /><br />One aspect of the book from which both the enthusiast and the casual reader will benefit, is the extensive bibliography.  The books listed under \\"further reading\\" are current and diverse.  Those from the general bibliography include both periodicals and books on specific topics.  Some are a little dated, but all give a comprehensive coverage of discussions in evolutionary biology from which the reader may select follow-up information that more suits their level of and specific interests.  All appear to be in English.  Some of the journals may be difficult to find in public libraries, but all should be available in a large university library.  Of those that I've read, Mark Ridley's Red Queen (1993) on the development of complex life forms and the enigma of sex and Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel (1991) on the serendipitous environmental factors affecting human diversity are my favorites.  Although on cosmology rather than evolution, Sir Martin Rees' book, Just Six Numbers (1999), is also of interest.<br /><br />For those not afraid of detail, I hardily recommend the book.  For those who just want a basic understanding, I'd look for something a little simpler.ugh, that should a beginner make an attempt to get through it, he/she would have a very clear and comprehensive understanding of the workings of evolution.

467435:US	50669529	R1XBYHBRCP3BLF	0595327249	536378931	Aunt Puff and Missing Minerva	Books	5	14	14	N	N	A gem for the teacher or librarian	When I first began this book, I wasn't sure I'd like it.  The central characters were a bit extreme to my first impression.  Afterall, I grew up with an eccentric mother, and her exploits were legendary in our family.  My favorite was that about her catching rattlesnakes on the cliffs near her college to sell to the biology department for spending money.  We spent most of my childhood in a small town where, despite their rather conservative attitudes, they accepted my mother and her oddity, because she was \\"an artist.\\"  Specifically she was their artist.  And she did all this without purple and green hair or a leopard cowboy hat (although she did join a clown club and learn to walk on stilts at 62), which of course made the central characters of the book seem a little too over-the-top to me at least!<br /><br />Giving the story a chance, though, I read on and became quite enchanted with the tale of Aunt Puff and Missing Minerva.  Although I rarely have a feeling of genuine joy when reading a children's book, I found myself smiling at the antics of these characters.  I especially enjoyed the dog Ludwig probably because I have Great Danes of my own and the character is so often like my two.  For all their over-the-top personalities, the characters and their activities made one feel genuinely delighted.  The episode of Lilly's Luring Lemonade was particularly fun. The story moves right along, pulling the reader from chapter to chapter.  Each is filled with novel activities leading to the conclusion.  The narrative is well structured with a logical beginning, middle and end, and there is character development with issues of self-discovery all along the way.<br /><br />My only problem is that I still am not quite certain to whom I'd recommend the book.  This is partially because, while some of the earlier chapters are well composed for very young readers, the later chapters are more complex and might be better directed to older readers.  The simplicity of the earlier chapters, however, might put off a somewhat older child as too \\"silly.\\"  It's a difficult call.  Certainly much of the vocabulary is for an older child, but it would be nothing that would not make sense to the younger sibling if read to him or her.<br /><br />In general I think that the book would make a delightful read-to-me book for pre- to early school age children.  I could see a library volunteer or a grade school teacher reading the book to smaller children to great effect because of the issues and odd points that might be brought out to teach children about the world and reality, even about subtle, common sense physics.  Is it possible to put 15 suitcases into a woman's purse?  Why not?  Do you know what a green house is?  Do people live in them?  Could people live in them?  What changes would a person have to make to a green house to live in it?  Can you take photographs with a magnifying glass?  What are magnifying glasses used for in the real world?  Could you make a boat out of ice?  Etc.<br /><br />For older children, one might let them read aloud and discuss the issue of responsibility for the well-being of others and the realistic limitations of such responsibility as it's discussed in the story.  There are also many classical allusions to creatures from mythology that might become part of a study project.  There is also some use of poetry in the text to illustrate points more clearly to the central character Elizabeth.  One might look at poetry and its construction as opposed to prose and its construction.  Why is poetry effective in so short a space?  Etc.<br /><br />For all its oddness I enjoyed this little book, and I think it is a mine of learning gems that would easily suit the classroom or a library reading program.  For one thing, the topics that might be used for discussion seem almost limitless.  They are so varied that any teacher, no matter what type of background, would be able to find topics that suited their own knowledge base well enough to lead a discussion.  A clever book, well written and a gem for the teacher or librarian.base well enough to lead a discussion.  A clever book, well written and a gem for the teacher or librarian. <br />	2004-11-04

After reading Eric H. Cline's book, Jerusalem Besieged, I think I'm going to have to reconsider the issue.<br /><br />What I found most intriguing about the author's discussion was his concept of the origin of the site's importance.  Most archaeologists tend to point to the advantage of a location as the inspiration for settlement and development in the area.  Often things like access to a sheltered harbor, a fishing resource, mineral wealth such as flint, obsidian, ceramic clay, iron, gold or silver, or water availability and so on are reasons that a city grows and flourishes through time.  As one realtor has said, \\"there are three things to remember in selecting real estate:  location, location, location.\\"<br /><br />Jerusalem however seems to defy that premise.  According to the author, it is neither exceptional for its geologic nor for its geographic gifts.  The agricultural value of the surrounding land is marginal, water supply is iffy, there are no large stands of timber to be harvested and few if any valuable mineral riches to be mined.  Geographically it seems to have been an isolated site, in the back of beyond.  It lies well inland of the coast and is not the hub of intersecting trade routes.  In fact, although it is mentioned in the Egyptian Armarna texts, it seems to have held little political value until David took it forcibly from the Jebusites, its previous owners, and made it the center of his new monarchy.  It would appear that even he chose the site primarily because it had not been a power base for any of his own people.  Its foreign citizenry owed no one but him any loyalty, so it would not entangle him in the petty internal feuds that seemed to be the bane of the Israelite political world.  Yet over the past 3000 years, more blood has been shed over the city of Jerusalem than practically any other site on earth.<br /><br />So what makes this rock in the middle of nowhere such a magnet for passion and violence?  Why does the City of Peace seem to drive sensible people crazy?  According to Professor Cline it would appear to be the city's emotional wealth.  So many have made Jerusalem the center of spiritual and emotional importance that the site is invested with staggering human significance.  That investment in Jerusalem over the past 3000 years almost ensures continuous strife over its possession.  No one seems immune to the insanity either.  People from as distant as the Far East have taken a part in the madness.  Everyone from the Romans to the British and the US have entered the melee.  Embarrassingly-for a nominal Christian at least-the worst of the violence seems to have been perpetrated by the Crusaders.<br /><br />Almost all of the illustrations of the city in the book are from its outside and from a fair distance.  I think the artist had a good idea.  Personally by the end of the book I felt that everyone should be forbidden to live on the site for their own good; it's far too dangerous.  It should be walled off for the health of the world, and the faithful and the curious can look at it through the fence from a safe distance.  Having read the author's book The Battles of Armageddon, I would have to say that if the end of days does occur, it won't be at Megiddo; it'll be at Jerusalem!<br /><br />As I said above, this is a book that really needed to be written.  It's not that there is anything particularly new in it; it's just that it's all particularly focused.  I think that it should be required reading for all politicians, both regional and national, and certainly for any of those involved in attempts to bring about peace in the area.  For the general reader it will make the issues in the Middle East far clearer and reveal why a lasting peace in the area is unlikely to occur any time soon.  It will also make the Arab countries' horror over the US activities in the region more understandable.  Certainly the author's final statement, quoting O'Neill, is vividly evocative of the entire message of the book, \\"For now, however, in Jerusalem, perhaps more than anywhere else in the world, `There is no present or future-only the past, happening over and over again...(p. 310).'\\"he Middle East far clearer and reveal why a lasting peace in the area is unlikely to occur any time soon.

If the author actually finishes the series, it has the potential to become a classic, as young people who read it today introduce it to their own children years hence.<br /><br />The publishers suggest Aidan or Oren for third and fourth grade readers, and from the level of the sentance structure and vocabularly I'd agree.  I think that pre-literate and early literate children would also enjoy it as a \\"read-to-me\\" book as well, although they may have to have some of the vocabularly explained.  Words are age appropriate and introduced repeatedly in different sentences so that meaning can be learned from context and practiced, but the work is not so repetitious that is boring or pedantic, something that might irritate an adult reader.<br /><br />The world of the children is delightful, and each child is an individual as are the non-humans Charles and Damon.  The world of adults is kept in the background and viewed as it probably is to most children, as full of \\"advisors\\" and \\"teachers\\" and social interactions of which children are not a part but to which they are important.  While the action of the story is probably a little tame for an older child, the trials confronted by the central characters of Aiden and his friends McKenzie and Lilly, are those of real children who have reached the magic age of thirteen, since the story is a coming-of-age tale.<br /><br />Thirteen is that pivital point between childhood and adulthood that is full of discovery, especially self discovery, when every child learns who he or she is and what they are meant to become and to do.  While most children are not confronted with dragons or talking birds, elves or trolls, they are confronted with changing roles and expectations that can be equally magic at one time and frightening at others.<br /><br />In the story Aidan discovers his abilities and his \\"destiny\\" with the help of his capable peers.  He learns, among other things, that the responsibility of leadership is the well-being of others, and that while one person, even the leader, cannot know and do everything, the group or community may.<br /><br />Truely an enjoyable book; well written and well crafted.bility of leadership is the well-being of others, and that while one person, even the leader, cannot know and do everything, the group or community may.  <br /> <br />Truely an enjoyable book; well written and well crafted.	2004-10-23

The book is therefore an excellent introduction for the young person with an interest in geology, earth history, or paleontology as a career, or for the individual of whatever age who is interested in the subject but has difficulty with the dry facts of science as generally presented in books and journals on the topic.<br /><br />While I personally like to take my information \\"straight up\\" like those he composes with co-author Donald Brownlee, and without the biographical admixture of adventure, I did find the sociological information about South Africa very enlightening and enjoyed it.  I am also once agained reconfirmed in my belief that the life of a field geologist is a rigorous one.  More than anything, I now realize how very unsuited I would have been as either a geologist or a paleontologist.  I enjoy having worked on my degree in geology, but I really am an armchair enthusiast.<br /><br />I found the author's late realization of the clues inherent to the red beds surprising, since their significance occurred to me almost immediately.  This may possibly be because I live in the once iron rich state of Minnesota and the oxidation of iron in solution in the oceans that formed those beds was made quite clear in my own geology classes.<br /><br />Among the findings that the author offered at the conclusion of the book, several were of interest to me.  He suggests that the common finds of Lystrosaur may not be due to simple accident of preservation but reflect the fact that they were a common post Permian animal.  Perhaps the Lystrosaurs had made it successfully through the bottleneck to increase in numbers at the expense of those who failed to survive whatever catastrophe had occurred.<br /><br />The author also mentions that this animal had been known as a high altitude creature, successful where others were not by virtue of its specialized lungs.  This led him to wonder if the common finding the the Lystrosaur might reflect a depletion of oxygen level and a movement of the animal into lower altitudes as competitors died out.  He also opines the likelihood that the dinosaur and its relatives the birds became successful by virtue of similar lung changes accommodating lower oxygen levels early on, a very insightful proposal.<br /><br />The notion that all these changes might have set life on a totally different pathway, one that ultimately led to us, is also quite clever.  I know that others have suggested atmospheric oxygen content changes as an explanation for the size increase in animal life during the Jurassic, but this was suggested as an increase in content rather a decrease.  Another decline in oxygen level, this time to our current level of 21%,  has been proposed for the extinction of the megafauna of the Pleistocene.  Clearly any major change in the proportion of atmospheric gases is going to effect any life that has accommodated itself to a narrowly defined set of conditions.  Animals that are more tolerant of deprivation or have a wider tolerance for variation will out compete those that don't.  Given the pressures to which our present atmosphere is subject, whether by natural climate change or the effects of green house gases from fossel fuels and ozone depleters, it may not be too long before anaerobes come into their own again!astrophe had occurred.   <br /> <br />The author also mentions that this animal had been known as a high altitude creature, successful where others were not by virtue of its specialized lungs.

God and the New Physics, written in 1983, still holds up well despite the passage of time and the amazing new findings in cosmology.  When I realize that Paul Davies was in him mid-thirties when he was penning this major work of philosophy and physics, it makes me wonder at how little I did with my life!<br /><br />Anyone hoping for a scientific justification for a specific religion or for God in general will be disappointed.  Although the author puts up a variety of possible cosmological points that might do so, he generally comes to the conclusion that they do not.  The work is a superb examination of a variety of philosophical issues that plague even the average thinking person: How did the universe begin, did God create the universe, why does it exist at all, what is life, what is the mind, what is the soul, what is the self, does free will exist?  He also discusses scientific issues that have baring on religion: what is time, what is matter, did the universe arise by accident or design, what is chaos, how will the universe end?<br /><br />Any student of theology or philosophy would do well to be acquainted with this book.  Certainly every point is covered with regard to the existence of God and the meaning/purpose of life.  The key scientific facts are lucidly put forth in a way that even the least math minded can understand them.  For the blindly faithful, the book will do little to effect your point of view.  It certainly won't bring about any change in your religious affiliation since no specific religion is endorsed.  For those who are undecided or complete unbelievers, the book will not make you feel closer to a personal God if you don't already, but it may give you a sense of awe, a feeling of gratitude for the amazing universe of which you find yourself a part.<br /><br />Although the author does not say so specifically, science cannot prove the nonexistence of a deity any more than the religious person can prove his existence.  God is essentially a non-testable, non-falsifyable, non-repeatable entity, a matter of faith and belief and therefore of choice.  For the faithful, he needs no explanation or justification.  For most scientists, God is a non-issue.  Science is a method, one of examining nature, of finding out how it works, of putting together a description of its principles.  As technology and understanding advance, that description changes.  In essence, science is a self-correcting picture of reality.  The author reveals this admirably.<br /><br />Anyone with an interest in cosmology will be find the book a little dated if they have already done any reading on the topic.  Black holes have become an accepted phenomenon, the Hubble Telescope has allowed more detailed visualization of space, the universe is now believed to be speeding up rather than slowing down its expansion, etc.  Still the basics are there and presented in a very readable, understandable form.  Although those with more interest in physics than in theology might find other more recent books on the topic more to the point, there is no doubt that Davies has produced an amazing presentation.ience cannot prove the nonexistence of a deity any more than the religious person can prove his existence.

Wow, talk about depressing, although I don't know why it should be.  Anyone who studies earth history with anything like a rational scientific interest knows that the planet will eventually cease to exist.  Most of us don't plan on being here when it does.  In fact, those of us with a background in paleontology might be willing to lay odds on whether the human race will survive to anything like a time \\"close\\" to the final days.<br /><br />Basically the authors-and probably mostly Peter Ward-have given the last hours of planet earth the aura of a human death.  In fact, Ward compares it graphically to the death of his own elderly mother, a gradual failure of all systems.  While I found this very depressing, I found the concept of reverse evolution-if one can say that there is a \\"progress\\" to evolution-back to its beginnings an intriguing one; much like the \\"big bounce\\" concept in cosmology.  In looking at the probable decline of our sun and of the living conditions of the planet because of it, one should find it unsurprising that life will evolve to simpler forms as a matter of entrenchment.  With respect to the other possible ends to life on the planet, the death by fire in the form of asteroid impact has been done to death by the media over the past decade, while recently death by ice in the form of renewed glaciation is now gaining its fair share of film time.<br /><br />In many respects the book is a continuation of Ward and Brownlee's  earlier collaboration for Rare Earth, and repeats the assessment of what conditions favor life in general and intelligent life in particular.  In both books the Drake equation is studied in detail with less of a rose tinted perspective.  Basically The Life and Death of Planet Earth, like Rare Earth, points out the possibility that life at its most basic might be common enough in the cosmos but that what we see around us now on planet earth might not be.  In short, once gone the magnificent experiement might truely be over.<br /><br />Interesting follow up to Rare Earth.br /> <br />Interesting follow up to Rare Earth.	2004-09-23

I had read some of the forensic information on the victims of Vesuvius in a journal article written in the 1980s and have often wondered what else had come of the work there.  When I discovered Ghosts of Vesuvius by Charles Pellegrino, I felt I would at last learn a little more.  I did indeed learn a great deal more but not all of it about Pompeii and Herculaneum.<br /><br />Dr. Pellegrino is obviously a person of diverse interests and experience who has worked and corresponded professionally with researchers like Haraldur Sigurdsson (volcanology), Carl Sagan (cosmology), Issac Asimov (cosmology), Stephen Jay Gould (paleontology), Robert Ballard (marine science), Arthur C. Clarke (space engineer and astronomer), and Sara Bisel (forensic scientist).  He also appears to be able to propound competently on both religion and philosophy and to speak knowledgeably about historical figures, events, politics, law and society.  In short, he is an exceptionally well rounded individual.  (E. O. Wilson would probably approve of his efforts towards consiliance).<br /><br />The book is not probably for everyone, however,  since it seems almost stream of consciousness in style.  It took me a while to stand aside from the English Comp expectation that there be a beginning, middle and end with smooth transitions between concepts and a clear, up-front development of a central theme.  I had the feeling that the author had a great deal to talk about and had decided to say it all in one book!<br /><br />For those able to take information of various sorts and fit it into what they already know without necessarily needing a continuous thread, the author is a gold mine.  Among other topics, he discusses the origin of the cosmos, the solar system, and the earth, the evolution of life, reveals our position in time by taking the reader backwards in leaps that double in length back to the big bang, discusses the mistakes and ambition of various Roman emperors and the development of Roman legal systems especially those regarding the rights of former slaves.  He also discusses the effects of other volcanic events on  the world, including that at Thera during the Minoan period and of Krakatoa during the 19th Century and analyzes the Old and New Testaments for indications of the psychological impacts of the AD 79 eruption on biblical stories.  He outlines the various Gnostic sects of Christianity, their setting in the Roman world, and their beliefs vis a vis the Roman Catholic Church.  He describes the historical background of the Vesuvian eruptions, points out the characteristics of what has become labeled a Plinian type of eruption, and describes some of the forensic data that provide insight into the human drama of the event.  He narrates details of the 9/11 attack including the physics of the collapse of the buildings and of the odd pattern of survival of various individuals.<br /><br />An excellent discourse, but suspend your English Comp notion of how a book should be written.takes and ambition of various Roman emperors and the development of Roman legal systems especially those regarding the rights of former slaves.

My first surprise was that the author, Hazel Denning has a PhD.  That spurred me to check her vita to see in what the degree was taken.  Apparently it's in clinical psychology, not a bad beginning.  A practice emphasis on past life regression, however, tended to make me a little skeptical.<br /><br />My next surprise was the lady's age.  The copyright of the book is 1996, and her stated year of birth (on the same page) is 1907.  Not a bad output for an individual of 89 years.  The book is eminently readable, very literate, and suggests a person with non-scientific mainstream ideas but with a firm conviction in them and the courage to set them to paper.<br /><br />True Hauntings is not your average ghost story book.  These are not the mythic or camp fire variety tales but more in the style of Hans Holzer.  Individuals suffering haunting are described, the venues in which these phenomenon have occurred are also provided, and follow-up research where indicated was done.  In short it is more of a case book.<br /><br />While I'm not certain that I believe in ghosts beyond their entertainment value, I still found the author's deliberations about them and about life in general quite profound.  If one can believe what she says about some of the individuals she treated for ghostly \\"infection,\\" she has provided quite a few people with emotional relief for some very real life crises.<br /><br />An interesting book.	2004-09-11

It is about the bubonic plague of  Seventeenth Century London during the reign of Charles II.  This was the epidemic that drove Newton to return to his home town to confront the famous apple; it is the epidemic that preceded the Great Fire of 1666; it is the Pepys' Diary world.<br /><br />Probably more than anything, this book, like that on the Great Fire of London, proves the value of diarists and their contemporary accounts.  While the facts of the devastation could be adequately conveyed by graph and statistics alone, the emotional impact of the event can not begin to be demonstrated by numbers alone.  The courage of the population at every level of society as they attempted to carry on their daily lives despite the devastation all around them was amazing.  Even those who fled the city because they could afford to do so, provided financial support to those who could not.  The psychological toll that months of death cost is evident in many of the diaries.  Even the ever buoyant and optimistic Samuel Pepys, the civil servant's civil servant, began to show cracks in his armor.<br /><br />One of the things that most impressed upon me the reality of the plague was the staggering demands for burial property.  Churchyards were used and reused for single burials, and empty land around the town was used for mass graves.  Just disposal of the dead became a major problem.  It reminded me of the same issues that arose in the aftermath of the 1900 hurricane that hit Galveston, Texas, only this was a \\"hurricane\\" that lasted over a year and produced far more fatalities!<br /><br />Another point that impressed me was the incredible competence and active involvement of James, Duke of York, the king's brother.  While Charles II fled the city for safety, James remained in London to conduct both the naval war with the Dutch and to keep the city stable during the plague.  He did much the same during the great fire that occurred shortly after the plague died out.  He sounds like a very useful person.<br /><br />As a health care practitioner myself, I found the alignments of the various elements of the health care world of the time of considerable interest.  The conflict between the medical establishment, the pharmacists, the surgeons, and the herbalists during this time helped to define the hierarchy of  health care as it is today.  It also showed that when confronted by a pandemic of this magnitude society was pretty much helpless.  That reality comes through in discussions of the flu pandemic of 1918 (for which see The Great Influenza, by John Barry) as well.  With the rise of drug resistant strains of bacteria and viruses like HIV, one wonders if society will one day once again be helpless in the face of a virulent plague.l war with the Dutch and to keep the city stable during the plague.

Using a vast repertoire of supporting data from subjects as diverse as economics and optics, he builds a very cogent case for the introduction of a new biological sense that changed all the rules for a then very ancient living world.  Although it gets a little bogged down in the discussion of shrimp, their light production and vision, the overall text is full of interesting illustrations of his thesis and conclusions to be drawn from them.<br /><br />To begin with, the author looks at what life is very probably to have been like during the Dark Ages of the Precambrian.  Professor Parker approaches the subject by suggesting that internal and external body plans have had different evolutionary histories and rates, and that the basics of internal body plan-those aspects that are not preserved well if at all in the fossil record-had already arisen during that early period of life's existence.  Those changes in structure that would require the greatest effort and the most time, were so firmly set by the end of the period that while some phyla have dropped out, no new ones have been created.  Focusing on the newer interpretations of the Ediacaran and Burgess life forms, the author believes that most of the external body plans were worm-like because there were few forces for the development of others.  While the internal structures were distinct to accommodate different niches, the externals remained unchanged.<br /><br />Everyone agrees that the efflorescence of external forms, particularly those with hard parts, after the Cambrian was both prolific and amazing.  For Darwin, who had no access to information on Precambrian life or genetics, it posed a major challenge to his theory of evolution.  It appeared as if life came diverse and fully formed out of nowhere and began to proliferate exponentially from its first appearance.  What everyone hasn't agreed on heretofore is the reason for that sudden burgeoning of body forms.<br /><br />Professor Parker takes the reader through various arguments that illustrate his thesis, namely that prior to the Cambrian it was essentially a blind world.  He suggests that prior to that point in time light could be sensed, but visual images were not possible, that neither the \\"hardware\\" nor the \\"software\\" for actual vision existed.  Without that sense predation, while it existed, was almost accidental.  Once the creation and interpretation of images was possible, vision drove the evolution of both predator and prey in an escalating manner.<br /><br />Superb reconstruction of an unusual time in life's history.everyone hasn't agreed on heretofore is the reason for that sudden burgeoning of body forms. <br /> <br />Professor Parker takes the reader through various arguments that illustrate his thesis, namely that prior to the Cambrian it was essentially a blind world.

I decided to remedy the deficiency by reading more on the topic.  Although we had a number of books on the nursing aspect of anesthesia, I found that most of them bogged me down in things I really didn't need to know to do my job.  It was interesting to learn about the demographics of PACU nurses or about the amount of space needed for each patient bed, for instance, but it wasn't really helpful.  I decided to purchase the book the resident had been reading, Anesthesia Secrets.  I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Although there is a lot of information about the field of medical anesthesia for which a nurse is not ultimately responsible, it is certainly useful to have that knowledge, as it specifically underlies patient care decisions.  It also helps make one aware of the adverse outcomes that may arise from anesthesia and what to look for to prevent them. As in ICU, perhaps even more so than in ICU, the nurse has considerable decision making autonomy, and it is important that his/her background be adequate to undertake the responsiblity.  In general, I found this book was much more pertinent to what I was actually doing in PACU than nursing books were.<br /><br />I also found the volume helpful specifically to me, as I spent about a year as the PACU's night nurse, and one of the components of my job was the scrutiny of patient labs for irregularities prior to surgery.  It helped to know those specific labs that were important to anesthesiology, what their normals were, and what lower (or higher) limits were acceptable for the OR.  Levels that might not be of over riding significance to a particular service, such as BMT for instance, might prove important to the OR and be a cause for dropping the patient from the schedule.<br /><br />Well worth the money.

Like most people, I associate John Lithgow with interesting, off-beat acting rolls: the eccentric engineer Walter Curnow in 2010, the bemused and crazed father in Harry and the Hendersons, Professor Solomon in 3rd Rock from the Sun, and the voice of Prince Charming in Shrek.  In examining his vita on-line, I find that he has had a long and varied career.  With his first book, The Remarkable Farkle McBride, Mr. Lithgow can happily add \\"children's author\\" to that vita.<br /><br />The Remarkable Farkle McBride is a delightful short story about a musically gifted child.  The style has the rhythmically catchy poetry of a Dr. Suess, but unlike the latter is grounded more in the reality of a child's world.  It reads quickly and would be a good before bed story for very young children-although I suspect you'll have to read it more than once each time to please your audience!-and a good first reading book for pre-schoolers, although it may require some explanation, since some of the vocabulary may be a bit advanced.<br /><br />The art by C. F. Payne is wonderfully whimsical.  The exaggerated facial expressions on Farkle's face are delightful, and so typical of children; it's like having a photograph of kids at their funniest and most dear.  So endearing are the sketches that I plan on keeping the book in my own collection-something I don't often do-and donating another to the hospital where I work.<br /><br />A great first book, Mr. Lithgow.	2004-08-25

His specialty is the Inca, and this volume is a cumulative description of current research on that topic.<br /><br />The Incas is a thorough description of the land and people of the region, including groups and empires that preceded the Inca.  Written sources for the information are analyzed for their contemporaneity, reliability, and bias, while archaeological data are used to clarify these accounts where possible.  The author discusses not only the rise and fall of the empire but the social order and political and religious ideology as well.<br /><br />The notes to the chapters are interesting in themselves, as they provide additional information that addresses questions that seem to arise from natural curiosity about the details of events.  My favorites had to do with the claimed ages of witnesses to events and those claimed for various emperors.  The bibliography is truly amazing and contains entries of almost every copyright date, many annotated, recently printed volumes of early explorers' accounts.  A casual perusal of the entries suggests that most of these date to 1558 and later.  Some of the secondary entries and most of the primary sources are in Spanish, although there are more than enough in English to answer to the needs of the interested.  Periodicals are a significant portion of the bibliography, however, and some of these may be difficult to find unless one has access to a large university library.  Most of the modern book entries date to the late 1970's, although some of historical interest or significance date to the earlier years of the 20th Century.<br /><br />The book is easily accessible to the average reader with an interest in Native Americans, the Incas, anthropology, archaeology, political history, social history, Spain in the New World, and cultures in conflict.	2004-08-25

Although I was not aware of it, I had also enjoyed some of his other work, like the portrait of Emilie Floge; I had simply been unaware that it was one of his products.  I am always impressed with his incredible sense of design, which to some extent reminds me of works of classic mosaic.  His use of line and especially texture, particularly where he employs gold, has the feel of ancient art.<br /><br />All these points I realized on my own, but the author Laura Payne, an Oxford PhD in 20th Century art, brought Klimt's other works and styles to my attention.  Unsurprisingly the artist was a member of a family of gold and silver engravers.  One of Klimt's brothers became a goldsmith and one a printer.  Klimt himself showed considerable talent for art and design early in his life, enrolling at 14 at the School of Arts and Krafts in Vienna, Austria.  While his early school portfolio contained works that were rather stiff although technically excellent, his later work was amazing for its breadth of style.  To study the artist's work chronologically is to follow art history from Photo Realism and Impressionism to Art Nouveau and Art Deco.  One can see influences from a veritable Who's Who of famous artists: John Singer Sargent, Beardsley, Monet, Renoir, Degas, Van Gogh, among others, yet he is nowhere a mere copyist.<br /><br />Although less well known than other artists, Klimt deserves more attention since his repertoire is sensational.  I haven't studied individual styles or artists to any great extent, but to that which I have, the only artist who comes close to Klimt's breadth is Jean Gerome, who's works are also surprising in scope.<br /><br />A very enlightening book.  One I intend to keep.	2004-08-24

The book is really rather misnamed.  If anything, while Seahenge is a captivating title, it is way too limited.  While the author discusses the wood circle at Holmes, he does so only briefly in the introduction and over a couple of chapters at the end of the book.  What the main body of the volume contains is a very pleasant recitation of a life spent working in Neolithic and Early Bronze age archaeology in England.<br /><br />For those looking for a more thorough description of the work and story of the remains at Holmes, it would probably be better to look to the journals.  A visit to the local reference library for a bibliography will probably come up with what you want, and large public and certainly most university libraries will carry many of the journal entries on your list.  These are likely to be quite technical, though, so be forewarned.  More popular accounts might be available in journals like Archaeology, Archaeology Odyssey, or Scientific American.<br /><br />Next, the positives.  And they are major positives.  First and foremost, the author has a very nice narrative style.  It's readable and friendly, and while laced with some technical terms and ideas, these are usually fully explained without being labored.  Furthermore, the author shares his knowledge of his field in practice so the reader has a first person, first hand account of an archaeologist at work.  At one point Dr. Pryor quotes from his site diary, letting one in on his personal thoughts and experiences at a crucial point of his work at Seahenge.<br /><br />Probably more than anything, the book offers a glimpse of what it means to be an archaeologist.  In particular the reader learns how one goes about acquiring ones credentials, what the management of daily routine on the site is like, under what conditions one works and lives, what job opportunities there are, and how these effect ones personal lifestyle.<br /><br />If one is inclined to follow up the information on archaeology and the archaeologist, the bibliography provides a good deal of material, some on specific topics from the journals and some on more general topics from books, most from 1980 to the present and some of historical interest from the 1960s and later.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book for a school library serving students from forth grade and later.  The book would be comprehendible to good readers of whatever age and gives a clear account of an archaeologist's life and what one has to learn to become one.nclined to follow up the information on archaeology and the archaeologist, the bibliography provides a good deal of material, some on specific topics from the journals and some on more general topics from books, most from 1980 to the present and some of historical interest from the 1960s and later. <br /> <br />I would definitely recommend this book for a school library serving students from forth grade and later.

As the author puts it himself, the funeral is not necessarily the end of the story for many historic individuals.<br /><br />To some extent the book simply makes a play to natural morbid curiosity about death and the dead.  After all who doesn't enjoy a good old fashioned ghost story now and again?  But it also  showcases the amazing hold that the people who make history have over the average person, even after the former have gone the way of all flesh.  The anger that they elicited from foiled rivals continues, as in the case of Cromwell, whose body was subjected to a belated public \\"execution\\" and whose head was kept as a souvenir for generations.  The love that they engendered continues beyond the grave, as in the case of Shelley and his wife Mary (and perhaps his friend Trewlany).  Who is not still amazed by the brilliant mind of Einstein, though he has been gone since 1955, and would not perhaps enjoy stealing a glance at the brain that once produced those amazing thoughts?<br /><br />Probably the most scandalous issue taken up by the book is the commercial value that famous dead people have.  The resting places of the likes of Daniel Boone, Buffalo Bill, Sitting Bull, Moliere and Marx have all been turned into tourist attractions and, believe it or not, some have given posthumous endorsement of eternal real estate (plots in private cemetaries)!  The fight over the remains of some of them by those who would make a profit makes for amusing reading.  The quarrels among the citizens of North Platte, Nebraska, Cody, Wyoming, and Denver, Colorado over the body of Buffalo Bill are particuly funny.  I understand that the fight between Cody and Denver has only recently been resolved.<br /><br />While the fate of the bodies and body parts of history's famous are often up for grabs, according to the author, not even cremation seems to be a safe way of avoiding the vagaries of eternity.  The misadventures of the ashes of the writers D. H. Lawarence and Dorothy Parker attest that point.<br /><br />All in all a fun and informative book.a safe way of avoiding the vagaries of eternity.

Books	5	92	105	N	Y	Superb synthesis	Although the book is mostly a review of the last 100 to 150 years of scholarship on the subject of origins, Who Were the Early Israelites and Where Did They Come From offers a fine critique for the student or interested reader.  The author, William Dever, is a professor of Near Eastern archaeology and anthropology at the University of Arizona, an institution noted for its on going work in the Middle East in collaboration with other institutions of higher learning, (including site work in Egypt under the directorship of Otto Schaden, with whom I studied Egyptian hieroglyphics years ago).  With some thirty years of experience in the field, he is able to interlace his discussion of current theories with insights of his own taken from this perspective.<br /><br />One of the points that I admire most about the book is the author's lack of rancor.  Knowing as I do that the field of Biblical studies can present a minefield of controversy to anyone who professes any point of view, and that the journals can fairly smoke with comments and counter-comments to the editor, I find his openness laudable.  The author does have his disagreements with the proponents of other theories, but he seems able to give them a fair and balanced airing and credit where credit is due.  This isn't always easy in a field where contention rules, reputation is made by going against the current, and tenure may be given to those who successfully unseat their elders.<br /><br />Part of the contention also arises from a peculiar need to justify the biblical narrative, to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that it all \\"really happened\\" and is therefore \\"true.\\"  Like proving the existence of God, this is essentially a non-question.  The religious reality of the Bible and its stories is a matter of faith; one either accepts it or doesn't according to ones own light.  To the devout, proof is unnecessary as the author himself notes in his introductory chapters.<br /><br />The modern political ramifications of Israelite origins is another embarrassing stone for the scholar to trip over, one of which Dever also makes note.  The charge that Israelite origins or even the reality of its monarchal state was a fiction created to serve the political interests of their creators, and even more inflammatory, the possible suppression of \\"Palestinian history\\" by the modern state of Israel have made the issue of \\"historic reality\\" a major political problem that is not likely to go away anytime soon.  With so much at stake both personally and nationally, any definitive statements in whatever direction are likely to be seen as an attack by someone.<br /><br />With the above caveats, I tend to agree with Professor Dever's assessment of the situation.  It seems highly probable that the later state of Israel arose from an indigenous source with small exogenous groups providing origin stories that were useful to later redactors to whose efforts we owe the modern version of the Biblical narrative.  Whatever the motivation of these latter individuals, those of the earliest population or of the early monarchy were effected by conditions current during their own time.  It is thus to these conditions and to this historical setting one must look to make sense of the record.  Dever makes it quite clear from his discussion of the local infighting presented in the Armarna texts that conditions for the average citizen were deteriorating in the area during the Late Bronze/Early Iron age.  Climate may or may not have been a factor in the Levant itself, but it most certainly had an effect on more northernly populations, since massive population movements occurred from there into the Near East.  Change was almost unavoidable.  With incursions of outsiders putting pressure on available land, increase in the number of lawless dissidents harassing the cities, quarrels between monarchs over control of their mutual boundaries, an unfair division of resources, the peasant population might well decide to cut its losses and run for it.  It might also assume to develop an identity of its own irrespective of the ultimate origins of its constituent members.<br /><br />In assessing the soundness of such a proposal, one might well benefit from the less emotionally charged example of the Anasazi origins and from research on the effects of climate on population movement and cultural change.  To begin with, David Stuart's excellent account of the effects of climate change on the rise of the corn growing cultures of the four corners region of Arizona and surrounding states, makes a good parallel.  In Anasazi America, the Professor suggests that the earliest inhabitants changed from a condition of transhumanescence to one of settled existence when climatic conditions made it necessary.  With decline in resources, cultivation of multiple areas by people who considered themselves \\"kin\\" was a good way to spread risk widely.  A need for organizing labor for water and land management probably led to a centralized authority, a class system of sorts, large scale architecture, in-group religious institutions, and an inequity in resource allocation.  When climate changed again and the privileged elite were unable to manipulate conditions by their connections with nature or their management abilities, the sparsity of resources and inequity between classes became too pronounced for the culture to endure.  The rural population disbursed.  It had nothing to lose by doing so.  Heading to the empty upland frontiers, they established architectural and technical hall marks suggestive of small family freeholds linked by obligations of shared risk, but the buildings and cultural menagerie did not arise from nothing; it arose as a derivative of what had been used in the area before.<br /><br />The topics of climate and culture and climate and the rise and fall of polities are dealt with in very clear terms by Brian Fagan in The Long Summer, Harry Thurston in Secrets of the Sands and Richardson Gill in The Great Maya Draughts.  In all four of the above books, there is ample data to support Professor Dever's thesis of an indigenous origin for the early Israelites.decide to cut its losses and run for it.

My mother was a working artist with an MA in studio arts and art education, and she had a genius for running a three ring circus in her own art classes. At any one time she could have up to two or three projects going for anything from K-12, college classes, private lessons, and special ed groups. Although she didn't actually teach me \\"art\\" her example, and encouragement, and the availability of almost every conceivable art material at home gave me an opportunity to try almost every medium. Ms Diehn is probably one of the few authors on arts and crafts that even remotely compares with my mother's influence.<br /><br /> Making Books that Fly, Fold, Wrap, Hide, Pop Up, & Turn is a marvelous example of a how-to book that not only gives one ideas but encourages one to come up with them on ones own as well. It's exuberance also encourages the learner to \\"go ahead and try it!\\" It combines information on how to do it, with history on the evolution of books and book art. The author gives simple instructions that any person who can read can understand and illustrations that are understandable enough that the pre-literate individual may put the instructions to work with only a little help.<br /><br /> More than anything the author has instilled a sense that art is a process, a fun process; it is what artists do. Like most processes, art is also something one experiences; it's a feeling. Like my mother, she shows that there are no real \\"rules\\" about what makes something a work of art; when one gets right down to it, art is just as the old hackneyed phrase has it, &quot;just what you like.&quot; There is probably nothing worse than an art teacher who disparages the creativity of the students in her charge. I have friends who refuse to do anything remotely artistic because they had an art teacher that \\"thought anything less than Rembrandt was a waste of time!\\" as one of my former roommates said. How sad. In Ms. Diehn I find an artist like my mother, who had a lovely collection of student art, someone who loves the process and is able to convey her passion to the reader.<br /><br /> I hope to make several of the ingenious little books Ms Diehn illustrates for Christmas gifts for my friends. We've all got pretty much all we want by way of material goods-and anything they might like and don't have I probably couldn't afford anyway!-so these charming books will permit me to give them something of sentimental value. We've shared a lot of years together and what better way to preserve the memories!<br /><br /> An impressive little art book.hn I find an artist like my mother, who had a lovely collection of student art, someone who loves the process and is able to convey her passion to the reader.  <br />  <br /> I hope to make several of the ingenious little books Ms Diehn illustrates for Christmas gifts for my friends.

For one thing it has a beginning, middle and end, which this type of book sometimes doesn't .  The writer also has a good sense of character, and an excellent sense of narrative.  Each of the chapters seems like a short story, complete in itself, while the collection gives the reader the complete tale of the house and its history.  Those expecting a blood chilling, creepy tale, however,  will be disappointed, since the ghosts tend to be pranksters rather than monsters.  My favorite prank is the explosive beer. In fact, I found the author's disconcertion over the haunting somewhat surprising since most of the activity in the house was hardly more challenging than a generally well behaved child's pranks.  The phenomenon generally restrained its activity on command as an obedient child might, and some of the occurrences were more designed to please and delight than to upset the family.  The tale of the rose bush was quite charming.<br /><br />A fun tale of the supernatural.	2004-07-28

Benton's text, When Life Nearly Died, is superb.  The topic of the book is the end-Permian extinction, an event less known to the average reader but of far greater impact than that of the KT boundary extinction of the dinosaurs.  Although not necessarily as emotively compelling or as dramatic as the latter, the Permian devastation left the planet with only 4-10% of its previous species.  It was a bottleneck of major consequence for subsequent biodiversity.<br /><br />I would recommend this volume to any general reader with an interest in paleontology and earth history.  The book covers the early history of geology and especially the biographies and activities of those researchers who helped define the rock sequences which every student memorizes: Precambrian, Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Tertiary.  He focuses particularly on those who clarified the facies of the Permian and Triassic and brought to light the fact that \\"something funny\\" was going on then.<br /><br />Although no real background in geology is needed to comprehend the narrative, I suspect that most will find the first chapters more interesting than later ones.  The author touches upon subjects like uniformitarianism and catastrophism and the disagreement between them and upon the scientific free-for-all that arises over new theories like the impact demise of the dinosaurs, making them quite clear for the average reader.  He subsequently builds upon the basics he has provided to carry one through his thesis.  Once he gets into the actual discussion about the causes of the Permian event, however, the discussion settles down to chemistry, especially atmospheric and oceanic chemistry: how they work, how they interact, and how they can go horribly wrong.  This may be a little tougher going for some readers.  For those expecting a definitive answer to what caused the extinction, they will be disappointed.  While there are contenders aplenty, the author honestly admits that there is not yet a clear winner and the ultimate cause may be multifacited.<br /><br />I was especially impressed by the author's ability to stay on track.  He gave a good background discussion, added some information about his own contributions, discussed the theories currently entertained by the geological community and ended with a discussion about biodiversity and human impact on the environment.  In short the book was about the Permian extinction with enough support material to help a non-professional reader understand it and was not a platform for an autobiographical ego trip.  He also gave a very clear and unbiased account of other scientists' work and how their efforts fit into the whole picture.  In short he gave credit where credit was due.<br /><br />A superb overview of the Permian extinctionre contenders aplenty, the author honestly admits that there is not yet a clear winner and the ultimate cause may be multifacited. <br /> <br />I was especially impressed by the author's ability to stay on track.

The title and cover blurb suggested it was tailor made for me.  Unfortunately I learned more about the egos of academe than I really wanted to know, and very little more about the geological theory than I had learned in Ward and Brownlee.<br /><br />It's not that I don't have an interest in the personalities of men of science and history, nor do I expect them to be less \\"human\\" and more \\"above it all\\" than other people.  Goodness knows Newton was a little crazy and more than a little petty, Di Vinci and Michelangelo were both difficult people, Pasteur was a patent scene stealer, and Tycho Brahe and Kepler both more than a little eccentric.  It all makes interesting reading and reassures one that no matter how goofy one thinks oneself to be, there are others who are far worse and even more productive despite it all!  Unfortunately Ms Walker's style is a bit \\"over the back fence\\" gossip.  She seems to have an opinion about each of the characters about whom she writes and puts that opinion front and center.  One comes away from the book wondering if the character of the players was more important to her than the subject of their discoveries and differences.  As a result, one has to really work to get the information one bought the book for.  Like Tolstoy, she exacts her price!<br /><br />I'm not too sure to whom I'd recommend the book.  I might suggest it for adolescents interested in the sciences and possibly in geology as a career, but I'm not too sure that the childish behavior of the scientists involved would be very encouraging to a young person.  It would certainly be a reality orientation though: adults, even educated ones, can act immature; field geology and geologic theory are careers for the solitary and socially inept, so there's hope for the most introverted student; to achieve in academia, one must be as competitive as a barracuda, etc.  On second thought, maybe the book isn't so good for kids.<br /><br />As far as those interested in a topic that is fairly complex, the information about geology that the author interlaces into her text is quite accurate and comprehendible to even the most uninitiated on the subject, so the theory should make abundant sense.  The book might even encourage such an individual to do a follow up on the field itself.  Certainly there are a number of books on geology and earth history on offer on the Amazon.com web site.<br /><br />For those with a background in geology and an interest in the topic of global glaciation, I think one would be better off with the journals:  Science, Geology, Scientific American, and others.  Most of these will be available in any university library, and some of them should be available in large urban libraries.  Hitting a reference section should help one to find the relevant topic and reprints are often available.dent; to achieve in academia, one must be as competitive as a barracuda, etc.  On second thought, maybe the book isn't so good for kids. <br /> <br />As far as those interested in a topic that is fairly complex, the information about geology that the author interlaces into her text is quite accurate and comprehendible to even the most uninitiated on the subject, so the theory should make abundant sense.

I also have degrees in history and a natural curiosity about the human aspect of science, but very little more is ever said about Steno in textbooks other than that he was among the first founders of the discipline.  Alan Cutler corrects that sparsity of information in his book The Seashell on the Mountaintop: How Nicolaus Steno Solved an Ancient Mystery and Created a Science of the Earth.<br /><br />Like Galileo before him, Steno?s ideas came ahead of their time and met with resistance.  Unlike the latter, however, Steno?s work was not deemed a threat to the Catholic Church which doubtless had learned through the Galileo affair that knowledge will spread despite its proscription and had come to terms with it.  Steno?s work on the geological structure of the earth and its history?even the idea that the earth had a history?presented in his opus De Solido met with greater resistance from the Protestant religions in the north, which at that time had a more literal interpretation of the Biblical texts, particularly the order of creation.<br /><br />Surprisingly it also met with skepticism from the scientific community itself.  Whereas the concepts of Galileo had been readily accepted by northern students of science, even preserved when they had been suppressed in Italy, interestingly Steno found the reverse.  He had readily found a supporter at the Medici court?incidentally the same supporters of Galileo?and found no difficulty in having his theories published.  In northern regions, however, there was a firm conviction that fossils of sea creatures found on mountain tops were simply unusual rocks.  The fact that no representative living species could be found anywhere was often stated as the basis of this belief.  Although it seems impossible that the great minds of the time were unable to accept the evidence of their own eyes with respect to these anomalous fossils, Cutler?s careful sketch of the culture of the time, its belief systems, and its stage in scientific development makes this more understandable.  As he points out the fossil evidence in the north was older and more of the fauna extinct than that in the south because glacial activity had removed the younger strata.  Even a concept of a glacial age  was a generation away and Darwinian evolution with its principles of speciation and extinction was even further in the future.  Scientists were only beginning to realize that the age of the earth was a far cry from the 6000 years it was believed to be by most of the community or even of the million or so years it was believed was possible by some.<br /><br />As a biography and tale of human interest, Steno's life is intriguing.  His life began like a dream come true.  An anatomist of astounding ability, he made major contributions to the understanding of the human body.  His knowledge and abilities were accorded great respect throughout Europe before he was twenty eight, which would be considered an early age by modern standards.  (By the standards of the time, one could easily be dead long before twenty eight.)  His later work in geology was supported by the famous Florentine rulers, the Medici, and condoned by the Roman Catholic Church.  Interesting and intriguing was his conversion from Protestantism to Catholicism, even to entering the priesthood during middle age.  His passion for the church earned him a bishopric, but his aestheticism broke his health, ultimately caused his death, but achieved him a canonization.  In all a life well and variedly lived!<br /><br />As a critique of science and its growth through time, its self-correction, and its record of both human attainment as well as human vanity, The Seashell on the Mountaintop can hardly be beaten.  It emphasizes that while scientists are humans burdened with many of the personality and social problems that other humans are, science as a discipline is subject to a constant update, evaluation, reevaluation and change that lives beyond the weaknesses and vested interests of the time.mans burdened with many of the personality and social problems that other humans are, science as a discipline is subject to a constant update, evaluation, reevaluation and change that lives beyond the weaknesses and vested interests of the time. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-07-23

Emergence: the Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities and Software by Steven Johnson is a compelling argument for higher order emergence from aggregates of lower order units.  Like Stuart Kaufman's works on self organizing criticality-though a lot more easily understood than the latter- Johnson's discourse points out that order can be produced from apparent chaos when \\"rules\\" are in place and when some critical number of individuals  interact with one another following these rules.<br />Probably one of the more interesting living systems the author discusses is the slime mold, that unique creature whose cells can act autonomously as individuals or collectively as a unified whole.  I'd heard of this phenomenon before, but at that time no underlying cause was given.  Johnson notes that their inherently human hierarchical point of view had led researchers to look for pacemaker cells that dictated when, where, and under what conditions cells would form a collective.  After years of looking, it became obvious that either no such cells existed or they were very subtly distinguished from the others.  According to the author, recent research suggests a more bottom up organization, with individual cells making local decisions about the need to collectivize and using pheromone trails to attract others to them.<br />Interesting too were the descriptions of emergent systems arising unconsciously from human interactions.  The reader interested in modern social problems might benefit from the author's discussion of current top down changes in city organization and urban design.  The anthropologist or student of mind/brain research might find his discussion of the rise in human awareness and the concept of self through so-called \\"mind reading\\" of interest.<br />For myself, as a student of history, I enjoyed some of his perspectives on the rise of cities, \\"Cities have a latent purpose as well [as a manifest purpose] to function as information storage and retrieval devices....Ideas and goods flow readily within these clusters, leading to productive cross-pollination, ensuring that good ideas don't die out in rural isolation....And the extraordinary thing again  is that this  learning emerges without anyone even being aware of it (p. 108-109).\\"<br />The changes that have occurred because of the feedback systems of the internet and the cable industry are also intriguing.  Although like many people I've surfed the Amazon.com website, received my \\"suggestions\\" for potential purchases, expressed my likes and dislikes of the various books I've read, voted for reviewers whose critiques have help my decisions, and in short become part of a community of similarly minded people, I've not thought about the overall impact that this type of system creates as it spreads to other situations.  Johnson makes some very interesting points regarding a bottom up movement in politics and the media and the loss of control by hierarchies.  Unconnected, the individual makes little difference, but connected to others of like mind by way of the internet and feed back loops, the collective has power to change a great deal.<br />Probably the most important point Johnson makes is that much of what arises from this higher order emergence is unpredictable.  It might be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; from the point of view of a single unit.  As with evolution-one of those situations where this type of action is seen-other types of emergence depend upon random decisions and actions of large numbers of individual units, be they ants, software Sims characters, or cities.  One can predict that at some critical number of units the system will go through a \\"phase transition,\\" suddenly becoming something else.  Just what else and what impact that change will have on any one individual is impossible to predict.<br />Intriguing.

I hate to admit it but it looked \\"pretty\\" and it looked \\"historical,\\" so I got it.  I also love the Japanese film classics starring Toshirô Mifune as the ultimate samurai warrior.  Many of them illustrate a combination of charm, sophistication, humor, even comedy, with violence, ruthlessness, and arrogance.  The comparative lack of graphic bloodiness tends to focus the viewer on the human dynamics and art of the situation, and while some of these classics have been translated by the Hollywood film industry for Western tastes, what transpires still has a \\"foreign\\" feel.  One sees the action and senses that something going on here is different, uncomfortable.  Upon reading a few paragraphs of the Book of Five Rings : The Classic Guide to Strategy, I understood why.<br />For one thing, I had not understood that the character in the samurai collection that Mifune had been portraying had actually been an historic individual living in a unique period of Japanese history.  Why I should have been surprised, I don't know, since the exploits of the likes of Pat Garret, Wyatt Earp, and Doc Holiday became the basis for a good deal of 19th and 20th Century pulp fiction, TV series, and movies in the United States.  In fact, the period in Japanese history that the translator describes sounds not unlike the \\"Wild West.\\"  The sod busters and the ranchers have made their peace, leaving hundreds of gunmen unemployed.  The lucky ones find work as lawmen while the unlucky wander the country looking to enhance their reputations by lethal  confrontations to see who's \\"fastest on the draw.\\"  The winner may ultimately find a job as a peace keeper; the loser finds a spot on boot hill.  In the case of the American western, the contestants use guns;  in the case of the Japanese samurai, they use swords and other equipment.  Still there seems something more to it. The something more, I think, is a philosophy, a school, an etiquette, even an art that leaves the Western mind a little uncomfortable.<br />With some of the techniques of sword work and battle strategy, I think that as Musashi himself informs the reader, it is very difficult to \\"write\\" how to do a mechanical task.  One can only convey the \\"feeling\\" that performing such a task has for the expert writer on the subject.  In modern times this facet of the learning process is overcome by photo illustrations, but even then only to a very limited extent.  As the author points out, there is no substitute for experience with the process and practice, practice, practice.  Even the very limited experience I acquired years ago when I took fencing lessons helped me picture more clearly some of the moves the author described.<br />Part of the difficulty in connecting with the author's experience as he performs the various actions of sword fighting may be that this book is a translation from the Japanese, was originally written in an older version of the language, and embodied an ancient version of the culture itself, one that is no longer available even to modern Japanese let alone a Western translator.  A warrior of Musashi's time may well have connected far better with the similes he uses than a modern person.  The unique benefit of this fact, however, is that a great deal can be read into the work.  Part of this is the author's intention, but part of it is due to the very ambiguity of the work.  Just as the author himself suggests, the reader who does not concentrate on the words but allows the mind to float over them makes all sorts of interesting discoveries.  For instance a book on dealing with problem people suggested a technique much like Musashi's \\"To Know the Times,\\" essentially to match the rhythm and intensity of the subject until one can gain control of that rhythm to de-escalate it.  His \\"To Become the Enemy\\" immediately brought to my mind the individual characters of Civil War generals Robert E. Lee and his opponent George McClelland.  As Musashi suggested, the enemy always feels he is outnumbered which means that a few may defeat many if they are trained in The Way.  Or as Lee is reputed to have said before a battle, &quot;The Army of the Potomac is a very good one, unfortunately General McClelland brought himself along.&quot;  Lee understood The Way.  He knew that McClelland's personality, or lack of The Way, produced vast armies of the enemy in his mind.<br />In all a very interesting and surprising book, one I expect to read again and again to mine for concepts.  For a slender 95 pages, the author, like a good poet, has packed each word with a maximum of information because they encapsulate concepts and principles.orge McClelland.

I don't quite know what to say about this book.  The Big One is a difficult book to put a number rating on really.  For one thing I'm not quite sure for whom it was written.  It strikes me as a \\"publish-or-perish\\" kind of production.  I enjoyed the book, but only because I enjoy anything on geology.  This said, I will point out the merits of the book from the point of various populations of readers.<br />The average adult with only the very meagerest  background, if any, in geology and natural sciences might well enjoy the book-certainly the title and the cover blurb are designed to hook in such a reader-but he/she might be better served by spending the money on a more general title, the focus of which is learning the basics of these sciences.  Certainly there are a wide number of such books out there, many of them textbooks for survey courses at the general college level.  Just searching Amazon's own list, I turned up thousands of them.<br />The authors' stated goal was to describe the New Madrid earthquakes of 1811 and 1812, and the first few chapters do an admirable job of it.  Unfortunately they tend to get off the track with their discussion of basic geology and don't return to their main topic until the end of the book where they speculate on the effects of a similar event in the future.  I had the distinct feeling that they had only a slender amount to say about New Madrid and padded the volume out with a discussion of basic geology for the beginner.  I certainly can't imagine a professional geologist reading the book when most of the information contained in it can be found with more precision and detail in professional journals.<br />Of their aim to demonstrate that the New Madrid quakes provided the impetus to the development of seismology and geology as disciplines, I'm not certain they achieved their goal.<br />While many people were interested in this event and a number of witnesses attempted to quantify as well as describe it, I'm not certain that this qualifies as any more than a minor branch root of these fields, an interesting aside.  Again, if one has an interest in the history of geology, one can find other books that will give a broader and more connected narrative of the personalities and development of this field.<br />The primary population to whom I'd wholeheartedly recommend The Big One is to libraries that provide books on scientific topics for young people.  For advanced students of middle/junior high or interested senior high, the book would be a splendid introduction to the topics of seismology and the geosciences as professions through the intriguing narrative these specific earthquakes and their effects on the people in the area.  The book is especially good because it also discusses quackery in earthquake prediction and describes specifically what can and cannot be known about seismic events.  It also defines geological terms that have come into the more ill-defined vernacular of journalism and tend to mislead.  Furthermore, it describes how such irresponsible journalism can produce public panic that can needlessly cost millions of dollars, while debate about the expense of building codes illustrates how government and science work to protect affected regions.  Young people trained to look beyond the headlines for solid information and who pay attention to the particulars of debates over codes, etc. are more likely to be sensible and responsible citizens.<br /><br />For THOSE WRITING PAPERS on geology, seismology, history, journalism, political science, and urban planning.  One might look at how the mythology of the New Madrid quakes grew from the actual events.  What human needs were met by this mythology?  What kind of distortion do you think may have occurred and why?  One might look at how interpretation of published accounts has allowed geologists to fine tune their evaluation of the New Madrid earthquakes and how they fit into plate tectonics.  Why did some earlier researchers feel some ofthe accounts were due to hysteria, while even later researchers believed them to be true.  What kinds of things were each looking at?  What data did each use to evaluate the narratives?  One might look at how governments like that of Peru got almost unavoidably carried away by the quake quackery.  Were the responses of these foreign governments any different from the responses of local governments in the US as described by the book?  What human issues underline the similarities and differences in these responses?  What suggestions, if any, would you make to avoid panic?  To what extent is journalism responsible for promoting this type of panic?  How might it be held accountable?  Can it be held accountable?  One might look at the issues of building codes in earthquake prone areas.  Do you think that California and the New Madrid area should have similar codes?  Why?  If not, how should they differ?s feel some of the accounts were due to hysteria, while even later researchers believed them to be true.  What kinds of things were each looking at?

Hanging in there, though, was worth it.  Most of the literature I've read recently has accepted the theory that species H. sapiens and its immediate Homo ancestors originated in and spread from Africa.  Although other scenarios have been proposed from time to time, the Mitochondrial Eve study topped off the debate so that it is now taken almost as a given.  What was less contentious throughout most of the discussion is the route by which the various species of our dynasty took to arrive in Europe, which was usually through the Levant to Europe and Asia. In The Real Eve Dr. Oppenheimer gives very cogent reasons for believing otherwise.<br />Following genetic studies conducted recently by a variety of researchers including himself, the author puts together for the reader an intriguing tale of a southern exodus across the Red Sea to Yemen and from there to coastal Asia, where the Beachcombers as he describes the culture, spread from India to the Americas and when climate permitted to the Levant and Europe.  What makes his theory so forceful is the interwoven elements of genetics, archaeology, paleontology, geography and paleoclimatology with which he creates it.<br />What I found most fascinating was Dr. Oppenheimer's critique of the American adversarial style of archaeological and anthropological studies.  His description of an entrenched elder generation vigorously fending off the encroachment of an energetic younger generation that is trying to make a name for itself by overturning respected theories is not far off the mark.  Reputation means academic power and control of grants and tenure.  With cut backs in government finance of education and research, these plums are harder to come by than they were, and he-and it's usually been a \\"he\\" in these situations-who controls the department controls the future of the fledgling wannabes.  I saw this type of professional skirmish in action myself while studying history some time ago.  The reader can see it in action by simply following the course of the debate over the peopling of the Americas that has occurred in the literature of the past 50 years.  Dr. Oppenheimer gives a blunt overview of it in his book.<br />What is most admirable about the discussion-despite its confusion for the lay person-is the fact that the author tends to stick with genes rather than individuals.  Other authors try to depict individuals like Oppenheimer's Nasreen or Cane as people to capture the reader's imagination.  While this is entertaining, it also creates the false idea that \\"A\\" Nasreen lived and breathed when in fact a particular gene sequence rather than a person is what is being followed.  Human beings are masses of genetic sequences which we reshuffle with each generation.  I found myself getting caught up in this mystique of an individual Eve when I first started reading literature on the subject, and it took a while to get the concept clear of personalities.

Admittedly my first scarves were trapezoidal marvels as I lost or split stitches, but I've enjoyed the hobby ever since.  Kaffe Fassett's book of designs is an incredible resource.  Not only are there useful designs for the knitter, but needlepoint, cross-stitch and other enthusiasts of handwork will also find wonderful ideas for their artwork.  I used a pattern of flowers taken from the book to design a decorative band for the front of an otherwise very plain swing coat sweater, and I have yarn now for a similar sweater using another, broader floral pattern for the lower edge of another garment.  Really, if you're tired of the routine, this book--an eye pleaser just as something to look at--will give you tons of ideas for your own designs.	2004-06-30

Maybe only a nostalgia for lost youth or something, but I have found some very enjoyable entertainment in some of those I've read recently that were not available when I was a kid myself.  The Magic Tree House series is just such.<br />I picked up Haunted Castle on Hallow's Eve as my introduction to Miss Osborne's work and was thoroughly delighted with it.  Simple and direct, it is instructive without being pedantic, and introduces new words in contexts where their meanings are apparent-or explains them when they aren't.  The story hangs together well, introducing the protagonists and some of their past exploits sufficiently to engage the reader no matter where in the series one starts.<br />I think that some of the better children's stories are written to capture the attention of adults as well.  If an adult can read them, or reread them as an adult, and not lose interest in the narrative, the book is a good one.  Children have as complex a gift for understanding plot and theme as adults do.  I think years of television have made them better at it than they were when I was a kid.  It's not the structure or complexity of the tale that loses them so much as the reading vocabulary.  Language and relationships are probably \\"hotwired\\" into humans.  The written word is something else again!  The Haunted Castle on Hallow's Eve was interesting enough to keep the reader involved with the story and working through the new vocabulary.<br />One of the most significant things about the author's work is her background in history, literature, and culture.  As she explains in the final pages of the book, she put her tale together from many sources, including English history, Welsh and Irish poetry and Celtic mythology and folk beliefs.  In looking over the titles of her other stories, I see that she and her husband have been able to weave into their children's adventure stories information about historical topics of a wide variety making learning something fun to do.  I say hooray for the Osbornes.  I expect to read some of their other books and share them with others.f a wide variety making learning something fun to do.  I say hooray for the Osbornes.

Lately I've come across an entire selection of classic literature in the Barnes-Nobel Collectors Library among which Little Women was offered.  It was so easily carried in a pocket, I decided to buy it.  I was not disappointed.  Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy are as delightful as ever.  Although I enjoyed re-reading the book in this format, I found that there were many typos and many misused words, so for student/young person's use, I'd purchase a more carefully edited book like the one above.  Also, for those of you who, as I, are also familiar with the story through the many film versions, make certain that the book you purchase includes the later story of the girls as they grow to adulthood and marry.  The small collector's library edition did not include it, and I was rather disappointed.<br />The story contains a fair number of moral lessons dealt with in a typical, heavy handed 19th Century manner, but some of the points are not out of place even today.  To those of you who might have difficulty over the frequent Christian references or with the role of women in society, I suggest that you sit down with your child and explain your family's position on the subject of religion and point out that the references are part of the history and culture of the time-it's Civil War period, 19th Century-and that people of that period would not have found the ideas unusual or unacceptable.<br />As many may know already, Louisa May Alcott was the second of four daughters of the controversial educator and transcendentalist, Amos Bronson Alcott, who believed that children should be actively involved with their learning and who founded several schools which failed to survive.  She spent her younger years in Concord where the family was friends with various writers, including Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau.  As an adult she joined Clara Barton as a nurse during the Civil War, a career cut short by typhoid contacted in the field and from the treatment of which (mercury poisoning) she never fully recovered.  Her best known works are of the March family and their domestic adventures, all loosely based upon experiences in her own family.

The Great Influenza sort of blew me away.  Like most people I've heard of the 1918 influenza, but also like most I've never actually read anything on the epidemic.  My first introduction to the topic came as a young nurse working on a neurology ward where Parkinson's Disease was diagnosed and treated.  At the time it was believed to have arisen as a late neurological response to that infection.  For all I know they may still think so.  During the swine flu epidemic and the controversy over whether the vaccine had caused a rise in the incidence of Guillian Barre, the so-called French polio, the 1918 flu was frequently mentioned.  After reading Mr. Barry's book I can certainly see why.<br />What amazes me most about the pandemic of 1918 is not its virulence so much as its repercussions.  It definitely occurred during the most inopportune time, almost proving Murphey's law that if anything can go wrong it will and at the worst possible time.  Probably one of the most significant outcomes of the flu seems to have been the effect it had on the peace terms.  One is left to wonder if Wilson had not been affected by the flu in so damaging a way and at so crucial a time, whether World War II could have been avoided.  Moreover much is made of the nihilism of the 1920s, that lost generation between the two world wars.  The young of the era seemed to have gone through a loss of innocence that is often attributed to the effects of the WWI experience and the death of the overconfident 19th century way of life.  It seems to me that far more damage to the confidence of young adults was due to the effects of the influenza epidemic.  Certainly Barry's discussion makes the character of the 1920s and 1930s much clearer to me.<br />The differential effect of the flu on the various age groups, suggests much about the effect of the virus on the immune system.  Having had to manage patients with ARDS in ICU, most of them very young people like those in 1918, I can hardly imagine what it might have been like to be a nurse during a time prior to mechanical ventilation and sophisticated drug therapy.  We lose ARDS patients with an unpleasant frequency even now.  In 1918 I don't know how one could have helped even a single patient survive it.  It had to have been appallingly painful to the staff, overworked as they were, even ill themselves as some were, to watch a patient die that way especially as the author points out again and again because so many of these patients were in the prime of life and had so much to live for yet.  I certainly know what its effect has been on me over the years.<br />Although the author attempts to reassure the reader that although we may have another similar pandemic, the outcome will be less devastating because of our modern medical facilities and experience, I can't help but think of the Titanic!  It couldn't sink, you know, because it was the product of the most modern and up to date technology of its time.  Maybe MRSA (methacillin resistant staph aureus) and VRE (vanco resistant enterococci) will be our armageddon!<br />A serious and fascinating book.

The series is almost like a cliff-hanger movie, with the characters facing an impossible and unpleasant predicament which they resolve only to find themselves faced with an uncertain future.<br />A Bad Beginning introduces the readers to the central characters, the three Baudelaire orphans Violet, Klaus and Sunny.  They are utterly charming and seem designed against stereotype.  Violet, unlike the stereotype for girls, is mathematically and mechanically inclined; she's the inventor of the three.  Klaus, unlike the stereotype for boys, is a great reader; he can learn anything from books and becomes a problem solver.  Sunny, well she's just Sunny, an adorable infant given to bitting things.<br />While the author goes to great lengths to inform the reader that the orphans have a hard time of it, the actual tale is not particularly upsetting or threatening.  Like Harry Potter, the Baudelaire children have lost their parents and are raised by family that is not necessarily pleasant.  In the latter case this is the mysterious, threatening, greedy Count Olaf.  While the book makes an effort to point out that not all of life goes smoothly, that it really is sometimes a series of unfortunate events, it emphasizes that these are problems to be solved, things from which we learn.  It also teaches that resources are available for problem solving, things like books, reliable adults, even siblings.<br />Also like the Potter series, The Series of Unfortunate Events exhibits enough plot structure, complex vocabulary, and sophisticated wit to appeal to adults as well as children.<br />One of the things I particularly like about the book is that the author provides a number of words and idiomatic expressions the meanings of which are explained partially by context and partially by outright definition.  He neither avoids using advanced vocabulary nor assumes that the reader will always figure out the words alone.  He acts as a teacher/parent who helps the learning process along.<br />A vary charming book.

Where better to start than with a book entitled, &quot;A Brief History of Canada,&quot; right? Ooooh noooo! For the person only interested in the barest facts, and those mostly involving consitutional history, this is the book for you.  It's very encyclopedic and heavily focused on how the political structure of Canada got to where it is today.  Not the meat and blood and bones of it all, not the blood, sweat, and tears; just the dull legality and &quot;who's who&quot; of it all.  If you want to know that the maritime provinces hang together in self defense and that the French and English cultures blend about as well as vinegar and oil, you've got it in Mr. Riendeau's book.  Personally I find that aspect of modern history stultifying.  Although I'm aware that Canadian history does without a Revolution or a Civil War, I can't believe there is no human drama involved.  The book is painfully dull and emotionally sterile.	2004-06-18

Although I have always enjoyed Mark Twain's work--his Diary of Adam and Eve is one of my favorites--I've never read Tom Sawyer.  Recently I found a small book from the Barnes-Nobel collector's library and decided to read it.  That particular issue is probably not the best to use, especially for a first introduction because it is badly edited and exhibits an inordinant number of spelling errors and misplaced words.  Certainly for a volume one will use for quotations in any paper one writes a better copy, like the one above, would be more desireable.<br /><br />Despite his depression in later years, Mark Twain captures the sly sense of humor and dry wit that is a characteristic of American humorous writers:  O'Henry and Will Rogers, among them.  This is well illlustrated in Tom Sawyer, a novel about being a kid, not just in the 1880s but any time.  Twain gets right into the heart and mind of childhood, it's myths, superstitions, trials and victories, even it's great philosophies:  \\"He had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it, namely, that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain (p. 25).\\"  (The latter a gloss on the whitewashing of Aunt Polly's fence.)<br />Truly a Twain and truly a joy.<br />For THOSE WRITING PAPERS: in English literature.  How might Twain stack up against a modern humorist?  What types of things make this a \\"dated\\" work?  Why does that datedness appeal to many readers.  How is Tom like modern children?  Mark Twain was an adult when he wrote the book.  Do you think that that fact makes the story less about a child and how he views the world and more about how an adult remembers being a child?  Watch a film about Tom Sawyer.  How has Hollywood reworked the story?  Does seeing some of Tom's adventures help one enjoy them more?  Or does getting \\"inside his head\\" through the book make it more enjoyable?	2004-06-18

But for what it's worth, I will anyway.  I'm afraid I wasn't particularly impressed with Marvin Monster.  I realize that wizards, witches, and monsters are all the rage, and I enjoy them as much as anyone--I enjoyed the Harry Potter series, for instance--but Marvin seems a little tepid even for young readers.  Although I can see that proper behavior with regard to peers and promises should be incalcated into the young, I suspect that even those of 6-9 might find this less appealing than the Lemony Snicket or Harry Potter series.  For the upper age range, the book might seem too patronizing while for the lower range many of the references may not make sense without the interuption of an explanation.  How many 5 or 6 year olds actually have a grasp of the superstitious beliefs behind a reference to Friday the 13th?  How many would know what a banshee is--how many adults really do?  The book is not expensive, and certainly if the parent thinks their child would enjoy it, it's fine, but I think there are better ways of spending the money for reading material and better inclusions in a child's personal library.	2004-06-18

When I ran across several books by Dan Asfar, I decided to read three of them to give me some ideas.<br />Ghost Stories of the Old West (as also Ghost Stories of the Civil War, and Haunted Highways) is in the style of recent TV series on haunting and the paranormal.  They are short, often second or third hand, and often very vague.  Many, especially those from the Civil War and early west, are more in the nature of folk tales, round-the-campfire-ghost stories, or urban legends.  Several of the latter type are stories that I have read in other anthologies, the Inn at Mile 108 which narrates the tale of a larcenous and murderous inn-keeper, being a case in point.  The only new thing introduced in this story was its setting in Canada, which information I had not heard prior to its recitation in this book.<br />In general Mr. Asfar has a good narrative style, although he does occasionally stoop to pure sentimentality, as he does in this book in The Ghost of Catherine Sutler and the Ghost of Elizabeth Polly.  He creates a mood and a history for his tales, often teaching the reader a little about the founding of some of the towns of the old west.  Some of the stories are set in places where the haunted sites are open to the public, most notably the Bird Cage Theater in Tombstone, Arizona.  It makes one want to make a special stop!<br />Although I doubt that anyone reading them will feel any great apprehension, Mr. Asfar's tales do make for a fun afternoon.	2004-06-18

When I was in Junior High--what they refer to as \\"Middle School\\" these days--we occasionally had book sales to raise funds for various projects like the Prom or the Class Trip.  One of the books I selected in those long past days was Shirley Jackson's \\"We Have Always Lived in the Castle.\\"  I was very impressed by her style.  I still am!<br />In the intervening years since high school, I took narrative writing classes to complete one of my degrees, and I can honestly say from that experience that Ms Jackson writes exactly and very successfully as they tell you how to write in such classes.  There is a novel introduction; I mean, who can fail to be captured by a paragraph that tells you the narrator should have been a \\"werewolf\\" and ends succinctly with the statement that \\"Everyone else in my family is dead (p. 1).\\"  The author builds mood and character by the use of carefully chosen words that project atmosphere, as when speaking of the village, she says, \\"The houses and the stores seemed to have been set up in contemptuous haste to provide shelter for the drab and the unpleasant (p. 9).\\"  Already we sense there's something not quite right.  Like Shakespeare's much touted Falstaff, however, the character of Uncle Julian adds a touch of levity that gives the tragedy of the story more impact.  There is a good deal of detail, but despite this the story isn't just wordy or inflated to fill the requisit 200 pages.  The detail makes the town and its residents and the two women in the \\"castle\\" much more real, and pull the reader into their story more fully than a more economical treatment would have done.<br />A thorough delight.  Miss Jackson's work still hangs together despite the years.<br />For THOSE WRITING PAPERS: in narrative writing or English composition.  Examine the book for key words that give each character their personality.  What does the author tell you without actually telling it to you outright.  Were you surprised by the revelations in the book?  Were you surprised by the outcome?  Compare writers like Edgar Allen Poe, Steven King or Peter Staub with Ms Jackson.  How are they similar?

A couple of friends at work have been urging me to read Shelby Foote's trilogy, Civil War A Narrative, for over four years now, and I finally completed the first of the three, Fort Sumpter to Perryville.  I am just as impressed as they suggested I would be.<br />Although the series is now quite old (the original copyright is 1958), it is still probably one of the best and most comprehensive descriptions of the war from beginning to end.  Foote was actually a journalist and novelist rather than an historian, but his interest in the war between the states was an over riding and life long passion.  His experience as a writer probably prepared him better for his task of presenting the conflict to the reading public than any PhD in history could ever have done.  His laid back and genteel style of address, his thorough knowledge of and apparent impartiality for both sides in the conflict, and his delightfully anecdotal approach to the subject are a pleasure to read.  I think it is telling that his is the Civil War History most often cited in the footnotes and bibliographies of other writers on the subject, even those of more recent publication.  Like the diary of the southern belle Mary Chestnut, Foote's Civil War seems to be the sine que non reference to have in ones own work.  Not taking note of it is almost to suggest ignorance of ones own topic, if not downright illiteracy!<br />Although the narrative is essentially told from the perspective of the various officers and politicians involved-often they were the same people, both an officer and a politician-the author also includes diary entries and letters from common soldiers on both sides, lending a very up close and personal sense to the events of the war.  (I remember on several occasions telling my husband that I had to \\"get back to the War, as we were about to attack Richmond!\\" or some other place.)<br /><br />My only complaint is that, at least so far, very little is made of the black experience in the war.  This may be because documents from this population are largely lacking or that mentions of black individuals in other material is often skewed, although it seems doubtful.  I know that Mary Chestnut mentions slaves and that some documentaries have quoted letters from slave/soldiers to family back home.<br />I found particularly interesting the character sketches of Lincoln and his opposite number in the Confederacy's presidency, Jefferson Davis.  Their problems were often quite similar, yet their psychological make up was so vastly different, that outcomes were often determined by this fact. It was also interesting that they had similar difficulties with their constituency, both coming under attack by the public for the way they were conducting the war and the choices of personnel they made to conduct it.<br />So impartial is the author and so respectful of the strengths of both societies and their leaders and armies, that the reader is often cheering first one side and then the other, is fearful for the well-being and fates of first one group of soldiers or individuals and then the other.  I think this reflects the ambiguity and division that was often felt even at the time, since many families had members fighting on both sides of the conflict.  Even General Lee himself had a son fighting for the Union.  It reflects, too, that the war was a conflict among a people rather than between people.  One might well still feel animosity toward the \\"other\\" side had the division remained permanent and the two remained independent countries.

From that meager background however, I found Crane's work phenomenal.  The unrealistic view of war expressed by the protagonist, his urgent desire to join in the effort to &quot;gain in the glory&quot; before it was all over, his fear that he would not measure up when the time came, even his disgust over the conditions of camp life and the apparent ineptitudes of his superiors were as though they had been harvested from the diaries of the Civil War veterans used as resources by modern historians.<br />I had read the Red Badge of Courage in high school as part of American Literature, but decided to read it again as part of my review of Civil War literature.  In school we tended to focus on the narrative as a craft, looking at color words, meaning of words in context, creation of character, etc.  Certainly in this perspective, the work is exemplray.  One of the more vivid passages describes the youth in the presence of a corpse of a fellow soldier in an arbored area after he has fled the battle field.  The tight, concise style and careful choice of words carries the main character from braggadocio to cowardice, from flight to fearless valour, from novice to veteran in under 200 pages.  Unforgettable.	2004-06-18

When I ran across several books by Dan Asfar, I decided to read three of them to give me some ideas.<br />Ghost Stories of the Civil War(as also Ghost Stories of the Old West and Haunted Highways) is in the style of recent TV series on haunting and the paranormal.  They are short, often second or third hand, and often very vague.  Many are more in the nature of folk tales or round-the-campfire-ghost stories.  Several of the latter type are stories that I have read in other anthologies, the Beauregard-Keyes House, an old mansion in New Orleans once owned by Confederate General Beauregard, being a case in point.  In this account, however, the author gives a more plausible reason for the haunting of a private home by an entire Civil War battle that had been fought several hundred miles away from the house!<br />In general Mr. Asfar has a good narrative style, and although he does occasionally stoop to pure sentimentality, in this book he does so less often.  Many of the stories are recounted to him by people who believe they actually saw ghosts of soldiers of the Civil War.  He creates a mood and a history for his tales, often teaching the reader a little about the War.  The hauntings at Andersonville and Johnson's Island are cases in point.  Anyone interested in Civil War History knows about these two infamous prison sites, one Northern and one Southern, where so many men suffered and died.<br />Although I doubt that anyone reading them will feel any great apprehension, Mr. Asfar's tales do make for a fun afternoon.	2004-06-18

Both the Edicarian and the Burgess Shale fauna are discussed extensively as are stromatolites, as one would expect, since these are the primary fossil and trace fossil representations of the biota of the period.  The limitations of this material, and the rarity of fossilization of animals without hard body parts is also pointed out to the reader.  In particular, the difficulty of positively identifying remains of early life is pointed out by the primary author who himself misidentified a geological phenomenon for a biological one. The likelihood that there existed a long era of evolution prior to the apparent \\"explosion\\" in the Cambrian is discussed as is the chemical and geological evidence for such precursors.<br />While the book by J. William Schopf, Cradle of Life : The Discovery of Earth's Earliest Fossils, is more current and goes into greater detail about the discovery of early life, what forms evidence takes, how it can be mistaken, what information is derived from study of the remains, and what indirect evidence tells us about the early earth, it might be a little too much information for those who are only casually interested in the topic of fossils.  The McMenamin book might be a better place to begin, while the Schopf book would be a good follow-up for those who want more information.	2004-05-04

The long stretches of sea wall, the pretty beaches-Agami Beach is like fine granulated sugar-and the museums were a delight.  Little did I know that under the pavement beneath my feet lay hidden wonderful relics of Ptolemaic Egypt waiting for discovery.  At the time I was there the city was a thriving, growing community but had yet to expand even to the full size of the ancient site.  There were a few monuments from antiquity-Pompey's Pillar, the Serapeum, etc-most of them misidentified, but most of the site was much more recent.<br />In Alexandria Rediscovered Jean-Yves Empereur introduces the reader to the newest archaeological finds.  Expansion of the modern city and its infrastructure into and beyond the boundaries of the old settlement over the past two decades involved him in emergency excavation projects to reclaim or at least document the finds uncovered by developers.  In addition, recent discoveries in the harbor have helped illuminate the Ptolemaic period lighthouse, palaces, and government buildings, including those of the famous Cleopatra.  The author, an expert in underwater archeology helped document and reclaim some of the finds.<br />Complimented by the beautiful photographs of Stephane Compoint, the folio sized book gives the reader an extraordinary view of the new discoveries.  My favorites are the incredible illustrations of the catacombs and of the even more fascinating cisterns and underground canals of the city's ancient water system.  Considerable document research from the early Islamic and early colonial periods helped to identify some of these sites and to map the extent and workings of the water system.<br />This is probably not the book for someone looking for detail on Cleopatra or the Ptolemies or on the Greco-Roman era in Egypt.  The volume dedicates itself, as it title implies, simply to new archaeological discoveries and touches more on the history of the archaeology of the area than upon the history of its founders.  For those who want to know more about the city and its archaeology or for those planning a trip to Alexandria, this would make a very nice starting point for learning more about the area.he volume dedicates itself, as it title implies, simply to new archaeological discoveries and touches more on the history of the archaeology of the area than upon the history of its founders.

I wasn't sure I'd really get into this book when I first started it, but I was hooked almost immediately.  What an incredible and complex individual!<br />The Last Alchemist:  Count Cagliostro, Master of Magic in the Age of Reason by Iain McCalman is a remarkable biography of what amounted to a world class con-artist.  What makes him such an enigmatic individual is the fact that he was not simply a sociopath, but exhibited a compassion for the poor that endeared him to many.  From the point of view of history, as I've often said before, one often learns more from fringe figures and marginal places about periods in history than one does from those on center stage.  The story of Count Cagliostro confirms once again that belief.<br />Although the author, and in fact many of the Count's contemporaries, credit him with \\"causing\\" the French Revolution and other disastrous events, I would say that he was more a symptom of the times than the cause of their events.  This is in fact the stance of at least one of the author's sources as well.<br />The world of the 18th Century was one of transition (although one could plausibly argue that this is true of every age!).  The highly centralized, aristocratic and tyrannical political systems of the time were gradually being confronted with issues and intellectual concepts with which they were unprepared to deal.  The Catholic church, the other major political player, had been playing a losing game with science,  intellectualism, and protestantism for well over two centuries, and had retreated to the old stand by of incarcerating its enemies when they presented the opportunity.  The arbitrary abuse of individual rights, the desperate poverty of the bulk of the European population, the marginal existence that was reality for even the middle class in times of economic down turn, made it obvious that changes were well overdue.  This was the age of the philosophers of the American and French revolutions, of Paine, Voltaire, Hume, Rousseau and others whose literary support of human rights and of elected self government created a foment of intellectual unrest that ultimately produced much of what we consider to be the \\"modern\\" way of life.<br />The selfish, greedy and often foolish individuals in positions of power and privilege made ready targets for someone of the Count's talent and predilections.  It is no accident that this was also the period of Casanova and Jeane de Mott, and other major imposters.  Concerned only with personal vanity, accumulation of wealth and power, in short with the status quo at all levels, the wealthy of Europe were easy prey for someone with promises of physical youth and increased sexual prowess, with unlimited wealth and personal power, and with immortality.  If it had not been so tragic in other ways, the tales of some of these people and their encounters with the Count would have made wonderful comedy.  It is no wonder that the Count and his exploits provided creative people with plots for opera and story-both Mozart's Die Zauberflote (the Magic Flute) and Goethe's Fauste were based on the Count's exploits.<br />Born Giuseppe Balsamo in Palermo, Sicily the self-styled Count Alessandro de Cagliostro, aka Colonel Joseph Pellegrini, was no stranger to the abject poverty of some of the poorer people he helped treat as a healer.  He grew tough and morally elastic surviving a childhood in the competitive environment of Italy.  His fortune was made when his mother's family attempted to educate him and prepare him for a life dedicated to the church.  Obviously bright, a quick learner, artistically gifted, and probably the possessor of a photographic memory, Giuseppe turned his hand to preying on the wealthy by appealing to their greed since it provided him with a lifestyle as affluent as that of his \\"clients.\\"<br />What I found most interesting was the man's ability to land on his feet with almost every set back.  The story of his legal fight with Jeane De Mott over the Diamond Necklace affair was amazing.  I also found the rapidity with which his reputation as a mountbank caught up with him surprising.  One would have thought that in an age innocent of telegraphy, the telephone, radio, television, airplanes, computers and the like, that such an individual could disappear by simply changing his name or even by simply moving.  It seemed that this was not the case, and even at this time, those who wanted to know more about the man could \\"dig up the dirt\\" with a little guesswork and research!  Part of this was no doubt the fact that the man traveled in a rarified society, that of the very wealthy and influential.  This class of people was very small and often known to one another, even occasionally related to one another, which made knowledge of the man's previous activities easier to transmit from one venue to another.<br />An amazing book.<br />For THOSE WRITING PAPERS: in history, sociology, psychology, anthropology, speech/communications, philosophy, political science, church history.  Did this man play a pivotal part in the revolutions that swept through Europe during the latter part of his life?  When he predicted the fall of the French throne, do you think he was politically astute, psychic, just vindictive?  How did this man reflect his society?  What social situations lead to the formation of many such individuals of this type?  What personal characteristics did the man have that made him more successful than many others?  What social situations during the period produced personalities of this type?  Would the Count have been just as sociopathic even had the social environment been different?  Why did so many people, like Seraphina, ultimately go along with his plans?  What changes if any did the treatment of the Count during the last months of his life bring about in the Catholic church?  What types of persuasion techniques did the Count use to influence his targets?  Are some of these same techniques used successfully today on us?  Who uses them?

Not long ago I reviewed a book on Alfred Russell Wallace, In Darwin's Shadow, where I suggested that Wallace's life had probably been a happier one.  A reader of that review suggested that this was not necessarily the case, and suggested that I do further research on Darwin's personal life.  When I discovered the book Darwin, his Daughter, and Human Evolution by Randal Keynes, a descendant of both Charles Darwin (who was his great-great grandfather) and the economist John Maynard Keynes, I felt that I had found a gold mine.  Privileged to the access to family documents and memoirs, Keynes was able to do a very thorough work on the private life of the Darwin family, and a creditable discussion of the effect of Darwin's experiences as a husband and father on his theory of evolution.<br />Above all the book is a charming visit to the Victorian era and a lovely story of a devoted family of that time.  The more tragic events that occurred in the Darwin household were not unknown to many families up and down the social scale.  The loss of their second child shortly after birth, the death of the ten year old Annie, the birth and death of a Downe's syndrome child later in their life, were all events that occurred in other households as well.  Probably more unusual was the closeness of the husband and wife, and the involvement of Darwin with the upbringing of his children, although these aspects are similar to those of the lives of Queen Victoria and her husband, Prince Albert.  One wonders if these situations were just unusual or if one has a skewed sense of family in the Victorian age.<br />Above all, the intense observations Darwin made of his growing children and the sometimes painful conclusions with respect to evolutionary theory that these studies reinforced were surprising to me.  I would tend to agree with the author that his family did have a profound impact on Darwin's theories.<br />I thank the individual who suggested further research on Darwin and his personal history.<br />For THOSE WRITING PAPERS: in biography, history, evolution studies, sociology.

The author combines an interesting psychological account of her own pursuit of danger and excitement, a sense of mystery and suspense, a wonderful almost playful sense of humor, and a gift for story telling that makes the book hard to put down.<br />Her discussion of the history of ghost hunting, the individuals involved in it, their various styles of research--tarot reading, mediumism, electronic and photographic equipment, etc.--and their personalities make the book almost a textbook on the subject.  The theories of what produces ghostly phenomena are discussed by each of the individuals with whom the author interacts, so that the reader learns a lot about what is believed about the subject.  I was a little disappointed, however, that the author did not interact with or discuss in more detail the work of Hans Holzer, a name with which anyone with any knowledge about the subject would be familiar.<br />For those who want to follow up on the subject, the author provides an in situ bibliography, citing a number of authors and their book titles throughout the text.  She also provides a fairly detailed formal bibliography with very current entries, mostly from the 1990's, although some as old as the 1970's.  In addition there are a number of resources provided for the reader to follow up if desired, including addresses and websites for some of the authorities she had occasion to consult and the addresses, email addresses and phone numbers of various haunted places to visit or to spend a night.<br />Although I found the resolution of the mystery of Christian somewhat disappointing, I found Ms Ramsland's critique of the subject of ghost hunting a very objective one, far more so than I would have expected.  Since I'd love to write ghost stories (fictional) myself, I found her discussion of the equipment very interesting and useful (I've bookmarked some of these pages for future use!)<br />A very intelligent and gifted lady.  Probably someone it would be fun to know.<br />For THOSE WRITING PAPERS in literature, history, sociology, psychology, anthropology, physics: this book would make a fun resource and starting point.  One might, for instance, write a paper on how this type of book bridges the gap between narrative and expository prose.  Is this a \\"story\\" or a research paper?  What aspects of both give it an arresting character.  How does history become folklorized by tales of ghosts and hauntings?  What function does the ghost story have for group cohesion, for reinforcing group values, etc.  How might one explain ghosts as a social or a psychological phenomenon?  Why do even people who \\"don't believe in ghosts\\" often still have difficulty with cemeteries, haunted houses, and the like?  Is there something evolutionarily beneficial to a fear of or veneration of the dead?  The author mentions the Skeptical Enquirer, a journal dedicated to debunking beliefs in ghosts, extra terrestrials, and other phenomenon.

It was mentioned in an encyclopedic work by Hans Holzer, and I decided to follow it up out of curiosity.<br />Ms Mercado, if her vita is to be believed, is a well educated individual who works in a very demanding field-ER nursing at a trauma center-which expects practical, level headedness in emergencies.  I would therefore expect her to be observant, calm in intense situations, and critical enough not to jump to conclusions without proper reflection.  Her discussion of the events that occurred over a 12 year period and affected her family in major ways, is thorough and open.<br />I found her efforts to understand the phenomenon, even to the point of taking a class on the subject, impressive.  The number of people who could corroborate these experiences was also impressive.  It would be interesting to have a book by one of these individuals.<br />I would love to write fictional ghost stories myself, and it was interesting to dissect this tale for points that made it both believable and scary, ie) the characters are real, they invite sympathy and support, the house has an interesting character and history, there are specific places that are haunted and others that are &quot;safe,&quot; there is a stop-start character to the phenomenon--ala Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds--there is a mystery to be solved, experts to be consulted, a resolution to the mystery and to the haunting, and a happily ever after ending.  I liked it.	2004-04-27

Books	5	6	7	N	N	A charming introduction to therapy dogs for children	So dear!<br />I was \\"raised\\" by Siamese, but about 9 years ago I got my first dog, a Great Dane named Courageous.  He has since passed to doggie heaven and two new dogs, Tempo and Scherazadh, also Great Danes, have taken their place in our hearts and home.  It has been my wish to train one of them to be a therapy dog since I first saw the effect of a visit by such a dog to my ICU unit several years ago.  Like the heroine dog, Lady, in the book this dog was very well trained, very friendly, and was an instant success.  The patient had suffered a self-inflicted gun shot wound to the face and was VERY depressed, but the dog was able to connect in a way and to such a degree I had seldom seen in the past.  I was very impressed.  Unfortunately I have been unable to get my pets to the level of behavior that the dog I met or the dog Lady acheieved.<br />The book shows the importance of early training for dogs, significant even for a family pet who doesn't go on to be a therapy dog, and of the involvement of the owner with the animal.  One doesn't just with provid food and shelter, one must devote time to them as well.  Sometimes people who want to owe a dog forget that they need more attention than a cat or a bird.  They don't realize that a dog is a member of the family, and one that needs a lot of attention.<br />The book also provides names, addresses and web sites of non-profit organizations that provide further information about therapy dogs for those individuals who would like to learn more about them or to learn about programs for training them.  This is a significant addition, especially for the student who may like to write a report on training animals, on the jobs that working animals do, and on animals and people.<br />The reading level of the book is that of about a 1st or 2nd grade level or for precocious younger readers, but it would also make a good \\"read to me\\" book for younger pre-readers.<br />A very charming addition to any child's personal library or to a public or school library.to a public or school library.	2004-04-20

Faster than the Speed of Light is a semi-autobiographical account of the author's work on the theory of the variable speed of light (VSL), a controversial theory that attempts to address some of the \\"Big Bang riddles\\" for which the inflationary theory has failed to account.<br />Unfortunately the largest portion of the text is dedicated to an excoriation of academic bureaucracy, peer-reviewed journals, and \\"senescent\\" senior scientists who according to the writer discourage new innovation by forcing young hopefuls into the old, accepted mold under threat of non-tenure.  While I have no doubt that his indignation is justified, I still found his invective somewhat juvenile and at times bordering on the libelous.  One has the distinct impression of a youngster stamping his feet in outrage.  His comments on individual scientists were very ungraceful.  Though unnamed, these people are probably identifiable to anyone familiar with the author, the venue of his work and the individuals with whom he has been associated.  One has the feeling that Dr. Magueijo is intellectually precocious but socially delayed.  I suspect that unless he tones down his angry young man act, he will continue to [fight] with the establishment and have to fight for every inch he gains.  Surely this can be no better for the furtherance of scientific discovery than the closed mindedness of his mentors!  While the author does make his awareness of these behaviors and his appreciation of his peers known by the end of the book, I wonder how many will have set the book aside long before they reach that point.<br />The account is full of vignettes of the author's life, many of them having little to do with the new cosmological theory that he proposes.  In part this seems to be an attempt to give the reader some insight into the creative mind of the physicist, in part to create a bond with the reader.  In general by the middle of the book, if it didn't have anything to do with the VSL theory, I skipped over it.  I suspect many would have set the book aside before then, but I was determined to find out something about VSL of which I have only recently become aware.<br />I also found it annoying to find that almost the entire first half of the book was dedicated to yet another discussion, albeit a less respectful one, of Einstein and his theories.  Again the reader is treated to a \\"novel\\" means of explaining relativity and general relativity to the beginner.  I've gotten so I read them  now just to see to what extremes authors have to go to be \\"original\\" with respect to this topic. This time its jumping cows with their heads through an electrified fence.<br />These complaints having been stated, I will say that I appreciated the author's clear and concise discussion of the riddles of the big bang:  the horizon problem, the homogeneity issue, events before the Planck time, the cosmological constant, in essence all those theoretical problems that have yet to be resolved to explain why we see what we do in space.  His outline of the VSL theory--minus all the personal invective and reminiscence--and its ability to explain them was particularly lucid, as were his short discussions of string and loop theories.<br />As contentious and uncertain as the field of cosmology is these days--in all days, I suppose--the VSL theory does seem to be one that can be subjected to field observation and has met with some verification recently.  As the author states, some of the astronomical findings made during his years of work on the theory and on getting it into publication have suggested that the speed of light did vary early in the history of the universe.  Just recently, some findings on quasars also seem to support the theory.  It will be interesting to watch the cosmological scene to see how the various theories fair in the future.<br />An interesting topic, but the author needed to stick to the title subject more.ook, if it didn't have anything to do with the VSL theory, I skipped over it.

The Long Summer:  How Climate Changed Civilization is another of Brian Fagan's volumes on the interaction of climate and human history.  (Others I have read are the Little Ice Age:  How Climate Made History, 1300-1850, and Floods, Famines and Emperors:  El Nino and the Fate of Civilizations).  As with the others, this book chronicles the changes in climate throughout the globe and notes the changes effected in the human condition.  Whether there is actually a direct correlation between the two or not it would be difficult to really prove since historic events are nonrepeatable, but the frequency with which major changes in human behavior have occurred when climate has shifted is certainly very suggestive.  Like most such claims, however, there is probably more to the reality of the situation than is apparent from this distance.  His topic, however, is not without significance for our own world, so I highly recommend reading it!<br />The author discusses El Nino, the Southern Oscillation, and the Gulf Stream &quot;conveyor belt&quot; and the effects of the introduction of increased fresh, cold water into it as he does in his other books.  A more complete discussion of these phenomena was given in Little Ice Age, however, so if the reader is a little confused by the more limited introduction in this book or is simply curious about them, he/she should definitely read LIA for clarification.<br />Some of the author's points were not new to me.  In particular I had read a collection of articles on the concept of human evolution as driven by continental drift and its effect on the Gulf Stream and climate.  I have also recently read a book (Secrets of the Sands:  The Revelations of Egypt's Everlasting Oasis), which discusses climate change and lifestyle, in this instance that in Egypt and its Oases.  The theory that the invasions of the Sea Peoples into Asia Minor, the Levant and Egypt were climate driven had been discussed as early as the '60s and '70s.  Other points were probably predictable but had never occurred to me, for instance that the attacks on settled societies by desert invaders were driven by the desperate living conditions of the latter with a major dry spell.  Most of the history of the ancient near east is studied from the perspective of the city dwellers, the marginal populations being treated as &quot;unfortunate&quot; intrusions which brought collapse.  One almost gets a sense that they did so arbitrarily just to be difficult!<br />An interesting book.  It might provide something of a background for courses on ancient civilization.  Certainly it would make the ebb and flow of nomadic populations and their impact on the settled societies they boardered more sensible.<br />For those WRITING PAPERS in history, climatology, sociology, and political science:  one might look at the effects of climate on ancient societies and predict the likely outcome of a similar down turn on today's populations.  Look at writers like Per Bak (How Nature Works:  the Science of Self-Organized Criticality), whose studies of sentinel events suggests that every possible event will ultimately occur with a different probability and at unpredictable times, or Stuart Kaufman (At Home in the Universe:  The Search for Laws of Self-Organization and Complexity) whose work suggests that such events actually help increase organization.

While her correspondence with her father figures prominently throughout the book and details of her life factor into the story, the book is largely a biography of her father, the preeminent Renaissance physicist and astronomer, Italian Galileo Galillei.<br />Dava Sobel manages to capture her subject from a more intimate prospective than many biographers by using correspondence, mainly that from his daughter Virginia (later Sister Maria Celeste) to illuminate the more personal aspects of his life.  None of the great man's own letters to his daughter remain--the author opines this was because the sister was not allowed to possess anything and such letters might therefore have been destroyed or removed to another location--so his replies are unknown except through references made to them by the sister.<br />The details of Galileo's life as a youth and as a scientist were known to me to some limited degree through other reading and by means of a play based on his life that I attended at the Children's Theater here in Minneapolis, but the author's book more clearly develops the scientist's life as a family man, devout Catholic, and confidant of the world's contemporary intelligentsia.<br />For me the most interesting aspect of Galileo's story is still the ordeal he was subjected to as a result of his astronomical observations and beliefs.  The author makes it much more obvious that this was no insignificant event in the scientist's life, using Sister Maria Celeste's letters to illuminate the precariousness of the scientist's political situtation and health.<br />She also makes it clearer that much of the issue was inspired by political events outside of the country that impacted the Roman Catholic Church and its hierarchy, which is something of which I had been unaware.  Having undergone an earlier losing confrontation with the inquisition, the scientist had actually discussed his proposed scientific play with the Pope and had submitted the manuscript to not one but two official scrutinies.  He had made the changes they required and gone to press, when enemies within the religious and academic communities, both in Italy and abroad, conspired to ruin him by bringing charges of heresy against him.<br />At this time, Pope Urban VIII was involved in an expensive war with various political entities in Europe over the control of the Holy Roman Empire and over the issue of Protestantism in the contended territory.  His capacity to &quot;protect the faith&quot; was being called into question by the discontented in Italy who were being pressed to finance the furtherance of the war, and he needed to prove to them that he could in fact stand firm on religious questions.  Galileo managed to get in the way, just at that point in history. Urban, who was himself scientifically inclined and fairly open minded, was also an astute politician caught between a rock and a hard place.  Ultimately he had to have known that what was being discovered by the world's scientists would be proven fact in the end and could not be indefinitely supressed.  He was probably aware as well that the heresy of which Galileo's work was accused was more of a literary technicality than anything.  But he also had to protect his reputation and that of the church in order to maintain its integrity as an institution during a difficult time.<br />To his credit and that of his peers, up until Urban's time much of science had been speculation and philosophy and &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;reality&quot; were defined by the reputation and status of the proponent of the theory and not by objective data.  Equipment used to quantify scientific proposals was just only beginning to be invented during Urban and Galileo's lifetimes and was very new, untested, and not widely understood.  The telescope, microscope, thermometer, and barometer were all devised at this time.  Furthermore, many charlatans had used mechanical devicesto defraud and delude their victims.  That one might look through a telescope like Galileo's and see exotic and unexpected things that might well prove to be untrue, seemed entirely logical given the status of science and culture at the time.<br />An interesting book on an interesting topic and an interesting time in history.vices to defraud and delude their victims.

Although I found The Birth of the Mind by Gary Marcus to be a very well written book, I don't think that the author has added anything significantly new.  Anyone who has read Penrose, Pinker or Dawkins is pretty much aware of the theory of mind as emergent property of brain function.  Anyone who has kept abreast of research in genetics is aware that most of what we are as biological beings is dictated by our DNA.  That the brain and the mind are part of that is hardly a surprise either.  Of Dr. Marcus's illustrations of physical and cognitive dysfunction drawn from neurology and neurophysiology, few were new and most have been discussed in far greater detail in other volumes, the best known probably being Oliver Sac's The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat.<br /> What the author does do is put all of the most recent work together in a very cogent and readable manner for the average reader on the subject.  His friendly, chatty writing style makes the subject very accessible.  A youthful Associate Professor in the department of psychology at NYU, with a primary research focus in the brain and the mind in cognitive psychology, he is well placed to pull recent and germane literature together.  For anyone who has read very little about the topic but who wishes to get a well rounded idea of the subject, this is a good place to start.  It's current and well written even if the conclusions are not especially new.<br />For THOSE WRITING TERM PAPERS in psychology, history of science,or philosophy, this book might provide you with a large, very current collection of sources from which to begin your own literature search.  Most of them come from 1995-2002.  Among the list of periodicals are journals like the American Journal of Human Genetics, Brain Research, Cognition, Journal of Comparative Neurology, Journal of Neurobiological Science, Nature, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science USA, and Science.  Some of these, like Science and Nature, will be readily available in most college libraries and even some local public libraries, while others will only be available at large university, especially those associated with medical schools.le in most college libraries and even some local public libraries, while others will only be available at large university, especially those associated with medical schools.	2004-03-06

I have to admit that I rarely read narrative prose, but the love of a good murder mystery is my &quot;guilty secret.&quot; I enjoy the puzzle that this type of fiction poses for the reader, and the more literate the author, the cleverer his design, the more I enjoy the experience.  This one was a rare treat.  Not only does the author present a stylishly crafted crime novel, he also creates a series of cryptic word puzzles based on history that engages of the reader's own knowledge base.  Since I also enjoy history, he definitely had me riveted.  I read the book from cover to cover in a few short hours in one sitting.  While some of the characters were a little two dimensional, and I had already solved the identity of the &quot;villain&quot; well before the end, the author's competent style and the secondary story buried in the Da Vinci code itself, so thoroughly  captivated me that I was not disappointed in the least.  Furthermore, I'm going right out and find out more about the Knights Templar and Mary Magdalene! An amazing book.	2004-03-06

I've no doubt that Mr. Barbour knows what he's talking about, but I have to admit that I got thoroughly lost on more than one occasion.  Just when I thought I had the thread of his argument pinned down, he embarked on a new more arcane path, and I was lost again.  I have to admit I am not really a math-physics type person, but I do read a fair amount of literature for amateurs on the topic of theoretical physics, and time is one of those subjects that intrigues me the most.  I'm not quite sure for whom the book is intended either, because although it lost me as a neophyte, I can't imagine that it would hold the attention of someone well grounded and/or professionally involved in physics; it has too many words and too few mathematical formulae.  In all though, I found the concept of time as a, more or less, static collection of instants all shuffled together like playing cards or like the frames of a 35mm film strip a provocative one.  I just can't help feeling, though, that there is something significant missing in the author's argument.  I'm sure he would insist that it is just the overwhelming psychological experience of time &quot;flowing&quot; that is throwing me off, but when I think of his perspective on time and history, I find the only way it makes sense is if I stand outside of the system to see how it might work.  I find it difficult to see how the information about past experiences can be passed on to my memory in any given instant without some sort of connection between all the instants of which &quot;I&quot; am a part.  That however would make consciousness a unique and special entity, which I find difficult to accept.  Although consciousness has sometimes been claimed to be a factor in generating Newtonian reality from quantum &quot;observations,&quot; I think there has been sufficient discussion that refutes it.  Again, I found the book way over my head, but I hope to reread it on another occasion with hope of achieving better understanding.

While I admit it's a captivating title, Love and Madness goes little beyond tabloid speculation in its investigation of the murder of Martha Ray in the 18th Century.  Set in the midst of a fascinating political and social era, the book should have filled in a lot more gaps than it does.<br />An apparent celebrated crime of passion, much is made of the young man's utter desolation over the lady's death, of his willingness to die for his crime, of his total infatuation with his victim and of his completely unrealistic expectations with regard to their relationship.  Meanwhile, despite the author's professed concern that the victim herself received little attention or sympathy during her time, he too focuses more on the prominent males of the era and on the pathetic condition of the perpetrator of the murder.  He gives a slight nod to the lady's ability to hold her own in a class where she was neither accepted nor treated with civility, but one feels that a lot more might have been said.  Given the power of mistresses in the English and French courts of the time, it's difficult to believe that the lady had no impact on the decisions of the day.<br />Martha Ray was the mistress of a powerful governmental figure, the Earl of Sandwich, who as Minister of the Admiralty figured prominently in George III's conflicts with the American revolutionaries.  This was the world of William Pitt and Samuel Johnson, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, James Boswell and the Fielding brothers, a raucous world with one foot in the risque and boisterous past of the 17th century and one in the buttoned up world of the upcoming Victorian England of the 19th century.  Though she was perhaps a peripheral character in the ongoing events of the time, Ms Ray's was a story that might well have cast considerable light on these transitions.  Almost in passing does one learn of the status of women at the time, about society's expectations of class behaviors, misbehaviors and interactions, about the avenues for advancement of the average person, about how individuals fit into world events etc.<br />In reading Mr. Levy's book it would be difficult to say whether Ms Ray was a victim of society, a major player in affairs of state, whether she was happy or not.  Certainly she seems to have been a competent individual in so far as one has any access to her personal life.  Since the author makes use of most of the documentation available from the time: biographies, letters, newspapers, diaries, one must assume that there is simply little more than bare detail known about the woman, her life, influence and the events of her death.  Since the Earl himself fell into disgrace not long thereafter and fades into obscurity, one can only wonder if Martha's death was part of a plot to damage an unpopular bureaucrat.  It certainly seems odd that the murderer could grab hold of the woman's skirt, draw two pistols--both of which would have to be manually cocked to fire them--and manage to fire one fatally at her and the other at himself.  Something doesn't quite ring true.<br />Seems like a missed chance to me.<br />For those WRITING PAPERS in:  English or 18th Century world history, sociology, anthropology, political science, or women's studies:  How might the biography of a woman such as Martha Ray illuminate some of the social and political events of her time in a way that those of more prominent individuals might obscure or miss?  What was the status of women during her time?  How did it compare with earlier times (think of pre-Roman and post-Roman times as well as Anglo Saxon and Norman Britain)?  Later times (think of Victorian, Edwardian and Modern England)?  What kinds of political clout did mistresses of important individuals exert on the politics of the day?  Might this be considered an avenue of professional advancement for a bright and capable individual for whom other avenues were essentially closed?  Could such a person actually have more latitude for expression of power as an &quot;outsider&quot; of upper class society than mainstream individuals might?  What happened to children of such individuals (you might look at the lives of Juan, Cesare and Lucetcia Borgia among others)?  What impact did they have on society?

Lately I've been thinking about starting my own e-business.  To that end I decided to study up on the composition of web pages, so that I might create one for myself and provide my own upkeep thereafter.<br />In reading up on web businesses Dreamweaver was one of several programs suggested for the purpose of efficient web page design.  I consulted my husband--the family computer guru--about it, and he said it was probably the best program I could get.  When I worried that it might be more than I could handle, his reply? &quot;You're the smartest person I know.  Believe me, you can do this.&quot;  While I appreciated his whole-hearted support, I have to admit I was still a little apprehensive.  Before I purchased an expense piece of software, I decided to get the H.O.T  Dreamweaver book by Green and Rudner to help me learn it.  I found it splendidly lucid.  I read the book cover to cover, visualizing the steps with the illustrations provided in the text, then began the programmed learning CD.  It was marvelously simple, mostly cut and paste, drag and click.  I also liked the advantage of being able to look behind the scenes to learn the HTML that makes the whole thing work.<br />There is a large caveat to the situation, however, mainly that as pointed out by other reviewers you eventually have to have files of your own with which to complete your ultimate goal.  That will involve you in learning other programs like Adobe Photoshop, Flash, or others with which you can create these files.  Furthermore, these programs require even more artistic talent, scope, patience and diligence than the Dreamweaver program does.  For me, that fact suggests more fun things to learn.  For others it may be a major pain and one more hurtle to leap on the way to doing what they really want to do.  If you find yourself in the latter group, I'd find a professional web page designer to take the problem off your shoulders.  If you're like me and enjoy learning new things, especially new media of expression, then this is the program for you.  It's a nifty experience.like me and enjoy learning new things, especially new media of expression, then this is the program for you.  It's a nifty experience.	2004-03-05

I have to admit that although I have a master's degree in history, my major focus has always been ancient history, particularly ancient Near Eastern history (I was one of those people who felt that &quot;modern history&quot; meant everything after 1200 BC.--yes, BC.).  Only just lately have I begun to follow up intriguing trails through other periods.  Some time ago, I began to realize that one could really gain incredible insight into the events of an era by studying peripherals:  the history of countries peripheral to the main stage, side issues like trade, crafts, and long distance contacts, and the women and others behind the main historical figures, etc.  Jerrold Packard's book Victoria's Daughters seemed to be just the book I needed to learn about a period in time about which I knew next to nothing, the late 19th Century.<br />At first it seemed as though the book would be more about Queen Victoria herself than about her daughters.  As I read on, though, I realized that the oddity of Victoria's succession to the throne had much to do with the lives of her daughters, as did her early life and her own upbringing.  Furthermore, it is against her long life and protracted reign that not only the events in her daughters' lives were measured and chronicled but those of most of the lives of the world's population.  There was a reason that most of the 19th Century was labeled &quot;the Victorian era!&quot;<br />In the past I had given very little thought about the connections that existed throughout European history or about what actually brought about the events that occurred during the turn of the century.  I knew of course that the Tsarina of Russia was &quot;Victoria's granddaughter&quot; and a &quot;Prussian princess,&quot; but I hardly gave thought to what that really meant.  Nicholas and Alexandra were charismatic historical figures in their own right.  They were a fairy tale couple, much in love, with a cozy little family living the life of a Russian folktale, and their poetic tale came to a tragic but colorful and certainly very memorable finish.  End of story, or so it seemed to me.  One knows about World War I, I suppose, and all the people that died in trenches of disease and exposure and mustard gas and enemy fire.  One has heard of Bismark and Wilhelm II and Lord Mountbattan, but they're all just interesting names, names one memorizes to answer our world history tests, right?  Not when one reads Mr. Packard's story of the children of Queen Victoria.<br />Each of the daughters, Victoria, Alice, Helena, Louise, and Beatrice had a unique relationship with their mother.  Because of whom and what she was, Victoria's was not a particularly warm and maternal presence in their lives.  When she was a presence at all, she was distant, self-centered, imperious, and controlling.  Unfortunately some of this early relationship translated into problems with parent-child interactions when the girls had children of their own.  Lest anyone think that women do not have an impact on the course of history because they don't lead armies into battle--often anyway--one only need read about the relationships between some of these women and their children.  That between Victoria, &quot;Vicky,&quot; and her eldest son, Willy--later Wilhelm II--will quickly disabuse one of the notion.<br />Furthermore, the five girls were married into some of the key families of Europe.  The titles of each and their in-laws read like a who's who of European nobility, and their sons and daughters became kings, queens, and dukes, many of whom ended up on opposite sides of wars in Europe during the late 19th and early 20th century.  The tangled web of personal relationships, treaties, and ambitions ultimately brought about World War I.<br />I was especially entranced with the intimate detail woven into the stories of each of the women.  The author mined diaries, extensive familycorrespondence, and biographies written about each to create very personal characterizations.  The reader becomes as engaged in the story of their lives as in those of fictional characters; one just does feels connected.<br />FOR THOSE WRITING PAPERS:  in history, anthropology, political science, sociology.  One might use this book to discuss the limitations of women of the upper classes at the time and their effects on history.  One might look at individuals like Alice, who became a follower of the practices of Florence Nightengale, or her sister Louise, who was an accomplished and professional sculptor, who attempted to break out of the social mold of the time to create an identity and existence of their own.  What types of role models did they make for others?  What changes did they bring about in society?  How did they set the stage for our own era?  Might the events of WWI been less likely to have happened if the relationships between countries had been based on less personal grounds?

Adrian Tinniswood has an undergraduate degree in history and a master's in literature and is a respected journalist.  From the extensive bibliography for By Permission of Heaven, one can see that his training in historical research has enabled him to dig a first rate story out of historical archives, while his training in literature produced a riveting tale.  The True Story of the Great Fire of London reads like a novel.  Tinniswood's effective mining of his sources has paid dividends in the creation of historical characters at least as engaging as those of fictional works, and these individuals are set in the dramatic setting of the fire and its aftermath.  The author chronicles the birth and progress of the fire, its amazing destructiveness with little fatality, and its effects on later London and English society.  Adding excitement to the story is the fact that, unlike the Chicago fire which was almost as devistating, the London event was set in the midst of war with another country and the very real fear of invasion.<br />At the end of the book I felt like there should be more story to read and began to cast about for biographies and other historical works on 17th Century England.  What more can one ask from a good book?<br />FOR THOSE WRITING PAPERS IN HISTORY, ANTHROPOLOGY, OR SOCIOLOGY:  One might write a comparison of the Chicago fire and the London fire using the author as a resource.  How were they different?  What types of political factors in both made the situation better or worse for either?  What kinds of social factors entered into these situations if any?  Why were there so few fatalities during the London fire?  How did things change for the working class after the fire?  Why?  Could either fire have been prevented?  Why were these cities particularly vulnerable?  Were they more vulnerable than other cities of the time or just unlucky?  Could Per Bak (How Nature Works:  The Science of Self Organized Criticality) or similar authors on the subject of criticality have predicted these events?  What would they say about them?  Are cities still as vulnerable to fire today despite our better preventive and fire fighting measures?  Under what circumstances might such a fire occur today?

An exciting and thorough book.<br />Once upon a time, a long time ago, I was asked to go along as expedition nurse on a field survey of the Qatarah Depression in Egypt.  A friend with her PhD in history and another with a PhD in linguistics had come to the conclusion that the hieroglyphics of Crete and Egypt might have originated in the Western Desert.  Computer research into both scripts suggested a relationship with Berber, the language of a nomadic tribe in North Africa.  Because oil reseachers in the area had reported finding large amounts of pottery in the field and nomads generally don't burden themselves with heavy ceramics, my friends decided to do a surface survey for material that might support their thesis.  They believed that the area had once been a very large fresh water lake in prehistoric times and might well have sustained a sizeable settled population.  Unfortunately at the time, the US government had decided to cut back funding to many research projects, and my friends were unable to find financial support.  End of saga.  Reading Thurston's Island of the Blessed is a wonderful chance to see with what major discoveries I might have been involved had things been different!  I can only say, \\"congratulations\\" to the sensible Canadians and their government.<br />Island of the Blessed by Harry Thurston is a particularly interesting document, because it chronicles not only the discovery of a long lost culture--actually severa--but because it covers an almost continuous record of habitation in the Dakhleh oasis, an area blessed with a continuous source of water.  The association of climate change and human and other biological response is documented in these material remains through over 8000 years.  Important too is the author's conclusion that man-wrought changes in the environment have caused major problems in the past and look to be shaping up to bring on even greater catastrophe in the future.  His very brief discussion of irrigation cultures and their effect on the environment is very sobering, especially given the statistics of world population and dependence on irrigation agriculture.<br />Again history and archaeology prove their worth to the modern world.<br />FOR THOSE OF YOU WRITING PAPERS:  in history, archaeology, sociology, cultural anthropology, biology, geology, climatology, political science, and economics.  This book shows an interesting use of history, anthropology, archaeology, and environmental biology/climatology as applied to modern day issues.  Is this a valid assumption?  Does the past predict what the future may be like?  Why or why not?  How does this new field data compare with that found by other authors, like David E. Stuart (Anasazi America) or Richardson Benedict Gill (The Great Maya Droughts:  Water, Life and Death).  Which author would agree with Thurston's position?

I am surprised at how much has been learned about the early phases of life's development since I last formally studied paleontology.  One of my favorite areas of study was invertebrate and early life forms.  At the time only a modest amount was known about stromatalites and cyanobacteria.  The trace fossils of the soft bodied, multicellular, Ediacaran fauna were known but were considered &quot;late&quot; in geologic and biologic terms.  The Burgess Shale community, made famous by Gould's &quot;Wonderful Life&quot; in the late '80s, was known, but the organisms were confusing and many have since been restudied and reclassified.  Having been a leading actor in the field of microfossils and early bacterial life forms, Schopf  puts everything into perspective in his book, making it virtually a history of research into the topic of life's beginnings.<br />Cradle of Life begins, as such books so often do, with a brief synopsis of Darwin and his theory of evolution, including most critically, its early problems.  Thereafter Schopf begins a veritable &quot;who's who&quot; of early paleontology, giving short professional biographies of those who worked in the field as early as the 19th century.  He points out where promising leads were suppressed by virtue of the lesser standing of the individual proposing them, and misleading theories given credence because they were proposed by someone of powerful academic credentials.  Some of the tales are impressive object lessons in how things can go wrong for human reasons and why science ultimately &quot;gets it right in the end.&quot;<br />One of the more interesting topics the author confronts is how our recent advances in the field of paleontology might help determine whether life exists or has ever existed elsewhere.  The author provides an interesting perspective on the Mars meteorite &quot;life forms&quot; that shows how easily it is to be lead astray by high hopes, and how space research scientists can benefit by a familiarity with modern precepts applicable to early life studies on this planet.<br />The book goes into great detail about the discovery of early life, what forms evidence takes, how it can be mistaken, what information is derived from study of the remains, and what indirect evidence tells us about the early earth.  It also discusses how life might have evolved from non-life, how it managed to get started so early, how the atmosphere changed and how that change affected the diversity of earth's biomass.  For those who are only casually interested in the topic of fossils, this book might be a little too much information.  I love this kind of stuff, but I could certainly see how others might find it incredibly boring.  I doubt that those in junior high would find it rewarding, but those in senior high might have enough science background to understand and enjoy it.  Certainly for anyone fascinated with science and by how paleontology works, this book will be right up your alley.<br />FOR THOSE WRITING PAPERS:  in paleontology, biochemistry, biology, evolution, and history of science, this book would make an excellent bibliographic entry as well as a good source of topics.  One might discuss how science works, how &quot;authority figures&quot; can derail even the best ideas, how science like other human endeavors are affected by culture, expectations, what is &quot;known&quot; already, etc., how progress in technology has allowed us to learn more about the distant past, how the tendency to specialize can delay progress, how a recent trend toward consilience (for which see Consilience:  The Unity of Knowledge by E. O. Wilson) might lead to more rapid advances in science.  One might compare the work by Nick Lane (see Oxygen: The Molecule that made the World) or by G.

Nick Lane's book, Oxygen The Molecule that made the World, is a surprising volume.  It mixes organic and inorganic chemistry with evolutionary studies, paleontology, research medicine, and even a little engineering to explain how the world got to be as it is.  The first half of the book is dedicated to what our early atmosphere was like and how it changed as a result of biological activity.  It also discusses how the evolving atmosphere, particularly the presence of oxygen, affected the complexity of early life and the sudden flourish of biological diversity after the Precambrian.  The last half of the volume deals with the recent research on free radicals and their effect on health and on the phenomena of aging and of immortality.<br />Doctor Lane's own background is in biochemistry, and his research focus has been on oxygen free radicals and metabolic function in organ transplants.  Not surprisingly he went into some detail about the free radical cascade that affects cellular metabolism and DNA integrity.  I found this somewhat difficult to understand as I have only a very rudimentary grounding in organic chemistry.  Still I have to admit that I know somewhat more about the process than I did before reading this book.<br />Probably because I know significantly more about geology and paleontology, I enjoyed more fully the author's synthesis and analysis of what we know of the geological and biological development of our atmosphere and our planet.  Some of this material was familiar to me from other sources:  Certainly that O2 can actually be a \\"poison\\" I know from managing patients with ARDS (adult respiratory distress syndrome) on mechanical ventilators with 100% O2; that the earth went through a series of green house earth/snowball earth phases early in its history I had learned from Ward and Brownlee's book Rare Earth; that life had begun almost as early as it was able and much earlier than had been previously believed, I was aware of from works by Gould, Schopf, and others; and that the mitochondria may once have been free-living, aerobic organisms that formed a symbiotic relationship with anaerobic organisms was known to me from my past exposure to microbiology in a nursing class.<br />  New to me however, was the concept that gigantism may have been a means of limiting the negative effects of a periodic increase in oxygen in the environment, as Dr. Lane suggests in his chapter on The Bolsover Dragonfly.  Although I had read an article that suggested that the immense sizes achieved by some of the dinosaur species might have been due to a higher percent of O2 at the time, I had also understood that it was because oxygen was a \\"good\\" thing, an opportunity of sorts.  Lane points out that the negative effects of oxygen on tissues and DNA through the free radical cascade might have been ameliorated by an increased size.  An animal--or one presumes also a plant--that increased its size might have been able to distribute negative effects over a greater body mass.  One wonders if the rise of the mammalian mega fauna of the ice ages and their sudden almost catastrophic disappearance might not also have been due to some temporary fluxuation in the oxygen level of their atmosphere.  (In which case the early Native Americans could be once and for all exonerated of having liquidated them, since their demise would have been dictated by a return to a baseline oxygen level!)  If this were the case, one might also question what type of changes might be expected among our own kind as a result of such an increase and decrease of atmospheric oxygen.<br />  I found the doctor's ideas on the trade off between sexual reproduction and immortality a unique approach to the topic of aging.  Some of this information--the studies of animal reproduction rates, predation, and age at death, for instance--was known to me.  Dr. Lane's discussion brought it together in a much more complete way.<br />Certainly the concept of sexual reproduction being one of life's mechanisms of perpetuating the fragile, complex organic molecules (DNA) in an oxidative environment was interesting.  I had read Ridley's proposal that sexual reproduction evolved as a means of resisting bacterial infection, but Lane's suggests why it began as early as the DNA swapping behavior among early single eukaryotic cells.  That the massive increase in biological diversity was an indirect product of the release of oxygen into the atmosphere, is truly an amazing thought.  In the event as Lane makes claim in his subtitle, oxygen was truly \\"The Molecule that made the World.\\"duction being one of life's mechanisms of perpetuating the fragile, complex organic molecules (DNA) in an oxidative environment was interesting.

Composed of a selection of short stories first published in Fate Magazine, the book is very well written.  While it isn't King or Straub, it isn't intended to be either.  The tales hold the reader's attention to the end, and charm by virtue of they're being &quot;real&quot; experiences.  Since the book is a collection of southern stories, the book is divided into Southern states, with two and more selections for each.  Those coming from one of these states should find them especially fun to read.  Some of the tales are legends, some approach folk tale status, and some are reported by those who purportedly experienced what they believed to be true paranormal events.  Enjoyable.<br />FOR THOSE WRITING PAPERS FOR ENGLISH LIT OR ENGLISH COMP, SOCIOLOGY OR ANTHROPOLOGY:<br />You might consider how these tales blur the line between narrative and expository prose,  ie.) fiction like that of King or Straub and serious study or research.  You might compare these ghost stories with those of Hans Holzer, whose style is more like that of a scientist (in fact, I believe he is a physicist).  You might critique the style of the stories: what makes one story seem like a true event, while another seems more like a folk tale.  How might you write a fictional story that took on the character of a &quot;true&quot; narative, ie.) what are the components of &quot;real events.&quot; You might consider what function such stories have had--even still may have--for the individuals that tell them or communities in which they are repeated.	2004-01-03

The narrative style is that of short vignettes arranged in chapters by subject:  haunted houses, people, theaters, and restaurants, and mysterious phenomenon.

This assessment is based primarily on what I've learned myself about diets over the course of several years of patient care and of trying to bring my own weight under control.<br />Like most of those who have reviewed Arthur Agatston's book, I too have tried most of the diets that have come down the road and found them distinctly wanting.  I was quite pleased by the author's discussion of the data underlying these diets and of  that which refutes their effectiveness.  As he points out in the introductory chapters, information about nutrition, like other scientific endeavors, changes continually over time.  That's because science is an on-going activity that self corrects--I recall one scientist who said that it was every scientist's unhappy fate to eventually be proven wrong.  This is a difficult concept for many laymen to accept--difficult even for some scientists.  Because nutrition like medical science is interested in the betterment of the lives of contemporary people, the research data and the theories it engenders are put into practice as soon as possible, and it is only with time that the results of these practices, good or bad, become apparent.  So it is with diets like those suggested by the American Heart Association, the Pritkins, the Adkins, and the Ornishs.  Dr. Agatston is fully aware of that fact, whether his readers are or not.  As he points out, Dr Ornish has modified his theories to accommodate the data.  That's because they are scientists--and more important MDs--and they move forward as needed for the betterment of their patients, some of whom are only patients by proxy, by way of the written word.<br />One of the things I liked most about the author's current attempt to help others is his honesty with respect to the value of the efforts of his predecessors.  He doesn't make currency of their failures to better his own standing in the nutritional world.  He takes the useful information from these early efforts and adds his own to them.  In short he avoids throwing out the baby with the bath water, as the old saying goes.  He's being a scientist.<br />I also believe Agatston when he states that his primary interest is entirely in the well being of his patient's coronaries, not in their personal appearance or vanity.  He views the improved self esteem that may arise from losing a few pounds as a perk that enhances the likelihood of his patients' follow through and thereby of an improvement in their lab values.  I believe this because he's a cardiologist and that's their thing.  When he says he's happy that so many people have jumped on the bandwagon for their own reasons, I suspect he's happy that they will also decrease their likelihood of developing coronary artery disease--again also because he's a cardiologist and that's their thing!<br />As far as the actual content of the diet goes, I felt that the avoidance of concentrated sugars and refined starches was a good idea, and I approved the reintroduction of low glycemic index vegetables, something which the Adkins in particular had forbidden.<br />Although I tried the diet myself, I found that I felt somewhat unwell by the third day.  The doctor indicates that this is to be expected as the body gets used to the changes.  Like one or two of the other reviewers, I too suffered from headaches and a general mild nausea.  Both of these factors made it difficult to remain faithful to the diet beyond the fifth day.  I will say, however, that a friend of mine, whose weight was nearing 250 pounds and had begun to affect her physical well being profoundly (and to the point where she said thought she would be the first of our circle of friends to die!), had no trouble with the diet, did in fact loose some 30 pounds in four months and was thoroughly pleased with her results.  What I personally intend to do about my symptoms is to return milk to my diet but to stick to proteins and low GI vegetables, in short to move into Phase II sooner.<br />As with any project like this, one should probably consult ones physician for advice.  For some people, there might be medical reasons not to pursue this type of weight loss program.  Your MD will be able to assist you in this regard.  Again, as with any medication, weight loss program or other activity that affects your health, if you feel that your response is negative, you should probably heed those feelings and discontinue or alter the diet.  In any case, good luck with your resolution to lose weight and improve your health.turn milk to my diet but to stick to proteins and low GI vegetables, in short to move into Phase II sooner.  <br />As with any project like this, one should probably consult ones physician for advice.

What it really intends is to show how science discovers how things work--or in this case fail to work--in human anatomy-physiology.<br />Now that the human genome project has crunched out the raw data on what our DNA code is, it has become the far more daunting task of biologists to figure out what it says and how it works.  The best way to do that would be to screw up specific sites on the gene and see what happens.  This is how they learn what the DNA of lower orders does, but humans aren't like fruit flies; we don't live our lives in a matter of days.  Nor are we like amoeba or worms; our genetics are much more complicated and the interactions among them probably orders of magnitude greater than those for the &quot;simpler&quot; animals.  Most important, screwing up the genetics of a human subject is not exactly, ethically or morally speaking, a good place to go!  That leaves us with natural genetic failures, those individuals who have suffered genetic misprints that can lead to clues about what normal DNA does.  This is what chapter one explains in some detail.<br />The remaining chapters illustrate what is learned from specific mutations:  twinning, how and from what parts of the body arise, how things grow, how gender develops, how skin differences occurs, and why aging happens.<br />Since many of the mutant individuals discussed are historic figures, some of the bibliographic entries are quite old.  While there are some books, most of the entries are those of modern scientific journals:  American Journal of Medicine, Annals of Human Biology, Developmental Biology, Nature, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Science, etc.  Most of these are very current, many from the late 1990s.  For the interested follower of the subject, some of these might be difficult to find unless there is a university library at your disposal.<br />FOR THOSE WRITING PAPERS:  IN SCIENCE OR IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE:  The book might illustrate how scientists can approach a problem without offending the ethics of the society of which it is a part.  One might also check some of the old texts to find material that would illustrate other types of genetic problems and describe how this might be of help to geneticists.

Over the past four or five years, however, I have been branching out more.  Of late in particular I have been filling in what I learned of English history in a survey course I took years ago.  I've read some on Richard III, on Edward I, II, III, and IV and on Edward the Black Prince.  I've followed up on King Harold and his &quot;difference of opinion&quot; with William of Normandy, etc.<br />In reading some of these works, I find that I've learned only tangentially anything about the women of these episodes. When I came upon a reference to David Baldwin's book on Elizabeth Woodville Mother of the Princes in the Tower, my curiosity was immediately aroused, and I decided to find out something more about one of these women in the background, to see what part they actually played in the drama of their times.<br />Like most people interested in English history, I know the Shakespeare Richard III and the story of the little princes in the tower.  Having read some of the history of the period, I realized too that the queen was not well liked by many of the more influential and established nobility of her husband's realm.  These individuals tended to depict her as a small town upstart who capitalized on her personal beauty to better all of the members of her family at the expense of the &quot;legitimate&quot; nobility.  This set the stage for a very shaky government; one tested more than once by the disaffected, and created the drama of the Tower and of Richard III.  Baldwin gets at the character of Elizabeth by looking at the extant documents of the time and by analyzing how the woman fit into the on going politics of her husband's reign rather than by following the contemporary accounts circulated by the woman's detractors.<br />I was particularly fascinated by the degree to which each phase of English history links naturally with its predecessor and its successor--not that this is particularly surprising perhaps.  Some of the histories of other countries have far more discrete hiatuses between phases.  This flow is particularly noticeable when it is viewed from the perspective of Elizabeth Woodville and her family.  The royal genetics of the period was definitely convoluted.  It was amazing how interrelated were not only the branches of the royal family with one another but with some of the nobility as well.  (Looking at other genealogies reveals the degree to which the nobility of most of Europe were interrelated.)  That &quot;six degrees of separation&quot; thing was definitely in operation here and pushed to the limit.  It left the possibility of Elizabeth's either mending the rift between the houses of Lancaster and York, which is what the author theorizes was the intention of Edward IV, or exacerbating it.  It also left a lot of people with a potential claim on the throne and with incentive to cause trouble--which is how the rift began in the first place.  The chain continues into the future through the connection of the Tudors with the ultimate patriarch, Edward III. Elizabeth, her daughter--mother of Henry VIII--and her two sons help complete that link.  Fascinating.<br />FOR THOSE WRITING PAPERS IN HISTORY, HISTRIOGRAPHY, SOCIOLOGY, POLITICAL SCIENCES, WOMENS' STUDIES:  One might look at how documents like accounts can be used to clarify lifestyles (clothing, expenses for servants, etc), status, power structures, etc or to write a biography such as this one.  One might write a paper on the use of power by women in history, on how women acquire power within a society or at what the study of women and other &quot;background&quot; figures reveal about events during a particular episode in time.  One might compare less favorable studies of Elizabeth Woodville with this one to determine to what extent the author's assessment of her reign is accurate.  One might look at the story of the princes in the tower asit is told in Shakespeare--or Josephine Tey's novel Daughter of Time--and as it is presented in Baldwin's biography of Elizabeth to determine who might actually have committed the murders.<br />A fun biography of an interesting womanower as it is told in Shakespeare--or Josephine Tey's novel Daughter of Time--and as it is presented in Baldwin's biography of Elizabeth to determine who might actually have committed the murders.  <br />A fun biography of an interesting woman	2004-01-02

The implications of Professor Stuart's analysis of the Chaco Canyon and later Pueblo cultures in Anasazi America blows one away.  Certainly some of the social data from our own culture and time period, which he uses for comparison, are scary!  The book has a very interesting concept, namely that we can apply what we know of modern economics to the ancient world and what we discover of economic outcomes in the ancient world to our own.  While I'm none too certain this is a valid premise, it certainly made for interesting reading!  I am by no means an expert in prehistoric Southwestern America, but I have done some reading on the subject, and I can't recall when I've read a volume that made so much sense of the mystery of the collapse of ancient indigenous culture<br />Unlike many students of ancient history and culture, this author does not stop with a simple description of the data or the sequence of events.  He extrapolates principles relevant to all cultures, including our own.  Most authors on the American Southwest make much of the climate changes which made life in the area nearly impossible;  Stuart's  analysis of this data and of the timing of the furious building activity that occurred toward the end of the phase uses economic principals and modern sociology.  This technique makes the period come alive.  Stuart points out that all human behavior is motivated, and motivated not just by basic biological needs but by social and cultural needs and expectations as well.  Stuart uses evidence of violence, even of possible cannibalism that occurred as a climax to the period to understand the implications of decline, violence and collapse on the evolution or extinction of a society. He also applies what he discovers of human behavior in this setting to what he sees as occurring in our own culture.  As middle and lower socio-economic classes feel more and more disenfranchised,  modern society is facing a possible withdrawal from its principles and leadership.<br />Some of Stuart's summary of the succession of cultures in New Mexico and the Four Corner's region are arguably speculative. The assumptions he makes about why people did things-like move away from their homes and property-so long as they relate to such factors as climate, infant and maternal mortality rates, nutrition and malnutrition, etc. seem quite sound.  When it comes to less quantifiable issues-like personal values, the sense of community among society's constituency, religious intent, etc,-his observations, while certainly very credible, are also not testable.<br />With these caveats in mind, the reader will discover through this discourse that our own lifestyle as it is currently practiced, may not be indefinitely sustainable.  The US might well be facing a cultural disintegration not unlike that of the Anasazi.  If the social statistics in the author's final analysis are correct, and they certainly seem reliable to me, the effects of our rather profligate style of consumerism are already producing negative outcomes for a significant portion of the US population.  We may share more in common with the ancient Anasazi than we realize.  We may evolve into a more sustainable society as the Pueblo people did, or we may go extinct as the Anasazi people did.<br />As the author points out in his introduction, the book arose as the result of a very favorably received classroom style that stressed the relationship between economics and social cohesion, using archeology as the medium of introduction.  In doing so the professor made his specialty relevant to the lives of his students in a way that inspired them.  It inspired me too.  Unmentioned by the author is the fact that much of our culture is shared by the world, and while the third world may not be politically incorporated into the US or into the privileged portion of the world, it is definitely part of the globalized culture that has arisen as a result of more rapid communication and transportation.It is not inconceivable that the collapse that Stuart envisions for the US cultural milieu might actually extend to the world.  It gives one pause to think.<br />This book could and probably should be included in the reading lists of courses in economics, cultural anthropology, history, sociology, and political science.  It might be useful in high school classes that include any or all of these topics.  FOR THOSE WRITING PAPERS: this book shows an intersting use of history, anthropology and archaeology as applied to modern day problems.  One might find it profitable to: 1) contest the author's conclusions with your own ideas or with quotes from other authors, 2) agree with his conclusions and say why in your own experience you believe what he says, 3) compair his assumptions with someone more versed specifically in economics or sociology than the author is, 4) check his sources to see if you can find errors in his data or in his use of it or to suggest a different interpretation of the date or a different use of it , 5) write a paper on whether or not you believe that it is valid to use anthropological or historical data in this way.n.

Essentially it's a much more readable version of Cunliffe's book Facing the Ocean, and the reader of the latter will find familiar passages throughout the volume.  While the focus and time period of Facing the Ocean is much broader than that of The ExtraordinaryVoyage, the narrower time period of the latter makes the ancient world come more alive for the reader.<br />On the Ocean, written by the fourth century B.C. explorer Pytheas of  Massalia (modern day Marseille in France) is itself lost to modern day scholarship, but it does exist in short excerpts found in the works of later authors.  Professor Cunliffe is both an archaeologist as well as an historian of the period and is able to use his understanding of the cultural remains of the period and of the region in which Pytheas traveled  to verify many of the traditions surrounding the great adventurer's voyage.  In essence, he uses both Pytheas and his travels to create the structure and theme of his own work on life and trade along the Atlantic coasts during the fourth century.<br />For those with a general knowledge of Greco-Roman history, this book adds detail to the image of the ancient world.  Many of the more general texts of the period, while discussing the colonization period of ancient Greece, fail to really give more than a gloss-over of the cultural phenomenon that restructured the Mediterranean world and led to the more widely known events of the Roman Republic and Imperial periods, with its cast of characters made popular in literary form from  Shakespeare's Anthony and Cleopatra and Julius Caesar  to Ridley Scott's Gladiator.  The book takes the reader to the ends of the earth from the point of view of the contemporary Mediterranean world and provides a personality whose adventures match those of the great explorers of the fourteenth and fifteenth century A.D.<br />The book is brief and concise, and would be understandable to most readers from junior high level and beyond with an interest in history.  The bibliography contains a number of references that would provide further reading sources.  Most of these are a little old, 1893-1994, and some are in French or German, but several of the general sources are more recent and in English.century A.D.    <br />The book is brief and concise, and would be understandable to most readers from junior high level and beyond with an interest in history.

897263:US	50669529	R3I77OWYUYE2SA	0195148304	704635275	In Darwin's Shadow: The Life and Science of Alfred Russel Wallace: A Biographical Study on the Psychology of History	Books	4	5	8	N	Y	In the shadow no longer	Alfred Russel Wallace seems to rate hardly more than a footnote in the history of the theory of evolution.  Like most who have studied this subject, I knew of Wallace's mutual discovery of the theory and evidence in support of it. I knew too of Darwin's generous introduction of the man as a co-discoverer, and even of the theory that that introduction might have been more premeditated and less generous that it appears.  In some of my reading I had even learned of Wallace's \\"defection\\" to spiritualism.  However, where Darwin's life is everywhere paraphrased and his thoughts on the subject of evolution almost subject to canonization, Wallace's life and thoughts seemed just to have \\"fallen out\\" of the picture.  Michael Shermer's book, In Darwin's Shadow, The Life and Science of Alfred Russel Wallace, provides a more detailed look at Wallace the man and scientist.  It also looks at the subject of how history and biography reflects the psychology of their time-in some ways, he does so unintentionally.<br />In many ways A. R. Wallace, though not a formally educated man, was more of a research scientist than Darwin.  He apparently plunged into the pursuit of regional studies with a vengeance for most of his youth, some twelve years abroad, studying natural subjects in their native habitat.  Whether it was beetles in the tropics, indigenous people in their native and in their European dominated settings, the communities of animals characteristic of different regions in Southeast Asia, or the geology of various regions, etc, his studies were extensive and detailed.  According to Shermer, he logged in over 20,000 miles on various collecting trips, and just on his Malay trip collected almost 125,000 specimens, over a thousand of which were new species (p. 14).<br />His reputation for openness and exposure to new experiences was amazing, especially for the day, and recognized even by those who did not necessarily agree with his opinions.  His written output was prolific and varied, with topics ranging from ancient history, animal behavior, botany, ethics, history of science, linguistics, plurality of worlds, phrenology, spirtualism, taxonomy, womens rights, agricultural economics, literature and poetry, poor laws, and trade regulation (p. 15).  Shermer indicates that even into old age Wallace wrote on a variety of subjects and had a life-time average output that ranks high, even when compared to modern writers like Gould, Sagan, and Ernst Mayr.<br />While I found Shermer's historical matrix model interesting, I felt that I learned more about how history and biography are created in our own time and what it says about us than I did about Wallace or his contemporaries.  The matrix model seems to smack of psychobabble and Oprah \\"awarenesses\\" and introduces a lot of introspection into the possible effects of birth order, etc. on behavior.  It tries to hard to get at the \\"whys?\\" of human behavior and motivation for which there is little proof for or against.  It was only once the author got into the life and times of the man himself that I could more easily settle into Wallace's world.  For one thing, I understood better what the flap about the man's delving into spiritualism was all about.  I also learned where Wallace and Darwin differed, even from the beginning, in their own individual approach to evolution, and why Darwinian evolution is the model that gained the greatest respect and serves as the foundation of modern theories.<br />I think more than anything, the book introduces the reader to the fact that science is a communal thing, a human thing, and is subject to the vicissitudes of other human endeavors: chance, political and social prejudices, personalities and egos, readiness for new ideas, plain old mistakes, etc.  I learned again that scientific discoveries occur in tandem, when the world is ready to receive them, that they're sort of \\"in the air.\\"  I learned that more than one person can come up with the same or similar idea, putting their own personal stamp on the concept, thereby forwarding human knowledge just a little bit more.  I learned that scientists can be wrong or partly wrong about their topic and can be wrong or partly wrong about topics outside their expertise, and most importantly, that reputation should not be given total credence without proper thought.  Because a person is famous does not mean that their opinions are any more valid than anyone else's.<br />An enlightening biography of an interesting man.  While I think that Darwin's is the more carefully thought out and supported theory of evolution, I think that Wallace was the more interesting and happier person.

It sounds like a Victorian Thriller, and coming from well known mystery author Patricia Cornwell, one might expect it to be one.  What it is, however, is an extremely well researched study of an artist, Walter Sickert, whom the author believes to have been the Whitechapel serial killer, Jack the Ripper.  It comes close to the \\"more than I wanted to know\\" category at times, but the detailed discussion of what is known of the victims' lives and last activities is a poignant social description.  The manner of their deaths seems to add insult to injury, and probably seemed as much to the socially conscious of the time.  The author herself suggests that the miserable conditions of the slums of London came into the limelight in a way that they never had before, bringing them to the attention of the public and perhaps paving the way for social change that gathered momentum in the early twentieth century.<br />The story is a chilling review of the evidence from the police, public document, newspaper, and family files of the period and an application of modern forensics techniques to them.  As the author states, there is no statute of limitations on murder, and although all of the characters involved in the drama are long dead-most over a hundred years dead-there is still a fascination with the macabre behavior of the killer.  Modern audiences are familiar with the subject of serial killers, which seem to have cropped up from time to time throughout the past century to fill our newspapers with the senseless violence that seems almost the hallmark of our age.  When one reads this book, one will discover that barbarity to ones fellow human being is by no means confined to our own disturbed culture.  The Ripper was never brought to trial, and Cornwell believes that many of his crimes were not even credited to him, including some of the more vicious crimes perpetrated against children and others in outlying areas of England.<br />At the beginning of the book, Cornwell admits to a feeling of discomfort with the evil of both the Ripper and unbalanced mental state of the artist.  It's obvious that she herself is convinced of his guilt.  The chapters start out organized, the discussion of the artist's early life and family providing structure.  The deaths of the victims also provide a framework.  By the middle of the book, however, the author seems to wander a bit.  She jumps from date to date, describing a variety of events that interweave with the Ripper murders, and by the end of the book, the story just stops.  It ends with the artist's strange behavior at the funeral of his second wife in the 1920's, this despite the fact that Sickert himself lived until 1942 and married a third time.  It's almost as if the villainy of the Sickert character in his purposed guise of Jack the Ripper has freaked out the author, and she can barely tolerate dealing with either of them.  It bespeaks of an unpleasant experience and certainly gives credence to the idea that there really is a devil and some people can in fact be evil in a deep and spiritual sense.  It also suggests that Cornwell herself is an incredibly creative and imaginative person for whom writing is more than just a vocation.<br />While I think that Cornwell makes a good case for the guilt of the disdurbed artist Sickert, I'm not certain but that that fact arises at least as much from her ability to weave a good story and to create an ambiance of mystery around her characters as it does from the facts in her case.  That the man was deeply disturbed, possibly due to childhood traumas and to a highly disfunctional family, seems quite likely.  It's not impossible that the man was either autistic or even schizophrenic.  That he was Jack the Ripper, I'm not so sure.  Probably the most damning physical evidence is the stationary used by both the artist and Jack the Ripper in their correspondence, but as Ms Cornwell herself points out, even if theartist had written the letters to the police, it demonstrates more his rather bent sense of humor than his guilt.  I also find it interesting that there appear to be no descendants to be offended by a book damning their ancestor as one of the nineteenth century's most vicious killers! There is an element of legal safety in that.<br />A fascinating book, but be prepared for the gruesome.the artist had written the letters to the police, it demonstrates more his rather bent sense of humor than his guilt.

The author was what we would now refer to as a family practitioner who worked in a small rural community near Duluth from 1947 to 1980.  His charming collection of stories is a delight to read, and I literally read the book from cover to cover over about three hours without putting it down.  The tales of the doctor and his patients pull the reader through the pages without tricks of style, just the author's natural talent for telling a simple story:  the life and death struggles of members of his community, the happiness of new lives begun, the suddenness of unexpected death, incredible courage in the face of adversity, acceptance of the setbacks of life, amusing vignettes of simple people living life among their neighbors.<br />FOR THOSE WRITING PAPERS in English, creative writing, journaling, journalism, history, and sociology, this would make a nice format to follow or a good bibliography entry.

Although The Great Maya Droughts by Richardson Gill is a very impressive collection of information, it's not quite what I had expected.  Given the title I had expected an archaeological account of recent finds and what they tell of the decline of Maya civilization.  Instead the bulk of the book, eleven chapters of it, deals with a wide variety of scientific information having to do with a number of fields: physics, oceanography, complexity theory, meteorology, geology, hydrology, paleoclimatology, and volcanology among them.  Not until the last two chapters of the book, and then mostly in summary form, does the author really discuss the archaeological data.  For the average reader interested in the Maya and/or in general archaeology this might be a thirty dollar disappointment.  Some of the material is rather complex, and although one might be able to work ones way through it on just the explanations the author gives of each topic, it would probably appeal more to those who already have at least some background in these areas.  This having been said, though, I have to admit that I loved the book.<br />The author's primary goal is to introduce the theme of what he terms an energy failure as the cause of the Maya demise.  To do this he approaches his topic as a physical scientist.  Modern archaeology has come a long way since W. M. Flinders Petrie and A. Layard, and there is as much \\"hard\\" science involved in this discipline as digging in the sand.  In fact with funds for excavations difficult to come  by these days, there is probably far less digging in the sand going on now than there was in the past.  Gill seems to be a model of the new archeologist/scientist.  Steeped in what E. O. Wilson calls \\"consilience,\\" the author calls upon data from a variety of fields to supply him with the building blocks he needs to reinforce his thesis.<br />At first I was a little skeptical of this type of approach, even though I know a fair amount about most of Dr. Gill's supporting subjects.  By the time he got to a discussion of the shifting of the ecotomes in Europe during the Roman period (p. 16), I was totally hooked.  I had just read a book covering the rise and fall of the Roman occupation in Gaul, and Gill's discussion of it in his work made perfect sense.  With his treatment of human culture and its limitations in terms of thermodynamics and its evolution in terms of self organizing criticality, he had completely reeled me in.  Like others, I had considered the decay of the Maya centers to be a \\"multifaceted\\" problem.  Human culture and behavior being as complex as they are-or seem to be-a multidimensional answer to the problem seemed logical.  As Gill presents it, however, there is nothing so logical-or so simple-as the destruction of the human animal by a lack of water.  As he points out, a person can live for months without eating but only days without water.<br />The book is well worth the effort, even for those with limited knowledge of the included topics, as long as he/she has the desire to learn something new and isn't afraid of a little work.  Furthermore, the bibliography is a mine of useful resources, both books and periodicals.  Some are a little old, 1970-1980s, but many are more current.  Of the books that I've read from the author's list: Per Bak's How Nature Works is fun, as is Sigurdsson's Melting the Earth. Jered Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel is wonderful, a \\"must read\\" sort of book.  Both Decker and Decker's Volcanoes and Bullard's Volcanoes of the Earth, though a little old, are interesting and easy to read.  Of the journals American Scientist, Archaeology, Nature, Science, and Scientific American should be readily available in most college and urban public libraries.  Those like Geology, The Holocene, Hydrobiologia, Hydrology, the Journal of Human Evolution, Journal of Paleoceanography, and Quaternary Research may be available in some university libraries or in their individual department libraries.<br />For THOSE WRITING PAPERS on archaeology, history, meteorology/climatology, anthropology, ecology, etc.  this book would make an instructive source for \\"how-to-do-it with science.\\"  It would make an excellent source of quotes in support of your own themes, a good source for bibliographical material, and a good bibliographical entry for your own paper.<br />Not an easy book to get through.  Certainly not for those who just want an overview of the Maya.  Definitely worth it for those with a desire to learn.For THOSE WRITING PAPERS on archaeology, history, meteorology/climatology, anthropology, ecology, etc.  this book would make an instructive source for \\"how-to-do-it with science.\\"  It would make an excellent source of quotes in support of your own themes, a good source for bibliographical material, and a good bibliographical entry for your own paper.  <br />Not an easy book to get through.

I found it a very interesting topic, particularly the discussion of the experiences of military surgeons and nurses.  Having grown up with the TV series Mash, and being myself a nurse, I found the Civil War experiences surprising similar to those of the Mash staff, and even to some extent to my own in ICU (though of course the ICU is a more controlled environment, and I am not subjected to the same exhausting routines).<br />The character of the volume suggests the published form of a doctoral dissertation, and indeed Dr. Dean had only just received his doctorate in history from Yale when the book was published (1997).  The fashion these days is very much toward introducing statistical methods into the social sciences in an effort to give them a \\"legitimacy\\" through quantization and to \\"extract\\" as much information from the data as possible.  This is in an effort to put them on an \\"equal\\" footing with the \\"hard\\" sciences.  Having done a statistical project myself in a social science (industrial relations) and having seen the effects of this fashion on my present profession, the practice of nursing, I usually find myself frankly unimpressed with the results.  Fortunately the author limits his statistical manipulations of the data to the final chapters of the book, where he attempts, among other things, to determine whether the victims of post war psychological problems were characteristic of veterans of the war in general.  He very honestly points out the caveats of treating the patchy and scant information in this way, and in fact is able to come up with only very little of statistical significance.  The demographics of the patient population he investigates is, however, very suggestive, as are some of the diary entries.  The latter are indicative of the attitudes of teenage veterans toward war prior to combat and of their reaction to the reality of it on the battle field.<br />The work seemed a little labored at points by virtue of it's attempt to discuss both the experiences of the Viet Nam veteran and the Civil War veteran with respect to the traumas of their war experiences.  To some extent I felt that Dean had some sort of soap box mission in his treatment of the Viet Nam veteran, though I'm not quite sure what it was, since the discussion seemed all over the place at times.  To the degree that post traumatic stress was defined by our own times and that the modern veteran and his treatment is a model of that definition, I see the information as pertinent, otherwise it seems intrusive.<br />As long as the author remained on his topic of Civil War soldiers, the research was very impressive.  He must have spent some considerable time delving in libraries and public archives to bring so much personal data together.  The men whose lives he describes are solid individuals; though information was obviously limited, it was well and carefully selected and makes their experiences very real for the reader.<br />I also was a little surprised to find a non-health care person take up a subject that is to some extent a medical problem.  His understanding of psychology and it's confusing array of theories and course changes through its history is quite good, but I suspect he is not quite as aware of some of the more recent biochemical theories of human behavior.  These theories might far better explain the symptoms of his veterans.  To the extent that any theory of human behavior is a social construct, Dr. Dean's veterans-or at least their families-received a surprising degree of support for the time.<br />An interesting book on the psychological effects of the Civil War on the veteran.The latter are indicative of the attitudes of teenage veterans toward war prior to combat and of their reaction to the reality of it on the battle field.  <br />The work seemed a little labored at points by virtue of it's attempt to discuss both the experiences of the Viet Nam veteran and the Civil War veteran with respect to the traumas of their war experiences.

Because there is no text for the class and I have little experience with the subject, I decided to use Mr. Proulx's book Build Your Own Kitchen Cabinets as my starting point.<br />One of the first things I learned was the value of a good table saw.  Having tried to make cases for a project at home with a basic carpenter's table saw and having used better equipment in class, I can attest to the value of his advice with respect to the matter.  With respect to design I also found his information helpful in steering me clear of some of the ideas that I had originally thought would work well in my kitchen.  Some of the photos of completed work in place made me realize how crowded my own plans would look in my more limited space.  I had also planned on altering the measurements from standard ones, to achieve a more spacious feel for the area, but decided that I should consider those who might work in the kitchen after me and the effect on the value of my house.<br />One of the more useful design ideas was the author's suggestion of purchased, individually adjustable feet for lower cabinets.  Having made cases with toe kicks cut from the fabric of which the case was composed, I know the increased measurement, cutting and materials-not to mention frustration-it required.  The adjustable feet are ideal, and I plan on using them in my kitchen project and will probably use them for a bathroom cabinet as well.<br />Although I'm not sure I really care for the idea of using Melamine for my own projects, I can certainly see the worth of using it.  The material is less costly and someone on a tight budget with lots of cabinets to replace could certainly get more done for less using it.  The interiors of completed cabinets and drawers also had a very clean look to them that I liked.	2003-10-31

Professor Cunliffe covers a very long period of history, from 8000 BC to 1500 AD, in about 500 pages.  Although slow in some parts-I nodded out a few times during discussions of specific trade items-it was none-the-less a well assembled volume of information.<br />Although I `ve studied the history of the area on a number of occasions for classes and in personal reading, I was surprised at how well the varied information was pulled into a more coherent whole by simply looking at the experiences of coastal populations.  To a large extent these groups were marginal to the events of the major centers of civilization, isolated by distance and by geographical barriers from them.  I've found in other cases, too, that it is often from the perspective of the peripheral cultures that more sense is made of global history.  Although most historians treat these areas as cultural backwaters waiting to be \\"enlightened\\" by the more technologically advanced, in fact they had vigorous and creative cultures of their own that provided the central players with raw materials and a strong market for finished goods.  The ebb and flow of trade and of people and the changes in the fortunes of the various participants of the central arena create a much richer historical texture than is usually portrayed, and makes more sense of some of the events of world history.  For instance the author's statement that the decline in productivity and birth rate in the Mediterranean world coupled with the denser population of the Germanic tribes north of the Rhine created a \\"fracture\\" zone, was very prescient.  Taken out of global context, the fall of Rome seems to be a simple matter of internal decay, which to some extent it was.  It becomes more a matter of population dynamics and economics when considering the European, African and Asian Continents as a whole.  In short, there was a lot more to it than it seems on the surface.<br />Because the author's primary research seems to be in Celtic studies (he has written an entire volume on the Celts), the book tends to focus rather heavily on periods leading up to the Celtic-Roman confrontations and to periods just after it.  He barely touches upon the age of discovery during the 15th Century, which is an age of Atlantic maritime expansion, par excellence.  Even though he is neither historian nor archaeologist by profession and his primary focus is Chinese global exploration, Gavin Menzies gives a far more thorough discussion of the age of European discovery in his book 1421, The Year China Discovered America.  (He also gives an amazing account of fraud in map making by Bartholomew Colombus in collusion with his brother Christopher that is well worth the reading.)<br />Interesting, too, is the author's perspective as an archaeologist on the culture of Europe during the long period of habitation, particularly the Roman and post-Roman periods.  Historically speaking, written works from the period tend to be vary biased in favor of the Romans.  Unfortunately modern historians aren't always \\"up front\\" about some of these biases.  The magic of the written word tends to give credence to whatever is imparted.  For one thing, the ancient writers provide a good story, often times a gossipy one.  And who doesn't enjoy a good gossip?  For another they sometimes just didn't know, or they quoted as reliable information the reports of other writers who also just didn't know.  While archaeology is as prone to errors of interpretation as is historical analysis of written sources, it has the benefit of solid primary evidence.  Where one discipline seems to support the other, we probably have a good approximation of what occurred in the past.  Where they disagree, we have to admit that for now at least, \\"we just don't know.\\"  The author makes this abundantly apparent throughout the text.<br />I was particularly impressed that author had such a good sense of geography and geology, particularly with his ability to pull the concept of isostacy into his discussion.  It wasn't just that he understood that the coastal environment was subject to change due to emergence or submergence, he knew the mechanisms by which this occurred.  This may be because he is an archaeologist, which requires a good understanding of geomorphological processes in interpreting habitation sites and the finds that are made there.  I was a little surprised, though, that he made less of the environmental changes that occurred throughout his selected time period, producing major shifts in ecological zones.  Though his main interest is Mayan history, Richardson Gill in his book, The Great Maya Droughts,  gives a very plausible interpretation of changes in the European sociopolitical picture that takes this factor into account rather well, making even more sense of the shifts in fortunes in the Northern and Southern European venues.<br />All in all an interesting book.  I think that it is more for those with a special interest in European history and pre-history rather than for the general reader.  It would make a very useful supplementary text for a college archaeology or European history course.  I would certainly have welcomed it when I took my Archaeology of Northern Europe class a couple years ago.  I think that at a high school level it would make a good addition to a library for use in research or for the student with a special interest.  I suspect most high school age individuals would find it a bit slow going.or had such a good sense of geography and geology, particularly with his ability to pull the concept of isostacy into his discussion.

Since I was rather disappointed by that author's conclusions, I almost anticipated an equally disappointing experience with Mr. Menzies' book.  Hapgood discussed the Piri Reis map, a portalan map of the known world rediscovered in a collection in Turkey.  He and his students subjected the work to a thorough study by applying modern mapping techniques and non-Euclidean geometry.  While I had no complaints about their scientific research on the map-I'd taken some cartography in conjunction with my degree in geology-I was somewhat taken aback by their conclusion that the map proved the existence of the \\"lost continent of Atlantis!\\"  It is a fair jump from deciding that a pre-Columbian map portrays an accurate visual image of the coasts of the world to proving the existence of a fabled civilization.  There should be other more reasonable explanations of the phenomenon tested before we resort to the Sherlock Holmes theorem (when all probable explanations are disproved, then the only remaining explanation is the improbable.)<br />Menzies' work, 1421: The Year China Discovered America, while it also challenges accepted doctrine regarding the European initiation of world discovery, is a far more satisfying work.  Like Hapgood and his students, Gavin Menzies subjects old maps to a thorough examination by modern techniques and approaches the project with a better personal vita.  While not himself a professor of history, he is a well read and well traveled individual.  Furthermore his life experiences qualify him far better to undertake this project than Dr. Hapgood's did.  He served in the Royal Navy from 1953 to 1970, commanding a submarine, the HMS Ronqual, from 1968 to 1970.  During this time he experienced the same natural phenomenon of the world's oceans and became familiar with the idiosyncracies of maps and cartography in practice.  He also lived in China for two years before WWII and has returned many times since then.  He displays an obvious bias in favor of Chinese culture and its potental, but not unjustly if his data are to be trusted.<br />Probably the most impressive thing about the book is the author's very methodical approach to his subject.  He begins by giving a history of the Chinese state at the time he proposes produced the maps, discussing the social background that provided the impetus to world discovery and the reason the great voyages were not followed by extensive colonization as they were later by similar European ventures.  He also notes why the documentation of these voyages is so scant in China and uses what information there is as a starting point for his own pursuit of external evidence.  Describing the careers of commanders like Zheng He, Yang Qing, Zhou Man, Hong Bao and Zhou Wen, he sets the stage for his own research into their adventures.  Following each of the ancient commanders in their proposed missions and capitalizing on his own experience as a captain of an ocean going vessel, he charts the nature-driven course these ancient pilots would have been encouraged or forced to take.  At each probable landing point, he searched for and occasionally found indications of ancient contact: in material remains like porcelains, votives, and inscriptions, in the mythology of aboriginals, in wreck sites of non-European vessels, and so on.<br />The most impressive piece of this type of assessment is that of the Bimini \\"road.\\"  This underwater formation has had many attempted explanations, most of them total fantasy.  They have been described as \\"temples\\" of a lost civilization, as \\"roads\\" from the lost continent of Atlantis, as odd geological formations, as concretions remaining from some former sea life, etc.  That they might have been laid down by sailors for the very practical purpose of beaching their ships for repair is the most logical explanation I've heard yet!  Menzies is even able to describe how the beaching procedure would have been done and why that dictated that the \\"road\\" be designed just as it is.<br />Unlike Hapgood and his students, this author examines not just the Piri Reis of 1513 but several of the other anomalous early maps in pursuing the voyages of these amazing captains: the Kangnido world map of 1402, the Pizzigano chart of 1424,  Fra Mauro's planisphere of 1459, the Cantino world chart of 1502,  the Waldseemuller map of 1507, and the Jean Rotz world map of 1542.  While many of these date to after the European voyages of discovery, this author-and others as well-believe that they are copies of originals that are older.  It is believed that the European understanding of map making and of assessing position, particularly longitude, was not adequate enough to have produced such precise descriptions of foreign coasts.  The author's explanation of why this is true and why and how the Chinese were so far ahead of their European counterparts is detailed and interesting.<br />Menzies' style is colorful and descriptive, reading almost like a novel.  At times one is as lost in the narrative of the voyages as one is in the history of the events and the logic of the author's arguments.  I found it difficult to put down and read it in about two days.  The bibliography is quite extensive and includes mostly books in English or in English translation.  Some are a little old-Aldridge's \\"Cairo\\" for one (1970) though it's a fascinating discussion of the city-but even some of these are germane to the subject.  The technical discussions might be beyond the junior high level reader, but the story certainly is not.  I think that some of this should be taught in high school world history classes, since it shows that the age of discovery was a global phenomenon, that the world may have been \\"ready\\" for discovery, that it was \\"in the air\\" so to speak and inevitable.  That the Chinese could explore the world without antagonizing the foreign people they met along the way makes one wonder if the violence of the European ventures abroad were truly \\"inevitable\\" outcomes of a highly technological society confronting a less advanced culture as sometimes said.

It seemed too pedantic.  Later, in doing a little research on the author for my Amazon review, I discovered that Peter Tremayne is the nom de plume of Peter Berresford Ellis, a Celtic scholar of some ability.  Given my preference for expository prose anyway, I decided I might enjoy his more serious books in the field, so I bought A Brief History of The Druids for my library.  As I suspected, I enjoyed this book much more than the mystery.<br />At the outset, let me say that The Druids is not a new age discussion of mystic powers, etc and anyone looking to \\"get in touch\\" with the ancient past will be profoundly disappointed.  The book is a very carefully researched study of what the author has determined was a social class of Celtic society.  These were the \\"philosophers, judges, educators, historians, doctors, seers, astronomers and astrologers; in fact,...the native intellectual class of Celtic society (p. 35).\\"<br />Ellis freely admits that very little of written documentation on the druids remains and much of what there is has come down to us from external sources not always favorable to the Celtic world, for one reason or another, or at best simply not \\"in the know\\" about it.  He cites various primary sources from the Greek and Roman world:  Hecateus and Herodotus, Poseidonios and Diordorus, Strabo and Laertius, Pliny the Elder and Julius Caesar among them.  He also refers to various Irish, Welsh and Scottish mythologies regarding early leaders and ancient deities, various law codes still in existence into the Christian era,  and rounds off  his own conclusions regarding the nature of the druids, by quoting a number of secondary sources whose theories he discusses at some length.  The works of Rhys, Wagner, and Chadwick as well as others are all given a pro and con inspection for the benefit of the reader.<br />For myself, I found my interest most engaged when the author kept to the historic or mythic data for the Celts and the Druids, but early history and mythology happens to be the area of my personal  interest.  When Ellis delved more into poetry and an examination of Celtic words and their meaning-something about which I have absolutely no knowledge-I tended to veg out.  With little underlying knowledge of the material, I found the words just so much nonsense and his discussion tended to be meaningless to me.  To someone with a Celtic family background or a knowledge of the language and culture of the time, these might be the passages that were the most interesting and informative.<br />One of the things the author discusses is the similarities between Hindu and early Celtic cultures, suggesting that the common factors between the two may reach back to their common Indo-European heritage.  He also mentions an enclave of Celts living in Turkey and the degree to which Celtic traditions remained constant between this group and those with which Caesar was familiar.  The author's discussion of the origin of the Celts at the head of the Danube reminded me of the book I'd read on the mummies of the Takla Makhan desert.  Here another author suggested that an enclave of Celts may have settled as far east as China!<br />For those looking for TERM PAPERS in HISTORY, WORLD RELIGION, CLASSICS, ENGLISH LIT, etc.  The Druids is an interesting book on a fascinating subject.  It is well and thoroughly researched.  The bibliography is lengthy and includes journal articles as well as books.  For classical references, the author simply refers the reader to the Penquin Classics series.  (I would tend to prefer the Loeb Classic series).  Bibliographic material is dedicated almost entirely to modern secondary sources some of which are perhaps a little old and may be difficult for the interested reader to find unless he or she has access to a university library.  Some of the sources are in French, a very few in German, but most are in English.es are in French, a very few in German, but most are in English.	2003-10-18

No Bone Unturned by Jeff Benedict is the second book on the topic of Kennewick Man and the legal and political battle over his remains that I've read these past few months.  Ancient Encounters: Kennewick Man and the First Americans by James C. Chatters gives the perspective of the first forensic anthropologist to study the remains and attempt to preserve them.  No Bone Unturned, written by a journalist, discusses the involvement of the Smithsonian forensic archaeologist/anthropologist Douglas Owsley in the legal battle itself.  While the former work gives the reader a good perspective on the significance of the material remains themselves and certainly illustrates the hazards of working in the field of archaeology today, the latter book puts the entire debate into more striking relief.<br />The book reads like a novel, carrying the reader through Owsley's childhood fascination with bones and what they can tell us of the being when living to his college years and professional growth at the national museum.  The researcher is made very human by the details of his childhood, friendships and family relationships.  His ability as a researcher is hardly left in doubt.  Tales of his work with the remains of the recently dead, such as those of the Waco disaster, those of two murdered journalists in South America, and those of the victims of the 9/11 disaster, make his personal bravery as well as his focus and perseverance abundantly apparent.  Stories of his work with historical remains makes his ability to piece together the story of the past through the scant skeletal material left in burials reads like a mystery book.<br />Jeff Benedict the author is himself an interesting character.  An investigative journalist with five books to his credit, he holds a J.D., an M.A. in Political Science and a B.A. in History, and in 2002 was a candidate for U.S. Congress from Connecticut.  His credentials make his political and legal assessment of the events and significance of the Kennewick debate more than idyll.  Probably more important than what the bones can tell us of the history and settlement of the continent is what was nearly made precedent, namely the clandestine activities of several governmental agencies looking for an expedient way to deal with a trying situation, the pressure by government agencies on their own scientists, impinging upon their civil rights, and the arbitrary decisions made by political leaders and government agencies with respect to what constituted &quot;acceptable data&quot; upon which they might base their decisions.  In short, &quot;acceptable data&quot; became whatever the agency decided it was and private individuals were expected to accept that as final.  Scary.<br />Junior high students can probably understand the vocabulary and might enjoy the science, but probably only senior high and older will understand the implications of the judicial debate. An interesting and exciting book.  Well written and easy to read.  Very informative.

Oddly enough I've had Ms Tey's The Daughter of Time in my own library off and on for years, but just never got around to reading it.  Usually it got given away whenever I moved.  This time I actually took a moment to read the cover introduction and decided to buy it once more, fully resolved to reading it immediately.  Once I got into it, I couldn't put it down.  The lady justly deserves her reputation as a gifted writer.<br />As the commentator Robert Barnard opines at the beginning of the book, Tey's style is difficult to pigeon hole.  I'd read one other book by her (Miss Pym Disposes) and this story was not remotely what I expected.  The Daughter of Time (a title taken from an old proverb, \\"Truth is the daughter of time\\") is a wonderful medley of history, mystery, and theatrical.  One can easily see the author's grounding in the world of the stage.<br />The entire story takes place in a hospital room and in the imagination of its occupant.  The action, if you can call it that, comes through the introduction of information by various other characters who aid the invalid, an injured detective from Scotland Yard, in his attempt to discover the true story of Richard the Third-yes that nasty fellow who murdered his nephews in the Tower of London.....or did he?  He pursues the evidence as he would a modern day crime, believing nothing until he can validate it by a primary source.  Slowly but surely he builds his case.<br />From the beginning the author has complete control of her reader's attention-I read the entire book in about 2 hours.  After creating the image of the hospital room and the ennui of its occupant, she wastes very little verbage on descriptions beyond creating the personalities of the walk on characters.  Most of the focus is on solving the puzzle of the murders and the reality of the time in which all the historical figures lived.  One almost has the sense of a stage with the main character addressing his audience with his thoughts when alone or his guests when they make appearances.  A spotlight may fall on the actions of the past and their participants briefly, then dissolve as the story progresses to the next fact and how it fits into the tale of the young princes and their uncle.  This makes it a rapid and enjoyable read.  I'd love to see it done as a play.  It's set might be very nearly as economical as that for Our Town.<br />A tightly written, well researched work of art.

I had therefore expected something a little more cutting edge in this department and so was a little disappointed.  Other readers will probably not be.  As with any book with several authors the quality of the writing varies from chapter to chapter according to the abilities of the various sources.  In some instances the word choices and grammar suggested that a foreign language speaker or his translator had make an awkward word selection, in others it might have been an editing failure, but the overall style is very lucid and rapidly read.  I took about an afternoon to read it.<br />Some of the material was already known to me from other sources;  other information was new and fun to read.  Because most of my study has been conducted in ancient history, in particular the Near East, Greece and Rome, I found the studies of modern remains and those in Chinese and Andean sites were of more interest.<br />Vilnius and the Ghosts of the Grande Armee was particularly arresting, describing as it does the tragic fate of the bulk of Napoleon's army during his ill-conceived Russian campaign.  High-mountain Inca Sacrifices updated me on the discovery and examination of the freeze-dried remains of children sacrificed in the Andes Mountains.  The find given the name Juanita was known to me, but much research has been done since her discovery almost a decade ago.  Since I have recently taken an interest in post-conquest English history (inspired by a particularly good series of murder mysteries) I found the article Anne Mowbray and the Skeletons in the Tower, a discussion of the murders of the nephews of Richard III, enjoyable.  It filled in a knowledge gap and extended my period of interest a little.<br />Most of the stories are simple, general descriptions of human remains and their relevance to the historical record of human kind.

Her stories are a little too much to pattern, with vocabulary choices at times almost cliche, but the stories in her Coast to Coast Ghosts are quite charming none the less, and she does do a fair amount of background research on her subjects.  As with Holzer's books on the paranormal, there is a bit of history incorporated into the discussion of the ghostly encounters.  Whether one believes in ghosts or not, the stories still captivate.  I didn't care much for the more blatant promotion of hotels with purported ghostly sightings, however.  Even the hotel's phone number was included in some instances, just in case the reader might want to make a reservation.  That was a little too commercial for my taste, but other readers might in fact like the information.  One of the aspects of the book that I very much enjoyed was the lady's photography, since most of the photos in the book, including that on the cover, are her own.  She definitely has a way of capturing the feeling of a place with the camera.	2003-08-24

That is, I tend to look for books produced by PhDs in a specific field who teach at prestigious universities or for collaborations of them.  I do, however,  pride myself on giving credit where credit is due, and this volume is certainly an example.  According to the text's introduction Robert Blitzer, the author of Introductory Algebra for College Students, has a BA in math and psychology with a minor in English literature, an MA in math, and a doctorate in behavioral sciences and teaches in a local community college in Florida.  That's quite an eclectic vita.  In this case it is an ideal vita, that of a teacher dedicated to student comprehension of his subject.<br />The author approaches student learning from a variety of directions, some uniquely oriented to specific types of mental framework.  He presents, for instance, visual guides for those who need to \\"see it to understand it\\"-my particular favorites are the sets that compose all real numbers on p. 19 [3rd ed.] and the graphs of systems of linear inequalities like those on pp 312-313, because they make these topics so crystal clear.  Elsewhere he introduces the concept of matrices, putting information into columns under appropriate headings so that one can see what information one has, what one needs and what has to be manipulated with what to achieve an answer (i.e. \\"Solving a Solution Mixture Problem,\\" p. 173.)  Remember those threatening word problems involving things like that Greyhound bus and the car approaching one another, or the two planes traveling in opposite directions? Piece of cake.  The author also gives instructions for scientific and graphic calculators for those who are especially in tune with technology-I have yet to try this, because for my money it's a whole different learning parameter in itself.  He also puts some of the algebraic expressions into a useable context.  The student finds equations in economics, health sciences, physics, population demographics, athletics, nutrition, sociology, politics, in short most of the areas of student interest and student majors.  More than anything, Blitzer makes math useable, accessible, and relevant.  It's not just a subject we have to pass to take the classes we really want, it's a skill that helps us with decision making in everyday life.<br />Some of the data the author uses to create his equations come from industry, education, census data, the cinema industry, simple everyday problems like fencing a yard or deciding on the respective values of a large size or two medium sized pizzas!  These situations provide some unique educational experience, not simply because they allow the student to understand the underlying mathematical concepts of solving a specific problem.  They are themselves very instructive in reality.  What does it matter if two cans of peaches that cost the same are shaped differently ( i.e. if one is six inches in diameter and five inches in height while the other is 5 inches in diameter and 6 inches in height are they really the same value?)  How fast does the cost of an education climb over time (i.e. will you be able to afford it for yourself? your kids?  Should one get involved in the politics of education?)  What is the difference between the rate of increase in salaries for those without high school educations vis a vis those with high school diplomas and those with four years of college (i.e. you may be making the same as a drop out at the beginning, but where will your income be relative to theirs in five years?  In ten?  In 15?  Are you really to busy to get more education?  Is that math class really too difficult to get through a degree?)  One gains some very important insights into real life just by doing the math that underlines the decisions life presents the average person.<br />As with any textbook in math, however, the student is an important part of the learning process.  If you only do the assigned problems, or if you skip the cumulative reviews at the end of each chapter because you've \\"already learned all that,\\" you may have perfect daily work but fail your exams.  There is, after all, a difference between getting an answer correct, especially with the help of the book, and getting the underlying concept so that you can apply it in new situations.<br />I think this text would be a wonderful way for adults who are math shy by virtue of unpleasant early experiences to get more out of the subject.  It would certainly give  parents, whose math skills are poor or just covered with dust, to help their children with this discipline.  It would also help college algebra students to prime themselves for more advanced math or for taking a college level algebra course that uses a more confusing text.process.

I chose Inviting Disaster, by James R. Chiles, (another Minnesotan), Why Things Bite Back by Edward Tenner, and Normal Accidents by Charles Perrow.  I also decided to review them together, although I have also reviewed the latter separately.<br />The Chiles book Inviting Disaster is thoroughly entertaining.  The author is a professional writer with a readable style who often tries out equipment, goes on site, or goes along with technicians in order to do his research.  He is by no means given to just armchair research and that makes for a very exciting narration.<br />I did have some difficulty getting used to his method of pairing recent and 19th Century tales of disaster, especially his habit of jumping back and forth between the two narrations.  It does focus ones attention on the similarities between the two events and the degree to which we have learned little from experience!  It would appear that leaning from mistakes has been given more lip service than practice  over the years.  This may well be due to the fact that it's only been more recently that failure itself has been made a subject in its own right with a proper examination of how systems \\"go off the rails\\" and what can be done about it.<br />The author includes an interesting variety of situations, and the list makes it clear that complexity itself gives rise to surprising new outcomes.  Just as the authors of Figments of Reality note, complex systems can give rise to emergent characteristics which are entirely unexpected and therefore not planned.  (In their book intelligence/mind arising from brain/nerve.<br />In Inviting Disaster, Chiles focuses on the effects of top down management, the over riding desire to accomplish records and goals, and the disenfranchisement of front line workers who have important information about front line conditions as the primary cause of disaster.  He also notes that with very complex systems, the Devil can be in the details, and it tends to be these that get overlooked or ignored.  In the final chapters, he suggests that successful companies have tended to focus on customer satisfaction and safety, and not only value but reward bottom up communication.<br />The book has a very extensive bibliography that the interested reader might enjoy following up for further information on the technology/human interface.  The appendix also includes a list of disasters and near disasters and brief descriptions of each; an eye opener.<br /> Why Things Bite Back is by a historian turned science editor, Edward Tenner.  This volume focuses on what the author calls \\"revenge effects\\" of technology, the reverse or worse outcomes arising from applications of technology that were intended to eliminate or mitigate problems.  Tenner's book takes a more holistic look at the unexpected outcomes of science and technology rather than at specific disasters.  Medicine, Environmental Disasters, Computerized Offices, and  Sports are among the facets of modern life that are examined.science and technology. In general Tenner sees there has been an exchange from the overwhelming, localized disaster affecting a few to a few thousand individuals to the chronic, more socially distributed effects of negative outcomes that require more sustained vigilance and therefore more expense distributed over an entire society or over the world's population as a whole.<br />One of the more interesting aspects of the book is the point made that there has been a major change for the worse in the level of satisfaction with life that has arisen as an unexpected outcome of reduced risk.  Apparently as life becomes easier and we are less threatened by major problems, we begin to magnify minor problems.  He also notes the odd relationship between computers and productivity; their promise doesn't seem to have lived up to the expectations of the industry, and he suggests that our dependence upon them has created complications.  He admits, however that some of this may be due to the lag between the introduction of new equipment and the full embracement of the technology, noting that there was also a problem created by the lag between introduction of electrical motors and the abandonment of steam power in industry during the earlier part of the 20th century.<br />The book has a small annotated bib for \\"further reading\\", but the more extensive notes to the chapters with their resources, include titles that might interest the reader too.<br />Normal Accidents by Charles Perrow, a professor of sociology at Yale, is the most detailed of the three.  I found it more difficult to get into this book, however, because of its more technical discussions of industry failures, particularly those in the nuclear power industry.  The book was reverently referred to by both of the above authors, however, so when I had finished reading them, I returned to this book and got much more out of it than I had on my first reading.  (See my individual review on this book under the title.)<br />Because of his overall approach as a sociologist to the subject of the human/technology/organization interfaces, Professor Perrow tended to look more closely at how human goals, preconceived notions of reality, and social structures set up some types of failure.  He also notes that in some instances, had the various individuals actually tried to cause the accidents of which they became a part, they probably would have had difficulty doing so.<br />The final chapter of the book is very interesting for the author's social commentary and his suggestions for resolution of dangerous situations.  Although I'm not entirely sure I believe that his position is a strong as it seems on first reading, I think it's definitely something that should be considered; certainly to do so would cause us less harm than not doing so might.<br />The bibliography contains a wide range of references and demonstrates the thoroughness of the academic research.  I would make an excellent starting point for anyone who wanted to do their own similar study.have lived up to the expectations of the industry, and he suggests that our dependence upon them has created complications.

1043101:US	50669529	R1E5ZUQT3I47X5	0425177173	842248212	Atlantis Found (Dirk Pitt, No. 15)	Books	4	18	19	N	N	Good fantasy fiction of a particularly masculine variety	The geological descriptions, mirroring those of the catastrophic meteor impact at Chicxulub off the North coast of Yucatan implicated in the extinction of the dinosaurs, caught my attention with the first page of Atlantis Found and kept me reading to the end.  Although I really don't care for the Dirk Pitt persona-he seems too much of a comic book character-I did enjoy the pace and shear adventure of the tale.  It is certainly very imaginative.<br />Like the Bond series, every woman is a beauty of one type or another, every bad guy (or gal) is totally reprehensible, their demise justly deserved, and every \\"good guy\\" from 8 to 80 exhibits intelligence, fortitude, cavalier indifference in the face of physical danger, and the comic repertoire  of a Bill Cosby.  Each one is a hero at whichever of the different stages of the male life cycle he may be.  If middle aged fathers have fantasies, they are undoubtedly of exploits similar to the Dirk Pitt series: their hair \\"maturely\\" greying at the temples, their muscles aching but undaunted by their travails, and just their very life experience able to outwit even the most brilliant of the bad guys.  (Too bad, though, that we don't give the guys in our lives the credit they are very much due for reading us to sleep as children, helping us with math problems as adolescents, and forgiving us our arrogance as young adults, and for the very much braver task of being there day after day when they might possibly have realized more of their own dreams instead!)<br />I was glad for once to find the oft repeated Atlantis story told in a more light hearted vein.  I've studied ancient history, including early Greek history, and have come across the persistent modern belief in Atlantis often enough to cringe when I meet it again.  The author's treatment certainly made it much more fun to contemplate.  Like some of those mainstream geologists mentioned by Cussler in the book, whose stodgy concepts of earth science forbade them to believe in a continent that sank beneath the sea, I too am skeptical.  But then I've studied geology extensively, too.  Continents are really too light to sink.  They float.  Not on water, but on the much denser but more plastic magma that lies beneath them.  Cussler's concept of a transgressing sea is almost the only way that Atlantis might be considered remotely possible. (Though I too believe that the Greek island of Santorini, ancient Thera, is a more likely candidate.)<br />Although a little pedantic, the information that the scientists in the book provide Pitt about history, geology, astronomy, and anthropology is, for the most part, quite accurate.  The reader gets to learn a little bit about these subjects along with the adventure (and just might develop a new interest, following up on one of them).  Cussler's own background in underwater archaeology (he participated in the search for the CSS Hunley, the world's first successful submarine lost during the Civil War) and in deep sea diving make the oceanographic descriptions and the underwater exploits of his characters seem more real.  Certainly his widely traveled life has given him a talent for describing the details of the world's different cities, landscapes and cultures.  The pacing of the story is superb.  One hardly has a chance to get in sync with any one adventure before the heros are off chasing the bad guys again in some other part of the world.  I particularly enjoyed the descriptions and adventures in the gold mines of Colorado, and the description of the Opera House in Buenos Aires.<br />Enjoyable too is the fact that the book does not take itself seriously enough to try to place itself in any \\"real\\" time.  The President is a fictional character.  Technology that for us is just beyond the horizon and therefore familiar only as buzz words (nanotechnology) is in the present tense for Pitt and his peers.  That leaves the door wide open for the author to let ancient Atlantis and its artifacts survive the endof the story.  Unlike similar stories where all traces of the discovery must be \\"lost\\" to keep the story \\"true\\" to our times, Cussler lets the reader glory in the relicts of the ancient city preserved beneath the ice.  We get to imagine the treasures as existing for our enjoyment, not forever lost.  Much more satisfying.<br />The book presents itself as good fantasy fiction of a particularly masculine variety.end of the story.

I was most impressed with the gentleman's erudition.  As a professor of Classics at the University of Zurich, he has, as expected, a thorough knowledge of Greek and Roman classical literature, but he also exhibits a very broad spectrum of knowledge in history, anthropology, linguistics, psychology and sociology.  He also has a good command of the professional literature on these subjects from the world's scholars, citing topics from journals in English, German, French and Italian.<br />From the perspective of research on the issue, I have no doubt that some of the author's arguments with respect to the evolution of religious ideas are very plausible.  They are certainly interesting and suggestive.  I'm not as certain, however, that they constitute &quot;proof,&quot; and there is a distinct difference between the proven and the plausible.<br />Among the topics he subjects to scrutiny are:  the function of religion in the context of a world of information, the design features of myths, legends and fairy tales, the reinforcement of hierarchy, the concept of &quot;religious therapy,&quot; the cultural function of reciprocity of giving, and the process of validation through signs and oaths.<br />Some of the concepts I found particularly interesting.  The author's suggestion, for instance, that, &quot;By a process of reduction, religion provides orientation within a meaningful cosmos for those who feel helpless vis-&agrave;-vis infinite complexity (p. 26).&quot;  Certainly in a world where information seems infinite, not always consistent, and mistakes can be dangerous, the possibility that a superior force can help narrow things down to a few key pieces of data would reduce the anxiety of dealing with life.  As he points out in later chapters, this is probably why belief in things like astrology have been so long lived.  It might be pointed out that science serves this function for the modern world, but that it often seems counter intuitive and inaccessible to many.<br />I also found Burkert's suggestion that sacrifice was a form of gift giving between the Gods and mankind and was a form of manipulation, even bribery, logical.  Certainly in ancient society it had a capacity to bind society together, and even to effect reciprocity between nations.  Other authors have suggested that gift giving between widely spaced societies may have operated to spread risk over a greater population and territory.<br />Again, a very plausible book with many interesting ideas to think about.e been so long lived.

I don't have children, but I do have an interest in mind and the brain, so when an on-line friend, Steven Haines, recommended it I decided to read The Primal Teen.  As catchy as the title may sound, the book is actually quite serious about the subject of the developing teenage brain.  Although the author is not herself a neurologist or neuroscientist, she is a skillful journalist (New York Times and Newsday).  The topic is well researched with primary sources taken from prestigious professional journals like Nature Neuroscience, Brain Research, Journal of Comparative Neurology, Cerebral Cortex, Annals of Neurology, etc.  While some of those articles cited are late 1980s, most are 1997 to 2002 (the book was published in 2003).  Ms Strauch also interviewed some of the researchers personally for their input on what the scientific data are likely to mean and how it impacts teens and their families.  Topics covered are: where the new data are coming from; teens and impulsive behavior; the whens, wheres, and whys of changes in the structure of the brain; what animal studies have to say about development of the brain in adolescents; why teens take risks; why teens seem to keep late hours and sleep late in the day; the chemistry of the brain and puberty; and the effects of drugs, tobacco and alcohol on growing brains.<br />I was a little frustrated with the lack of actual suggestions for parents on how to cope with their changing teen.  To some extent the anecdotal stories of some of the researchers who had teenaged children and those from the author herself provided insight into possible approaches, but on the whole very little by the way of helpful problem solving was offered.  This may well be because too little has yet been done to make definite statements.  The book at least helps a parent understand that their teenagers are &quot;normal&quot; despite the apparent erratic behavior they exhibit, that patience is the most likely route to a successful rite of passage, and most importantly that &quot;this too will pass.&quot;<br />An interesting and reassuring book.d most importantly that &quot;this too will pass.&quot; <br />An interesting and reassuring book.	2003-07-08

At first having noted the author's vita on the cover, I wasn't certain that an individual trained \\"only\\" in chemistry and physics could adequately write a book that was \\"obviously\\" about geology.  As I read on, however, I realized that Phillip Ball's intention really was to write a \\"biography of water\\" as the subtitle suggested.  The book in fact contains information about water from almost every perspective: from the origins of its constituent elements oxygen and hydrogen in cosmological processes to it's social and political effects in the modern world.  The book covers it all.  Because I have almost a complete degree in geology, I enjoyed most particularly the geological effects of water including its effects on geomorphology, its impact on glacial formation, its effect on climate and ocean physics, etc.  The author lost me a little in his discussion of the chemistry and physics of the substance, but I still found what I understood of it very instructive.  Water's function in the evolution of life and in the biochemistry of cellular metabolism was also interesting to me since I enjoy studying evolution-paleontolgoy and earth history were my major focus in studying geology--and I also am a nurse caring for patients whose fluid and electrolyte status arises from the cellular effects of water.<br />Probably the most important messages in the book, however, are those regarding conservation and utilization of water resources.  Certainly the information about the disparity of water availability and quality between the western and 3rd world countries, between urban and rural use, and between countries and states that have competing interests in a particular watershed were very enlightening.  It was surprising to learn that part of the problems of the Middle East revolve around water availability and use.  These issues certainly provide previews to future problems that will almost certainly arise globally in the not too distant future!<br />A very thorough, interesting and multifaceted book.resting and multifaceted book.	2003-07-07

The Private Life of the Brain by Susan Greenfield is a very complex work on consciousness and theory of self.  Trained in the field of neuropharmacology and physiology with degrees from  St. Hilda's College, Oxford, United Kingdom, the College de France, Paris, and NYU Medical Center, New York, the author has held lecture posts at several of the world's prestigious universities including Lincoln College, Oxford, the Institute of Neuroscience, La Jolla, California, and Queens University, Belfast.  In 1998 she became the first female director of Britain's Royal Institution.  Her current research is in the causes of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.  With this vita she is eminently equipped to discuss the topic.<br />Although the book seems to be a bit rambling, this is because it covers a lot of territory-but then there is a lot of territory to cover: brain anatomy-physiology, chemistry, neuro-connections, diseases, emotions, consciousness and the emergent self.  Probably because she is a pharmacologist and physiologist and most especially a scientist, she approaches her subject by dividing it into aspects that illuminate these characteristics and give rise to testable hypotheses regarding the inner workings of the brain and mind.  The chapter headings are therefore: 1) The Idea (the problem of consciousness), 2) The Story So Far (a history of the theories of mind), 3) The Child (early consciousness), 4) The Junkie (pain, euphoria, neuro-effective and neurophysiological chemicals), 5) The Nightmare (loss of consciousness), 6) The Depressive (highs and lows of consciousness), 7) The Human Condition (emotions and a theory of consciousness), 8) The Answer (the wrap up).  Certainly much of the material, especially in the first two chapters, is a recap of the work of others.  This is the usual approach to a topic about which one wishes to introduce new information; first you inform your reader of what has been done and by whom and how it fits with what you are yourself doing.  Much of this may be new to those who have not studied anything about mind-brain research, but for those who have the names will be familiar: Edelman, Aleksander, Chalmers, Crick and Koch, Calvin, and Dennett, among others.  In line with this style of authorship, most of the bibliography Greenfield cites is in the form of articles in prestigious professional journals from the 1980s to the 1990s (the book was published in 2000).  One finds here periodicals like Science, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Neurology, Journal of Cell Science, etc.  Most of these entries will probably not interest any but the professional in the field.  Fortunately the author has done most of the work herself and puts the research into understandable perspective for the amateur.<br />For myself, I found some of the information very interesting, even useful in my profession.  I had heard of and even seen ecupuncture use to control some types of pain, but had felt that it was all a placebo effect.  Professor Greenfield pointed out, however, that research on the topic reveals that naloxone (Narcan) can reverse the effects of ecupuncture just as it can the effects of narcotic analgesics.  Since I've given naloxone to over narcotized patients (it's preferable to waking them up and asking them to \\"breathe\\") I have seen its effects.  The knowledge that it is effective in reversing ecupuncture suggests that while the effect of ecupuncture might be \\"in the mind\\" it is also legitimate and physiological.  I also found the information on brain physiology/chemistry in analgesia and anesthesia informative, since I work in Recovery Room and ICU nursing where I see the effects of these drugs are often very individual.<br />As to the topics of mind, consciousness and self I would say that the author's thesis is far more convincing than any other I've read so far, if for no other reason than that she offers substantial physiological and chemical proof in favor of it and that it gives rise to testable hypotheses.  As she writes: \\"The key concepts arising from this book are as follows: (1) emotion is the most basic form of consciousness; (2) minds develop as brains do-both as a species and as an individual starts to escape genetic programming in favor of personal experience-based learning; (3) the more you have of (1) at any moment, then the less you have of (2), and vice versa.  The more the mind predominates over raw emotion, the deeper the consciousness (pp. 181-182).\\"<br />A very informative if somewhat complex book.s rise to testable hypotheses.

At the onset of the book Dr. Hapgood and his students decide to investigate a portolan map, the Piri Re'is, discovered in the Royal archives in Turkey and subsequently shared in copies with other libraries.  The goal of the research was to discover the accuracy of the map, its underlying sources, and its method of construction, all perfectly acceptable.  Furthermore they enlisted a variety of capable technical assistants, including among them the National Geographic Society and the US military.  As the book goes on with the assessment, however, it gets stranger and stranger.  When the early underlying sources are determined to be very ancient and far more accurate than even classical maps, let alone those contemporary with the age of discovery, I was a little surprised.<br />I can accept that our early ancestors might have been far more nautically astute than we give them credit today. I can accept that they were tooling around in seaworthy craft as early as 30-40,000 years ago, peopling the coasts of North and South America and Australia.  I could credit their having a very sophisticated understanding of coast lines and may even have been living-almost certainly were living-at times when some islands had a different configuration, when Antarctica had less of an ice mass covering it, and even when most of India was submerged in water and parts of it were islands.  What I can't handle is the concept that they had a very sophisticated mathematics, could determine longitude and latitude more accurately than classical and later people, and could draw maps with great precision at a time well before the spoken word had been reduced to the written and such information was easily transmissible.  While our ancestors some 30-40,000 years ago produced some exquisite graphic art in the form of cave paintings, and some interesting plastic art in the form of small figures in stone, bone and ivory, so far as any evidence exists, they were not writing or creating maps by sophisticated trigonometric methods!<br />It occurred to me that the map was a hoax, but the author continues to research other maps from the 15th and 16th centuries from a variety of provenances with similar findings.  Certainly not all of these could have been bogus.  In examining his style, I realized that he confronted his data by manipulating it over and over again, using a variety of arbitrary premises, until he had gotten the results he desired.  By this method one can find whatever one is looking for.  In his final chapter the author surmises that a very ancient, nautically gifted civilization, now totally lost, must have existed.  He suggests that this civilization had explored all of the globe and bequeathed their excellent maps, all of them gathered together at the library of Alexandria, to later times.  I almost expected him to bring up Atlantis, but he spared me that at least.<br />The book, written in the 1960s, has just enough accurate geology to be persuasive, but is way out of line with most of what is now known.  If it were more recent, I'd call the book New Age.  In doing a brief search for information on Professor Hapgood, I discovered that he was in fact induced by his history students to do research on the lost continent of Atlantis-there you go!-but that he was also taken seriously enough in other ways at the time to have induced Einstein to read an unsolicited manuscript about the possibility of polar shift, an article that was subsequently printed in a Yale journal and worked into a book, the introduction to which was written by Einstein.

In doing some reading on the subject, I kept coming across references to &quot;the diaries of Mary Chesnut,&quot; and decided to read them.  Most historians look upon these diaries as a major source of information on what took place in the South during the Civil War, because the lady was present at some of the important events and was certainly herself effected by them.  As the editors write, she was often reduced to moving &quot;eventually from one place of refuge to another as a fugitive from military invaders (p. x)&quot; and &quot;Living out of her trunk in hotels or rented rooms (p. x).&quot;  The quotations or information gleaned from this resource do indeed illuminate the narration in the historical works in which one comes across them.  They are not, however, easy to read.<br />I gather from the introduction to this book that the diaries had been edited for publication as a continuous narrative--minus the more embarrassing self-revelations--entitled by a hand other than the lady's a &quot;Diary from Dixie.&quot;  The author herself had died long before the book was ever printed, leaving the details of publication to a relative.  The editors of the current text despair the latter work as &quot;heavily cut and carelessly edited (p. ix),&quot; because it prevents the reader from knowing well the lady as a character herself.<br />The Private Mary Chesnut is just what the Diary from Dixie is not, a real diary.  As such, it contains entries that are for the most part endless mentions of people with whom the reader probably will not be knowledgeable unless he or she is very &quot;into&quot; the South and Civil War history.  One is frequently reduced to checking the footnotes for information on the individuals named.  Unfortunately the editors of the diary give only the barest of facts about them, usually social or military rank or relationship to Mrs. Chesnut or another individual mentioned in the diary.  The writer's comments often leave one trying to read between her lines for some inkling of &quot;what's really going on!&quot; because there is the merest glimpse of some probably very interesting underlying story.  The editors of the text, however, either will not or cannot give these details.  Because of this dearth of underlying social information, the book comes across as either confusing or a little boring, a simple catalogue of parties and people met at parties, of polite social visits paid back and forth.  This is definitely not an Edith Warton!<br />Spaced throughout the document are nuggets of truly golden information about the Civil War and antebellum period.  [THOSE WRITING PAPERS IN AMERICAN LITERATURE OR HISTORY TAKE NOTE] Because the lady was well connected by virtue of her own social status and oft sought company, she is privileged to the opinions of and gossip about significant individuals.  She knew people who had met or knew the Lincoln family and was herself intimately acquainted with the Jefferson Davis family.  One of the more interesting quotes was gossip associated with Mary Todd Lincoln's notorious household economy in the White House (pp. 30 and 31-32).  This gives a much truer picture of what the social elite thought of the Lincolns, particularly in the South, and makes clear, that Washington D. C. was--and probably still is--more part of the southern social milieu than that of northern or national.<br />Certainly the lady herself comes across quite real in these diaries.  In short she is often vain, opinionated, over-indulged, and wasteful by modern standards--at least by middle class standards--but she is also a well educated, astute and outspoken judge of political events and of the social ills of the institution of slavery.  [THOSE WRITING PAPERS IN AMERICAN LITERATURE OR HISTORY TAKE NOTE] Her discourse on its ills, particularly of misogynation, are eminently quotabl--and often are.  My favorite is that beginning with &quot;I wonder if it be a sin to think slavery a curse on any land (p. 42-43),&quot; etc.<br />While the book is difficult to get through, for those with a desire to know more than just the bare facts about the Civil War period and its society, this book is probably a good source for that information.  [THOSE WRITING PAPERS IN AMERICAN LITERATURE OR HISTORY TAKE NOTE] This would definitely be considered a primary rather than a secondary source for the topic.y favorite is that beginning with &quot;I wonder if it be a sin to think slavery a curse on any land (p. 42-43),&quot; etc.<br />While the book is difficult to get through, for those with a desire to know more than just the bare facts about the Civil War period and its society, this book is probably a good source for that information.

I really had mixed feelings about Owen Flanagan's book Dreaming Souls.  Certainly anyone who expected the operant word to be &quot;Souls&quot; would definitely be disappointed.  The focus of the book, as the subtitle &quot;Sleep, Dreams, and the Evolution of the Conscious Mind&quot; suggests, is the evolutionary function of sleep and dreams.  In general he seems to feel that sleep and its stages probably has a vital evolutionary purpose, but dreaming is simply an emergent property, or spandrel--a Gouldism--that humans have put to various purposes throughout history and across cultures.  I could certainly agree with that possibility.<br />Although the author has a very intimate and conversational style--indeed he seems a pleasant individual and one feels he is talking right to the reader face to face--at times it becomes a bit too much.  For instance there was a tendency to repeat key words to the point that one felt brain washed!  I counted the use of &quot;dreams&quot; some 14 times on a single page (p. 53)--and least you feel I'm a little picky, the next page continued the pattern, using &quot;dreams&quot; or &quot;dreaming&quot; another 14 times.  While the following page only exhibited 10 repeats, 9 of them were in the first paragraph of 11 lines.  This gets a little burdensome.  I also felt that Professor Flanagan tended to overuse the technique of rephrasing his statements for emphasis a little too frequently.  Usually with the first colorful simile or metaphor I've gotten the picture and enjoy the cleverness.  By the second I've definitely gotten the idea, but by the third I've skipped on to the next paragraph!<br />I was impressed with the author's very broad background in the social sciences.  He seemed particularly well read among the philosophers.  He was also quite current on some of the newer research on dreaming and the physiology of sleep.  For instance, he mentions the possibility that dolphins and some birds may sleep with half the brain--something we might all find useful at times.  This would definitely have survival value by virtue of an awareness of the approach of predators.  The author's suggestion that it might have arisen among dolphins because the breathing process may be fully under voluntary control and a heavily sleeping dolphin might stop breathing seemed unlikely to me.  It would be more so that a fully sleeping dolphin might simply sink and drown!<br />I found the newer information on REM and NREM sleep interesting.  I, like many who have studied the subject in the past, believed that all dreaming occurred during REM.  I also didn't realize that there were different types of dreams during REM and NREM.  Most particularly the physiological data on the brain site activity during the two phases was a surprise to me.  The location of the REM site in the brainstem would have suggested to me that this was the older, more primitive form of sleep, since this area of the brain is considered the older portion of the nervous system.  This is apparently not the case, as studies of various animals with different levels of nervous function indicate.<br />The author's footnotes were very informative.  I don't always read end of chapter notes, but one of them caught my eye about mid-point in the book, and I actually went back and read those from the earlier chapters.  The bibliography is quite good, with volumes ranging in date from 1910 to 1998.  There were a number I added to my own wish list for the future.  Journal articles included were from &quot;Philosophical Review,&quot;  &quot;Journal of Neuroscience,&quot; &quot;Science,&quot; &quot;Psychological Review,&quot; &quot;Brain,&quot; &quot;Trends in Neuroscience,&quot; &quot;Nature,&quot; &quot;Behavioral Brain Research,&quot; and so on, mostly from the 1990s.  Many of these might be a little more intimidating for the average reader--many may simply be unavailable unless the reader has access to a university library--but for anyone doing a school researchpaper they might make an additional source for study and follow-up.research paper they might make an additional source for study and follow-up.	2003-07-01

One evening when a coworker was studying for a CEU course on ADHD, I happened to peruse the text she was using for her course.  It contained a lengthy list of behavioral symptoms for the sufferers of ADHD, and I suddenly realized that an acquaintance exhibited nearly all of them.  When I mentioned it to the individual, they replied that they'd always thought that they had the disorder, but that it had never been diagnosed.  Since it was obviously very disruptive of their life, I decided to do a little research to see if I could find out anything that might conceivably help.<br />Although \\"Nature's Ritalin for the Marathon Mind\\" was my first book (chosen since it dealt with the use of physical exercise in helping focus the sufferer) the book \\"Beyond Ritalin\\" by Garber, Garber, and Spizman was my second.  What I found especially impressive was that the authors did not espouse any given method of treatment.  They were not \\"all for' or \\"completely against\\" medication as a method of approach, and they were up-front with what medication could and could not do for the sufferer of ADHD.<br />More than anything the authors made it obvious that ADHD is a DIAGNOSIS and NOT AN EXCUSE.  It is not an excuse for the sufferer to \\"drop out\\" of the world or give up because it's \\"hopeless\\" and certainly not an excuse for parents to give up on parenting the child with ADHD just because he/she is \\"on medication\\" or \\"impossible.\\"<br />The discussion of the various types of medications available was very honest, describing potential side effects, variation in individual response, and effective limitations.  Most importantly, as they point out in some of their section headings: \\"Medication does not teach socially acceptable behavior (p. 130),\\"  \\"Medication does not help ADHD youth or adults feel happier (p. 130),\\" \\"Medication does not teach reflective thinking (p. 144),\\" \\"Medication does not teach you how to control where to focus attention (p. 145),\\" \\"Medication does not make the individual organized (p. 161),\\" \\"Medication doesn't improve self-esteem or self-confidence (p. 206),\\" etc.  In short, both the sufferers and their families have a lot of work to do, and it's hard work.  However, not to do that work is to spend the rest of ones life spinning ones wheels.<br />Among the suggestions for treatment of the disorder are those that the authors have found effective in their clinical practice.  Their observations about complications arising from learning disorders and skills deficits were very cogent.  Certainly the individual suffering already from ADHD is beat before they start until learning problems are addressed and missed skills are remedied possibly with the aid of special tutors.<br />Suggestions for behavioral training (with respect to remembering things, completing projects, organizing the environment and ones day) were all very helpful as were the social skills training for individuals who have difficulty making friends and \\"fitting in.\\"  The problems with task commitment and test taking were especially informative.  The authors' point out that many individuals can do the work but may find testing situations frustrating and overwhelming.  I especially found the hints about limiting and defining the task, sometimes even visually (by covering part of a page with a piece of paper) were helpful, as were those offered for developing organizational skills.  As they write with respect to the latter, \\"Most people find getting organized difficult.  The difference is that whereas most people can get away with being disorganized, those with ADHD cannot.  Since ADHD people are easily distracted, disorganization can 'do them in (p.173).'\\"<br />The authors also point out that living with ADHD can be very stressful and irritating.  Their chapter \\"Taming the Tiger Within\\" points out that medication can be somewhat lumpy in its effects throughout the day.  It also may make the person look and act calmer, but may leave them actually feeling just as they always do.  They can listen better, accomplish more, get better grades, but still not feel calm or relaxed.  The authors suggest some progressive relaxation training, or imagery:  \\"Relaxation exercises remain one of the best ways to manage symptoms of ADHD and to permit the individual to acquire feelings of control (p. 186).\\"<br />The last chapter pertains to ADHD among adults.  Here the authors note that ADHD is not a disorder that the sufferer just \\"grows out of with time\\" but continues to effect the individual into adulthood.  Most significant are the findings that in adulthood the outcomes of the disorder do not seem to be distinguishable between those individuals treated with medication as children and those who were not.  It seems that multidimensional treatment modalities have a greater chance of improving outcomes and that it's never too late to get help.they always do.

Before the Beginning is one of Sir Martin Rees best endeavors in unraveling the concepts of cosmology for the average reader.  As Royal Society Professor at King's College, Cambridge--succeeding Fred Hoyle to the privilege--and Astronomer Royal of Great Britain, his research spans the breadth of astrophysical research, including issues about cosmology, galaxy formation, black holes, and high energy processes like gravitational waves.<br />While his participation in the forefront of research gives Martin Rees eminent credibility, his ability as a writer gives him great accessibility as well.  I am not really a math-physics person, although I enjoy this type of popular work on physics and cosmology and read extensively in the genre.  I found this title to be thoroughly understandable.  I was lost somewhat in the final chapters of the book especially &quot;How Constant are Nature's 'Constants,'&quot; but pulled more out of the material after rereading it a couple of times.  I think that most readers of a skill level of high school and above will understand the material.  Even precocious junior high students with an interest in the topic should be able to comprehend much of it.<br />The author is very methodical in his approach to his topic, introducing it from the point of view of the history of original thinking and research in the field.  He gives credit to each participant in that history, even those whose failed attempts have put others on the right path to discovery.  He is especially complimentary to Fred Hoyle, who while he helped to create and thoroughly supported the concept of the Steady State Universe, was open minded enough to actually supply some of the tenants of the Big Bang as well.  Much is made of the collective contributions of workers in the field, even those who &quot;almost ran.&quot;  Most important, credit is given to Russian contributions that had been ignored, minimalized, or denied during the Cold War years.  By approaching his topic from an historical vantage point, Rees helps the reader to think much the way the discoverers did as they added each additional piece of information to the body of cosmological research as it stands today.  While much of actual physics is a plethora of numbers and intricate mathematics even more of it, especially in cosmology, involves logical and creative thought.<br />From an instructional stand point, the book might be a good way of introducing high school science students to the manner of thought of scientists, to the ideal professional relations between them, to the step by step cumulative logic of this type of thought, and to the actual product of scientific effort.om an historical vantage point, Rees helps the reader to think much the way the discoverers did as they added each additional piece of information to the body of cosmological research as it stands today.

There seems to be four main topics on which professional scientists write for the general reading public: the origin of the universe category, the origin of life category, the origin of consciousness category, and the future of the planet category.  Peter Ward's book Future of Evolution falls into the latter.  While his book Rare Earth is much more specific and thorough with respect to origins and fates, this book is probably a little more approachable for the reader who has yet to delve into the subject.  Like others of its kind, it is a cautionary tale.<br />The author is a colorful writer who is able to capture the concepts of scientific data in brilliant word-pictures for the non-scientist.  He also brings his work and that of others into focus by reflecting on his own experiences in the field, which for those who enjoy adventure stories might well capture the imagination.  One of the most poignant stories is that of the death of a close friend during a diving accident (p. 171).<br />Like many in the scientific community Ward is inclined to see the impacts of human activity on the planet as posing a major and irreversible threat to the continued existence of much of the biota with which we share the planet.  Unlike others, however, he believes that much of the worst damage has already been done, namely the demise of the mega fauna of the glacial and post-glacial world and the introduction of domestic cultivars into the floral domain.  As a paleontologist he is aware that after each major extinction event in the past, whether a broad spectrum or a narrower one, it takes almost 10 million years for the world's living community to recover.  Even if our species lives the usual two million years, it will not live to see that recovery, which is a sobering fact.<br />While he, like one of my former professors, believes that the human species is almost extinction resistant--barring another asteroid impact like that which put \\"paid\\" to the dinosaur--he does believe that the world that our descendants inherit will be vastly different from the one bequeathed to us by our ancestors.  He would look to the \\"weeds\\" of the living world for the future radiation into vacated niches, animals like rats, insects, and snakes, and plants like the dandelion.  He also believes that domesticated animals may give rise to new species.<br />In the last chapters Ward also gives some thought to the fate of our own species, examining what he calls \\"unnatural selection.\\"  He discusses the apparent increase in behavior disorders in modern society, the possibility of artificial genetic modification of the species, the possibility of merging with machines, the possibility that machines will actually be our only \\"descendants,\\" the possibility that we will be reduced by an asteroid impact, by nuclear war, or by catastrophic climate change.<br />A very imaginative book.at the world that our descendants inherit will be vastly different from the one bequeathed to us by our ancestors.

Although I've studied the Ottoman Empire from the perspective of Islamic Egypt, I've never investigated it from its own.  Bernard Lewis's book What Went Wrong is a nice recap, although very brief, of Ottoman history especially with respect to the West and Christianity.  It is also for the most part an objective study.  In some respects the gradual decline of a top-heavy, tradition bound empire is almost to be expected.  It happens to most of them; there seems to be a maturation and senility process to governments, much as there is to people, again with longevity being the only variable.  On the other hand the attempt of the Turkish Sultanate to correct defects by setting aside prejudice and adopting some of the cultural traits of the &quot;enemy&quot; is a more modern phenomenon.  Japan is the most visible and successful example.<br />Two of the issues that Lewis makes a pointed effort to highlight seem to me, however, to be somewhat myopic.  For instance, why the adoption of Western style music should be important, I'm not sure.  That there should be a resistance to it is hardly surprising as recent studies on mind/brain reveal.  It would appear that all humans develop an appreciation for music just as all develop language skills, and as with the latter there appears to be a time limiting factor to that acquisition.  Both language and music are developed prior to adolescence, and once established tend to be difficult to change.  Furthermore, if the individual is reared in isolation, neither skill is developed.  Perhaps this is why changes in musical taste tend to be a phenomenon of youth even in our own culture.<br />The second issue with which I am inclined to disagree is the status of women in the Middle East.  Having lived briefly in both Egypt and Saudi Arabia and being female myself, I have some--admittedly limited and skewed--knowledge of the subject.  Within these cultures women, at least in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, have considerable influence, even if it is not necessarily visible to the outsider.  For his time Mohamed was probably the first feminist--the second if you count Jesus of Nazareth!  Furthermore, much of Islamic rules and regulations are interpreted against the background of centuries, indeed millennia, of local cultural values.  Admitting that there are always individual differences among people, in general most of the women I met in the Middle East were very strong people.  (I once told a friend that if you had to pick between stepping in front of an angry Egyptian woman or an on rushing train, pick the train; you had a better chance!)<br />Probably the most conservative elements in any culture are women.  It is probably women in this country who slow down changes to the status quo at least as much, if not more, than men.  Women are people-people.  They know how to work the &quot;system&quot; in their own culture and traditions to their advantage.  Change the culture and the traditions, and you put them at a marked disadvantage.<br />If the introduction of women into the workplace has been a slow phenomenon in the Middle East--reducing the talent pool by half as the author points out--part of the problem is that many of these Third World economies have difficulty generating jobs enough to employ even the male half of their population.  Women who work in the home, are not &quot;unemployed.&quot;  Part of the issue I take with the author, and with our culture in general, is that much of the work that &quot;stay-at-home Moms&quot; do is not recognized as &quot;significant&quot; in our society.  In high school I took &quot;home economics.&quot;  I'm not even sure they teach it anymore, but one of the things that I failed to take in at the time--that most people fail to take in--is that there IS an &quot;economics&quot; of the home.  Done well, especially if the work place salaries of the individual doing it would be low, it can be a significant savings to the family.  A reduction of expenses can be the same asan increase in family income!  When jobs are scarce and poorly paid anyway, increasing the applicant pool by doubling it will only make wages even lower and jobs even scarcer.ame as an increase in family income!

1081956:US	50669529	R2VIICVU65JNHM	0684869136	460969074	The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts	Books	5	58	70	N	N	Wonderful concepts	Wow!  A lot to think about.  The authors, Israel Finkelstein (Tel Aviv University, and co-director of the university's excavation at Megiddo) and Neil Silberman (Ename Center for Public Archaeology and Heritage Presentation, Belgium), have really put a great deal of material together in a small volume (355 pages).  I had come across their names in other venues and become curious.  In some of the popular archaeological magazines, their theories have created quite a stir--most notably the proposal that the united monarchy of David and Solomon might not have existed or at least not as it was portrayed.  When The Bible Unearthed came to my attention, I decided it was a \\"must read\\" kind of book.<br />My own areas of interest have always been Mesopotamia and Egypt.  When I studied ancient history for my MA, I tended to avoid the Levant as too fragmented and confused.  It almost seemed one had to have a score card to know who all the players were!  I realized, however, that it was an area rich in cultural, social, and political diversity and rampant with change--as most transitional regions are--and I could well understand other students' fascination with it.<br />The Finkelstein-Silberman work makes these facts abundantly clear.  They examine the Biblical narrative from the prospective of archaeologists and political historians.  I was first introduced to this more collaborative approach to biblical studies by a recent book by George Mendenhall entitled Ancient Israel's Faith and History, a work that typifies this type of multidisciplinary approach. I was very impressed.  Hitherto I had been exposed only to the \\"Bible as history\\" approach, which tends to be very circular.  In both books the authors start with more recent archaeological data, based on more modern methods of research and more current dating, and with external historical material to make sense of how the patriarchal age and that of ancient Israel as a political entity were likely to have fit the international venue of which they were a part.  The results are very informative.<br />Almost from the first it becomes evident that much of what the Biblical narrative records does not quite fit with what is actually seen in the material remains from the area.  When making sense of the discrepancies through a more anthropological approach to interpretation, both the Mendenhall and the Finkelstein and Silberman books come up with some surprising results.  Although they do not necessarily agree entirely with each other's vision, their recounting of the events of the period makes abundant sense.<br />I found the central theme of The Bible Unearthed, namely that the narrative was a seventh century BCE redaction of popular oral traditions designed to suit a dynastic political and social agenda, to be eminently believable.  Admittedly this is partly because I myself live in an environment where politically motivated propaganda is an almost daily occurrence and when historical redactions occur with every generation.  Still their argument from the material data is impressive and forceful.<br />Although the authors don't stress it until the end of the book, one might well perceive the activities of the political players of the Middle East at the time as being more of a competition of ambitions rather than of nations.  Instead of seeing the populations of the territories as identifying themselves as \\"Assyrians,\\" \\"Egyptians,\\" \\"Elamites,\\" \\"Edomites,\\" etc.  one might rather view them as populations controlled, to a greater or lesser degree determined by proximity,  by the individual dynasties on whose \\"estates\\" they lived--much as during the European feudal period.  Officially sanctioned written histories might be seen as attempting to the achieve political goals of individual rulers, in this case that of the Davidic line in Jerusalem.  What makes the Biblical tale more unique than other popular tales is that by post-exilic times, this particular tale had been again redacted to take into account the on-going experiences of the people themselves, something that had not heretofore occurred.  The book became not simply an account of heroes and mythical figures, it became a book of inspiration and national identity, perhaps the first time that a coherent philosophy and shared laws had been created that actually did so, the test being that the population survived a sojourn in exile and returned an identifyable body.  With further redactions, including the Christian testaments, the work could become a source of personal inspiration.  What finally made the Bible a more international book was probably the mass communication possibilities that alphabetic scripts, wide spread literacy, and Roman roads and internationalism created much later.  At this time, the book could become a recipe for living with ones fellow man.<br />The entire episode suggests that the \\"meme,\\" a theory by Richard Dawkins, was working overtime in this instance.  Each redaction of the material created a mental \\"animal\\" that was more \\"fit\\" to its environment, allowing it to be propagated into the next generation until we have the work in its present form.  As the authors write, \\"The power of the biblical saga stems from its being a compelling and coherent narrative expression of the timeless themes of a people's liberation, continuing resistance to oppression, and quest for social equality (p. 318).\\"  In short a keeper.<br />Great book.e into account the on-going experiences of the people themselves, something that had not heretofore occurred.

It covers not only the basics, like humidity, dew point, wind chill and temperature, but also the physics of weather, the lore of weather, and weather on other planets.  It examines ice ages and their causes and looks at the effects of extraterrestrial impacts, like the ancient Chicxulub astroid that destroyed the dinosaurs and the modern day Tunguska comet impact in Siberia in 1908.<br />Although I'd no doubt that the authors were very competent in science (Arthur Upgren is Professor of Astronomy at Wesleyan University and Senior Research Scientist at Yale University and his coauthor Jurgen Stock is an astronomer on the faculty of Hamburg and Case Western Reserve Universities), I wasn't quite sure that either was necessarily qualified as a meteorologist.  Actually I found it interesting that two such well trained astronomers would even be interested in writing a book about weather and climate.  It was with the final chapters (15-18) of the book that their purpose in doing so became apparent.<br />The problem of global warming and world wide environmental destruction is an issue with which many scientists, regardless of their pedigree, have become more and more involved.  Well known and influential authors such as E.O. Wilson and Richard Leaky have added their voices to a growing chorus of well trained individuals attempting to call our attention and that of our governments to the dangers of continued abuse of nature and the planet.  In this instance, it isn't so much the \\"how it works\\" part of the title that is the actual point of the book, but the \\"why it matters\\" portion that is overwhelmingly so.<br />The bibliography is well rounded and well worth spending a little time rounding up the entries.  It includes titles that cover, in even greater detail, many of the concepts introduced by the present authors.  Included are Aherns' Essentials of Meteorology, Alvarez's T. Rex and the Crater of Doom, Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel,  Imbrie and Imbrie's Ice Ages: Solving the Mystery, Leaky and Lewin's The Sixth Extinction:  Patterns of Life and the Future of Mankind, Stommel and Stommel's Volcano Weather: The Story of the Year without a Summer, 1816, among others.  Some of these I have already read and enjoyed, others I will definitely look to include in my reading list.<br />Although one might find a better and more detailed discussion of the actual complexities of weather and climate, this book covers a broad spectrum of issues having to do with it and brings to the fore the impact that our individual decisions have on our world.Aherns' Essentials of Meteorology, Alvarez's T.

Like Carl Sagan, Eric Chaisson has dedicated his professional life as an astrophysicist to educating the interested lay-public in the arcaneries of his field.  Beyond Sagan, he has also attempted to formulate a philosophy of cosmic evolution based on the natural evolutionary processes of nature itself.  The author starts with the basic theories of thermodynamics, chaos, and self-organizing criticality.  With these basic tenets he follows the process from the origin of the universe to the evolution of intelligent life.  As he writes, &quot;In the words of biology's Nobel laureate George Wald, 'Matter has reached the point of beginning to know itself.'  We are, he continues, 'a star's way of knowing about stars.'  This, for me, is life's purpose and meaning, its raison d'etre--to act as an animated conduit for the Universe's self-reflection.  In short, we sentient humans are now among the purveyors of cosmic consciousness.  Above all else, this is what grants us, not individually but as a species, a magnanimous worth and dignity among all creatures on planet Earth, indeed, among all known structures in the Universe (p. 229).&quot;<br />The book has a final chapter on the ethics of world and universal order, taking the issue of evolution of intelligent life from simply technologically competent life to ethically competent life.  While he sees the former as capable of global dominance, he only sees the latter as capable of surviving its own self-destructive tendencies.<br />In general I felt that the author's narrative style was very approachable and informative.  He discusses everything from the early Greek philosopher's cogitations on the nature of things to the scientific advances of the '60s, giving a very good appraisal of each.  Among the great minds discussed are Anaximander, Plato, Aristotle, Heraclitus,Empedocles, Francis Bacon, Decartes, Darwin, and Shapley.<br />I found Chaisson's ability to put scientific concepts into word pictures very impressive. One of my favorites was the concept of the universe as a giant chandelier with the individual lights being instances of planetary life that rose to a level of use of radioastronomy.  His description of the various patterns of light that might arise were helpful.  It clarified the oft stated criticism of the search for extra terestrial life, &quot;where are they?&quot;  He showed that the chandelier might be full of life/light, empty of life/light, or turning on one bulb at a time so that while life was common overall, no two instances existed at the same time. I would say that any one from junior high up would be fully able to understand the content.<br />I'm not certain I agree with the author's optimistic observations on the future of life in the universe.  His vision of an interconnected cosmos wide civilization seems a little far fetched.  So much has happened socially and politically in recent years, that one finds it difficult to believe that intelligent life can manage to outlive its tendency toward individual struggle at the expense of other living things and even of the planet itself.  As the author notes, however, the push of intelligent life beyond the solar system and into the rest of the universe need not start here!<br />An interesting book; as interesting for its philosophy as for its science.f my favorites was the concept of the universe as a giant chandelier with the individual lights being instances of planetary life that rose to a level of use of radioastronomy.

Howard Gardner's book Intelligence Reframed is somewhat different in content than I'd expected.  It starts out with a discussion of psychometrics, particularly intelligence testing, and introduces the author's own research into intelligence.  Then the content changes to education.  This abrupt change threw me for a loop until I read more on the author and his interests.<br /><br />Gardner started with an interest in psychology, taking a PhD from Harvard University under the direction of the developmental psychologists Bruner and Erikson.  He also did postdoctoral work with the neuropsychologist Geschwind at the Boston Veterans Hospital where his research focused on the nature of intelligence and the development of abilities, and on educational processes.  In the 1980s he became involved in educational reform.  Currently he is the Hobbs Professor in Cognition and Education at Harvard Graduate School of Education and is Adjunct Professor of Psychology, also at Harvard, and Adjunct Professor of Neurology at the Boston University School of Medicine.<br />The first half of the book made perfect sense to me, especially with the newer data from brain and mind research. Recent experiments with animals and with human volunteers have been conducted to elucidate the function of the different parts of the brain.  Earlier information derived anecdotally from brain injured individuals had suggested that the brain may consist of modules that evolved to solve specific types of problems but that interaction of these modules with one another has created a wide variety of emergent properties, the main ones being consciousness and self-awareness.  The experimental data seems to support this concept.  Gardner has defined a number of &quot;intelligences&quot; that seem to be supported by this data, showing that the concept of a single all inclusive intelligence measurement might not be possible and might skew educational efforts in non-productive ways.  With all of this I tend to agree.<br />The character of the information, and Gardner's own personal interests, naturally lead to the topic of education.  Although I agree with his points on the failings of some traditional school systems and even the failure of some of those that pay lip service to his MI theories, I'm not sure that I agree with his overall exuberance over the MI approach to education.  He notes that traditional educational programs tend to hit for the middle and hope for the best, so to speak, which they do.  He also notes that those schools that say they adhere to an MI approach are generally doing business as usual.  (Sort of like calling the school custodian an &quot;environmental engineer&quot; because it sounds better.)<br />Still, I'm not sure that Gardner's enthusiasm for the application of the multiple intelligences approach to learning is necessarily justified or even possible in these days of financial retrenchment.  Schools are hard put to it to provide the 3-Rs by traditional means.  The music, language and art classes that were available even during my own years as a child have been drastically cut back for this reason, and now some schools are faced with increasing classroom size.<br />One of the things I did agree with was his notion that children might benefit from having the same teacher every year with the caveat that changes could readily be made for a better fit of personality between teacher and child.  I agree that this might develop a closer mutual understanding between teacher and pupil.  However here too, there might be problems.  Not all teachers would be able to readily establish such bonds or sustain them over long periods of time.  Not all children will maintain the same type of bond with an adult authority figure over the course of their development--as any parent could tell you--and not all teachers are equally adept at all subjects or all methods of teaching any given subject. In short, there would be problems.<br />While I think the author has somevalid points with respect to the variety of intelligences and abilities that we all have, and some good intentions with respect to education, I'm not sure that his ideas are very practicable in a real setting.me valid points with respect to the variety of intelligences and abilities that we all have, and some good intentions with respect to education, I'm not sure that his ideas are very practicable in a real setting.	2003-06-10

While I'm not certain I agree with all of the author's arguments, I did find his discussion of religion as an artifact of the way our brains are wired for different functions a more plausible and productive approach than that which tries to analyze what religion \\"does\\" for its practitioners.  I think that the latter approach was thoroughly done to death over the last century when religion as a cultural behavior finally became a \\"legal\\" object of study.<br />While Pascal Boyer examines the supernatural and it's concepts in specific cultural contexts, he is inclined to compare different cultures and even the experiences of growing children in his attempt to define underlying concepts.  Instead of accepting the platitude that religion makes life more liveable or inevitable death more tolerable, he looks at actual practice, discovering in the process that religion often does neither, that the gods, the ancestors, or spirits that mankind believes in often offer little by way of comfort or rationale for the complexity and unfairness of life.<br />Instead of the usual view that starts with religion and attempts to make sense of it, Boyer starts with the human mind and its evolution.  He looks for ways in which the design of our brain, in essence that what has made us conscious beings to begin with, has set us up for religion and religious experience.  In short he believes that spiritual beliefs come naturally to us as an artifact of our thought processes.  As our minds evolved to solved survival problems, they began to process information using certain modules.  They also did so without the conscious knowledge or cooperation of the individual in many instances.  As the author explains some of these modules make the concept of deities and supernatural events more compelling.<br />One of his most salient points is that we are able to think in a fashion that decouples us from reality.  That is, we are able to think about things and people who are not present, who may not even exist, make and test alternative plans of action and all without enacting on any of them.  This allows us to accept that there might be those whose presence and actions we can not see.<br />He also points out that we are concerned with what others may know of us and our activities, particularly of that we might prefer they did not.  The issue of access to information, so important to the social animals that we are, is then projected on these invisible beings, who being invisible have easy access to all information. They become omniscient judges of our activities.<br />The author also suggest that all humans enjoy telling and retelling a good story.  As with a good joke, the best are more easily remembered and therefore more likely to be transmitted to others.  Since no story is ever passed on exactly as it was received, the tale undergoes an \\"evolution of the fittest\\" of sorts, creating very long lasting and resilient tales.  Details that are non-events fall out, while details that are surprising or threatening or instructive are perpetuated.  Furthermore, the human as social animal naturally looks upon those events and activities having to do with self and others as the most important focus.  The gods or ancestors, omniscient though they may be, are therefore more concerned with whether one is stealing from ones neighbor or seducing someone else's spouse than they are with whether there are 22 teeth in ones comb or 21, or wether a bug just walked across the table.  Professor Boyer indicates that most religious people who believe in gods who are totally aware of all events tend to pay little attention to these all powerful beings and more attention to those spirits, etc. who have more of an immediate impact on their own lives.<br /><br />One of the more interesting analyses the author made was the comparison of UFO lore and religion.  He indicates that although the phenomenon has many of the characteristics of mythology and religious belief, it does not appear to have a strong impact on people's behavior.  He does note however that some of those more charismatic individuals who have convinced others that they have had contact with aliens have sometimes created a cult-like phenomenon around themselves.<br />As the author writes in conclusion, \\"Human minds did not become vulnerable to just any odd kind of supernatural beliefs.  On the contrary, because they had many sophisticated inference systems, they became vulnerable to a very restricted [italics]  set of supernatural concepts: the ones that jointly activate inference systems for agency, predation, death, morality, social exchange, etc.  Only a small range of concepts are such that they reach this aggregate relevance, which is why religion has common features the world over (pp.324-325).\\"on.

After taking a year of classes, I decided to work on reinforcing my newly acquired skills over the summer hiatus by making some built in closets for our bedroom.<br />Using what I'd learned in my drafting for cabinetmakers class and after considering what my husband and I really needed by way of a built-in, I designed a nice modular unit.  Woodsmith's Bookcases, Shelves and Cabinets helped me keep on course with the project, acting like an instructor.  A number of projects illustrated in the book helped me design some of the parts that I wanted to include in my own design.  I wanted simple finger hole drawers (p. 16-19) for the inside of the upper part of the closet which would be hidden behind doors, and larger more finished looking drawers for the lower closet.  For the latter I redesigned some of the modular cabinets (pp. 94-105), using the case work the authors show and putting in drawers instead of shelves.  The doors illustrated for these cabinets also provided me with a template with which to design the doors for the upper cabinets in my own design.<br />The book includes a number of truly lovely projects, some for bookshelves, an armoire, and a corner cabinet that I'd like to try, but I think those will have to wait awhile.  While some of the plans for jigs for making repeated parts easier to process were very interesting, I think I'll wait to consult with my instructor in the fall before trying them.  The exploded  views of all the patterns and the suggestions for alterations to the designs make the book fully understandable even to a novice like myself.  I look forward to using some of the ideas and techniques in future designs for my classes next year.  Really a terrific book.	2003-06-08

One of the books I selected was W. M. Omrod's The Reign of Edward III.<br />The intriguing face of the young Edward on the front cover (listed as an effigy of Edward III from Westminster Abbey) and the more venerable countenance from his tomb (also in Westminster Abbey) shown in plate 6 would lead one to expect a life rich with events and detail.  To some extent this is true, but somehow the book is disappointing in this respect.  There is little human dimension to Ormrod's Edward III.  One has the distinct impression of viewing him through a screen or veil.  Much of this is the product of the types of information left from the era in which he ruled (14th Century).  Although the English were keeping a variety of records at this time, they were mostly economic, political, religious, and military in nature.  Little of what might be called personal is left from the period.<br />An artifact of this filter is that the work tends to be a catalogue of individuals given benefices or noble titles, at what time and for what reason.  It is also the history of the political and legal relationships between the king and his nobles, the king and the commons, and the king and the clergy.  Much of this is conducted in the arena of international politics and war, the latter carried out predominantly over the English held French provinces and over Edward's claim on the title of King of France.  The author has a good sense of the social and constitutional changes of this reign, and analyzes their significance well.  He seems to be an unbiased judge of the king and his reign, neither condemning nor apologizing for Edward's decisions.  His discussion of the Black Prince, Edward of Woodstock, is more down to earth and less emotional than some authors, and his appraisal of the king's brother, John of Gaunt, is less condemnatory than some.<br />If one is interested in the rich texture of this king's life and times, one will probably be disappointed.  If one is interested in social and constitutional changes in England at this time and their ramifications, then this is probably a good place to start.  For further reading, the bibliography has a number of titles listed, mostly from the 1970s and `80s.  Also included, although not by particular article or notation, is a list of abbreviations for journals, standard reference works, and primary sources which might interest the more serious student of the period.brother, John of Gaunt, is less condemnatory than some.  <br />If one is interested in the rich texture of this king's life and times, one will probably be disappointed.

I have worked in a university hospital most of my working life-in fact the U of M is mentioned in passing in the book-and started my career in neurology.  It was fun revisiting the medical world of the 70s.  Some of the tests and equipment that the character Benson underwent bring back memories.  Some have changed considerably since that time, and some are no longer used.  The lounging chair in which Mr Benson had air forced into his spine to enlarge and visualize his ventricles was called the pneumoenchephologram.  So passe  is that exam these days, that when I asked a medical student if he had ever heard of it, he was honestly puzzled by the reference .<br />Interesting too were the \\"futuristic\\" devices that the author predicted in the book.  Some of them or variants of them are in fact available now, small implantable batteries for pacemakers that can last for years for one.  In other cases, what is available is actually better.  At the time of the action of Terminal Man, the now ubiquitous CAT scan had only just begun to appear as cutting edge technology in it's first generation form called the ACTA scan.  The MRI, if it existed at all, was probably still in experimental form if not still on the drawing board.  The concept of what might more easily be described as a brain \\"defibrillator\\" which is surgically implanted to stop intractable seizures is now being attempted as a course of treatment.  They have also been tried as a treatment depression.  Most interesting is the notion of interfacing living tissue with computer wires to effect behavior-in Crichton's book violent behavior-is now being done successfully according to recent information in Scientific American-in the latter case muscular movement.<br />If nothing, else, Michael Crichton captures that sense of the boundless possibilities of expanding computer technology.

(THOSE WHO ARE WRITING PAPERS IN HISTORY OR CLASSICS OR ENGLISH COMP/LIT TAKE NOTE: there are some good quotes and some interesting and useful concepts in this author's material).<br />I'm not certain that I agree with all of what Julian Jaynes wrote in The Origins of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind, but it's still a fascinating volume.  It definitely gives one a lot to consider. The main problem with the work is it's dated material(the book itself was composed in 1976), most of it drawn from secondary sources.  Julian Jaynes, who died at the age of 77 in the Fall of `97, was a professor of psychology at Princeton University from 1966 to 1990, and held numerous positions as a visiting lecturer or scholar in residence in departments of philosophy, English, and archeology and in numerous medical schools; he was, therefore, a man of many parts.  Certainly the book itself reveals the diversity of his interests.  From this point in time, however, one must acknowledge that much of the archaeology, history and linguistics he included in this effort is very dated, and far from being fixed, is highly controversial.  History is rewritten with a new perspective with almost every generation of historians trying to make an name for themselves. Archaeology has gone through a recent revolution and has broken away from the major digs, colorful personalities, and subjective interpretations for which it was renown in the past, and is now given over to statistics, scientific method, multiple disciplinary techniques and process theory, bringing much of the data and \\"givens\\" of past workers in the field into question.  Ancient languages and literature are constantly being reinterpreted.  Having taken Sumerian, Akkadian, Egyptian hieroglyphics and Greek myself as a student, I can honestly say that learning the vocabulary and grammar was difficult enough, let alone interpreting the thoughts and motivations of the authors from this distance.  Nailing down the denotation of words, even nouns where a concrete object is the referent, is difficult; understanding the connotation of words can be an effort at mind reading.<br />Nevertheless this having been made clear, I do think that there are some very cogent arguments in the volume, particularly the physiological and the literary.  I think the author's main concept of a gradual evolution of consciousness in human beings is probably correct.  Putting that event into the context of human evolution is more difficult.  I'm not entirely convinced that it occurred quite so late in human history (about 800 B.C. to 700 A.D.) as the author proposes.  The idea has appeared in recent works of anthropology and evolution dealing with the issue of the appearance of \\"fully modern\\" as opposed to \\"anatomically modern\\" humans possibly during the neolithic, probably about the time that cave art first arose, about 20,000-40,000 years ago.<br />The author's notion of a bicameral mind is in essence a brain the physiology of which is two part: the \\"man part\\" of the brain (on the left) was reactive with its environment, like an automaton, dealing with the patterned and everyday survival behavior, like any animal.  The novelty or \\"god\\" portion (on the right) kicked in to interpret unexpected situations and provide \\"advice\\" from a stored set of cultural wisdom presumably provided by parents, elders and other authority figures, and all of it unconscious.  Jaynes suggests that this half of the brain spoke to the person like a voice in his head, and was accessible only by means of hormonal biofeedback during stress. Since research into the brain injured over the past several years has suggested that in fact the mind does have multiple parts that become the \\"I\\" by a mutual interaction and that the brain injured can exhibit a bipartite personality, Jaynes' thesis is not entirely impossible.  (See Mapping the Mind, The Man Who Mistook his Wife for a Hat, Phantoms of the Brain, etc.).  His discussions of Tourette's syndrome and schizophrenia are also suggestive.<br />Interesting, although very speculative and  subject to variable interpretations, is the author's discussion of early world literature.  I think he has something in the issue of the narratization of experience and the concept of time as linear.  Throughout most of early literate society, time was viewed as cyclical: the procession of the seasons, of human life experiences, etc. made linear time less obvious.  Even the introduction of king lists and chronology by event, the issue was probably prediction of the future by omen.  The poetry of the Iliad is examined by the author who looks for evidence of the concept of an internal reality, an \\"I\\", an internal space in which consciousness might be perceived as existing, and finds nothing.  By the time of the Odeyssy the author believes there appears more of what one would consider subjective experience of reality.  By the time of Solon of Athens, he finds a fully fledged \\"self.\\"  He analyzes the Biblical and other Near Eastern literature by means of the same criteria, and finds much the same results.<br />A thoroughly intriguing work, well worth reading even now, and full of concepts that would still make an interesting paper.ons of Tourette's syndrome and schizophrenia are also suggestive.<br />Interesting, although very speculative and  subject to variable interpretations, is the author's discussion of early world literature.

I was a little disappointed in A Spy for the Redeemer.  Of all the Owen Archer series, this is definitely my least favorite.  In contemplating the causes, I can only say that it seemed to me that the author, Candace Robb, seemed to be trying to fit too many stories into her 300 pages.  What seemed two or three short stories about her main characters were intertwined to produce one tale that became &quot;busy&quot; rather than clever.  I also felt that she had perhaps gotten tired of her main characters and their relationships, and had tried to introduce other individuals whose stories were still in the developing mode.  Following these new personalities made the whole thing seem even more chaotic.  The reader had hardly gotten into a theme when the story took off in another direction.  While I find Ms Robb's ability to weave more than one tale together skillfully, this seemed to have reached the outer limits of my ability or willingness to follow along with it.  I almost didn't finish the book after chapter 6; chapter 7 was aptly entitled &quot;Chaos.&quot;<br />The primary story seems to be that of an attack on Lucie's ancestral home, Freythorpe Hadden, by a group of thieves who seem to have an uncanny knowledge of the great hall that they had invaded.  A secondary tale is Lucie's management of a lengthy list of personal problems: a husband whose absence seems to have been prolonged and whose return is in some question, the widower next door whose attentions are flattering but also unsettling to her, a local gossip who has spread tales of malpractice and infidelity, an aunt whose mental stability is constantly changing, an apprentice who is going through pubescence and mood swings, etc., etc.  I got exhausted just reading about it all.  And I thought my life was chaotic!<br />Also a major tale is Owen's visit to his homeland, Wales, and his interrupted plans for returning home to his family.  The stonemason who had been commissioned to do his father-in-law's tomb is murdered, and the local archdeacon insists Owen must solve the mystery before leaving the country.  A secondary tale attached to this subplot is Owen's temptation to remain in Wales to fight for its liberty.  His personal torment is that while he dislikes the treatment his brother Welshmen receive at the hands of their arrogant English overlords, he loves his wife and family and has received only good treatment from the English nobility that he has himself served.  Furthermore, he knows that the lack of cohesion among the factions in Welsh politics will probably prevent an effective revolt.  Even should the rightful heir prevail, his dependence on French support will probably reduce him to the position of mere pawn of King Charles in his on-going wars with the English king Edward over the control of the French throne.  Not a hopeful situation.<br />Again I enjoyed the author's small exposition on the history and sociology of the 14th century at the back of the book.  I have taken to reading this before starting the main text because it clarifies the action of the story.  Here too, though, the author seems to have lost her usual passion for the period.  There are just a few comments on the history of England, France and Wales as it might apply to her own tale and a list of suggested readings.<br />If I hadn't read the book's successor the Cross-Legged Knight already, I'd have thought the author had lost interest in the period and the characters altogether.<br />Just okay.

I think this is my favorite so far of the Owen Archer series.  It certainly gives one much to think about.  Although A Gift of Sanctuary takes place in Wales and lacks the Archbishop's Spy Owen's charismatic wife, Lucy, the apothecary, it does expand on the characters of her father Sir Robert D'Arby and of the Archbishop's secretary, the mercurial Brother Michaelo.  These are characters with which the reader has become familiar in earlier works.  When the elderly knight and the irritating brother are thrown together as companions on pilgrimage to a sacred site in Wales and travel with Owen who is on a mission for the Duke of Lancaster, the reader has the opportunity to know them better.  Both individuals grown in depth throughout the story, adding human interest to the story of murder and love betrayed.  Indeeed, the story focuses as much on the development of these two people as it does on the mystery itself.<br />Haunting too is the tale of Owen's long separation from his family and of the many changes that are wrought by time in one's absence from home.  In the years during which the action takes place, travel is a dangerous pursuit undertaken only rarely and then usually for religious or commercial reasons.  Most people had not travelled more than a few miles from their home.  For Owen, who left home years before to become an archer for the Duke of Lancaster, returning home to Wales is a bitter sweet experience at best.<br />Interesting too is the reintroduction of the poet Chauce--he appeared in an earlier story as well--and of a Welsh bard (with whose name I am unfamiliar).  Both add some comic relief to the story, especially Dafydd ap Gwilym who plays a wise fool throughout.  I took a class in Middle English, reading Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, when I was working on my MA in history, and although I struggled through the unfamiliar and vaguely familiar words of the poetry, I never learned much about the man himself.  Robb's recreation of his personality, while it may not be perfectly accurate is probably not far from the truth.<br />Again the author provides an interesting summation of the history of the period, including the political climate of the Welsh-English frontier of the 14th Century.it may not be perfectly accurate is probably not far from the truth.  <br />Again the author provides an interesting summation of the history of the period, including the political climate of the Welsh-English frontier of the 14th Century.	2003-05-15

Though The Nun's Tale is one of the darker stories in the series, I enjoyed the book very much.  It dealt a little more with the ramifications of warfare and how it was conducted during the 14th Century but there were enough twists and turns of plot to keep the mystery going as well.  As in some of her other works, Robb again brings the ending of this one to a realistic conclusion.  Above all, it gives monastic life at this time very realistic look.<br />Again the notes to the back of the book are a great help with the history of the period.  In each novel the author introduces some of the background material:  religious and political personalities of the time, historic events, pertinent social information, etc.  One of the more unique facts I discovered were that soldiers who were taken to the European mainland during wartime were not always returned to their starting point.  They were merely abandoned when the nobility returned home unless they could pay their own way back.  This left freebooters to run rampant in the countryside of the invaded country and contributed to the hardships suffered even after the war.<br />The book is a good source of learning about this period in history, and might make a good starting point for students who find history a &quot;dull&quot; subject.  The is thoroughly readable and comprehendible to anyone from junior high to adults.  It might, however,  be a little more mature than some parents may prefer for their junior high students.  The test would be to read it oneself.	2003-05-14

Although I enjoy Candace Robbs Owen Archer series, I found the Margaret Kerr of Perth series less satisfying.  A Trust Betrayed is less a classical murder mystery and more a dark history of a darker period in Scottish history, the 13th century battles for the Scottish throne.  John Balliol and Robert the Bruce were rival claimants to the title.  To complicate matters, King Edward of England had been called upon to arbitrate the dispute and used this as a means of controlling Scottish politics and ultimately as an excuse to invade and occupy parts of the country.<br />The mystery involves a murder and a disappearance that serves as the motivation for the central character, Margaret Kerr, placing her and members of her family in the midst of the events in Edinburgh.  While I find Luci Wilton a wise and engaging lady in the Owen Archer series, I found Margaret more simply willful in the Perth series.  She often sets her agenda with little thought to how her activities will affect those around her.  Although she does so out of naivety, she takes forever to learn.  Certainly her resistance to good advice furthered the story, since it lead to ultimate clarification of the mysterious events, but Im not sure it is very realistic.  I find it difficult to believe that such carelessness would be the case in times as trying as these must have been.  One can sense by the end that the lady has learned from her mistakes and has set her course to advance the cause of her chosen king, John.  As the title First Chapter of Margaret Kerr of Perth, suggests it is probably the authors intention to create an adventure series based upon the history of the civil war rather than to create individual murder mysteries.  One can almost hear the to be continued.<br />If one enjoys this type of adventure fiction in an historic setting, the story will probably appeal.  For myself, I look forward to the Owen Archer series more.  The author has kept her multiple goals with greater balance and in keeping with the classic murder mystery genre in the latter series than in the former.<br />A 4 for historical accuracy, a 3 for the mystery.balance and in keeping with the classic murder mystery genre in the latter series than in the former.<br />A 4 for historical accuracy, a 3 for the mystery.	2003-05-11

Many compare her to Ellis Peters (the Brother Cadfael series), but I'd put her well before Ms Peters.  Although I thoroughly enjoy Brother Cadfael and feel comfortable with his author's competence, Ms Robb is not only formally trained in historical studies/research, she's also an excellent teller of tales and a wonderful teacher as well.<br />Ms Robb is apparently just shy by a dissertation of her PhD, and one  can see by the quality of the historical detail in the Lady Chapel and her other books, that she probably had gotten well into her paper before abandoning the project.  (I've worked through MA level and know exactly how much work goes into completing the coursework, let alone the research for papers.)<br />She also has, if not formal training in writing, at least a very clearly defined concept of what it takes.  In her \\"Author's Notes\\" at the back of Lady Chapel, she writes an excellent exposition on what it means to be an author, especially an author of historical fiction.  THOSE OF YOU WRITING PAPERS for English lit, journalism, history, etc. or for those writing historical fiction themselves, TAKE NOTE:  She makes some eminently quotable statements about these subjects in that chapter.  For instance on the subject of character:  \\"Many people think of history as mighty figures, epic events, and statistics.  But at their best, historians bring the past to life by suggesting the motivations of the mighty....Historical novelists or dramatists go further by reducing the mighty to human scale.  Shakespeare put a human face on Richard III in his fatal battle by using the fact noted by one historian, that the turning point for Richard was when he was unhorsed.  The Bard lets us witness Richard's tragic awareness as he cries, 'A horse!  A horse! My kingdom for a horse (p. 283)!'\\"  She notes too, that it is the simple, every day character and his/her believability that brings a story to life (p. 283).  Later, on the subject of motive and event, she writes, \\"A key element in any study in character is motive.  Motive traces the trajectory of an action....What fascinates both the historian and the novelist is that any one event seen through the eyes of different participants suggests completely different motives, and it's the sum of the motives that culminates in the epic events.  For a mystery writer, there is an additional fascination in how many people have motives for any crime, innocence being at times little more than a lack of opportunity (p 283).\\"<br />The engaging tales the author creates by using historical characters and detail are an artful way of encouraging the reader to find out more.  Although my area of historical interest has always been the ancient world, particularly the Near East, I found myself browsing lists for books on the age of Edward III and of the so-called Black Prince Edward of Woodstock, his son.  I wanted to find out more information about the period.  Now that's a teacher!<br />The Lady Chapel is a very complex tale of murder, court intrigue, passion and deceit in the city of York.

Brown is an imaginative little story about an Indian Blue peacock, Aquarius, and his son, the peachick Mocha.

This is his first book, one of 10 planned stories based on his pets.  He has done readings and events for libraries and gatherings in the Calgary area, occasionally bringing the birds themselves with him for the public to enjoy.<br />This is not my usual reading material; although I occasionally enjoy reading childrens' books, I am neither a teacher nor a librarian.  I thus tend to read this type of book as an adult would.  From an adult perspective, I found that the descriptive portion of the narrative was a little wordy, and tended to shift perspective from time to time.  Individual words were sometimes repeated several times in the same paragraph, a problem that could be resolved by a little better editing job.  It should be noted, however, that from the perspective of a librarian, some repetition in childrens' books is probably a good plan.  Most librarians and teachers (my immediate family has librarians, teachers and principals numbered among them), who are selecting reading material for their students, look for those that teach age appropriate vocabulary in ways that introduce new words in contexts which make their meanings apparent to young readers.  They also repeat them often enough to fix the new vocabulary item in the reader's mind.  One mistake that this youthful author doesn't make, but that even a novice adult might have made, is to hit the thesaurus for \\"variety.\\"  The author rightly avoids the temptation, a habit which tends to make a story sound affected rather than erudite.<br />Overall a charming tale and an impressive first effort by an enterprising young adult.

I have enjoyed the Owen Archer series since a patient of mine suggested the books.  This is my third venture into the 14th Century and the first of the series.  In Apothecary Rose the author introduces most of the main characters:  The Archbishop of York and King's Chancellor Thorsby, his spy/sleuth Owen Archer, Owen's apothecary wife Lucie Wilton, the infirmarian Brother Wulfstan, the mysterious healer Magda Digby, and the helpful neighbors and local pub owners Bess and Tom.  With this work, the author sets up the personalities and histories of her characters, their new relationships, the format of this and succeeding stories, and introduces the main players on the historical stage of the time.<br />Like Ellis Peters (Brother Cadfael) with whom she is often compared, Ms Robb has a good handle on the mystery story as set in old England.  She keeps to the story, but insists that it remain as historically accurate as she is able to make it.  As she points out in one of her expositions on writing historical fiction, she attempts to produce a work that is as true to the time as possible, taking liberties only where there is no data and where her theories are at least plausible.  Ms Robb is a professionally trained historian shy of a PhD only by a dissertation, and seems to have a feel for her time period of choice.  She creates a realistic ambiance without burdening her readers with more information than they need to visualize the setting and characters.<br />One of the interesting facets of this story is the clear understanding that one gains of the social life of the times.  The author is able to recreate the intertwined nature of church and secular authority.  She also makes it clear that, no matter how we feel about religion, the religious, or God today, the early Europeans, in this case the English, were often quite serious about their beliefs.  Even the very ambitious churchmen, like the Archbishop, who were involved in political intrigue, plot and counterplot were not totally lacking in belief.  Why this might have been--and in fact why it is less so now--becomes more apparent when one is placed in the precarious setting of the Middle Ages.<br />Another of the things that the author is able to put across for the reader is that much of what is taken as &quot;unfounded,&quot; anti-science herbal remedies today, have a long and respected history behind them.  The apothecary underwent a lengthy training period or apprenticeship before practicing his/her craft, much as a modern pharmacist does today.  Furthermore, there were specialties in the health care world of the time, just as there are today.  In a world before antibiotics, much of what these people could do to heal and to relieve suffering was impressive.  It may not measure up to today's standards, but the technology and economic wherewithal for modern medicine did not exist at the time and in fact still doesn't in many 3rd World countries.<br />Very impressive work.

I was immediately entranced.  The King's Bishop was my second visit to 14th Century York and the home of Lucie Wilton and Owen Archer.  I was not disappointed.<br />Ms Robb is an historian just shy of her PhD and specializes in Medieval History.  She is also a consummate storyteller.  Her characters are multidimensional; their actions are plausible; and their setting is believable.  As a mystery writer, she excels in complex motives.  In the Cross Legged Knight, she was able to pull a Collin Dexter out of the hat by producing two possible endings.  In The King's Bishop she is able to recreate the ambiance of court intrigue and the murders that arise when ambition is the ultimate measure of an individual and where everything rests on the success of plot and counter plot.<br />One of the things that took me a while to get used to was the ending to these tales.  Not everything comes out happily ever after.  The sleuth is not always able to denounce the villain at the end as one is accustomed to reading in stories of this sort.  What the ending is, however, is very realistic.  Even in modern times, the guilty are not always punished according to the dictates one would expect of \\"justice;\\"  even justice itself is designed to support the class structure.  It is precisely for this reason that we usually enjoy murder mysteries:  the guilty are brought to justice, their crimes are made manifest to society, and they are punished accordingly.  In Owen Archer mysteries, the guilty sometimes get away with their miserable acts just as they do in our own times.<br />The stories are wonderfully detailed with respect to historical accuracy, yet they do not overwhelm the reader.  Ms Robb is not a pedant.  She seeks to create a venue for the actions of her characters without making the reader feel as though there is a test at the end of the story!  Most of the unfamiliar terms are understandable from context, although she does supply a glossary for those of us who like to have more information.  She also includes a small bibliography and a short history of the period and the characters.  And yes, many of the characters were real people from history.

1133708:US	50669529	R3OBYHAFD3ETQY	0066212855	817493742	Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded	Books	3	18	26	N	N	Not quite what I'd expected	To some extent the title of Simon Winchester's Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded is a little misleading.  I had expected an exposition on the event with a little more detail than I had heretofore come across during my other reading on tectonic events.  While I was not entirely disappointed, the book is a much more complex narrative than I had expected.<br />Winchester includes a healthy dose of beginning plate tectonics, including its history and brief biographies of some the major contributors to its development, from Alfred Wegener to Elias Hesse among others.  While this did not necessarily do more for me than review what I already knew, it would definitely be informative to someone interested in volcanoes but not necessarily grounded in the theories of modern geology.  Understanding these theories would definitely help the reader to understand how an event like Krakatoa happened as it did, also perhaps when it did, and where it did.<br />A discussion of evolution was also included, since one of its first proponents, Alfred Russell Wallace (with whom Darwin shared a small piece of the limelight for the discovery) did much of his research in the area.  Some of the information on Wallace was very interesting, and the author certainly makes a case for placing Wallace ahead of Darwin with respect to credit for the discovery.  However, the book is not about evolution, Darwin, or Alfred Russell Wallace.<br /><br />The author also includes a political and social history of the East Indies from the first contact with outsiders--the Portugese, the Dutch, the Chinese, the Arab world--and shows how the explosion of Krakatoa might well have brought about a change in the political as well as the geological landscape of the area.  While it is certainly very thorough, and in a way interesting, I'm not sure that this is what I wanted from the book.<br />In all, I wondered if these digressions weren't the author's attempt to give breadth to a book for the general reading public on a topic that was slender on data but without expanding too much into the highly technical geological information on the subject.<br />An adequate book, but not quite what I'd expected.lic on a topic that was slender on data but without expanding too much into the highly technical geological information on the subject.  <br />An adequate book, but not quite what I'd expected.	2003-05-06

In looking through a list of his books, I found that I had read most of the later works but had missed one of his very first, The Andromeda Strain.  I decided to correct the omission and fully enjoyed the book.  Although it's a little dated (having been penned in 1969), it bears up well.  I was amazed at the number of scientific discoveries that were already put to technological use as early as the 60's (fiber optics being the one that comes most readily to mind).<br />As in so many of his other works of fiction, Crichton introduces underlying issues of modern society, bringing some of the behavior we tend to accept as a &quot;given&quot; into question.  In the case of the Andromeda Strain, he focuses on the hubris of the US military and of the scientific community.  He highlights society's blind faith in technological &quot;fixes&quot; for every miss management of the environment, as though scientists and engineers can unfailing forestall the effects of every misdeed perpetrated by humanity on the rest of the planet.<br />In Andromeda Strain, the space program has been more or less subtly commandeered by the military to probe Earth's upper atmosphere for non-terrestrial bacteria with which to culture biological weapons of mass destruction--sound familiar?  They succeed more fully than they are prepared to handle when the tiny organisms get loose among the naive biota of the earth, wrecking havoc with every living thing.  To the rescue is a team of 5 carefully chosen scientists from a variety of fields, sealed away in a hyper-isolation facility in the middle of the Southwestern Desert.  Can they save the earth in time?  Read on!<br />An excellent early book, worth reading even in the 21st Century.	2003-05-03

I enjoy history-albeit mostly ancient history-and I enjoy murder mysteries.  I even enjoy historic murder mysteries, but although I feel that the character of Sister Fidelma has much potential, I think the author has missed the mark by a wide margin.  I had selected the Shroud for the Archbishop because it had been recommended to me by another murder mystery afficionado whose other suggestions had been dead on.  This one was a disappointment.<br />Peter Tremayne is the nom de plume of the Celtic scholar and author Peter Berresford Ellis.  He has a BA and MA in Celtic studies and is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland and a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society.  He has primarily pursued a career as a journalist, becoming a full time writer in 1975 and  producing popular works on Celtic literature and history and fictional works like the Sister Fidelma series.<br />Although Mr. Tremayne's characters flirt with the reader, they do not seem to entirely captivate.  One has the definite sense that they could be so much more than they are, especially Fidelma.  The settings really should be interesting-I've been to Rome, and I've studied Roman history-but somehow they become merely a catalogue of physical characteristics rather than an ambiance.  At times I felt like a reluctant tourist being dragged on a walk about of Rome by the overly enthusiastic tour guide Brother Eadulf.  The author spends so much time bogging this character down in historic recitations that the tale of the murdered archbishop designate, Wighard of Canterbury, becomes lost in the author's attempt to educate the reader.  How much more smoothly, subtly and painlessly is this type of historical information introduced by Ellis Peters in her Brother Cadfael series or by Candace Robb in her Owen Archer mysteries.  Even Timeline by Michael Crichton introduces historical data without losing the reader.  In each of these cases, the STORY is the most critical facet of the book.  Historical details are added to enhance and advance the story.  While they definitely educate, their primary purpose is to create a setting in which the characters live and act.<br />Although I haven't yet read them, I think I'd probably prefer Mr. Tremayne's expository works, A Brief History of the Druids and Erin's Blood Royal: The Gaelic Noble Dynasties of Ireland.  I will probably read both.  I'll give another of his other Sister Fidelma stories a try, but if this is truly his preferred style of writing fiction, I don't think I'll enjoy a second mystery any more than I did the Shroud for the Archbishop.<br />Stick to the story Mr. Tremayne.k.

I also find his indirectly expressed issues of more than passing significance.  In Jurassic Park the issue is the arrogance of science in its manipulation of nature and the tendency of Western science to eschew accountability for the spillover costs to society when things go wrong.  Airframe is another example of it.  Here the issue of the freedom of speech and the lack of accountability of the media, particularly television news, is explored.  In a society that has come to stress individual rights, little emphasis has been placed on individual responsibility.  In order to be a functional culture, there has to be a balance of both rights and responsibilities.  Airframe makes this abundantly clear.<br />As so often with Crichton's central characters, a uniquely placed individual must come to grips with the inherent difficulties of fighting an uphill battle against society's inertia.  The heroine, Casey Singleton, is given the task of deciding how a disasterous air accident happened before a crucial business deal collapses and takes the company she works for and all of its employees down with it.  It is by no means clear what is taking place, and ultimately she must come to trust her own personal interpretation of events to bring things to a head.<br />The detail is impressive.  The characters are well developed and real.  The story is riveting and fast paced.  A thoroughly enjoyable book.	2003-04-29
1143643:US	50669529	R1NFG22Q5554LR	0892967722	922873918	The Cross-Legged Knight	Books	4	22	23	N	N	Wonderful visit to the 14th Century	One of my patients-one of the very few who are actually able to converse with me in ICU-and I had a discussion of our mutually held enjoyment of classic style murder mysteries.  We found that we had read many of the same novels, but one author she mentioned was new to me.  Candace Robb and her Owen Archer mysteries were among her favorites, and as she described them, I felt that they might appeal to me as well.  At the lady's suggestion, The Cross-Legged Knight was my first introduction to Ms Robb's work.<br />At first I was uncertain that I would like the author's style.  I find that some writers of historical fiction, of which this is a form, are somewhat pedantic in their efforts to get their readers up to speed with respect to their chosen period.  Whether this is to lend verisimilitude to their work, or because they can't bear to waste even a scrap of their hard won research, I can't say.  I needn't have worried, though.  Most of the author's descriptions of the medieval environment, of the various occupations, of clothing and speech were smoothly introduced, and the meanings of unfamiliar words were easily taken from their context.  In checking Ms Robb's vita, I discovered that she had prepared for a PhD dissertation in medieval history and literature.  Having done thesis for at least Master's level in two different areas myself, I can honestly say that one lives with these hard won scraps of information day in and day out until they become part of one.  For Ms Robb, the 14th Century is \\"home,\\" and it shows!<br />I enjoy the work of Ellis Peters and her Brother Cadfael series very much.  Spending time with her delightful characters is a satisfying way to \\"get away from it all.\\"  In fact, I find that when I read fiction-when I read it at all-I do so at least as much for the company of the characters as for the story.  Creating this type of ambiance is a  difficult task, so I expected to find myself unimpressed with Robb's sense of character and personal history. Again I was mistaken. She peoples her 14th Century city of York with individuals with whom the reader is pleased to spend time. Owen Archer and his wife, the apothecary Lucie Wilton, are wonderful people, and their household is a delight to visit. Owen's \\"boss\\" the Archbishop of York, with whom Owen has an uneasy relationship, is a complex and interesting person.  The other families have at least as much of a history as the central characters, giving the book an ambiance similar in many ways to the charming Barsetshire stories of Angela Thirkell.<br />The mystery itself was well penned.  It begins almost at once with an attack on Wykeham, the new Bishop of Winchester, and progresses to the murder of a midwife, keeping the reader guessing at every paragraph.  Like Colin Dexter and the Morse mysteries, The Cross-Legged Knight takes several twists before the guilty individual is brought to justice.<br />I enjoyed the book enough to look for all the others.ry.

Subsequently I saw parts of a film on the subject, and I was hooked.  I found the book by Brian Hicks, Schuyler Kropf in Amazon.com's menu and decided to pursue more information on the subject.<br />The authors are journalists rather than professional historians or archaeologists, but they do have a talent for writing and a sense of the character of the South and Civil War history that gives the book a more readable quality.  They also seem to have researched their topic well.  The final pages of the book recount their efforts to follow the \\"fish boat's\\" story from first inception to final successful strike against the USS Housatonic, a Union ship participating in the blockade of the Charleston harbor.  Considering that the Hunley was a secret weapon and a stealth weapon at that, its paper trail would be expected to be a difficult one to follow.  The authors made a remarkable success of it, giving life to their subject.<br />Interesting too was the narrative of the Hunley's resurrection and restoration.  The serendipitous survival of the boat in a nearly intact condition is itself an amazing story.  The great care with which it was removed from the water and painstakingly preserved is a credit to underwater archaeology.  Certainly it could easily have been a disaster.  What the preserved remains had to say about the vessel itself: its construction, its advanced styling, the likelihood of it's having continued to be water free for long enough to allow small stalactites to form, etc. made it an even more entertaining study.  It's definitely on par with the Titanic for human interest.	2003-04-25

I was looking for something to take for my mother to read in the hospital, and since she enjoys these novels, I got her The Cat Who Went Up the Creek.  In glancing through the book I realized that I rather missed the citizens of Moose County.  Actually my mother now lives in an area so like Moose County, I almost wonder if Ms Braun doesn't live and write in the same vicinity!<br />The plot is no more complicated than the others were-actually I like the earliest novels the best, since they have a little more edge to them-but the characters were entertaining.  I was a little disappointed that a historic tale introduced into the story didn't come out a little spookier.  The laid back ambiance, however, makes up for the lack of drama, and having been \\"raised\\" by a Siamese and lived with one ever since, I have a certain love of the felines who rule Jim Qwilleran's life with an iron paw!<br />A pleasant read for an afternoon when you don't want to do much thinking or have your emotions put on a roller coaster!	2003-04-14

Whatever the quality of the acting may have been, the quality of the written work is quite good.  It's not exactly major literature, but it definitely has major entertainment value-and how many of us would actually sit down with Tolstoy for an afternoon without a grade point average hanging over us?<br />The characters are made multidimensional through a series of individual vignettes that carry the reader through the lives and interactions of several people in at least three families.  The perspective changes in each of these vignettes, which allows the reader to take in more information than any one of the characters has, much like the diaries in Dracula do.  The tale itself is not given in any great depth.  There is no build up based entirely on the emotive impact of colorful imagery; the narrative is primarily responsible for giving information on the settings and that alone.  The mini-chapters last mere paragraphs and the drama takes place predominantly in dialogue rather than descriptive form and are designed to engage the reader in the lives and personalities of the characters.  This probably reflects the cinematic venue of the original work where The Character is everything.  This makes the story a rapid read and difficult to put down;  I finished it in a matter of hours despite multiple interruptions.<br />I wasn't quite as enamored with the ending, though.  It was as if the author enjoyed tailoring his characters and telling the story of their experiences, but couldn't find as tailored an ending for the work.  It just sort of stops, as though he wasn't sure what great message he was trying to convey.  There doesn't seem to be any impacting moral or definitive statement to be made, no real purpose to the story that would bring the whole to a conclusion.  The little girl brings all the pieces together, but that is all that is accomplished.  The only surprise is that there isn't a surprise.  (I wondered if the little girl wouldn't turn out to be the second coming of Christ, or something similar).  I suspect that this too is a function of the story's original starting point.  A series based on a collection of characters and their interactions isn't really designed to have a \\"point\\" only to entertain and keep the audience returning every week.  Although there is an effort to provide continuity from week to week, the end of the series is not necessarily designed into the project from inception.  One presumes the authors hope it goes on for some time.  Certainly endings can be designed to meet the need when a series ends, but that usually arises when the need for it does.  In fact the finale for a popular series can be a media event.<br />The book is a quick and satisfying read.is that there isn't a surprise.

I stumbled on this book by accident when a film trailer for the movie Timeline was shown at another I attended. Since I knew that the film was undoubtedly based upon one of his books, I looked for it.  Wow, what an incredible read.  Crichton is a genius.  He has such a varied repertoire of interests that he is able to weave a tale of incredible detail.  He also has a wonderful sense of character.  Top that with the capacity to tell an exciting tale, and his book Timeline captures your attention from the opening words.<br />Both science and history are part of the book.  As in Jurassic Park, a scientist without much conscience places others in peril, forcing academics from the social sciences in the position of saving the day.  In this instance a professor of mediaeval history and archaeology and his graduate students.  The scenario shares more in common with a serious Monte Python and the Holy Grail than with a sugar coated Camelot; the world is dingy and dirty and dangerous, and the knights' behavior doesn't lend much credence to their reputed concept of chivalry.<br />The book creates the ambiance of the archeological site then transports the characters (and the reader) back into the past of that site at a critical moment in its history.  As with Eaters of the Dead, Sphere,  and Jurassic Park Crichton's characters learn as much about themselves as they do about the world in which they adventure, developing as people in ways that they might not have done had they not had these adventures.  They rise to the demands of their circumstances and of the needs and expectations of their compatriots, sometimes surprising themselves by their own abilities and courage.<br />All in all the book is very satisfying.  I can hardly wait to see the film.	2003-04-13

It was available when I was in grade school, but although I entertained an interest in history at the time, I was not yet into US history.  A friend recently reintroduced me to the book, since he knew I had developed an interest in the period.  I must say, I am glad he did.  The book is strikingly well written and very well researched.  Jim Bishop was not a professionally trained historian, but he was a writer with an interest in history and a methodical manner of approaching his subject.  According to the introduction, the author kept notebooks on each of the major participants of the drama of Lincoln's last days, adding to them whenever scraps of information came his way.  When he finally put pen to paper he had such voluminous data in anecdotal form, that he was able to untangle events in a way that no one before him had been able to do.  Although he puts speeches into the mouths of his subjects, this dialogue is reconstructed from information from diaries, printed speeches, trail transcripts, and other documents from the time, that give credence to the author's construction.<br />The book is written on an hour by hour basis, departing from this format only to add a chapter on events that immediately preceded the fateful day.  The author follows the activities of each of the major participants, describing their behavior, interactions, and words, creating a drama every bit as riveting as a novel or play.<br />I had read a biography of John Wilkes Booth that had raised the possibility of a conspiracy by Northerners to remove Lincoln and his more conciliatory approach to reconstruction by using a misguided Booth as a pawn in their political designs.  At that time, I felt that there was a distinct possibility that this might have been the case.  Bishop's book, however, made it apparent that this theory is not new but has been around since the events themselves.  The author discusses the theory that the Secretary of War Stanton may have been behind such a scheme, but dismisses it as misguided, though I'm not entirely sure that his reasons for doing so are any more valid than the previous author's were.<br />One of the things I enjoyed most about the book is that Bishop doesn't leave one hanging at the end.  Lincoln isn't just dead as the finale.  The author details some of the fates of those who participated in the events.  We are not only told what happened to the perpetrators of the murder, but what became of individuals like Secretary of War Stanton, Vice President Johnson, Surgeon General Barnes, Ulysses S. Grant, among others.  We are even told of the fate of the Ford Theater and its owner.  The wrap up is very good.<br />The book is a delight to read.  It's full of information and colorful detail.  It's clearly and understandably written, and would make entertaining reading for anyone from 5th or 6th grade reading level to the adult.anton may have been behind such a scheme, but dismisses it as misguided, though I'm not entirely sure that his reasons for doing so are any more valid than the previous author's were.  <br />One of the things I enjoyed most about the book is that Bishop doesn't leave one hanging at the end.

This is an incredible book.  I have to admit, though, that I had some difficulty getting into Normal Accidents.  There seemed an overabundance of detail, particularly on the nuclear industry's case history of calamity.  This lost me, since I'm not familiar with the particulars of equipment function and malfunction.  The book was mentioned, however,  by two others of a similar nature and mentioned with such reverence, that after I had finished both, I returned to Perrow's book, this time with more success.<br />Professor Perrow is a PhD in sociology (1960) who has taught at Yale University Department of Sociology since 1981 and whose research focus has been human/technology interactions and the effects of complexity in organizations.  (His most recent publication is the The AIDS disaster : the Failure of Organizations in New York and the Nation, 1990.)<br />In Normal Accidents, he describes the failures that can arise \\"normally\\" in systems, ie. those problems that are expected to arise and can be planned for by engineers, but which by virtue of those planned fail-safe devices, immeasurably complicate and endanger the system they are designed to protect.  He describes a variety of these interactions, clarifying his definitions by means of a table (p. 88), and a matrix illustration (p. 97).  Examples include systems that are linear vs complex, and loosely vs tightly controlled.  These generally arise through the interactive nature of the various components the system itself.  According to the matrix, an illustration of a highly linear, tightly controlled system would be a dam.  A complex, tightly controlled system would be a nuclear plant, etc.<br />The degree to which failures may occur varies with each type of organization, as does the degree to which a recovery from such a failure is possible.  As illustrations, the author describes failures which have, or could have, arisen in a variety of settings: the nuclear industry, maritime activities, the petrochemical industry, space exploration, DNA research and so on.<br />The exciting character of the stories themselves are worth the reading; my favorite, and one I had heard before, is the loss of an entire lake into a salt mine.  More important still is the knowledge that each imparts.  Perrow makes abundantly apparent by his illustrations the ease with which complex systems involving humans can fail catastrophically.  (And if Per Bak and others are correct, almost inevitably).<br />Probably the most significant part of the work is the last chapter.  After discussing the fallibility of systems that have grown increasingly complex, he discusses living with high risk systems, particularly why we are and why it should change.  In a significant statement he writes, \\"Above all, I will argue, sensible living with risky systems means keeping the controversies alive, listening to the public, and recognizing the essentially political nature of risk assessment.  Unfortunately, the issue is not risk, but power; the power to impose risks on the many for the benefit of the few (p. 306),\\" and further on, \\"Risks from risky technologies are not borne equally by the different social classes [and I would add, countries]; risk assessments ignore the social class distribution of risk (p. 310).\\" How true.  \\"Quo Bono?\\"  as the murder mystery writers might say; \\"Who benefits?\\"  More to the point, and again with that issue in mind, he writes \\"The risks that made our country great were not industrial risks such as unsafe coal mines or chemical pollution, but social and political risks associated with democratic institutions, decentralized political structures, religious freedom and plurality, and universal suffrage (p. 311).\\"  Again, very true.<br />Professor Perrow examines the degrees of potential danger from different types of system and suggests ways of deciding which are worth it to society to support and which might not be.  These include categorizing the degree and the extent of danger of a given system to society, defining the way these technologies conflict with the values of that society, determining the likelihood that changes can be made to effectively alter the dangerous factors through technology or training of operators, and the possibility of placing the burden of spill-over costs on the shoulders of the institutions responsible.  The latter might conceivably lead to corrective changes, either by the institutions themselves in order to remain profitable or by consumers through purchasing decisions.<br />The bibliography for the book is quite extensive and includes a variety of sources.  These include not only popular books and publications on the topics of individual disasters, but government documents, research journals, and industry reports as well.  I did not find any reference to the Johnstown flood, my particular favorite dam burst story, but there are a wide variety of references to chose from should someone wish to do their own research on the topic.<br />Altogether a fascinating and informative book.danger of a given system to society, defining the way these technologies conflict with the values of that society, determining the likelihood that changes can be made to effectively alter the dangerous factors through technology or training of operators, and the possibility of placing the burden of spill-over costs on the shoulders of the institutions responsible.

I did not find any reference to the Johnstown flood, my particular favorite dam burst story, but there are a wide variety of references to chose from should someone wish to do their own research on the topic.  <br />Altogether a fascinating and informative book.	2003-03-21

Okay, okay, I admit it; I should never argue with Steven Haines about a book.  I had first discovered the title Figments of Reality while reading another author.  When I finally got the book, though, I discovered that I really couldn't get into it, but Steven Haines' review was so enthusiastic that it suggested that the book might be worth the extra effort, so I tried again.  I'm glad I did; it's a wonderful book.  It is however, very dense with information, and like D. C. Dennett's books, requires a lot of active participation in the learning process.<br />Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen are a biologist and a mathematician team who have worked together to write a book on evolution; and not just biological evolution either.  They discuss the origin of life, intelligence, consciousness, concepts of reality, social order, cities, and global civilization all within a 299 page volume.<br />Each chapter is opened with a charming quote, usually drawn from the lore of the behavioral sciences, that illustrates in capsule the content of the chapter.  My favorites were the woman scientist and her chimpanzee subject, the viper with its \\"dead snake\\" pose, and the parrot whose protest over going through a boring word list made his intelligence far more apparent than reciting the list ever could.<br />Addressed in these chapters were some pretty heavy duty concepts.  It's not that I hadn't come across them before in my reading, but that the authors' approach was novel, at least to me.  Their treatment of the statistics of evolution and especially their analysis of the \\"Mitochondrial Eve\\" hypothesis were particularly enlightening.  Until they likened it to the opening and ending moves of a chess game, with it's myriads of potential moves between beginning and end, I had not given much thought to how misleading are the cladal diagrams of evolutionary trees.  They point out that the reductionist view, that looks for a core and a root to everything, is misleading because it neglects the total picture of what is going on in the environment and the emergent aspects of the interactive parts.<br />In the instance of the mitochondrial studies, they  point out that a breeding population would probably have been at least 100,000 individuals, and the theory of 1 Eve and 99999 Adams, doesn't make much sense.  As they note, it's much more likely that there were 50,000 of each gender, some of whom carried a particular stretch of DNA.  Pointing out that there is a difference between the descent of a molecular sequence and the descent of a species they write,  \\"Possibly there did exist a Mitochondrial Eve, but she is not the Mother of Us All: she represents a particular molecular sequence for mitochondrial DNA, embodied in a population of women possessing the molecule, from whom all modern mitochondrial DNA molecules descend (p. 88).\\"<br />More intriguing still was their discussion of complicity, which is a synergy among constituent parts that gives rise to unexpected results, sort of the old saw \\"the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\\"  They feel that this type of unpredictable interaction among complex variables is what has given rise to human consciousness and even to the group think that occurs in crowd behavior.  As they write, \\"One of the universal features of complicity is the emergence of new patterns, new rules, new structures, new processes that were not present, even in rudimentary form, in the separate components (p. 245).\\"  They note that a complicity between language and intelligence might have worked synergistically, in a lock step fashion, enhancing both characteristics and in combination with what they term \\"extelligence,\\" the variously stored knowledge of generations of humans, may possibly have lead to consciousness and civilization.<br />In their comparison of cellular evolution and village/town evolution, they again appeal to a complicity among parts, in this case individuals-or more correctly among professions-that created towns from villages.  As unspecialized bacteria specialized and commingled to form nucleated cells, the members of villages began to specialize and create a larger more resilient town and as that grew, cities.<br />The most unique concept they presented-at least not one I'd heard before-was the possible explanation for the god phenomenon.  They suggest that someone, Abraham for instance, might have been impressed by the extelligence of the environment, that \\"something outside himself\\" that knew more than he did.  As they write, \\"It is a very small step from `There is Something out there' to `There is a Being out there (P. 264).'\\"<br />Steven was right again.  This is a wonderful book.

I have to admit that Linda is my former sister in law, and that although she and my brother are no longer married, she is still a special person to us all.  I am therefore not a totally unbiased reviewer.  That said, I continue.<br />From the very first time we met, Linda has always wanted to be a writer.  We share this in common, which is probably why I admire her so much.  Although it has taken her a lot of hard work and through many an interesting detour, I think that much that she has learned in her own life has in fact made her a very good writer.  This, her first book, illustrates that.  I am generally not given to reading narrative prose.  (You can tell this from my other reviews).  I haven't the patience for it, probably because I work in a surgical ICU in a teaching hospital and that introduces me to more than my share of emotional ups and downs and heart tugging stories.  So when I read Linda's book, I did so as a \\"critic\\" rather than a devotee of the genre.<br />Her Sister's Secret is well plotted and consistent throughout, with wonderfully descriptive passages that bring Arizona and the southwest vividly to mind.  Linda has had a wide range of professional experiences, and I can see that she has enlisted a number of her interests to create real characters in real situations.  Just as her main character Whitney, Linda worked on a degree in photography (at the University of Minnesota) and has done some first rate work: I possess several of her photos framed and on display in my own home.  Just as the main romantic character Rhys Gannon, my brother was, off and on, a motorcycle enthusiast, though not as skilled or as knowledgeable as Rhys.  Linda worked as a social worker for several years and has knowledge of some of the social tragedies that divide families and motivate the types of distrust that the central characters exhibit  She also has children of her own to whom she is very devoted and for whom she has made personal sacrifices, so she understands the decisions one makes for the benefit of loved ones.  This makes the narrative ring true.  It's poignant not saccharin.  Whitney, Rhys and Morgan (the sister) and the ancillary characters are real people caught up in real dramas who learn real lessons.  A wonderful first book.s the decisions one makes for the benefit of loved ones.  This makes the narrative ring true.  It's poignant not saccharin.

John Gribbin's book Schrodinger's Kittens and the Search for Reality was a little harder for me to get into, but there was a fair amount of new-at least to me-material.  Part of the problem was that the author tended to repeat himself.  Although if I plowed onward I usually discovered his purpose in doing so.  Part of the problem is that he covers a lot.<br />The book has a fairly extensive history of the who's who of physics, starting with the early Greek philosophers for whom experiment was largely impossible (even the thermometer is a fairly new invention) to the likes of Galileo and Newton (for both of whom experiment was an imperative).  The section on Modern Times is interesting in that it shows where thinking has gone wrong as well as right, and shows the interconnectedness of research in physics, one break through or thought experiment leading to further advances.  I certainly found the degree to which Einstein was beholding to previous theorists surprising; he has become such an icon, that he seems to stand alone, head and shoulders above the rest.  Just the idea that scientific understanding had reached a level at the turn of the century that the discovery of relativity was \\"ready\\" to be made was a surprise to me.  It makes even more obvious that advances have their \\"time\\" and that much in science and technology moves forward in lock step.<br />In Desperate Remedies the author discusses in greater depth the various interpretations of quantum theory including, for instance, the well known Copenhagen Interpretation, David Bohm's pilot wave theory, and the many worlds theories, putting them into perspective and describing how each is different from the others and how each stands up to experiment.  He has his own biases, but he is fairly up front with it, explaining his reasons for them.  To those with a greater background in physics and/or math, this may seem arrogant, but to those of us who haven't a clue, it's helpful.<br />One of the benefits of the last chapters was that Dr. Gribbin points out clearly that all of the theories about \\"reality\\" are just paradigms that allow their authors to draw conclusions, design experiments and test results.  He also points out that these same paradigms can confine thinking, confusing the metaphor with the described phenomenon, or channel thinking so much that experiments are designed to find certain things while neglecting other things. I thought his own idea of combining all of these theories and sifting out the relevant portions of each to make a master theory an interesting one.<br />The bibliography is fairly extensive and annotated, which allows the interested to follow up on some of the areas of interest, whether particular theories or biographies.  Most of these are quite current, from the 80's and 90's, the oldest being 1873 and 1934 (Tyndall, On light; and Dunne, An Experiment with Time.)<br />I'm not sure I'd advise the first time dabbler to start with this book.  I think it might be too confusing to start with, but it would definitely be a good one for those with at least some background in the genre.  I agree with another reviewer; read 10, then go on to this one.

I've already enrolled in a cabinet making course-a two year project in itself-so I'm in a position to get really creative with my endeavor.  I've prospected for a variety of design books, finding Johnny Grey's The Art of Kitchen Design among them.  The photos are wonderful, especially of the historic kitchens and of the Dutch and other classic paintings depicting kitchens.  I found the history of the kitchen and it's evolution from integrated activity room to the modern concept of separate functional space an interesting one, but I found most of the author's own designs somewhat cluttered and old fashioned.  Since the author evinces a certain disdain for the streamlined, convenient kitchen that arose with the advent of technology applied to the home, I suspect we would disagree over our mutual sense of design anyway.  As an ICU nurse, I don't like clutter and things in the way.  I like to have a place for everything and everything in its place.  Kitchens (and bathrooms) are dangerous places, I see no reason to accentuate the problem.  I did like the author's gothic look, primarily because it's rather novel in a kitchen, but my husband vetoed it because it looks too \\"churchy (he's a \\"devout\\" atheist).<br />While the book is an attractive and informative one, I found most of the ideas required far more space than I have in my kitchen or a major remodeling of the space I do have to achieve anything like the ambiance presented in the book.	2003-02-24

Since I've always admired the minimalist beauty of Japanese art and architecture and the oriental appreciation of the natural as art, when I found The Japanese Bath by Bruce Smith and Yoshiko Yamamoto I decided to check it out for ideas.  What I was looking for was practical information, however, and this book is more a philosophy of The Bath as multi level sensual experience.  As the authors write, \\"Entering a bath in Japan is to enter another world.  It is a place where one not only cleans the body but also cleanses the mind (p. 13)\\".<br />The photos are lovely (my favorites are the \\"created scenery\\" on pp. 30, 33, and 47), and one can hardly but envy those wealthy enough to have the space, let alone the wherewithal, to have a separate building devoted to the \\"zen\\" of bathing.  Unfortunately I live in a town house, and I rather doubt that the association would appreciate my extending my bathroom into the commons-I could be wrong, but I sincerely doubt it; they're not terribly open minded!  I suspect I am not alone in my lack of space for major remodeling.<br />Taking the above quote from page 13 as a starting point, what I did gain from the book was a realization that in our fast paced Western lives we can still find moments of relaxation and relief from stress by creating small environments in our homes conducive to the Eastern concept of \\"centering.\\"  It needn't be hours long and one needn't even be consciously aware of the effect to derive a benefit from the experience.  While The Japanese Bath provided some information useful to the average person for creating a bathing room (it does discuss tubs and wood for making them), there was little of the nitty gritty of how to apply the philosophy to the smaller homes most of us live in these days.<br />The  information one gleans from The Japanese Bath has to be more indirect.  The notes on the Japanese \\"palette,\\" for instance, suggest the use of darker, less vivid colors to create a quieter, more restful room.  Certainly this idea above all gave me a starting point that finally helped me pull some of my other ideas more smoothly into place.  I'd been struggling with loosely associated \\"great\\" ideas for over a year.  The notion that brighter isn't necessarily better also gave me plans for less direct lighting-after all one isn't always shaving or putting on makeup.  Integrating something of nature into the bathroom-table top fountains, plants, an aquarium, etc.-while it seems a bit `70s,  certainly isn't a bad one; furthermore it's affordable and not terribly space intensive.<br />Still while it's nice to see how the other half lives-or at least the other 5%- the book really is more of a coffee table display than a practical book for the average home owner to make design plans.from The Japanese Bath has to be more indirect.

The volume is a charmingly translated book by Gualberto Zapata Alonzo, who is listed as a professor of Mayan studies.  I was unable to determine his academic credentials, but I suspect the professor is a teacher in the public schools in Mexico and a self taught student of Mayan anthropology, archaeology and history.<br />There is much of interest in the book, and it adequately meets the author's intention of producing an accessible history of the Maya for the average reader and tourist with an interest in history.  The photos, although of average quality, are still impressive in their extensiveness and variety.  Although I've seen some of them in other books, there were some with which I was unfamiliar; that of the Pyramid of the Niches at El Tajin (p. 20) was particularly impressive and very lovely.  I hope I run across it again in a book with somewhat better prints of it.<br />The bibliography is rather a disappointment.  None of the entries are later than 1978, and many are much older.  There are few journal entries, and many of the books are themselves tour guides rather than historical works.  The author is given primarily to reciting the opinions of other researchers in the field.  I have no quarrel with this approach to scholarship, but I feel that he adopts their positions rather uncritically at times.  Some of the sources are fringe edge historians at best.  His introduction of the idea of Asian influences on Middle American peoples is not new to me.  It is, however, more recently beginning to be viewed with more seriousness than heretofore.  Still, I'm not certain that I believe that 40% of the Mayan language is intelligible to a speaker of Japanese (p. 8), especially if as the author maintains, the various dialects of Maya are not even mutually intelligible to other speakers of Maya.  I'm also not certain that I believe that the Maya originated in India (p. 65), at least not as an identifiable entity.<br />At times Professor Alonzo is rather dear in his naive interpretation of facts.  At one point he presumes that the Aztecs may have been from the American Southwest- which I could believe-and uses as his supporting evidence the fact that there are ruins in the area called Montezuma and Aztec.  Both sites are familiar to me-some of my family live in Arizona-and both were probably named in modern times by people familiar with the stories of Montezuma and the Aztecs (p. 40).  These are probably not the original names by which their inhabitants knew them; whatever they may have been called is entirely lost to us now.<br />The various descriptions of the Maya cities and their architecture are quite colorful, very chatty, and eminently entertaining.  The book would be fun to take with one on a tour of the sites.  In fact, I think a tour of just the Maya ruins would make a wonderful vacation.<br />Despite its shortcomings, the book was obviously a labor of love.  The professor obviously has a passion for his subject and has devoted considerable time to investigating the sources on the topic.

Richard Gott is an amazing book.  It's not an easy read, however, at least not for me.  I'm not a math-physics type, so I had to take time to understand some of the complex concepts discussed.  It was definitely worth it.<br />Gott, a professor of astrophysics at Princeton University, discusses almost every aspect of time travel, including what time is and why it seems to be unidirectional.  He also covers the origin of the universe and what might have happened \\"before\\" it came into being, including oscillating universes, de Sitter spacetime, bubble universes, self creating universes, and universes tunneling from nothing.  Most intriguing was the possibility that universes might be created like test-tube babies in a lab by supercivilizations.  According to the author, by compressing a mass into an extremely high density black hole, \\"occasionally it would branch off by quantum tunneling to create a baby universe hidden inside the black hole.  This branch could grow up to a large size without interfering with the lab (the trunk universe) (p. 191).\\"  The possibility of a multiverse is also examined, as are alternative realities.<br />Probably the most interesting part of the book for me was the final chapter, Report from the Future.  Here the author uses the Copernican principle to predict various events.  I have to admit, however, that by allowing himself a 95% range he makes his predictions pretty close to inescapable in some instances.  For instance, he predicts the future longevity of the internet based upon a start date of 1969 as being more than 9 months (this prediction was made in 2001, so it has already exceeded the low end  prediction) but less than 1,209 years!  Those are pretty safe odds!<br />Still, his extension of that principle to an analysis of our future as a species and of the character of life elsewhere is an interesting one.  He points out that as he-or you or I-are not \\"special\\" in the scheme of things (any more than the earth is the center of the solar system, the sun the center of the galaxy or the galaxy the center of the universe), our time and its character are not likely to be special either.  In short, whatever is examined should have a great likelihood of being the norm or average condition for that trait.  The assumptions that he draws from this premise are truly impressive.  For instance, since we are intelligent observers, if we apply the Copernican principle and assume that we are not special much can be said.  He writes, \\"You should expect to live in an epoch of the universe in which the population of intelligent observers is high because most intelligent observers would live in such an epoch (p. 237).\\"  He notes that the answer to Fermi's famous question about extraterrestrials, \\"Where are they?\\" would be that they \\"must still be sitting on their home planet, just like you; otherwise you would be special.  Simple (p. 237).\\"  With respect to the time in which the reader lives, he writes, \\"A graph of the population history of our species might...show low levels during its initial hunter-gather phase, then a brief spike to 12 billion because of civilization, followed by a crash back to hunter-gatherer levels.  You expect to live in the spike because most people will (p. 224).\\"  In short, you have little likelihood of living at either the beginning or the end of human culture, because most of the people who have ever lived are living now.<br />Though it's not an easy book to understand, it's still a very engaging work.(any more than the earth is the center of the solar system, the sun the center of the galaxy or the galaxy the center of the universe), our time and its character are not likely to be special either.

In fact this volume plus How Nature Works: The Science of Self-Organized Criticality by Per Bak and Ubiquity: The Science of History by Mark Buchanan should probably be on the reading list of most of those who find themselves in complex situations requiring decisions.<br />German psychologist Dietrick Dorner is a professor of cognitive behavior at the University of Bamberg and director of the Cognitive Anthropology Project at the Max Planck Institute in Berlin.  He is also the inventor of computer simulations that expose the errors in decision making that arise in complex situations.  The book The Logic of Failure describes some of this research.<br />One of the most interesting aspects of Dr. Dorner's work is that much of the behavior, good and bad, elicited from participants in the computer simulations is seen in real settings.  Depending upon the situation described, I found myself realizing that my own responses might not have been optimal had I been a test subject.  Also surprising was that no matter whether one had the best of intentions or simply took the situation as lightly as a game, the outcome could be disastrous.  (As another author, A. G. Cairns-Smith, has written, \\"Sometimes enthusiastic incompetence is worse than sloth!\\") Whether the improvement of living conditions among the imaginary Moros of Tanaland in the Sahel of North Africa or in the quality of life of the citizens of the simulated suburb of Greenville, the outcome of the decisions made was obviously highly correlated with the capacity of the test subjects for managing simultaneous, multifaceted, and interconnected analysis of the situations.  Some were capable of summing up the key points of the problem, forming plans, taking actions, and assessing outcomes while others simply spun their wheels in an effort to look like they're doing something.  Another surprising, one might almost say frightening, point was the almost natural inability of most people to interpret exponential functions, like growth rates, and to misjudge the effectiveness of measures taken to alter the course of outcomes.  Real problems like the spread of AIDS in a population were off by a substantial amount and the effectiveness of programs attempting to curb its spread were totally misjudged, leading to an unfounded optimism.  This lack of basic understanding of what amounts to compound interest is probably why so many people end up critically in debt because of credit cards.<br />Given the complexity of life in modern society and the decision making expected of the average citizen, critical thinking like that which Dr. Dorner's computer simulations help develop should be encouraged as early as early grade school.  While the work gives some basic concepts that will help the reader improve his own responses to complex decision making, more than anything Dorner's work suggests that society needs to be more tolerant of those who are in stressful positions that require decisions based on inadequate data.  It also suggests that it might be best to place individuals who are more skilled at making plans and taking action under these circumstances into positions of authority.  Certainly testing of this type might serve as a better means of selecting them.they're doing something.  Another surprising, one might almost say frightening, point was the almost natural inability of most people to interpret exponential functions, like growth rates, and to misjudge the effectiveness of measures taken to alter the course of outcomes.  Real problems like the spread of AIDS in a population were off by a substantial amount and the effectiveness of programs attempting to curb its spread were totally misjudged, leading to an unfounded optimism.  This lack of basic understanding of what amounts to compound interest is probably why so many people end up critically in debt because of credit cards.<br />Given the complexity of life in modern society and the decision making expected of the average citizen, critical thinking like that which Dr. Dorner's computer simulations help develop should be encouraged as early as early grade school.  While the work gives some basic concepts that will help the reader improve his own responses to complex decision making, more than anything Dorner's work suggests that society needs to be more tolerant of those who are in stressful positions that require decisions based on inadequate data.  It also suggests that it might be best to place individuals who are more skilled at making plans and taking action under these circumstances into positions of authority.  Certainly testing of this type might serve as a better means of selecting them.	2003-02-17

I'm not sure that I agree with all of the theories it contains-I'm not sure the author even does-but they're certainly astounding and the thought processes that went into creating them is truly awe-inspiring.  Some of them are not new to me.  What is new, however, is the approachable style of the composition.  Although formerly a radio astronomer at Cal Tech, at present Marcus Chown is primarily a professional science journalist.  His approach to the topic of modern physics and its newer concepts is one of a writer and broadcaster.  As he discusses each topic, he quotes the primary researchers in the field like a writer for Discover magazine would, asking pertinent questions and where necessary, explaining the answers.  Through these dialogues with renowned scientists, he allows the reader to become more familiar with the personalities of the individuals at the leading edge of theoretical physics as well as with their ideas.  He functions as a very knowledgeable and lucid interface between the professional scientist and the curious lay person.<br />Each chapter is primarily dedicated to a specific concept having to do with \\"reality\\" and with the nature of the universe.  Each chapter reads like a well written novel in that the last paragraph serves as a hook to draw the reader on to the next amazing concept in the succeeding chapter.  I found that I couldn't just set aside the book.  I read it cover to cover in one sitting and loved every minute of it.  For those with an interest in but less of a background in physics, there is a fairly detailed glossary in the back of the book which should help with terms, although most are adequately explained in the body of the text.  I think that most individuals can understand the concepts as they are explained.  It might be a nice place for the junior high student with a strong interest in a science career to become familiar with physics and physicists.<br />For those who find their appetites wetted for \\"more,\\"the bibliography at the back of the book is probably not a very helpful source.  Most of the listings are either journal articles that might not be approachable for the average student of the topic or science fiction.  Certainly the latter are very good, should one wish to take ones science in a more narrative form.  This cast of writers is stellar-no pun intended-and  includes Asimov, Clarke, Gunn, Heinlein, and Hoyle, among others.  For those who prefer expository style, I'd suggest they check  \\"Just Six Numbers\\" by Sir Martin Rees, Michio Kaku's \\"Hyperspace,\\" \\"Matter Myth\\" by Gribbin and  Davies, and \\"About Time\\" by P. C. W. Davies.  Each of the latter texts deals more thoroughly with topics addressed in Chown's book by individual chapters.wetted for \\"more,\\"the bibliography at the back of the book is probably not a very helpful source.

As such he became involved in the recent finding of the so-called Kennewick Man and the political furor over the disposition of the remains.  The book is an in-depth discussion of almost every aspect of the discovery:  the initial find, the socio-political conflict over it, the brief analysis of the remains, and the overall enlightment that it casts on human migrations.<br />For Native American activists the issue  was one of yet another example of dispossession of by those of European descent, this time  in the name of science.  For \\"science\\" here read the \\"manifest destiny\\" of the 19th century proponents of the westward expansion that led to a systematic, almost Hitleresque genocide of the indigenous inhabitants of the continent.  The active political voices of the Native American activists since the 1960s had led to the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) in the 1990s, and the discovery of the skeletal remains of an early American eroded from a river bank in 1996 put the laws to a critical test, one that is still yet to be settled.<br />For the scientists the issue was of information irretrievably lost to the store of human knowledge about the past.  For this issue read \\"truth\\" forever vanquished by the \\"superstition\\" of the dark side. Certainly in a time when the validity of science education is challenged by every Tom, Dick and Harry with an opinion, when the average person is unable to think critically, when the media are rife with occult nonsense, and when \\"reality\\" TV occupies whole evenings of family time one can hardly blame them for suspecting as much!<br />For myself, I find the research into the human past to be an intriguing pursuit.  I read Dr. Chatter's book in about a day, hanging on every word.  I have to admit, though, that most of my friends and co-workers consider me an eccentric, so I know for a fact that not every one holds my high opinion of this field of endeavor.  I can therefore see why Native American people, given their history with their European neighbors, might consider the analysis of the Kennewick remains as a dangerous effort to once again dispossess them, this time of what they consider to be their history and right of priority in the land.<br />The book brings into sharp relief that the confrontation was due to two groups of people each approaching the world with their own view and lacking understanding of the perspective of the other. It also points out, just as the brewhaha over the Ice Man in Europe did, just how much a part politics, ego, and media involvement has to do with disputes of this sort.  One can only hope that in the future, scientists and Native American groups can work together with greater accord.  Certainly what was discovered about the Kennewick man gave me more respect for the closeness of the global human population and for the successful adaptation of the early American people to a difficult set of circumstances.<br />One of the most interesting things I found from the discussion of the remains of the Kennewick specimen is that the human populations living today are more like one another than they are like their distant predecessors.  In short, human evolution, at least on a superficial level, is on-going.  Our decedents several thousand years hence will also be different.

While Dillehay's book The Settlement of the Americas refers to both the northern and southern continents, it is primarily concerned with the archaeological evidence from South America, giving a thorough assessment of data from several sites.  I suspect that the middle chapters on lithic technology may be less than engrossing to the average reader, but there is still much of interest for anyone interested in the topic.  The author discusses the current debate, and while he has his own opinion, his assessment of the data is not overly credulous.  In particular the heated contentions over the date and significance of the Pedra Furada site of Brazil are evaluated with a balance and thoroughness that is open minded but professional.  The author's attention to taphonomy, geological processes, and off site data in the interpretation of the significance of on site finds  is very good.  It certainly shows the reader how archaeological data are interpreted and what the problems in doing so are.  It also highlights why there is still so much disagreement between researchers.<br />The author, Thomas Dillehay is a professor of anthropology at the University of Kentucky and has conducted extensive research into the subject of early American origins.  He has done research at Monte Verde in Chile, in Peru, Argentina, and Uruguay.  The Monte Verde site, discussed at some length in the book, is particularly significant as it preserved many usually perishable artifacts that encapsulate a much fuller understanding of the lifestyle of the people living there than is usually the case with sites that preserve mostly only lithic cultural materials.<br />Of interest to me, if for no other reason that it had not occurred to me, is the author's note that some of the confusion over the first peopling of the Americas may be due to the fact that our information may be confusing itself.  The author looks at things such as the possible back flow from the Americas to Siberia and Asia which may have mixed the genetics of the populations under study.  While he notes that it is currently not provable, the fact that it might have been possible cannot be neglected.  He also notes that skeletal material from the earliest period is conspicuously absent and that this may represent a paradigm shift necessitated by survival in new territories by the immigrants or a research bias based upon expectations drawn from research conducted in the Old World environment.  He notes that until we are ready to shake free of preconceptions, we will probably not make much real headway.<br /><br />The greatest contribution of the book to my own stock pile of information is the concept that the major factor affecting the survival and spread of modern humans in any environment may have been a change in the mental equipment of the human being.  This may have been the ultimate change that divides the anatomically human from the intellectually human being.  In particular the author speaks of cognitive maps involved with an exploring skill.  Here too might reside the social skills required to roam into unknown territory , a willingness to take environmental risks based upon an effective evaluation of the costs and benefits of such a move and an ability to fall back on long range social contacts that spread out risk.  Much has been written about the possible insurance activities in which Southwestern pueblo groups may have participated in a climatically unstable environment, but little-to my knowledge-has been made of the importance of these same risk-reducing social paradigms among even earlier human groups.  Perhaps the reason that modern humans were able to spread as successfully as they did to every inhabitable environment on earth has to do with this capacity to maintain social links over long ranges.  By these links, however great the temporal or spacial distance, early people could exchange information, mates, and help.  Perhaps even shared links of tradition, remembered by elders much as they were and are among Arab groups, provided a measure of long term connection even after long separations.  If one can recount ones linage back to a common ancestral root one can make claims of charity.<br />An intriguing book.h as they were and are among Arab groups, provided a measure of long term connection even after long separations.

Everyone who takes English history probably remembers 1066, William of Normandy, the Battle of Hastings, and King Harold; essentially the date, the location and the leaders of the combatant armies.  Some may remember that the fight was over the right of succession to the throne of England after the heirless death of King Edward the Confessor.  A few may even remember that Edmond Halley's famous comet  made an appearance just beforehand, creating great consternation that was immortalized in the Bayeux tapestry.  For most, Harold's reign seems almost a foot note, hardly more than an intermission before the main event of the Norman conquest.  With William and his successors come castle building, classic knighthood, feudal society, all the \\"romance\\" of the middle ages.  Harold is so often treated as a cipher to all of this that the true drama of this transitional age is often lost on the student.  Harold is just \\"the loser.\\"<br />Ian Walker's book brings this period more into focus.  He approaches his subject by examining, not only Harold's own life and career, but that of his grandfather and father, creating a sense of the venue for the events of the Conquest.  Harold is no longer just \\"the loser.\\"  He is a powerful and intelligent warrior, dealing as often in diplomacy as in bloodshed, able to play the chess game of power politics in a very turbulent time.  He was in fact \\"the last Anglo Saxon king,\\" and his time, like the withdrawal of the elves from Tolkien's Middle Earth, is the end of an era.  His predecessor Edward was the last of the line of Alfred the Great, the king who had wielded the tiny Anglo Saxon kingdoms into the one kingdom of England.  William and his successors would turn the island into a developing nation state striving for a place in a world among other rising  nation states.<br />I found particularly interesting the author's approach to the period as one of a family biography.  Harold was not just a famous figure in history, he was a member of an ambitious extended family.  Like the Borgias in a later time and place, Harold's father and his grandfather played major roles in English political life during the years preceding the Conquest, as did he and his brothers in their own time.  Walker follows these careers, because it is the net created by their liaisons that defined the period.  Pull out any of these lynch pins, and the history of the era would have been vastly different.  Interesting too were the careers of Harold's children, who went on to carry the family into succeeding generations of international leaders.  I have often wondered what the fates of descendants of famous people have been.  What did happen to Cleopatra's surviving children for instance?  At least in this instance, more is documented about Harold's children which gives a sense of closure to Walker's book.<br />Thoroughly enjoyable and informative study.an ambitious extended family.

Graham Cairns-Smith has created a small gem in his Seven Clues to the Origin of Life.  The book, a discussion of the pre-biotic stage of the evolution of life, is concise, logical and lucid and explained in terms that would be comprehensible to anyone from the junior high student with a basic science education to beyond it.  As Daniel C. Dennett writes in the journal Nature about another of the author's books, \\"Cairns-Smith is a brilliant explainer of difficult ideas, bringing to the task an imagination that is magnificently disciplined by detailed scientific understanding.&quot;<br />I had heard of the concept of a crystal template for the creation of organic molecules while studying mineralogy for a geology degree in the 1980s, so Cairns-Smith's topic had already intrigued me.  When I found reference to this book in the annotated bibliography of another I was reading, I decided to look it over too.  I wasn't disappointed.<br />Dr Cairns-Smith is an Honorary Senior Research Fellow in the Chemistry Department at the University of Glasgow in Scotland.  The main area of his research has been in simple non-nucleic acid genetic systems which might have been important in the earliest stages of the evolution of life, a topic on which he has collaborated with others and continued to publish in professional journals as recently as 1996.  So he is eminently prepared to discuss the pre-biotic era of life.<br />Although the book is old for a work of science (1985), it is nonetheless still very much a leading idea in the subject of the early stages of life.  Furthermore, the author cleverly puts the topic into terms that most of his readers will understand, even borrowing concepts from architecture/building, the nature of ropes, and the history of technology to do so.  Avoiding confusing professional jargon, he leads the reader through the material in a logical, step by step manner until his conclusion:  that we may owe our existance to the character and evolution of clay materials.  While one may not necessarily believe that this is actually how the process worked-or for religious reasons may disagree altogether-it is still a cogent work, one that illustrates how science comes up with its theories of how things got to be as they are.y materials.

Most of the educational CD's I've tried have been a great disappointment.  The attempt at \\"interactive\\" formats has left much to be desired, and there were no lecturers at all.  The Thinkwell work, on the other hand, is superb.  The lecturer, George Wolfe, is enthusiastic, knowledgeable and entertaining.  The table of contents includes evolution, organic and inorganic chemistry, cell biology, respiration, photosynthesis, molecular genetics, biotechnology, cell reproduction, Mendelian genetics and mutation, population genetics and evolution, evolution of life on earth, animal systems and homeostasis, plant systems and homeostasis, and ecology.  With such a wide range of topics, the collection would be very helpful for students in earth history, geology, biology, ecology, and anthropology, among others.  Furthermore, the lectures are simple enough in their content, design and presentation that I think that most junior high school students would find the material fully understandable.  Each lecture is about 10 minutes in length, so there are frequent jumping-off spots to allow for other activities, and each is fast paced enough and topic focused enough to keep even the most hyperactive student's attention.  I find that when my husband is watching the lectures, I join him and we spend an hour or more; it's better than TV.	2003-02-01

It reminds me so much of my own history advisor, Tom B. Jones' words to me when picking a topic for my master's thesis, \\"keep it narrow, keep it simple, get it done!\\"<br />The subject is certainly a narrow one.  John Ringo was one of the lessor gunfighters among a panoply of truly famous names: Wyatt Earp, John Westly Hardin, Doc Holliday, Jessie James, Wild Bill Hickock, Buffalo Bill, etc.  While he may have been in the wings, he took noticeable part in almost none of the really graphic events of his time.  The most noteworthy event of his life was his apparent decision to commit suicide.<br />The topic can hardly be but simple; the author himself admits that there is little concrete data available on Ringo, and he proceeds to demolish most of it in his critique of these sources, some of which are poorly written western adventure novels.  To his credit Professor Burrows did manage to locate and critique several Ringo family resources that, for various reasons (for which check out the chapter notes)  had not been used previously in an academic fashion.<br />The coverage of the project took a short 203 pages.  It took that many mostly because the author repeats the same information in a variety of poses and with more adjectives than I've seen since attempting to wade through an old harlequin romance at the behest of a friend.  Sometimes the sentences are so long one loses sight of where one was going by the end of them.  And words?  I read voraciously and have a substantial vocabulary-I was once hailed as a genius by a coworker for using \\"sanguine\\" correctly in a sentence!-but some of Dr. Burrows' choices suggested that a thesaurus was ever at hand least he be too repetitious.<br />I do think the book is an important one.  It sets much of the mystery of the subject into perspective, which most of the written works  heretofore have not.  Certainly the on-going saga of the Ringo family's Victorian shame over the black sheep in its midst is certainly an interesting one.  The difficult events of Ringo's early life, brings one to wonder how many of the misfits of the old west-or of our own time for that matter-grew out of stressful events suffered during early adolescence, events over which they had little or no control.<br />I think that what the book needed was a better and more critical editor than it got.spective, which most of the written works  heretofore have not.

Although I see by the reviews that most people were thoroughly entranced with The Eternal Frontier: An Ecological History of North America and Its Peoples, I really had mixed feelings about the book.  It definitely attempts to accomplish way too much within the limited confines of its 357 pages of text, and by doing so cheats some topics while over indulging others.<br />First and foremost, like Africa: Biography of a Continent by John Reader, the book starts out to be a life story of the North American continent.  Unlike Readers  work, which sets the stage for the human drama by discussing the geology of the continent and the succession of biological eras that have characterized the land, The Eternal Frontier begins with the asteroid impact that purportedly brought about the demise of the dinosaurs.  In part this may be due to the very real consideration that there wasnt too much of a North American continent other than the Canadian Shield and a pair of island arcs  prior to this time.  However, I have the distinct impression its also due to the fact that the intended audience has more interest in dinosaurs and Pleistocene megafauna than it does in brachiopods, trilobites and crinoidsmyself being perhaps one of the few exceptions.<br />From this beginning, the author describes the successions of flora and fauna that have arisen indigenously or by migration through the ages.  I have no quarrel with that approach, having studied paleontology as my major focus while working on a bachelors in geology during the 1980s.  Unfortunately, these chapters become something of a simple catalogue of species that have come and gone, not because their individual stories arent interesting, but because they require more space to tell than the author has given them.  I found more interesting his occasional digressions into the personalities of the various fossil collectors of the early and mid 19th Century and into the few species he does describe more fully, things like the fact that the redwood tree species had witnessed the age of the dinosaurs and that the squirrel, like the horse and the camel, is an American  indigene, but one unlike the other two that has not successfully invaded Eurasia or Australia.  I also found the concept of the one way door between Eurasia and North America of interest as well as the weather magnifying effect of the north-south orientation of the continent's mountain ranges.<br />The middle portion of the book describes the successive waves of human immigration.  This section especially deserves more space than it was given, as those who have argued vehemently  over the issue of first date of colonization could tell one.  Even as a eulogy to the lost Native American cultures, it lacks something.  This story has a grandeur that deserves a venue of its own.  It is however interesting to think of the first humans as disturbing the predator-prey balance by being more efficient than any other predator hitherto, but that debate is also a subject of much controversy, and Dr. Flannery gives it rather short shift.  It is anything but decided.<br />At the risk of seeming a defensive Ugly American, I also take exception to the disparaging comments on the settling of the continent.  I agree, it was a period of time fraught with a ghastly disregard for the lives,  well-being and property of American indiginous populations, and the total disregard for ecological sustainability.  However, by literarily isolating these offenses to immigrants to this continent in particular, he appears to ignore facts that Jared Diamond has pointed out in a better balanced account.  In Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, Diamond makes it clear that a lot goes into changes of this kind, and it seems to take place all over the globe with equally devastating effects.  I cant help but wonder what the Australian aboriginal population might make of Dr. Flannerys elegant concern over the dismal fate of the American Indian.<br />Probably the most interesting portion of the book is that which discusses the possible reason for the persistent lack of concern by the powers that be in the US over devastation of environment.  While we in the US decry the fate of the Brazilian rainforests and the demise of the African megafauna, we seem unusually  blind to the loss of our own forests and wildlife and unwilling to sign accords that the rest of the world deem needful to save the environment worldwide.  Since we cant do anything to change our great grandfathers appalling treatment of the American Indian, but we can do something about the preservation of predator-prey ratios in our parks, about the amount of land we set aside unmolested in the name of capitalism, and to subsidize those 3rd world countries that are faced with damaging their environment or perishing, I think it behooves us to get a little more involved in the issues.<br />I found the book tried to cover way too much.  It might be a good place to get started on a number of topics, but I think that other books might offer more on any given subject.he American Indian.<br />Probably the most interesting portion of the book is that which discusses the possible reason for the persistent lack of concern by the powers that be in the US over devastation of environment.

The volume purports to approach human evolution from the perspective of the brain, and the title suggests that the effect of women on the process would be a component of the discussion.  While the effect of the maternal-infant bond is discussed briefly as a factor in language acquisition in the early part of the book, in general the rest of it consists of anecdotes involving the doctor's practice.<br /><br />His stories are very interesting to me, since Dr. Klawans did his residency on the same ward, Station 50, at the University of Minnesota Hospital that I worked on early in my career as a nurse.  As he mentions in the book, his mentor was our department head, Dr. Abraham B. Baker, a brilliant diagnostician.  Dr. Klawans probably graduated from the institution a year or two before my arrival.  While the stories are intriguing, they seemed to me to provide more illumination on the complicated process of diagnosis, especially of the more unusual neurological diseases, in particular the movement disorders (Parkinson's disease is the doctor's specialty) than they did a theory of evolution of the brain in humans.  In fact it might be said that an understanding of the underlying principles of evolution would be of more use in unraveling the causes of neurological problems, than vice versa.  Certainly an understanding of genetics, the very foundation of evolution, has lead to more advances with respect to the causes of some of the more exotic neurological problems, like Huntington's Chorea, Kuru, and Jacob-Croitzfelds syndromes.<br /><br />By the end of the book, the author has completed his lengthy digression and returns to his main theme, the evolution of the brain, it's effects on our overall evolution, and the key factor that women contribute, namely the size of the birth canal.  In his final chapter, Dr. Klawans discusses the importance of the immaturity of the human infant post-natally.  Compared to other types of mammal, the human baby is essentially still fetal at birth, as Stephen Jay Gould points out in his book The Panda's Thumb.  While the baby horse is ready to run independently within minutes of birth, the human baby is not able to walk for months.  This is due to the fact that the nervous system is still too immature for the newborn to be autonomous.  In order to accommodate the larger brain, a larger brain case is necessary.  In order to deliver the child without killing the mother, the mother's birth canal must be wide enough for the head to pass through it and/or the brain/skull must be smaller.  The baby's brain is still immature at birth and the plates of the brain case are not fully fused, allowing it to pass through the mother's pelvis.<br />Of interest was the doctor's suggestion that the bottleneck that caused the Neanderthal's demise and prevented a genetic mix with Homo sapiens was the contribution of maternal DNA and pelvis size to the situation.  In a  human male- female Neanderthal mix, the mother's pelvis and DNA would lead to a more mature infant with fuller sized head and nervous system, a situation that would provide less of an opportunity for learning.  As the author writes, \\"The greater maturation of the Neanderthal brain at birth would have been a biological advantage only so long as survival depended more on a classic survival of the fittest than on the acquisition of knowledge within a human-manipulated environment (p. 240).\\"  On the other hand, with a Neanderthal male-human female mix, the mother's smaller pelvis and the infant's larger head size would probably have killed them both.<br />The book digresses extensively, but that does have its appeal.the immaturity of the human infant post-natally.

While many of the stories that the author recounts from the pamphlets, periodicals, and book length works of that time period were indeed colorful, they were also for the most part just as much works of fiction as the stories on the same topic by the famed 19th Century novelist and poet Edgar Allen Poe.  It seems entirely likely that Poe's work itself may have been influenced by the sensational journalism of the time.<br />Bondeson notes that there are strong components of sadism, necrophilia, and fantasy about most of the stories of premature burial and an almost folktale continuity among some of the stories from one country to another.  As he points out, when reliable authorities undertook to investigate the underlying story of a premature burial as reported in some of these accounts,  they almost unanimously discovered that the stories were pure fabrications used to sell newspapers or to encourage the public to buy specially designed coffins, build special hospitals for the dead, or simply purchase an author's book or support his cause.<br />When Bondeson analyzes the descriptions of the supposed victims of anti-mortem burial, he makes it clear that totally normal causes for their disarray can be proposed, but that the data supporting more rational interpretations were either unavailable at the time or were ignored for the sake of a good story.  It's not that he feels that this type of disaster is impossible or that all stories of misdiagnosis are confabulations.  Quite the contrary.  In assessing the accounts, he points to several that he believes might have been real.  He also defends the fears at the time as not totally unrealistic and is unwilling to label individuals who took precautions against such an occurance as \\"phobic.\\"<br />Interesting too is the inverse correlation that he points out between the rise in the fear of awaking in a coffin and a general decline in confidence in the medical establishment of any given period.  He notes a similar modern day fear being declared dead prematurely that occurred during the 1980s and 90s when medical practitioners were uncertain about the exact criteria for declaring an individual dead, as transplant became a viable form of treatment and viable organs scarce, and as prolonged life support became more successful.  At just what point such support becomes a prolongation of the dying process is still a burning issue in many countries, as the book How We Die makes very apparent.<br />Since I work in a teaching hospital on a surgical intensive care unit and have been confronted with a number of the ethical issues associated with death and dying and with the concerns of family and friends over the well being of family members at this stage of life, I found the book of considerable interest.  The historic effect of the media on public opinion and its not always altruistic agenda  were also of interest.<br />The book is probably not as entertaining as one would expect from the title, but it is very interesting and informative as history.  It's certainly a very carefully researched and lucid account. For those who are more interested in the process of death and dying and the current ethical issues associated with it, I would suggest the previously mentioned book, How We Die.  For those interested in classic spooky tales on the subject, I'd suggest a collection of the short stories of Edgar Allen Poe.nst such an occurance as \\"phobic.\\"  <br />Interesting too is the inverse correlation that he points out between the rise in the fear of awaking in a coffin and a general decline in confidence in the medical establishment of any given period.

Since paleontology and earth history were my main interests, the title Two-Mile Time Machine: Ice Cores, Abrupt Climate Change, and Our Future by Richard B. Alley naturally caught my eye.  The book is an excellent exposition on the recent data collection from ice cores obtained from the more stable portions of the Greenland ice sheet.  I had come across this data source before while on a geologic field trip on Santorini helping with research on the volcanic activity that occured there during the Minoan period.  It had been information from this source that had helped to date the volcanic event, so I was particularly interested in learning more about how it was obtained and about its reliability.<br />In part two of the text, the author lucidly describes the rationale behind the selection of ice and of Greenland as an \\"archival\\" source.  He discusses the methods in and problems of obtaining and preserving the material intact and uncontaminated and the methods of analysis that produced the data.  Throughout the following chapters, he lays out for the reader the thinking that went into its interpretation and how this information can be used as a paradigm with which future outcomes of climate change might  be predicted.  Because Alley, a professor of geoscience at Penn State, took an actual part in all of these proceedings and is an active scientist himself, he is well positioned to give an informative account of the topic.  He also has a readable writing style which many such individuals do not.<br />Although I felt that his attempt to \\"get down to\\" the level of his non-technical audience was sometimes a little patronizing, I did think that his explanations of some of the physical systems was very clear.  The description of the events leading to and during the Younger Dryas got a little confusing with the comparison to a roller coaster with a bungee jumper and a yo-yo, but by the end of the chapter one still had a fair idea of what he was trying to convey.--I think he was just trying a little too hard.  His explanations of important environmental cycles with which I was already familiar--like those of the carbon, the water, the heat distribution, the oceanic and lake water overturn, and atmospheric cycles and those of the Coriolis and Milankovich effects--were very clear.  In fact they were clearer than some textbook descriptions I've read.  Although I had read of the effects of fresh water on the North Atlantic \\"conveyor belt\\" and its subsequent effect on global climate, I had not encountered the Dansgaard-Oeschger cycle or the  Heinrich-Bond oscillations in my reading in the past.  The author's presentation was therefore of interest to me.<br />For most readers, part five will probably be of greatest interest.  Here the author puts what is known or suspected of climatic mechanics to work in predicting possible impacts of human activity on global climate and the world's population.  Here too he points out the nature of the scientific method and its limitations.  He is quite clear that some of what he states in his final analysis with respect to the future is personal opinion and not science.<br />As an earlier reviewer points out, the book is an excellent portrayal of how science works, particularly in the aspects of framing a problem and a means of approaching it experimentally, and interpreting the data that arises therefrom.  I found it a very entertaining book.the chapter one still had a fair idea of what he was trying to convey.--I think he was just trying a little too hard.

Within a short hour of people watching in Central Park one can hear a dozen different languages; nearly every street has the emotional intensity of a state fair in other cities; and every block seems to have a character all its own.  It was to get a sense of the history of the place that I chose to read Five Points by Tyler Anbinder.  I wasn't disappointed.<br />Although I found some of the political history of the time somewhat dull, most of the other material was of more interest.  As one of the other reviewers mentions, the book is almost a sociology text of life ways.  It reminded me of  the gang studies done by early sociologists.  As a history, Five Points is probably one of the more site intensive works I've read short of an archaeological work.  The number and variety of the primary sources is impressive: newspapers, personal journals, biographies and  autobiographies (even something  by Charles Dickens),  early records of the city council, the sanitation department, the police department, census data, church records, legislature from other countries, estate records in Ireland, etc.  It was amazing to see a picture created of an era from scraps of information gleaned from such diverse sources.  The effort must have been monumental.<br />The author takes a topical rather than a chronological approach to the area, although there is still a general sense of the progression of time, especially during the last chapters that discuss the ethnic change of the area.  This method certainly ensures that issues of social interest are addressed and don't simply get lost in a mere march through events.  As the titles of the chapters suggest (The Making of Five Points, Why They Came, How They Lived, How They Worked, Politics, Play, Vice and Crime, Religion and Reform, Riot, The Civil War and the End of an Era, The Remaking of a Slum, Italians, Chinatown, and the End of Five Points) the topical approach more clearly and thoroughly discusses the phenomenon of Five Points than just a simple recitation of what happened after what.  Some of the photojournalism of the time is also impressive.  For some readers whose families perhaps arrived by way of New York and struggled for existence in conditions like this, the photos will be particularly moving.  For those who have arrived more recently, such as the Hmong in my own community, the trials of everyday life in a new country may well be familiar even today.Chinatown, and the End of Five Points) the topical approach more clearly and thoroughly discusses the phenomenon of Five Points than just a simple recitation of what happened after what.

He not only provides the information, he tells the reader the \\"whys\\" of what is, which I find helpful because it permits one to problem solve and trouble shoot more effectively.  Particularly useful are those things that he tells the reader to avoid and what can happen when they aren't!  The drawings are very helpful, particularly as they are clearer than photographs can be.  Sometimes less is more in this regard.  The schematic of the main floor of a house (pp. 22-23) which detailed how wiring is arranged for each room was quite helpful for my project, since it described what I should (and did) find in the walls when locating my power source and routing new wiring.

I was able to go to the store and pick out just what I needed without any trouble at all.<br />While the Cauldwell book is a good one to read from cover to cover because of it's clear and thorough discussion of electrical wiring and its many helpful hints (which I did), it really did not help with my specific plans.  It does cover some types of project, but I found that The Black and Decker book was more useful for my specific wiring goals.  It's definitely a \\"how to do it\\" book with information on trouble shooting current wiring for potential problems (pp. 122-143), on code requirements (pp. 145-146), on how to calculate electrical loads and when to upgrade.  It also includes simple repairs for the home owner, everything from checking which fuse controls which part of the house, to replacing plugs and repairing fluorescent lights.  It also provides some advanced projects, like rewiring a kitchen or installing outdoor wiring.  Of particular interest to my husband, the computer guru in our household, was the information on the home network wiring systems.<br />For my own project, I found the circuit maps for 26 common wiring layouts of greatest help.  With the aid of this feature and the Cauldwell book, I was able to draw on paper the likely arrangement of the present wiring in my spare bedroom, and plan in the pathway to and from the projected new outlets.  The diagrams on pages 155-167 also gave me a clearer idea of which wires connected to which specific sites on the receptacles, and what the pathway of the current would be.

I am a beginning student in cabinetmaking and have been browsing Amazon.com for ideas for my classroom projects.  Because I grew up in a time when boys took shop and girls took home ec, I really have not had any experience with power tools beyond an electric drill.  Any project that helps me become more comfortable with these tools and also with hand tools at a minimum cost outlay for materials is a welcome addition to my library.  Making Working Wooden Locks<br />by Tim Detweiler is such a book.  The simple diagrams, many of them full scale, should make the actual process of producing the lock parts simple.  The suggestions for jigs and measurements should be helpful, not only with this project but with others as well.  Most of the written instructions are very clear, especially when taken in conjunction with the diagrams, so assembly should not be a problem either.  While I can use the classroom equipment and will, I hope to purchase some of the tools suggested in the book for a shop of my own, and those that are required for the locks would be a good place to begin.  Each mechanism is somewhat more complex than the preceding one, and the tools required for each a little more complex as well, so I should have quite a collection with which I am familiar by the time I have completed all five.	2003-01-07

It  illustrates them more clearly with photos of the process, than either of the latter sources and helps me understand better what the instructor has in mind when he makes suggestions for my projects.  More importantly the book provides  more than one way of producing the joints, using different types of equipment to achieve the same results.  Since I expect to set up a small shop on a restricted  budget, at least to begin with, I know that I will often have to \\"make do\\" with the equipment I happen to have on hand, and I think that this book will help me do that.  While I am still a little too much of a novice to have yet discovered the faults in the book of which the other reviewers have written, I hope to be able to add my own notes to the methods discussed as I gain more experience, enlarging the information provided with details of my own efforts and those of my classmates (in fact we are expected to keep a journal for class with just this type of data).  I also see the book as a list of basic techniques to try before I have graduated.	2002-12-19

I am a beginning cabinetmaking student at a local community and technical college here in Minneapolis, and because I know I have much to learn before setting up my own work space, I decided to do some research on the topic.  Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop by Sandor Nagyszalanczy is a lovely book on the subject.  The photos are wonderful, and some of the shops are not so much places of work but an expression of lifestyle!  Particularly beautiful, though by no means the most clever, are those pictured on pp. 15,  58-59 and 84-85.<br />On a more practical level, the book deals with important issues that need to be taken into consideration prior to putting a shop together.  There were a number of points that had not occurred to me before I read the book, and that despite their fairly obvious nature-like dust control and ceiling height and the effect of hard floors on joints.<br />I already had a good idea of where my first shop will be-my basement--and the book provided me with some of the issues most likely to arise out of my choice of location.  Of these noise control, dust control in the presence of forced air heating, ventilation during  finishing processes, the limitations placed on movement of materials due to ceiling height, the effect of cement floors on my person, and the scarcity of space for large equipment were important to my situation.  The book offers a number of clever suggestions to solve some of these problems, and I look forward to finding others for myself.  Some of the designs for shop-made shelves for storage are particularly interesting, especially the pull out style wheeled clamp rack that can be stored out of the way in a narrow otherwise unuseable space.<br />The book makes me feel more prepared for some of the problems that I will face in setting up shop.  It raised my awareness of specific issues, so that I can discuss with my instructor how he has solved some of them himself.  That way I can deal with likely pitfalls before I have a basement full of equipment!al with likely pitfalls before I have a basement full of equipment!	2002-12-19

Whether one believes in these phenomenon or not, the book makes interesting reading.  While many of the stories have appeared in other books, Holzer adds interesting updates and background information which give them a new perspective.  Of particular interest to me was the historical research done with respect to the life and times surrounding some of the occurrences.  The author discusses the American Revolution and Civil War and some of the events of early European history as well as some of the central figures of these events.  Where he is able, he also adds information about the history the specific houses and other buildings he inspected.  He gives advice to the would be ghost hunter, and describes some of the mediums with whom he worked.  It sounds as though Dr. Holzer had a fun and exciting career that has taken him all over the world.	2002-12-19

I am a beginning cabinetmaking student at a local community and technical college in Minneapolis.  I'm also one of those people who feels ill prepared for an undertaking unless I've read at least one book on the project.  This is particularly true with my present undertaking, because I have never used power tools in the past and feel sort of all-at-sea!<br /><br />Because I hope to set up my own shop, I have been researching the types of equipment that I will need to do that, in this case the table saw.  I looked for a book that could not only give me advice on what to purchase for my particular needs, but how to use it safely, how to care for it, and what types of spacial arrangements would be best in housing and using it.  The Table Saw Book provides that information in a clear, well-organized and well illustrated manner.<br />It begins, logically, at the beginning, describing the anatomy of the machine, both externally and internally, listing the parts and discussing their purpose.  It also includes a chapter specifically dedicated to blades: their types, uses, and maintenance.<br />There is a section on dust collection and the pros and cons of different styles.  This is something of importance in my case, as I expect to set up my first shop in the basement and my house has forced air heating.  I have already looked at some of the equipment that is available on Amazon to control the dust, and am planning a dust collecting system.  (I've even thought of putting in a household vacuum system also).<br />The chapter on adjustment and maintenance of the saw  helped to reinforce classroom learning in the former case and provides an important reference in the latter case when I am faced with care of my own equipment with no instructor around to advise me!  I hope to have a complete reference library for trouble shooting all of my equipment, and this represents my first addition to that collection!<br />Sections on ripping, cross-cutting, the use of jigs and joinery on the table saw  were very informative.  I expect that my first purchase-and probably the only one for a while-- will be a table saw, and I will have to become proficient in its full range of usage if I wish to do much work before I am able to get any other equipment..

1300054:US	50669529	R226NR9PRTU37E	1561581135	102622503	Wiring a House: 5th Edition (For Pros By Pros)	Books	5	202	219	N	N	Comparison of 3 how-to books on home wiring	I've decided to remodel my spare bedroom.  It's one of those \\"furnished closet\\" type spaces that tends to collect junk at an alarming rate.  While it's a lovely little room when it's empty, it disappears in the furniture that gets put into it.  Even the sliding glass doors over the small balcony don`t give one an illusion of spaceousness.  I had a roommate for a while who used that room, and she had to climb over her bed just to get to her bureau.<br />The plan is to put up lighted crown molding to add dimension and indirect lighting to the room and to remodel  the ample closet space into a bureau cum mini-closet cum desk area.  By putting in a full sized futon, I can use the room as a sitting room/spare bedroom, and without the clutter, it'll seem quite spacious.<br />To accomplish my goal, the project required some rewiring of the room, so I found three books that seemed to have the information I needed:  Wiring 1-2-3 by the people at Home Depot, The Complete Guide to Home Wiring by the Black and Decker people, and Wiring a House by Rex Cauldwell.  Each is an excellent book with much to offer, but I definitely found that each had a slant that made it specialized in some way.<br />Of the three books, only the Cauldwell book was written in a person-to-person format.  The author is a third generation electrician with years of experience, and as he says quite charmingly, \\"I have written this book from lifelong experience and knowledge--some of which has been passed down through each generation.  However, there is no one within my family to pass the gauntlet to--no fourth generation to pick up the trade.  Therefore, by reading this book you will become heir to my knowledge and experience.  You, in effect, will become the fourth generation (p. 1).\\"  His style is very much master of the craft to learning apprentice, explaining all facets of his field from how electricity is produced, how it is measured, what types of wires carry it to and into your home, and what tools one needs to do electrical work.  He not only provides the information, he tells the reader the \\"whys\\" of what is, which I find helpful because it permits one to problem solve and trouble shoot more effectively.  Particularly useful are those things that he tells the reader to avoid and what can happen when they aren't!  The drawings are very helpful, particularly as they are clearer than photographs can be.  Sometimes less is more in this regard.  The schematic of the main floor of a house (pp. 22-23) which detailed how wiring is arranged for each room was quite helpful for my project, since it described what I should (and did) find in the walls when locating my power source and routing new wiring.  I also found that the information on materials to select was helpful.  I was able to go to the store and pick out just what I needed without any trouble at all.<br />While the Cauldwell book is a good one to read from cover to cover because of it's clear and thorough discussion of electronical wiring and its many helpful hints (which I did), it really did not help with my specific plans.  It does cover some types of project, but I found that The Black and Decker book was more useful for my specific wiring goals.  It's definitely a \\"how to do it\\" book with information on trouble shooting current wiring for potential problems (pp. 122-143), on code requirements (pp. 145-146), on how to calculate electrical loads and when to upgrade.  It also includes simple repairs for the home owner, everything from checking which fuse controls which part of the house, to replacing plugs and repairing fluorescent lights.  It also provides some advanced projects, like rewiring a kitchen or installing outdoor wiring.  Of particular interest to my husband, the computer guru in our household, was the information on the home network wiring systems.<br />For my own project, I found the circuit maps for 26 common wiring layouts of greatest help.  With the aid of this feature and the Cauldwell book, I was able to draw on paper the likely arrangement of the present wiring in my spare bedroom, and plan in the pathway to and from the projected new outlets.  The diagrams on pages 155-167 also gave me a clearer idea of which wires connected to which specific sites on the receptacles, and what the pathway of the current would be.  I was thrilled when I turned on the wall switch in the room, and the lighted crown molding actually came on, first try!<br />Wiring 1-2-3 is another group-effort type book like the Black and Decker.  It'd made a splendid gift for the new home owner or prospective buyer.  It provides the most extensive information on inspecting the home for electrical problems and providing measures for repairing them.  The table of contents highlights almost every conceivable project, and each project has a list of materials, a skill scale that projects the level of difficulty  to expect, and the amount of time that would be required by the experienced, the handy and the novice.  It also makes some suggestions regarding the selection of a professional electrician for difficult projects, and does not urge the novice to go beyond their comfort level.<br />Although I didn't use the Home Depot book for actual planning and wiring, I found it was especially helpful with the messy stuff, things like drilling holes through the attic to route wires, the nitty-gritty of fishing for wires, and repairing the damage to walls where holes had to be made to route wires.  In general these books are useful all round books.<br />I'd give all three books a 5, each for its own area of usefulness.  If you're a person who likes to have a multi-perspective approach to your projects, then I'd recommend all three.  Certainly the Home Depot book would be a very nice house warming gift.d the Cauldwell book, I was able to draw on paper the likely arrangement of the present wiring in my spare bedroom, and plan in the pathway to and from the projected new outlets.

The book is a wonderful compendium of historical information on the social eccentricities of the upper class New Yorkers of the 19th Century of which Miss Wharton had been a part in her younger years.  The narrative is delightfully and colorfully written and reads quickly.  Since I have lived in NYC myself, it was especially enjoyable reading about the early days of the old city, and the addition of 19th century pageantry made it doubly so.  As to the centerpiece romance of the book, I found it to be nearly non-existent, but then I am a woman of the 20th and 21st Century.  Where much of what occurs in the book must have seemed \\"steamy,\\" \\"sensuous,\\" and \\"adventurous\\" by the standards of the time during which the action takes place, I can't help but wonder if it would have seemed tame even to the readers of the roaring 20s when the book was first penned.  It is in the subtle disclosure that there are limitations in life and that those in our environment have a measure of control over how we live it and that this is probably a good thing, that the author's genius is discovered, and it is obviously in recognition of this genius that the Pulitzer was presented to Miss Wharton, the first woman to receive the prestigious award.  In Newland Archer, the author creates a wonderful character who believes he is confronted with the prospect of a dull life of \\"duty\\" with an unimaginative but beautiful wife.  A youthful rebellion against this stasis arises when he is confronted with a mysterious countess, the cousin of his wife.  Ellen Olenska is all any romantic young man could hope for:  a damsel in distress, a woman of the European tradition at once bored by convention but delighted by the simplicity of straight-laced New York ways.  She is sexually exciting by virtue of her unobtainability, and he spends much of his time in pleasant fantasy over her for most of his life.  The book has the same gentle wit and charm of movies like the Fourposter Bed, the Ghost and Mrs Muir, Life with Father, Cheaper by the Dozen and other films set in the same time period and social milieu.  For anyone who enjoys an enjoyable visit to a quieter, \\"simpler\\" time, the time of our grandparents and great grand parents, this is a wonderful vacation.iting by virtue of her unobtainability, and he spends much of his time in pleasant fantasy over her for most of his life.

More and more frequently it's been proven to me that one should listen to the reading suggestions made by friends with similar interests.  Since I enjoy expository prose more than narrative, I tend to resist recommendations when they are novels rather than books of information, but every now and then someone who shares my interests will recommend one that is a \\"good fit.\\"  Meet John Trow by Thomas Dyja is a example.  It is a very complex novel,  recommended by a friend at work with whom I'd like to write ghost stories and with whom I share a number of interests.  The book is part ghost story, part murder mystery, part Civil War history, and part a search for a philosophy of life.  Whether any of these things are subjects in which the author himself has a real interest or experience or whether he just did his homework, the book works, at least for me.<br />The central character, Steven Armour, is bogged down in a mid-life crisis.  His wife Patty seems angry all the time, his son is a stranger to him, his daughter suffers undiagnosed petit mal seizures which cause difficulties at school, his coworkers treat him with the indulgence reserved for the \\"elderly\\" and \\"out of the loop,\\" and his elderly father, a widower, perennial child and the arch antagonist of Steve's  wife Patty, is hoping to move in with the family.  It's not that Steve's problems are unique; but his solution to them is.  Introduced to a Civil War reenactment group while on a family outing, he is goaded into joining, and once involved gets REAL involved.<br />While I was a little disappointed in the ultimate solution of the mystery part of the book--I'm a romantic at heart--I felt that the book was greater than the sum of its parts.  On the way toward recreating the life of a private John Trow, Steve learns things about himself and his life.  We should all be so lucky.  He comes to view the goals and purposes that he had accepted as grounding principles from the perspective of an outsider which helps him make some changes.  Freed of the group think of modern life, at least for brief periods, he manages to become more centered and clinical in his judgement.  For anyone caught up in the hectic pace of modern life as Steven Armour is,  some of the points that Dyja makes about choices, taking control, taking responsibility, owning mistakes, and making changes are significant.  In fact they are far more significant than the actual plot of the story, which is in fact a little light weight.<br />The book is a good read for anyone with an interest in ghosts, the Civil War, Civil War reenactment, and family dynamics.

I guess I'd expected more readings and the personal stories behind them.  Instead the book is Mr. Edward's own personal story, especially  his growing mediumship and the development of his program also entitled Crossing Over.<br />While I don't necessarily believe in mediums, and I'm not entirely certain I believe in an afterlife, I have to give the man kudos for the obvious sense of closure that he bestows upon those who attend his shows, seminars and individual sessions.  From the book and the snippets of show I've seen, it appears that, contrary to his detractors, the man really does believe in his work and is not a charlatan.  The skeptic may maintain that Edward reads the living rather than the dead, but the average person with a sense of spirituality who is suffering with the pain of loss will probably find Edward's words far more consoling than those of the skeptic.	2002-10-06

Although the book doesn't  have the narrative strength that some of his later works do, it still bears the hallmark of the exceptional and extensive research that mark all of his work.  (The gentleman was educated at Harvard University, graduating summa cum laude...and Phi Beta Kappa in 1964 and graduating from that institution's medical school in 1969).  This edition of the work includes a postscript on the factual information behind the story which I found fascinating.  I had seen the movie and enjoyed it, which is why I decided to read the book.  The postscript told me something that I had not realized in watching the film, but which made sense upon reflection, namely that the tale is an \\"eyewitness\\" account of the myth of Beowulf.  In short, the narration attempts to strip the embroidery of the ages from what might possibly have been an historical event.  Early Islamic travelers like Ibn Fadlan, Ibn Jubayr, and Ibn Battuta did in fact leave transcripts of their experiences in the far flung reaches of the world, much like the stories of the later Italian adventurer Marco Polo.  The style of Crichton's book carries much of the flavor of these manuscripts, making it very plausible.  Furthermore, archaeological work has recently brought to light the extensive trade connections of the Norsemen or Vikings and illustrated the degree to which Europe had begun to turn to the north for trade and cultural leadership after the fall of the Roman Empire.  It would be interesting to see what Mr. Crichton  could do with the Icelandic sagas or the myth of the Trojan War.  A very entertaining book, but probably more so for those of us who enjoy a little education with our fiction.	2002-09-15

I have a friend who for years tried to get me to read the Tolkien books. She fell in love with them in the 70s when they were very popular and wanted to share them with everyone. I'm not really into narrative prose--although I occasionally read a murder mystery of the classic \\"who-done-it\\" type--so I have never read the books, Fern's efforts not withstanding. When the recent Peter Jackson film Lord of the Rings came out, I was very taken with the trailers for it and decided to see what all of the hullabaloo was about. Needless to say, like many people, I was totally taken with the color, the scenery, the characters and the adventure of the movie. I decided to read some of the books before the advent of the next film, The Two Towers, so that I could be better prepared to enjoy and appreciate it. My first venture into Tolkien's style was The Hobbit or There and Back Again, which I managed to read in a matter of a few hours.<br />Because the film had initially sparked my interest, I read part one of the Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring, from which the action of the movie was taken.  This book is considerably more complex in style than The Hobbit, and probably represents a more mature writer.  (In checking the copywrite dates, I discovered that The Hobbit was, in fact, written in the 1930s, while the Fellowship appears to have been copywrited in the 1950s shortly before the author had retired from his academic career.)  It's narration is much more convoluted, with great attention given to environmental detail and more space devoted to poetry, some of it exquisite--and I don't normally like poetry--than in the earlier work, perhaps reflecting the author's intention to appeal to a more adult audience.  While The Hobbit is a fairy tale, the Lord of the Rings is a more sophisticated fantasy.  The bard like style, the poetical interludes, the almost Celtic character of the story, and the author-created languages reflect Tolkien's background as a linguist, philologist, and translator of Anglo-Saxon poetry.  It is almost as if he is writing a history of the parallel world of elves, halflings, and dwarves that mankind believed existed around them during the early middle ages, a delightful and frightful world of magic and mystery that modern man misses for all his scientific and technological advances!<br />An enjoyable if brief suspension of disbelief.ogist, and translator of Anglo-Saxon poetry.

Almost everyone has one, whether they are willing to admit it or not, even me, and you'd be surprised how willingly people will talk about their own experience given a little encouragement and an open mind.  That's precisely what Hans Holzer has done successfully over the years, and his collections are often intriguing and fun.  Don't expect a quaking in your shoes experience though; for that one has to go to the fiction of Shirley Jackson, Peter Staub, or Steven King.  Holzer's tales are those of everyday people who believe they are host to a haunt--or being hosted by one, as the case may be.<br />One should also not expect a scientific critique of the haunting phenomenon, complete with methods, statistical parameters, or anything of the like.  Although Holzer studied at Columbia University and the University of Vienna and received his doctorate from the London College of Applied Science, most of his books are popularized accounts of his research (he heads the Center for Paranormal Studies, Inc. and taught parapsychology for eight years at the New York Institute of Technology.)  Most of the accounts are told with the expertise of a good story teller, with a back ground build up and a strong denouement, but some of them were disappointing because the lead-in led to nothing more than a statement that the house had passed on to new owners who did not want the phenomenon examined--probably a not infrequent occurrence.  In one story the author is reduced to insulting the new owner of the house in print for thwarting his attempts to pursue research on the property!<br />Great American Ghost Stories, is not the author's best work.  Some of his earlier volumes were a little better.  Here he seems to be pulling old stories from his earlier years, often incomplete studies.  Although copywrited in 1999, most of the accounts date from the 1960s, a fact that was a little disappointing to me; I was hoping for more current events.  I also found the references to &quot;my ex-wife&quot; a little unnerving.  It seemed like more information than I needed.<br />Although I'm none too sure that I believe in ghosts, I like to keep an open mind, and I'm looking forward to reading Holzer's newer book, Ghosts, which is a lengthy account (&gt;700 pages) of more than 200 case studies of paranormal experiences.  I'm not certain how much &quot;science&quot; is actually involved, but the entertainment value is worth it.

But I'm also a bit of a workaholic; that is, I definitely need to feel like I'm doing something constructive.  A career in cabinetmaking seemed to fit the bill, so I've registered for two night courses (out of 17 required) so that by the time I'm ready to retire, I'll have Plan B in place!<br />For both courses the recommended text is Umstattd and Davis's Modern Cabinetmaking.  It's a beautiful, well written, and thorough book on the cabinetmaker's craft, and covers everything from design, drafting, forestry and milling principles, wood types, non-wood products (glass, plastic, ceramic), hardware, processing wood for products, discussions of tools and techniques, finishes, and furniture design, to the employment opportunities available in cabinetmaking.  It's such an exciting and informative volume, that I got almost 1/3 of the way through the 854 pages of the book within a couple of days before my classes even began.<br />Tonight it's Basic Woodworking Fundamentals, tomorrow it's POWER TOOLS!!!  (Boy, if anyone had told me when I was a little girl I'd be this excited about a trip to the hardware store, I'd have thought they were crazy.)	2002-08-28

That's quite a feat in 334 pages, but he does a superb job of putting these complex concepts across for the non-math/physics types like myself.  I had some difficulty getting through his discussion of superstring theory, of which he is one of the primary architects, but the other aspects of the text were more comprehensible.  His style is very conversational, and he often calls upon his own experiences as a student, as a human being, and as a peer with others in the field to illustrate some aspects of his topics.  The illustrations, though few, are clear and helpful.  The bibliographical entries are a little old for a book written in 1994, many from the late 70s and early 80s.  I've read some of the entries in the past and enjoyed most of them. They will definitely give one a thorough background in the recent  history of physics and cosmology.  I've put several of them on my wish list for later purchase.  Notes to the chapters are full of additional historical and explanatory data of interest and are worth taking the time to read.	2002-08-28

It bears a striking resemblance to Per Bak's book How Nature Works, and Bak's research is cited a number of times throughout the text.  As with the Bak work, Buchanan's covers a wide variety of subjects from wars to stock market fluctuations.  Of particular interest to me was the discussion of evolution and the episodic character of mass extinctions, since I've read a number of books on the subject of the K-T boundary extinction.<br />Like Bak, Buchanan points out that much that appears to have historical significance and specific causation, while it makes for good story telling, has little predictive value about it.  He uses Bak's sandpile experiments to illustrate the futility of such efforts by creating a \\"Sandman's view\\" of catastrophe (pp. 179-180).  He imagines a catastrophic sand slide from the point of view of a tiny  survivor to whom events seem to have been \\"due\\" to negligence on the part of the individuals responsible for a steep area.  From the point of view of the sandpile, though, the information required for such control would have to be staggeringly large and nearly perfect in order to have predicted the slide and its effects.  Had some minute change to the pile been possible at the putative disaster site, a similar slide could have occurred elsewhere.  Then the caretakers of the sandpile would have been blamed for causing a disaster rather than preventing one.  One can see in this parable why politicians in the real world tend to seek their own ultimate good rather than that of their constituents or of the environment itself.  The vagaries of prediction caused by the intertwining of particulars and the vastness of the data involved put such individuals in impossible positions.  They are either guilty of  not preventing or of causing various negative outcomes if they are unfortunate or praised for positive outcomes if fortunate.  As the author points out in a quote of John Galbraith, \\"Politics is not the art of the possible.  It consists in choosing between the disastrous and the unpalatable (p. 1).\\"<br />The key point of the book seems to be that many systems are organized on the critical edge between instability and stability.  Life itself may owe its very existence to that fact.  Because of this poised-on-the-edge characteristic, small events may cascade in such a way as to produce major changes: a new value for stocks, a massive extinction that creates new opportunities for remaining species, a redistribution of power among nations, etc.  Which outcomes occur and when, however, are not subject to predictive formulae, even though they may seem ideally suited to it.  If even extreme events are the results of myriads of small, seemingly unimportant events-sort of the butterfly in Japan fluttering its wings concept-then there are no means by which catastrophic events can be predicted any more than smaller ones can be.  According to the author, while there seems to be a mathematical frequency with which incidents of different magnitudes occur, there is no way of divining when a specific outcome of a given magnitude will actually occur, nor are the consequences should such an event be forestalled.  This has implications for events meaningful to human beings:  wars, the stock market peaks and valleys, even extinction events.  For Buchanan, history itself may arise by virtue of natural resolutions of unstable systems of whatever kind.<br />After reading the author's discussion of the Gutenberg-Richter power law and the scale invariance of some systems, it occurred to me that the end of the world scenario presented by Carl Sagan in his book Cosmos-and credited to an earlier researcher-may fall into this category.  In that volume, a chart had been created that plotted murder (private war) to the total destruction of mankind against a time line, finding that total annihilation should occur a few years after the year 2000.  (It was expected closer to mid 21st century, but the original author had not factored in the destructive power of nuclear war.  Later individuals did and produced a chart that suggested armageddon would be around 2010).  While the ultimate war may well occur, if Bak and Buchanan are correct, it might not be due to either predictable or controllable factors, and it will probably not occur on any clear cut timetable like that suggested in Cosmos.<br />An amazingly interesting book full of concepts that, however theoretical, are certainly plausible and explain a lot about our world.ected closer to mid 21st century, but the original author had not factored in the destructive power of nuclear war.

What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It?  is a critique of traditional biblical, which he finds biased and slipshod, and \\"new\\" archaeology, which he feels is almost nihilist-you can't know anything so everything means whatever you want it to and so nothing about it even matters--with neither of which the author is in accord.  It is also the author's attempt to write a philosophical treatise, a mission statement of sorts, for field archaeology.  He outlines-he seems very fond of outlines-various issues that can be resolved by research into the material remains of humans living in the Levant and points out the limitations that are inherent to field.  The work is so clearly written and well organized that it would make a good text on archaeological theory.  His discussion of \\"meaning (p. 70)\\" and \\"proof (p. 71)\\" in archaeological interpretation are especially good, since I don't think that these points are all that apparent to the average person.  He writes of the former, \\"Facts may be assumed to `speak,' but until meaning-a uniquely human quality-is supplied, there is no message....These inherent limitations of the facts brought to light by archaeology must always be kept in mind (p. 70).\\"  And again, \\"I suggest that archaeologists ought rarely to use the word `proof,' because the kind of verification that is possible in sciences that investigate the physical world is simply not obtainable for material-culture remains, even though they are also physical objects....Ultimately... [archaeologists] are dealing with human behavior, and behavior cannot be replicated in the laboratory, nor is it predictable (p. 71).\\"<br />I found the book somewhat hostile at times.  The author William Dever, professor of Near Eastern archaeology and anthropology at the University of Arizona Tucson,  is pretty specific about the individuals with whom he disagrees, and although he helpfully points out the weaknesses in their arguments and is occasionally complimentary to those with whom he is in some agreement, his irritation with his detractors is a little more apparent than I'd have expected in a professional work.  This seems fairly typical of works written in anthropology of late, and archaeology has become more and more aligned with that department as opposed to classics or history with which it had historically been classified.  Having studied a little archaeology during the mid 60s and again in the late 90s, however, I did find his elucidation of the changes of interest.  I also found his frustration with some of the tenets of the \\"new\\" archaeology  validating, since I find some of it positively alienating.<br />The book is a little dry where it deals with the philosophy of archaeology; one has to be something more than just a little interested in the field to get through chapters 1-3.  By chapter 4-5, however, the author begins to illustrate his main thesis by applying his methods to specific problems in the biblical narrative.  While it does not \\"bring the bible to life\\" as a religious person might wish, it definitely brings clarity to the narrative, and a sense of reality to the life of the time period.  Nothing and no one can \\"prove\\" the bible or the existence of God.  That's a matter of personal faith.  But I agree with the author, much can be learned about the life and character of the biblical period through a careful use of the biblical narrative as it exists and through a wary use of material data from the field.<br />An excellent text on archaeology.ully points out the weaknesses in their arguments and is occasionally complimentary to those with whom he is in some agreement, his irritation with his detractors is a little more apparent than I'd have expected in a professional work.

I have a friend who for years tried to get me to read the Tolkien books.  She fell in love with them in the 70s when they were very popular and wanted to share them with everyone.  I'm not really into narrative prose-although I occasionally read a murder mystery of the classic \\"who-done-it\\" type-so I have never read the books, Fern's efforts not withstanding.  When the recent Peter Jackson film Lord of the Rings came out, I was very taken with the trailers for it and decided to see what all of the hullabaloo was about.  Needless to say, like many people, I was totally taken with the color, the scenery, the characters and the adventure of the movie.  I decided to read some of the books before the advent of the next film, The Two Towers, so that I could be better prepared to enjoy and appreciate it.  My first venture into Tolkien's style has been The Hobbit or There and Back Again.  The book is charming, though somewhat simple in narrative style, very like a children's fairy tale or just-so story.  It suffers little for that, however, and is quick and entertaining reading; I got through it in two days despite a heavy personal schedule.<br />The story is of the personal adventures of Bilbo Baggins of Baggins' End, a Hobbit-sort of a small hominid with furry feet-as he attempts to vanquish a dragon who holds a distant kingdom in thrall and to restore the Dwarf ruler Thorin to his patrimony.  It describes all manner of adventures on the way, including meetings with giants, two groups of elves, goblins, a shape shifting human, and a creature of unknown affiliation called Gollum, who is one of my favorite characters.<br />What impressed me most about this book was the remarkable degree to which the author was familiar with his imaginary environment and it's characters.  Not only are the settings and the individuals peopling it described in detail, the author is able to say that such and such is to the \\"north\\" or on the \\"right or left\\" of something else.  One has the distinct feeling that the author has himself \\"been there\\" many times.  It almost makes me want to read something about the man whose mind was so fertile it held an entire world within it.<br />A charming book, well worth reading.  Thank you Fern, however belatedly.ct feeling that the author has himself \\"been there\\" many times.

Years ago I had read an article about the discovery and autopsy of the remains of three seamen from the Franklin expedition.  I was so taken by the arctic story recapitulated for that article that when I discovered Ice Blink I read it greedily, becoming a fan of arctic exploration.  That find lead me to the current book, The Arctic Grail by Canadian historian Pierre Berton.<br />In reading Berton's book, one can hardly fail to notice the fact that most of the search for the Northwest Passage, which occupied many adventurous souls for the better part of the 19th Century, was conducted: 1) by Franklin expeditions, 2) in search of survivors of the last Franklin expedition, 3) in search of information as to the fate of the members of the last Franklin expedition, and 4) in search of relics and journals that might come from the last Franklin expedition.  It also becomes apparent that almost every venture into that frozen land led to tragedy and often death.  It seems that very little was learned either through the experiences of the survivors of the various expeditions or from the lifestyle of the natives of the area.  One is amazed that after the disasters that followed each undertaking, yet another venture would be proposed, despite the loss of life and the evident uselessness of the pass itself.  Each expedition met with nightmarish experiences,  many of the men dying of starvation and exposure, and while the officers might receive promotion in rank and recognition in the history books for their discoveries, the enlisted men who did most of the work got little more than an increase in pay if they lived to get it.<br />Of the rush to the North Pole, all that can be honestly said is that the notoriety of superhuman effort and of the attainment of nearly impossible goals inspired some pretty disgraceful behavior on behalf of a number of, particularly American, explorers.  It becomes obvious that the chicanery of ambitious men looking to make a fortune as celebrities did not start in the last half of the 20th century.  Both Cook and Peary seemed driven men whose egos could sustain the possible blight of fraudulent claims disputed by the records but not of public failure.  What is sad, particularly in the latter case, is that the actual attainments of the discoverer were pretty amazing as it was.  No one since has achieved quite so much under the same conditions.  While others have been to the pole successfully, it required air dropped supplies and a flight in or out of the area.<br />Throughout the entire book one is confronted with a sense of a major lack of real respect for nature by so-called civilized man.  It is tempting to see this attitude as a peculiarly 20th (now 21st) century phenomenon, but it seems to have had a good start in the 19th century.  The hubris that makes modern man feel that he can tame nature with his various gadgets may just be part and parcel of human nature.  Maybe it's just wishful thinking.<br />One of the particularly distressing aspects of the explorers accounts is of the callous treatment of the native population and of the total marginalization of their contributions.  It's apparent from Berton's book that the safe return of many explorers was due largely to help from the Eskimos.  I think a thorough narrative of Arctic exploration from their point of view-both their own conquest of the area and their take on the European and American explorations-might make very interesting reading indeed!<br />All in all the book is well written and well researched.  It would definitely appeal to anyone with an interest in history, in man against nature, in man in nature, in geography, ethnography, and 19th Century culture.  Anyone with a reading level of 6th grade or above should be able to comprehend it, and it might make interesting reading especially for young men.did not start in the last half of the 20th century.

Although there is little that is new in the text, the author has put the information into perspective for the reader, discussing a number of aspects and points of view.  Probably one of the most salient points he makes is that if , as some would have us believe, life is ubiquitous to the universe to the extent that water equals life, then the basic scientific world view may have to be overhauled. He writes:<br />In claiming that water means life, NASA scientists are not merely being upbeat about their project.  They are making--tacitly--a huge [italics] and profound assumption about the nature of nature.  They are saying, in effect, that the laws of the universe are cunningly contrived to coax life into being against the raw odds; that the mathematical principles of physics, in their elegant simplicity, somehow know in advance about life and its vast complexity.  If life follows from soup with causal dependability, the laws of nature encode a hidden subtext, a cosmic imperative, which tells them: 'Make life!'  And, through life, its by-products: mind, knowledge, understanding.  It means the laws of the universe have engineered their own comprehension.  This is a breathtaking vision of nature, magnificent and uplifting in its majestic sweep.  I hope it is correct.  It would be wonderful if it were correct.  But if it is, it represents a shift in the scientific world-view as profound as that initiated by Copernicus and Darwin put together.  It should not be glossed over with glib statements that water plus organics equals life, obviously, for it is far from obvious (p. 246).<br />This book and Rare Earth by Peter Douglas Ward and Donald Brownlee pretty much cover the life in the universe topic for anyone interested in the topic, and both are engagingly written and understandable.	2002-08-06

I learned a lot that I had missed by dropping out of my degree program prior to going on my summer field camp. There were examples of debris flows, unconformities, erosional channels, wind formations, faulting, uplift of sea bed strata with fossiliferous deposits, all an education in themselves. I also learned that hours on end in the hot sun plotting individual grains of rock for size, shape, color, angularity, and inclination is not my cup of tea. It makes a great summer vacation for the enthusiastic amateur, but I couldn't imagine it as a permanent, full time  job. I decided I had missed nothing by remaining a nurse, and looked forward to a publication of results that I could enjoy in the quiet of my own home!<br />Just such a report has since be published (2000). I had the great good fortune to discover Walter L. Friedrich's volume Fire in the Sea  while browsing the various Amazon links from another book on geology. Although it's not an in depth geological or archaeological survey of the research on the island, it is an excellent compendium for the page length of what is known about it with respect to these two topics. Above all it is an approachable discourse on the tectonic history of Santorini, both ancient and modern. There are wonderful photos of the various vistas around the island-many of which I recognized from my own visit there--and several maps that show the development of the site through time. Reports of volcanism and earthquake activity through the ages are included from earlier authors that give an almost biographical character to the story of Santorini or ancient Thera, and there are several illustrations of Minoan art work that help recreate the character of the island prior to the eruption for which the volcano is most noted and often cited, that during Minoan times ca. 1700 BC.  At the end of the book in Appendix 1, the author has included one of Plato's Dialogs discussing the ancient tale of Atlantis with which the island has been linked by a number of researchers.<br />I found the book to be an excellent discourse on the geology of the island but was a little disappointed in that there was so little about the archaeological site of Akrotiri, especially as geologists-including Dr. Floyd McCoy, with whom I worked and who is mentioned in the volume-have been very helpful in illuminating some of the events of the city's last moments.  The excavation site is fascinating, as the structures are preserved in places up to second stories. The faulted stair case (p. 70) is included and is one of the most emotive sights in the devestated city, but a more thorough discussion of the site and what is believed to have occurred there during the eruption that ended its life is a very stirring tale, one that could have lent a greater sense of the moment to the reader. It would also illustrate how the activities of archaeology and geology are integrated to generate productive results.  Although the author discusses in brief some of the concerns of the modern inhabitants of the island, I would also have enjoyed more photos of the modern towns in the area, since I suspect they are very like those that have existed on the island since antiquity. A discussion of their own history and likely future would have added a sense of continuity to the tale of Santoriniand often cited, that during Minoan times ca. 1700 BC.

The book is an interesting collection of stories of individuals with neurological deficits that highlight and clarify how the normal brain works.  The author approaches his study with a compassion for his patient's troubled existence, and where the patients are content with their lot, he prudently leaves well enough alone, something not all MD's are willing to do.  He also appreciates what his patients have to teach him about life and even about the practice of medicine itself.  His ability to learn from others considered \\"unfortunate\\" or mentally \\"defective\\" makes the book a very insightful work.<br /> While the author's extensive clinical practice has allowed him to make some interesting statements about what parts of the brain are involved with different mental functions, what he fails to do in this book is to provide anything approaching testable ideas or actual research supporting his theories.  The colorful stories are well worth reading as moral parables, but a better book on current  mind and brain research might be Ramachandran's Phantoms in the Brain.  One might begin with the Sacks book, which is easy to read, and proceed to the more extensive work by Ramachandran.	2002-07-25

Indeed if you take into account the extensive career of Freud, who was himself a neuro-anatomist prior to pursuing his medical profession, neurology and neuropsychology have well over a 150 years behind them.<br />In the book The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, written in the 1970 and reprinted a number of times since, Oliver Sacks illustrates peculiar neurological deficits arising from various insults to the brain, from tumors to strokes and seizures.  Although he can pinpoint the areas of brain compromise that cause the patient's problems and, like Freud, give the reader some theory as to what aspect of the \\"self\\" is effected, he does little beyond this.  In Phantoms of the Brain, Ramachandran recounts numerous colorful stories, but develops a theory of what level of brain function is the cause of the observed deficits, then proceeds to test his theory with further study, making the \\"self\\" a topic of research.  In the true spirit of scientific research he publishes his findings and elicits input from fellows in the field.  Where there is a discrepancy, he and others conduct further research to illuminate the findings and integrate the data into the overall theory.  While he freely admits that a true science of the mind is in its infancy,  he also points at the major advances made since Freud's work.<br />One of the things I found most unique about the author's style is that he points out the pertinent contributions in the works of other, often earlier researchers, particularly Freud.  It seems to have become fashionable to treat Freud and his work with great disrespect, ignoring that he was a man of his times and very progressive in his thinking for that time.  Not all of his work is useless, particularly that in neuro-anatomy, and as is often the case in science, as more research is done today it may be found that some of his theoretical work is less faulty than has been thought.  Ramachandran gleans the traces of gold from the mine of Freud's work and integrates them into his own.<br />The author's writing style is conversational and clear.  He appears to be a natural teacher, making the work obtainable for any person with average reading skills.

I had expected to have more of an evolutionary discussion of the brain and the mind than this book produced.  To the extent that it hardly lived up to its title, The Mind's Past (by Robert M. Sapolsky,) I was greatly disappointed.  Little effort is made to even suggest the evolutionary history of the brain or mind, a topic that would probably have had to be mostly guesswork anyway.  The author's style is stultifying; I literally fell asleep several times, trying to plow through it, and it's only 170 pages of information that is not difficult in itself.  Much of the material on the scientific study of consciousness, the mind, and the brain are, however,  better dealt with in other sources.  Something just over 170 pages is simply not enough to really inform the reader.  The Astonishing Hypothesis: The Scientific Search for the Soul by Francis Crick, although painfully detailed and very slow reading, will certainly bring a person up to speed on the topic of brain and mind science (though not the soul), as would The Emotional Brain by Joseph Ledoux.  Take warning, though, neither of these books is a quick read.  A more general and more thoroughly readable book is Mapping the Mind by Rita Carter.  For a good general book on the mind and emotions and the way they effect the body try Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers by  Robert M. Sapolsky, a thoroughly fun book.	2002-07-20

Years ago I had read a National Geographic article about the discovery of the frozen bodies of three seamen from an ill fated expedition to explore the Arctic for the fabled Northwest Passage.  The modern discoverers of the remains were scientists who performed an onsite autopsy to determine the cause of death, as the scope of the disaster had left many unanswered questions since it's occurrence in the mid-19th Century.  The amount of knowledge that was gained after more than a century post mortem was impressive, and left a lasting memory of the unfortunate expedition: The Franklin Polar Expedition.  When I saw the summary for the book The Ice Blink, I was immediately captured by the Franklin subject, and got the book.<br />The volume reads like a novel, written as it is by a well researched journalist rather than an historian.  I read it in a single day, almost in a single sitting, so riveting is its human detail.  The author covers the topic lengthily, including other equally unfortunate attempts to search for the passage to the Pacific by way of the northern most reaches of North America.  He details the careers of the various officers as well as that of the Second Secretary of the British  Admiralty, Sir John Barrow, who was as much a part of the events as any of the actual participants.  He outlines the background of many of the enlisted men, and points out the financial incentives that encouraged them to go on the discovery voyage.  He also points out that few who had been on one before, were actually willing to go for any amount of money!<br />Cookman's biography of the titular leader of the expedition, Sir John Franklin is illuminating, but that of the captain of the Terror is by far the most interesting.  Francis Croiser was passed over as leader of the expedition on the basis of his social and ethnic status (Irish middle class) but was the most experienced of the officers with the rigors of polar exploration.  It was ultimately on his shoulders that command fell after the early death of Franklin, and under the worst of all possible conditions.  From physical remains found at the site of the abandoned ships and strewn across the landscape following the doomed men's path, it would appear that the flight from the pack ice in which both ships had been imprisoned for almost 18 months had been well and carefully planned by Croiser, and except for the desperation and hopelessness of their situation might well have brought a few home.  He certainly seems to have given them the only real hope they had of survival.<br />The author paints a vivid picture of the retreat of the men, using the 19th Century reports of efforts to find survivors, those of modern investigators of known sites (like that mentioned above) and of reports by other explorers and natives who accidentally discovered remains.  Putting the story together with what is known of other polar expeditions, what is known of the 19th Century naval organization, and the society of the time, and the information about the Arctic that 20th Century polar expeditions have given us, Cookman provides the reader with a thoroughly convincing tale of the early conditions of exploration.<br />What makes the story most intriguing, though, is the probable cause of the disaster itself, which turns out to have been staggering greed, incredible double dealing  and total indifference to the fate and well being of others.  There is definitely a message to the modern world in the tale of the \\"lowest bidder!\\"  Steven Spielberg should make a movie of the entire affair!

I was a student at the time when various fields (Native American studies, Women studies, Afro-American studies, etc.) were just being established, and although I took a minor in anthropology, I never got into the topics underwritten by these new departments.  Since I also worked in the book store, I was aware that two of the key texts for Native American studies were Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee and Black Elk Speaks.  Sad to say, but it took me nearly 30 years before I read either book.<br />The former book was written by a sympathetic outsider who painted the American Indian as a helpless victim of European greed--which for the most part he was/is.  The latter was dictated to an interested party, John G. Neihardt, and is the words and reminiscences of Nicholas Black Elk, who witnessed as a child or participated in as an adult, some of the major events of the American Indian Wars that were the outcome of the US expansion into the West.  For those of us reared on John Ford westerns, manifest destiny and pioneering had a patriotic ring, as well they might most of them having been made in the years immediately following WWII.  In the social souring of the sixties and seventies that brought so many discontented groups vocally into the foreground, it became more obvious that the expression of manifest destiny by our European forebearers spelled manifest disaster for the Native American populations across the country.  An outgrowth of the discontent of the &quot;younger generation&quot; was the establishment of the afore said departments.  That of American Indian studies introduced us to the more honest, or at least more balanced, story of the indigenous people of the country.<br />Black Elk Speaks is a superb eye witness account of the Sioux experience with European expansion into the Dakotas.  It is a clear narrative of the frightening attack on a child's village by an invader intent upon killing women, children and the elderly as well as the males of fighting age.  It tells of a life that revolves around the buffalo, an animal whose numbers were countless during the author's youth but dwindled to near extinction along with the American Indian himself by the end of the narrator's life.  The story is one of growing up in a society where the young learn their roles from all adults by observation and imitation, where each individual graduates into the next age grade together with and by the aide of his peers, and where part of what is learned is not simply ones expected &quot;rights&quot; but ones expected responsibilities as well.<br />Although I enjoyed the story as a whole, I found the narration of the subject's spiritual experiences somewhat tedious, but then I find the repetitive style of the heroic poems of  ancient Greece, like the Iliad and the Odyssey, and those of  Saxon England, like Beowulf, somewhat difficult also.  I am a product of my age, a child of the printed rather than the recited word.  Perhaps if I had been reared at the fireside of the great houses of ancient Greece and England I would find myself more at one with the rhythm of this style of story telling.  Acknowledging this as my own shortcoming, I will say that my favorite part of the book is the author's story of his adventures with a Wild West show in England, of his having been abandoned there when the Tour went home and of his exploits attempting to get home again.  The most moving part of the narrative I'll share with you:<br /> &quot;I did not know then how much was ended.  When I look back now from this high hill of my old age, I can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch as plain as when I saw them with eyes still young.  And I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud, and was buried in the blizzard.  A people's dream died there.  It was a beautiful dream.  And I, to whom so great a vision was given in my youth,--you see me now a pitiful old man who had done nothing, for thenation's hoop is broken and scattered.  There is no center any longer, and the sacred tree is dead P. 207).&quot;<br />Powerful.the nation's hoop is broken and scattered.

I started the first page and before I realized it I was at the last page!  In one sitting minus the time it took to take my Great Dane Tempo out to do his \\"business.\\"<br />Although Larson is not an academic historian, he is a thorough journalist with articles in several publications, including Time, The Atlantic Monthly, Harper's and The Wall Street Journal, and several books to his credit.  His research of the topic is extensive, as witnessed by the bibliography, and his writing style is riveting.<br />Isaac's Storm describes an intriguing, almost mythic time in history, the turn of the 20th Century.  This was a time of expansion, a time when it seemed that western man, having colonialized most of the known world and traveled to the most inaccessible portions of the globe, would be able to conquer nature itself.  It was nothing if not an exuberant and naive time, an adolescence full of questions.  Darwin had questioned the tenets of faith and divine creation, Shaw the social and sexual hierarchy, Ibsen the values of the middle class, Marx the validity of capitalism.  Cline and his fellows were busy questioning the basis of cimate and weather.  It was a time of new inventions, a gadget age which witnessed the introduction of the telegraph, the telephone, and the automobile.  The Titanic, World War I,the disillusionment of the Jazz Age, and the Great Depression were still in the offing, just beyond the horizon, but in September of 1900 nothing yet seemed impossible.<br />Isaac Cline was a man of the times.  He was a workaholic and polymath of considerable talent, having graduated from a local Tennessee college and a training program in meteorology conducted by the military in behalf of it's nascent Weather Bureau.  He went on to get a medical degree and research the effects of climate on health while fulfilling his obligations as a meteorologist for the government.  Later in life he studied art and became an artist, art connoisseur and dealer.  It was evident by his thoroughness that he was proud of his work and shared the fundamental beliefs of his class and time.<br />While Cline is an interesting individual and the thread that binds the story together, the real personality of Larson's book is the hurricane itself; the book is really the biography of a storm.  The Galveston hurricane of September 1900 was of mythic proportions, an almost Armageddon event, and Larson tells its tale well.  It has a \\"family tree,\\" of sorts, beginning with experiences with Carribean hurricanes by men like Columbus and his arch enemy Don Jose Solano, and by those of amateur meteorologists in Cuba, and with the cyclones of the Bay of Bengal by European students of weather in India.  It also has a \\"personal\\" history, and Larson follows it from its birth in Equatorial Africa to it's march through the Atlantic across Cuba and on to Galveston.  Material as diverse as ships logs and the personal comments by captains and crews caught at sea by the storm add a sense of impending disaster to the description.<br />The story of the Hurricane of 1900 is made very real to the reader through a narrative of the events from the perspective of survivors.  Like tales of the Johnstown Flood, which had happened a few years earlier (and from whom the people of Galveston received relief aid after the storm) the stories of tragic loss and miraculous survival are moving.  The characters of many the individuals are made vivid through information gleaned in diaries, letters, government documents, newspapers, and personal reminiscences.  The reader is captured in the details of the daily life of the city and its in habitants in such a way that the outcome of the storm is not a matter of idyl curiosity but one of personal urgency.  I found myself so taken by the story of one family, that when a woman was found dead, I had to make certain by reading back again, that she was not a member of \\"my\\" family.  I felt relief in knowing she was not, but a sense of anxiety too, in not knowing the outcome of their tale.

An online friend with similar interests, Steven Haines,  recommended Daniel C. Dennett's book Darwin's Dangerous Idea to me some time ago.  (Last year, as I recall).  So enthusiastic was/is he over it, that he actually sent me a copy!  After reading the book--and it took me weeks rather than days to do it--I have to say that I have mixed feelings about it.  On the one hand I definitely found it dense with information, a thorough critique of Darwinism and its modern variants, and certainly a very interesting work.  On the other hand I found it very slow and difficult reading.<br />The book doesn't simply lay before the reader the author's observations and research on his topic like so many others.  In fact  Dennett  himself  points out this fact in his introduction when he notes that the volume is a book on science not a work of science.  As he rightfully notes, &quot;Science is not done by quoting authorities, however eloquent and eminent, and then evaluating their arguments (p. 11).&quot;  What he does do is describe the topic of Darwinian evolution and its impact on society, then presents the observations and research of diverse professionals in the field, critically dissecting them for the benefit and edification of the reader.  It should be noted that Dennett  is not himself an anthropologist or biologist, but he is trained in critical analysis.  As  Distinguished Arts and Sciences Professor at Tufts University and director of that institution's Center for Cognitive Studies, he is considered a philosopher whose specialty is consciousness as high-level, abstract thinking and is known as a leading proponent of the computational model of the mind.  As such he is also considered a philosophical leader among the artificial intelligence (AI) community.  His credentials, therefore, give him more than adequate qualifications for performing the above noted dissection with precision and thoroughness.<br />It is sometimes difficult for the average person, especially one who is not specifically trained in a field of research or in the rules of logic, to be objective about the literature in an area outside their specialty.  The power of the written word, the forceful current of a persuasive argument,  and the care with which confirming evidence is presented and refuting evidence suppressed or camouflaged, all make it difficult to see the flaws in some of the popular works on evolution--or any other science.  Therein lies the value of Professor Dennett's efforts in DDI.  He carefully points out the errors and strengths of the authors he cites.  As he writes, &quot;There is no such thing as a sound Argument from Authority, but authorities can be persuasive, sometimes rightly and sometimes wrongly.  I try to sort this all out....(p. 11).&quot;  And he does so step by step so that the reader can follow the logic or illogic of the arguments under discussion.  In doing so he takes on some pretty visible and popular authors, Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Dawkins among the better known perhaps, and some very high level math-physics intellects, most notably Stuart  Kaufmann and Roger Penrose.<br />I found that the work almost seemed like a collection of essays of varying length on assorted topics with all of them linked by a common theme.  The book  is probably best read with this in mind, since it's difficult to digest in a single sitting or even with a single read.  (I tend to use post-it-note page markers to highlight points on pages I wish to review after finishing a book.  There were so many post-it-notes marking my copy of DDI, that a friend at work pointed out that I might just as well re-read the entire book.  He's probably right!)  Part of the problem lies in the book's basic premis.  As a critique of various works by diverse authorities, it demands that the reader more actively participate in the thought process of that criticism.  And that participation requires a rather diverse background of knowledge: anthropology, architecture, artificial intelligence,  biology, evolutionary theory, game theory, physics, philosophy, are among some of the topics covered under the cover of Darwin and evolution!  It also requires some knowledge of the author's under discussion.<br />While I don't want to scare a prospective reader, I also think that this book might be a little more than most can or wish to handle.  I do think that the person who undertakes to read it, devoting to the project the time and care that it deserves, will come away with, not only a good deal of solid information, but with a first rate training in critical thinking as well!re, artificial intelligence,  biology, evolutionary theory, game theory, physics, philosophy, are among some of the topics covered under the cover of Darwin and evolution!

No where is this more evident than in intensive care.  As an older nurse listening to the new grads, I realize this over and over.  While experience has taught me the &quot;hows&quot; and &quot;whens&quot; of many events, procedures, treatments, etc., even in a teaching hospital it has not necessarily taught me the &quot;whys&quot; of things, which makes it difficult to predict and to prevent negative outcomes.  The education which was adequate in the time in which it was received may be woefully inadequate in today's modern ICU, and with nursing shortages approaching critical mass, older nurses will and probably should be encouraged to remain in their practice.  While taking the CCRN exam may not improve the situation, studying for it certainly will.  Since I received my license, I have attempted to periodically review some aspect of my profession: chemistry, A&amp;P, nutrition, pharmacology, etc.  The CCRN exam books have been a wonderful source of ICU specific information, and over the years I've purchased several of them.  Each author has his/her own format which trains the student along certain pathways.  Using more than one has helped me a lot.  For strips and 12-leads,  I've relied on the Rapid Interpretation of EKG's by Dr Dale Dubin.  I purchased my first copy in the 1970s, when it first came out, and recently bought the new volume for the new information it contains.  As an SICU nurse, I don't do more than simple monitor work, so my knowledge of the fine points is limited and requires periodic review.  (I'm in total awe of CCU nurses; to me they seem almost psychic!)  Among the three CCRN review books I've read recently (Critical Care Examination REVIEW, Vonfrolio and Noone; Critical Care Certification, Ahrens and Prentice; and Pass CCRN, Dennison) each has its points.  The Vonfrolio book is quick, direct, and compact.  Among others, it has 187 questions dedicated to CV alone, and 135 to pulmonary.  With these two areas the core of the Exam and certainly core to ICU, it provides a good work out.  The plus with this text, is that it provides a good run down of why the right answer is right and the wrong answers  wrong.  It helps one think the problem through the way one would at the bedside.  There are no &quot;answers in the back&quot; of ICU! What this book lacks, however, is a review of A&amp;P.  The Ahrens book and the Dennison volume do provide it.  I found the review of A&amp;P in Pass CCRN almost daunting, however, because it's in outline form.  It packs in massive amounts of information over a few pages.  One tends to scan rather than read it.  The exercises  in the book are excellent, helping one think about principles rather than  &quot;answers,&quot;  increasing knowledge base through thought processes rather than pt specific information.  I found the crossword puzzles less useful to me and passed over them, but then I'm not a crossword puzzle person; those who are, may find it a perfect way to learn.  The A&amp;P in Ahrens is in a narrative format, which may be easier for most learners than an outline. It provides a less detailed but still adequate description of each system at the beginning of the chapter dedicated to it, and the questions are more geared to test A&amp;P concepts.  I found the information provided was more naturally memorable than a list of facts.  While I make and use flash cards for memorization purposes, I try not to rely on rote to achieve my learning goals because it seems too temporary.  The Dennison outline is a flashcard writ large! If this is the best way for you to learn, however, go for it. The strength of the Dennison book really, is it's detailed discussion of test taking.  While most of the CCRN  books give you general tips: get plenty of rest, eat a salty breakfast (?), guess if you don't know, etc, the Dennison text takes each individual question and teaches the student how to examine it for clues.  It teaches test taking principles.  For those of you who are actually studying for the exam itself, especially if you are prone to test anxiety, the Dennison is probably the best book for you for that very reason.

Although it concentrates heavily on the Athenian contribution to history, it does not stop with the end of the classical period as if nothing of importance had happened after the end of the Peloponnesian War.  From notes by professional reviewers I had understood that Charles Freeman was a British professor, so I found most unusual his use of translations of Greek and Latin texts by other authors, even of quotes of translations quoted by other secondary sources (p. 189).  This left me with a feeling that the author's credentials might be a little weak.  He definitely offers little that is new with respect to the interpretation of historic events, art, architecture, etc, but he does offer insight into the history of the West's concept of Greek achievement.  I had already learned of the painted surfaces and crowded display of statuary that we now see as pristine white marble displayed with great care, individually in our museums world wide.  What I hadn't quite understood  was the degree to which the character of ancient Greek culture, even of the notion of &quot;Greece&quot; and &quot;Greek,&quot;  had been filtered through the prism of the 19th Century psyche, particularly those of scholar Robert Wood, art historian Johann Winkelmann, and financier and adventurer Heinrich Schliemann.  For anyone wanting to find out about the overall events of the period this is a good place to start.  There is an excellent date list with summary of events and artistic examples on pages 445 to 462, which might help the survey student study for exams, and a list of books on various topics (with publication dates from the mid 80's to the mid 90's) with which to follow up on selected subjects.  The material is clearly presented and would be fully comprehended by senior high students and even interested junior high students, and would thus make a good addition to a school library.on to a school library.	2002-06-12

I enjoyed  \\"Catastrophe:  An Investigation into the Origins of the Modern World\\" rather more than I initially expected I would.  I had anticipated from the description of the book something more on the line of \\"Floods, Famines and Emporers\\" or possibly  \\"The Little Ice Age\\" by Fagan, both of which I enjoyed.  The latter books look at the direct effects of weather and climate, more specifically at the el Nino and NAO, on the course of world history.  While Keys does use climate--and it's effect on plague carrying organisms--as a binding thread to his work, he must  restate this fact in the summary of each of his chapters to remind the reader.  In Fagan climate is the central focus of the work.  So I had to re-estimate the direction and theme of the book, something I hadn't expected to do.<br />What Keys' book does do and does well, is to examine a broad geographical area within a segment of history ( about 530-1200 AD).  Although this is not generally my era of choice (I prefer ancient and prehistoric),  I have to admit to having been fascinated by Key's construction of the period.  By drawing many of the loose strands of the human drama together, he illuminates the stage upon which many events of our own time were enacted.  This period tends to be chaotic and difficult to study because of its fragmented character.  Many aspects, particularly events in marginal areas, tend to have been wholly neglected by researchers as they focused on Western culture, as represented by the Byzantines,  and  Eastern culture and the spread of Islam.  As I have often maintained after reading books that dealt with odd topics relating to marginal areas (as for instance in the books \\"The Mummies of Urumchi\\" or \\"The Tarim Mummies\\"), it is in peripheral areas, the cross roads of the world, that true understanding of world history probably lies.  It seems as though the activity in the \\"wings\\" determines to a far greater extent then often realized, what happens on the center stage of human history.<br />Keys makes this very evident.  Because of his choice of time period with its proximity to our own, his discussion of the events that took place in these back corridors of the world and their effects on the course of modern history makes the importance of peripheral events much more apparent to the reader.  For instance, his discussion of the effects of climate on the movement of plague infested animals in Africa is very illuminating. This is especially true as it pertains to the density of human settlement and to the effects of international connections along trade routes.  The historic spread of Bubonic and other plagues throughout the world by these means has important implications for modern nations facing movements of antibiotic resistant disease organisms and alien plant and animal pests into naive environments by these same means but at a greatly accelerated rate.  (The books \\"The Parrot?s Lament\\" and \\"The Future of Life\\" both focus on these threats to the modern world.)<br />Of greatest interest is the author's concluding chapter which projects the world into the future after looking at some of the underlying principles of change in the past.  Some of the author's geologic scenarios, though interesting and already known to me,  are a little far fetched--more the stuff of a made for TV movie--but the possibility of a major disaster that realigns the world is not.

His life time achievements in areas such as the cosmic microwave background, quasars, black holes and gamma ray bursts was recently recognized by the Peter Gruber Foundation which bestowed it's Cosmology Prize on him last year (2001).  His credentials as an author on the subject are thus well founded.<br />Just Six Numbers is a very concise discussion of the defining factors that shape the universe as we know it, and although the underlying  physics of the book  would probably consume volumes, Rees' little (165 pages) book certainly does a very adequate job of clearly putting the topic across for the lay reader.  It adds very little that is truly new, however, except the discussion of the recent concept of Lambda, the so-called cosmic antigravity constant which may control the expansion of the universe.  Rees is one of the proponents and designers of the multiverse theory of reality, about which he was recently interviewed by a popular science magazine, but the book dwells very little on this philosophically intriguing subject, dedicating only about 13 pages to it.<br />This would be a good book for young people with an interest in the subject of cosmology to begin their research on the topic of the physics of the universe.  It requires adequate reading skills but little actual math.  Unfortunately, the bibliography is essentially nonexistant, although the footnotes to the text contain some references that the student might pursue.<br />A simply written little book on a difficult topic by a very competent scientist.	2002-05-07

It took completing the book and then rereading points I had highlighted throughout the text to make sense of it at all.  While I found some of the information helpful and instructive and some of it intriguing, I'm not altogether sure I would recommend it as a way of finding out about the \\"Four Strands\\" of which Dr. Deutsch composes his ultimate reality.  Reading some of the works he includes in his bibliography might be a  more helpful starting point for the average person interested in the subject.  Among these are The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins, The Blind Watchmaker, also by Dawkins, Popper's Conjectures and Refutations and The Myth of the Framework and Weinberg's The First Three Minutes.<br />Although I agree with the author, and with E. O. Wilson (Consiliance), that a certain synthesis among the various branches of human knowledge are a necessary prerequisite for advancing much beyond what the 20ieth century has accomplished, I'm not certain that I'm yet prepared for or convinced of the need for a multiverse explanation of reality.<br />The author makes some very important points about science which bear repeating for those who have not yet heard them. For instance,  \\"A scientific argument is intended to persuade us that a given explanation is the best one available.  It does not and could not say anything about how that explanation will fare when, in the future, it is subjected to new types of criticism and compared with explanations that have yet to be invented (p. 64).\\"  This is a fundamental principle of the scientific process that escapes many lay individuals and even some scientists.<br />He also notes that scientific theories  must do more than simply predict the future, since \\"Shoddy explanations that yield correct predictions are two a penny, as UFO enthusiasts, conspiracy-theorists and pseudo-scientists of every variety should (but never do) bear in mind (p. 65).\\"<br />More importantly still in describing scientific methodology the author writes, \\"Here I must mention an asymmetry which is important in the philosophy and methodology of science: the asymmetry between experimental refutation and experimental confirmation. Whereas an incorrect prediction automatically renders the underlying explanation unsatisfactory, a correct prediction says nothing at all about the underlying explanation (p.65).\\"  This too is often forgotten or misunderstood by those who do not do research of this kind.<br />In general the book tries to cover too much in too small a space.

1571884:US	50669529	R3I8KVTAZ1PMCX	073820143X	589019468	Isaac Newton: The Last Sorcerer (Helix Books)	Books	5	47	50	N	N	Wonderful reconcilliation of the paradoxes	I had been a little disappointed in White's biography of da Vinci, Leonardo: The First Scientist (for which see my review), because I felt he had overstepped the boundaries of the available data and wandered vastly into the realm of speculation.  When his book  Isaac Newton: The Last Sorcerer came to my attention I was dubious, but I needn't have been.  This volume seems very well researched, and what speculation the author offers is not beyond that which arises naturally from his material.  In fact, it is not much beyond that which other authors have also raised.<br />Although I have never read a book entirely dedicated to the physicist, I have often run across biographical information on the man in my other reading on the topic of physics.  My first introduction to Newton as a person was in an early book by Carl Sagan.  The latter seemed inclined to view Newton as a petty, introverted  man who came up with a brilliant contribution to science but who was otherwise enmeshed in the totally unscientific pursuit of alchemy, an endeavor that ultimately poisoned him after first driving him mad. It must be admitted, however, that Sagan's primary purpose had not been a biography of Newton.  White definitely gives the subject a better and fairer hearing.  In The Last Sorcerer, he makes it obvious that Newton's dabbling in the occult sciences, while less productive of useful information itself, helped structure his way of thinking about other problems which did.  Furthermore, he gives credit to the man's thorough knowledge of metals, solvents, furnaces and techniques involved in alchemy, in short of incipient chemistry, as a contributing factor to his later successes in science and other endeavors.  He notes too that other notable and productive scientists of the time are known to have dabbled in this subject.  This after all was a time of emergent science, when anything yet seemed possible.<br />In going beyond Newton the genius of physics, White brings the whole man to the fore.  He explains some of his social background (upper middle class for the day), his ambition (the YUPPIES of that generation), the origin of his paranoia regarding his work (not unlike the high-tech world's concern over the loss of rights to its intellectual property through theft), and his pettiness (though here White wanders farthest into speculation).  It was interesting to know that Newton had enjoyed several careers during his long lifetime.  He brought his considerable talents and drive to the rolls of  academic, politician, Master of the Mint (during which time he also became a detective and public prosecutor of sorts), and Royal Society president.<br />I have to admit to a certain shock--obviously felt, too, by those of his time--at Newton's vicious persecution of scientific rivals.  The degree to which he and Robert Hooke went at it, with the latter coming off as the villain, was surprising enough.  The battles between Newton and the Astronomer Royal Flamsteed, whose life's work was virtually stolon without compensation for Newton's benefit, and that between him and the brilliant mathematician Leibneiz, with whom Newton now shares the laurels for the creation of the Calculus, is appalling.  It certainly shows the degree to which even our scientific heros participate in &quot;feet of clay!&quot;  It also shows the pitfalls of hero worship.  In the end White reminds us that wonderful work can come from people we don't really like very much, which reminds us too that, unlike technology and art wherein things are invented or created and are therefore one of a kind, science is a body of discoveries.  If not Einstein, then probably someone else.  Maybe later than it actually occurred, but still eventually.  Newton was apparently enough aware of this fact to guard his priority with all the aggressiveness of a lioness her cubs.<br />I found it most interesting the degree to which Newton and others of his time were self taught.  Although many of the scientifically productive men of the time received university education, as did Newton himself,  much of their overall knowledge had been gleaned by their own studies.  It has always been my opinion that our educational system tends to discourage the student's curiosity by channeling it forcefully along specific courses, without due attention to that individual's personal interests.  While not all of us will be Newtons, and certainly not all of us have his gift of concentration and driven singleness of purpose, most might benefit from a greater latitude in what we read when we are learning to read, and how we use mathematics when we learn them.tifically productive men of the time received university education, as did Newton himself,  much of their overall knowledge had been gleaned by their own studies.

Since I had found Brian Fagan's book Floods, Famines and Emperors very thought provoking, I decided to read his more recent book The Little Ice Age: How Climate Made History, 1300-1850.  I was not disappointed.<br />Professor Fagan carries on a tradition (which he freely admits was discredited in the past but is now enjoying a renaissance because of newer information) of viewing history through the eyes of a paleoclimatologist.  Much of what he had said in the earlier text, namely that many of mankind's major social and cultural transitions have been climate and weather driven, made a good deal of sense to me.  Episodes such as the Sea People's invasion of the ancient Levant with the ultimate collapse of the Hittite empire and the reduction of the Egyptian during the late second millennium B.C.E. have long been thought to have been the result of droughts experienced in northern Europe.  Similarly the demise of the Moche in Peru, of the Mayan civilizations in Middle America, and of the pueblo cultures in the  Southwestern US are believed to have been the result of el Nino/la Nina weather changes, massive rains in the case of the Moche and severe drought in the latter two cases.  Although no one would say that any of these historic human changes occurred purely in response to climate, it is abundantly apparent that the economic impact of especially prolonged climate changes on large subsistence level populations tend to leave the more inflexible social systems at great risk.<br />The earlier book described the probable role of el Nino/ la Nina cycles on world climate, while  more briefly discussing the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and it's effects.  It was also concerned with  much earlier cultures.  The current book discusses the North Atlantic Oscillation in much greater detail and outlines it's specific effects on the climate and social environment of Europe and North America during more recent times.  The material is dealt with in a very clear manner and was not difficult to understand even with my average person's more casual understanding of weather and climate.<br />Because the history is of events in more recent time, especially in the last half of the book, the narrative clearly has greater implications for the modern reader than the earlier book does.  The Irish potato famine, for instance, was an event of great social significance whose impact on the modern politics in the United Kingdom and on the population demographics of the United States and Australia continues to this day.  Certainly pertinent is the lesson of the political upheavals suffered by European governments in the 18th and 19th centuries.  Those that  ignored the precariousness of the lives experienced by the bulk of their population, choosing to do little or nothing to alleviate their suffering during famines, did so at their own peril.  Those that refused to improve their management of their agricultural and natural environment also suffered more acutely.  Even now as over half of the world's population suffers from hunger, poor sanitation, little or no health care, and a growing sense of hopelessness, the governments and people of the developed world face similar challenges and choices.  Dealing with the inequities and injustices  has now grown from a national to a global scale, but ignoring them could easily have the same consequences as it did for the upper and lower classes of the nascent nations.  Similarly, the degeneration of the environment through overpopulation and mismanagement is looming large on our international horizon and can not be ignored for much longer.<br />My only complaint is that the last half of the book is riddled with dates to the point of distraction.  I realize that accuracy is much to be appreciated when it comes to historic events, but in this case &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after,&quot; &quot;earlier&quot; or &quot;later&quot; might have been  perfectly adequate.  I found that as long as I was aware of the generalcharacter of the times, its historic personalities and events, I could ignore the dates without being too misled as to time frame.  I am aware that individuals like Eric the Red and Lief Erickson were not contemporary with Louis the XVI or Napoleon but that Thomas Jefferson was, etc.  Someone less familiar with the events of history might find the dates more helpful.<br />I would definitely recommend this book for anyone interested in climatology, paleoclimatology, social change, and early modern history.  For those with an interest in earlier cultures, I'd suggest Fagin's previous book Floods, Famines and Emperorshe general character of the times, its historic personalities and events, I could ignore the dates without being too misled as to time frame.

I do enjoy short  puzzle-like problems, however, and I?ve found the GRE books are a wonderful source of entertainment.  It?s also an excellent way to review some of the material one is likely to forget over time unless used frequently.  There are word puzzles, reading comprehension stories, math problems, and logic projects.  The practice of any of these helps one with problem solving in everyday settings, so I feel I derive a particular bonus from doing the GRE books, and I?ve done them for years.  I also find that when one works on these books as a ?hobby? and ?for fun,? it diffuses some of the test anxiety that many people suffer when actually taking examinations of this type.  Furthermore, with the advent of computer testing programs, most screening examinations have been distilled down into this format, and learning how these problems are approached and how the they are designed makes the taker that much more adept even with other types of test (MCAT, LSAT, SAT, CCRN, etc).<br />The Princeton Review?s Crash Course for the GRE is a fun little book that is filled with helpful hints on preparing for the GREs and in a format that is easily portable.  (I took mine to work in the pocket of my warm up jacket.)  The fact that over half of the book is dedicated to specific methods of thought in dealing with the various sections of the GRE, coupled with the small size of the book, means that the number of practice questions are necessarily limited.  Those that are included, however, are followed by a thorough discussion of why the answers are the way they are, reinforcing the introductory material on problem solving.	2002-04-08

I had read at least one other by Wilson, and knew him for a brilliant scientist, an articulate writer and a person of strongly held beliefs.  In this book I also learned of his passionate support of the environment.  I am not that often stirred to action by a book, but this one was truly an eye opener.  Several conservationist organizations are listed, and I book-marked their web sites in order to start making donations to them. ... Many of the organizations were those to whom I'd donated to in the past, mostly because it seemed like the right thing to do.  Their importance had fallen by the wayside over the years as I dealt, like many people, with the financial exigencies of my own life.  Wilson's book pointed out that the environment is as intimately a part of my own well being as my finances.<br />The Future of Life, as I had expected, is a well written narrative of life as it has evolved on our planet and of the dangerous phase through which it is now passing.  The lovely bouquet of endangered and extinct species depicted on the jacket of the book and individually named on pages ix-x of the introductory text is a touching testimonial in itself of what has been lost and of what may yet be passing away in our own life time.  Creatures who have not even been yet catalogued by man, may already be poised on the brink of extinction.<br />The book describes the evolutionary basics of life on Earth, and its amazing spread to every corner of the globe, even to great depths of earth and ocean.  In describing our living extremophiles, those beings tolerant of the most difficult environments, the author points out their significance with respect to the beginnings of life here and to it's possible existence elsewhere in the universe, even perhaps in interstellar space.  ...A disturbance of one part of the ecology of the planet will not leave the other parts of it untouched.  This is the case whether it is a major change in oxygen saturation in the oceans, the green house gases created by the construction of the Deccan Traps in India, or an asteroid impact that sets the world ablaze. ...Despite the dismal prognostication of Malthusians even as early as Darwin's time, it has been a generally held  belief that any problem, even environmental ones, could be overcome by the combined offensive of science and technology.  Our own ingenuity will save us in the eleventh hour. For many this is still the basis of their decisions.  Wilson illustrates for the reader just why this cannot be the case, and why the task of the 21st Century will be to put the environment first.  He catalogues the many ways in which the heavy demands placed upon it to achieve mankind's goals have already led to significant depletion of resources.  Technology, in giving a minority of the world?s population a comfortable lifestyle has created a gulf between the haves and have nots of the world,  marginalizing  a significant portion of the world?s people.

In this case the age of early mammals is the subject of the discourse.  As the author himself points out, before the discovery of dinosaurs, the remains of the early megafauna of the ice ages were the great attractions in 19th Century  museums and exhibits.  These were the dream-team animals that inspired little boys to go into careers hunting fossils throughout the world.  The beautiful CGI of the book does more to bring these animals alive than any other collection of images that I've seen, and it makes one appreciate the advances that have been made in this type of characterization.<br /> While I enjoyed the wildlife presented, as with Walking with Dinosaurs, it is not always made clear to the reader that only some things can be known absolutely about these now extinct animals.  Much  must be extrapolated from what is known of modern descendants and shear guesswork.  Not everyone who reads the book will realize that, and I think that more of an effort should have been made to explain why the authorities on the subject believe what they do about the period.

Tattersall's discussion is clear and concise, and while I'm not entirely in accordance with all of his statements with regard to evolution, I feel that the work has much to say for itself.  The very word \\"evolution\\" seems to bring a knee jerk response from many people, an almost \\"them or us\\" mentality of the besieged, and their oft made point that evolution is just an unproven \\"theory\\" and not law, makes the need for public education apparent.  With recent attempts in several states to prevent educators from properly teaching these subjects or the insistence that philosophical or religious concepts be taught as equally valid explanations of natural phenomena, there is  without doubt an urgent need to deliver a clearer message of what science is and is not. As Tattersall writes in his first chapter \\"In science it is no crime to be wrong, unless you are (inappropriately) laying claim to truth.  What matters is that science as a whole is a self-correcting mechanism in which both new and old notions are constantly under scrutiny.  In other words, the edifice of scientific knowledge consists simply of a body of observations and ideas that have (so far) proven resistant to attack, and that are thus accepted as working hypotheses about nature (p. 9).\\" Nor can one delete the study of evolution from the scientific curriculum and profitably substitute religious explanations.  As the author points out, \\"The notion of evolution predicts the nested pattern of relationships we find in the living world; supernatural creation, on the other hand, predicts nothing.  It is concepts of this latter kind that are truly untestable (p. 15).\\"<br />Only when the public is better educated on the subject of science can school boards and education committees more properly design programs to meet the needs of young people.  Least the intellectual mistakenly think that science in the schools is only important to those who have decided to dedicate themselves to scientific careers, one might point out that it is the average voter who decides the fate of wetlands, nuclear waste sites, conservation of ocean resources, etc. and who needs at least a basic understanding of how life as we know it came to be and how our decisions can change that life drastically.  The average farmer needs to know what the impact of his decisions with respect to land use,  plant and animal pest control, cultivation of natural, bioengineered or hybridize plants, etc have on the environment and on his own continued prosperity.  The home owner who over fertilizes his lawn or who indiscreetly disposes of toxic substances in his garbage bin also needs to understand the problems these decisions can cause for the community in which he lives.  Any fear that such a person might feel over learning the concepts of science and of evolution might be alleviated by one of the more important statements in the book, \\"Scientific findings do not threaten anyone (except to the extent that Homo sapiens may prove incapable of controlling  what science makes possible).  But what is critical to understand is that our species (or, for that matter, God) is not in the least diminished by the idea that we emerged thanks to the processes of evolution (p. 55).\\"<br />Tattersall's book gives a nice overview of how life got to be as we know it and provides the reader with at least a small toolkit of information for thinking about the subjects of science, biological evolution, and mankind's part in the big picture.schools is only important to those who have decided to dedicate themselves to scientific careers, one might point out that it is the average voter who decides the fate of wetlands, nuclear waste sites, conservation of ocean resources, etc. and who needs at least a basic understanding of how life as we know it came to be and how our decisions can change that life drastically.

The author, Carl Zimmer, is a science journalist rather than a professional anthropologist, geologist or historian, which means that the book is eminently readable.  It is also well researched with an extensive bibliography for each chapter.  While it is clearly enough framed for the average reader without a background in the subject, it also presents enough new information to keep the serious student of the topic interested as well.<br />Although the volume was intended to accompany a PBS series on evolution, it would make an excellent source text for a high school or college survey course on the subject, as it covers the theory, the data supporting it, the newer thoughts on human evolution, the issues of ecology and conservation, and the character of science.  It even touches upon the issue of God and science.<br />As an overview, Part 1 covers the autobiographical history of Darwin and the metamorphosis of his theory and the intellectual and emotional environment into which it was introduced.  Part 2 introduces the actual theory and how the web of life has come to exist as it does.  It also discusses the impact of human activity on the natural world and what the likely outcome will be if we persist in pursuing our present behavior with respect to the environment.  Part 3 describes the coevolution of species and its impacts on relationships such as those in agriculture: natural plants, bioengineered plants, and insect and microbial pests.  It also discusses the probable origin of some of the human diseases, the use and abuse of antibiotics, and the rise of antibiotic resistant superbugs and AIDES.  Part 4 contains some of the most pertinent information in that it points out the risks of dropping the subject of evolution from the core curricula of the nation's high schools.<br />In his defense of evolution, Zimmer points out that it is not simply a theory of biology that is at stake, but the scientific method itself.  Some of my favorite quotes from Part 4 are: 1)  &quot;The scientific method does not claim that events can have only natural causes but that the only causes that we can understand scientifically are natural ones.  As powerful as the scientific method may be, it must be mute about things beyond its scope.

Under the circumstances, this book naturally suggested itself to me. While it's a pretty book, I'm not certain that much new is to be learned from Rosalie David's book Conversations with Mummies.  Certainly much of the technology dedicated to research on mummies and mummification are already well known to interested readers, having become subjects of recent public television documentaries and popular archaeology and science magazines.<br /> Written in collaboration with Rick Archbold, an &quot;editor experienced in bringing historical subjects to life,&quot; according to the dust jacket, it's dual authorship appeared to me to be just a way for the lady to say nice things about herself without appearing to be self congratulatory!  (Though whether this was her design or that of the editor himself is hard to say).  Dr. David has certainly lead a very fortunate life, managing to place herself in the right place at the right time to enjoy considerable attention and success in a very competitive field.  Archaeology and history are areas where many female PhDs, even during times when efforts at parity are being made, are still passed over in a conservative preference for males.  Still I'm not certain these biographical details are necessarily pertinent to the stated subject of the book, the study of mummies.  A more appropriate venue might be biography.  Certainly we need more biographies of successful women and more role models of success among women.<br /> Although  Mr. Archbold's narrative style tends to be somewhat patronizing, at times almost irritatingly so, he does present some fine photo journalism.  The facial reconstructions of Mummy 1770 and of Djedmaatesankh are particularly poignant.  The photos of Dr. Dunand and her assistant walking through the Western Desert each carrying a dessicated and rigid corpse is fascinating and certainly gives a sense of the reality of mummies, as do the quintessential mummies of Ramses II and his daddy Seti I, who are ubiquitous to every volume on the subject.  In short, most of the book is a rehash of TV documentaries, popular archaeology, and textbook Egyptology.rly poignant.

It seemed as though he was having difficulty identifying the audience to whom he wished to direct himself--or with a desire to appeal to everyone  There are threads of autobiographical \\"adventure\\" narrative, geological/paleontological field description, extinction theory--including the tried and true KT boundary extinction of the dinosaurs--a discussion of the quaternary extinction of the North American megafauna, a discussion of the Hawaiian Island biota and its extinction, and an appeal to world conscience to prevent what the author perceives as a current biological crisis.<br />I might see the autobiographical information as appealing to a young  male reader's sense of adventure, except that I suspect there is not nearly enough of  the suspense element or the do or die component.  There is much build up in places, but it often leads to a feeling of anticlimax.  The gentleman has definitely been a lot of interesting places, which is enviable perhaps, but I'm not sure that the majority of his readers would really relish the sometimes stultifying dullness of the environments in which the author has spent considerable time doing mind numbing work.  The apparent glamour of finding fossils often obscures the painstaking labor it takes to locate and excavate them.<br />The descriptive passages seem to suggest a disappointed novelist.  They might have been more enjoyable if they had  not been in a first person format.  For those who can \\"identify\\" with the heroes of fictional works when they're written in first person, this volume might be an excellent choice.  Personally, the only point when I found myself getting into the spirit of the thing was when the author described the Hell Creek formation in the Fort Peck Reservoir region.  Since I've done some geological/paleontological field work there myself, it brought back old memories--not all of them pleasant.  (Camping in the sticky \\"gumbo\\" of the badlands in a rainy May, screening alligator scoots, triceratops frills, fish scales and duckbill bones while standing [waist]-deep in icy cold lake water leaves much to be desired by way of experiences;  I`ve certainly had better.)<br />The description of the various outcrops illustrating extinction events was interesting.  Many of them, including the Hell Creek, are in inaccessible areas.  The author's chapters on the  Karoo were especially good.  I had heard of it before but had not read as thorough a description in other works as Ward provided in Rivers in Time. His discussion of the Georgian outcrops of the Tertiary recovery were entirely  new to me.<br />In general his discussion of extinction was more balanced than many writers.  Although he gives a large word-count to the KT extinction, he also covers the Permian event and the Quaternary die-out with some degree of  thoroughness.  He might have given the opposing views more of a forum, however, as he makes the situations seem pretty much cut and dried which they aren't.<br />Throughout the volume the reader can't help but feel there is a hidden agenda, and the final chapters produce it with Ward's appeal to public conscience over modern biota loss throughout the world.  If this was his ultimate goal, I think it would have been more helpful to have had it more clear cut from the beginning.  It would have tied the various chapters together a little better.  I feel he did a much better job of pulling various material together, providing alternate views of events, and making an ecological statement in his earlier book Rare Earth, written with coauthor Donald Brownlee.  If I was making a decision about which book to put into my personal collection, I would chose that work over the present.of the badlands in a rainy May, screening alligator scoots, triceratops frills, fish scales and duckbill bones while standing [waist]-deep in icy cold lake water leaves much to be desired by way of experiences;  I`ve certainly had better.)<br />The description of the various outcrops illustrating extinction events was interesting.

The author's intent is to show that the human being is not the only animal that demonstrates mental and communicative abilities.  He avoids the contention which surrounds scientific debates on the issues by simply recounting stories from his own experiences and from those of zoo keepers and naturalists, people whose only interest is in the animals they care for and not in scientific laurels or criticism.  The only caveat, as he himself points out, is that because \\"it's unscientific...no matter how persuasive the material, one cannot use the stories and examples as proof of anything (p. xvii).\\"  For those of us who are already convinced that animals are far brighter than most people give them credit for, this is not an important issue anyway.<br />The book is divided into sections, including: games and humor; trade and barter; deception, mind reading and mental chess; cooperation in work, conflict and healing; tools and intelligence; escapes from captivity; empathy and heroism; and untouched nature.  Some of the material is repeated under different chapters, but when it is, it's presented from a new perspective which enlarges understanding of animal behavior.  My favorite stories are some of the orangutan escape episodes, and some of the tales of trust and friendship.<br />The book certainly gives the reader a sense of what is being lost as our natural world is being destroyed by overpopulation, encroachment and exploitation.  Since destruction of habitat seems to have taken on a life of its own these days, one almost wonders if it is unstoppable irrespective of our best  intentions or of the ultimate negative impact it will have on our own future.  This was particularly apparent in the last chapter of the book which deals with the Ndoki rain forest of the Congo.  As was pointed out in Matt Ridley's book, The Red Queen, the incremental increase in benefit to the individual who causes the destruction of the environment increases the likelihood that the destruction will occur despite the overall long term loss to society.  And this is often so, even though the individual beneficiary of the immediate good will also suffer with the rest of society.  The loss of viable commonly held fields to over grazing during the Middle Ages was the example cited by Ridley (p. 91), but any other major loss of shared wealth could be substituted as well.  As Linden points out, perhaps the very intellect of which we are so proud will be our ultimate undoing!  We certainly don't seem to have learned from the lessons of our history!<br />Altogether a delightfully readable book.the destruction of the environment increases the likelihood that the destruction will occur despite the overall long term loss to society.

The Founding Brothers by Pulitzer Prize winner Joseph Ellis was the book chosen as the central text for a brief course offered on the American Revolution.  It is a well written book, the central theme of which is that at the nation's founding, politics was of necessity a very much face to face, up front and personal kind of thing.  Although I'm not certain I agree with that, I do agree with the author's take on the central characters, namely that while they realized that they were making history, they weren't always aware of the degree to which history was making them.  Certainly it becomes apparent through the biographies of the seven men, that nothing was definite or clear cut except that nothing was definite and clear cut.  Events once started created a stage upon which certain individuals were allowed to play key parts, and their personal choices, good or bad, shaped the course of history. The strengths and weaknesses of such individuals were thus deciding factors in that course.<br />This, however, is a case of 20-20 hind sight on our part.  We can see that it was the case, but the letters, diaries, newspapers and political documents of the time make it abundantly apparent that the individual players were not always aware of it.  More than anything,  Professor Ellis' book makes their lack of certainty more obvious.  He also suggests that though the seven were real people with more than the cardboard cut out persona they have become for most of us, the more central characters of the American Revolution ultimately became the personification of central, recurring themes in the country's history: federal control vs states rights, urban industrial vs rural agrarian interests, isolationism vs world involvement, etc.  It would almost appear that it was always destined to be so, since it is the nature of human beings to mythologize important events by using central figures as a short hand of sorts.  Ellis' description of Adams suggests that he at least was aware of this and fought tooth and nail for reasons of his own to prevent it, to preserve the truth and reality of the events of his time.<br />What the book did most for me was to clarify some of the issues. Why didn't the Founding Brothers eliminate slavery at the beginning?  Was it their intention to leave it to posterity to decide?  Were they unaware of the likelihood of blood shed over it?  Why was American policy as wishy-washy as it was regarding international events like the impressment of American seamen by the British navy or the pirating of American merchant ships by the French?  How did the early Patriarchs get along as people?  Were their characters as sterling as they are always made out to be? Etc.  Many of the questions were at least partially answered.  So was the most paramount of my questions.  Should I read more about the period?  Definitely.  Some suggestions?

Although I have a strong interest in physics and cosmology, I am by no means what I would call &quot;good&quot; at it.  With only a rudimentary understanding of things like quantum mechanics, relativity physics and string theory, I still found the text readable.  I felt that it was clearly enough written for the lay person that I was able to recommend it to a friend with little physics background who had enquired about the subject.  This was especially the case as the text covers almost every aspect of cosmology, even in its final two chapters the question of God and the universe.  <br />Covered also are the concepts of the speed of light and &quot;seeing&quot; the past of the universe, the expansion of the universe and the question of its fate, the first few moments of the universe and the creation of matter, the possibility of other universes, the possibility of other dimensions beyond the four we experience, the evolution of the large scale structures of the universe, the anthropic cosmological principle, and for those with a special interest in the topic of religion and philosophy vis a vie physics and cosmology, a discussion of God and the universe.  Although there are several books which give a more in depth account of each of these topics, this one is an excellent compendium, which is probably why it was chosen as the text for the class. <br />The bibliographic notes to the text are all a little old, being mostly primary sources.  This is good from the historical perspective, as it makes the reader aware of the underlying research in support of the author's text, who did it, what it was, and when it was done.  However, it doesn't give the reader many of the more current titles with which to follow up his/her own interests. <br />All in all a good starting point.	2002-02-26
1647670:US	50669529	R2AKJ75ERZJTOE	0312270267	392150924	Leonardo: The First Scientist	Books	3	8	10	N	N	Leonardo	Leonardo the First Scientist by Michael White, while engagingly written, walks a dangerously fine line between biography and historical fiction.  Biography is essentially the history of an individual based on historical fact, while historical fiction is fiction based on historical fact.  For my money, White's biography of Leonardo da Vinci tips a little too far into the latter realm, particularly in the first half of the book where he tries to capture for his reader the inner workings of his subject.  His flights of imagination and speculation are just a little too fanciful and frequent when trying to get at Leonardo the man.  That's  perhaps because there is too little remaining of the man except his art and his inventions with which to  make a detailed personal profile.<br />White introduces his work by suggesting that he will discuss Leonardo as a scientist.  Indeed he starts out to do so by devoting an early chapter of his book (Leonardo's Intellectual Inheritance) to the Greco-Roman roots of Renaissance science.  This chapter reads like many introductions to the subject of science in the Classical world, and while it places Leonardo in the setting of common Renaissance learning, it does little to show his actual relationship to it.  Despite his statement in the introduction that he is interested in creating something new by focusing on Leonard the scientist, the author strays into all manner of suppositions with regard to the great man's possible inner turmoil:  his illegitimacy, his lack of formal education, his relationship to his parents, and to the great men of his age (particularly Lorenzo de Medici of Florence), his possible fear of water, his homosexuality, etc, for much of which he admits he has little if any evidence.  Most of these psychological wanderings are prefaced with \\"might,\\" \\"possibly,\\" \\"could have,\\" \\"might have,\\" etc.  While the latent historian within me may lift an eyebrow over it, I can let it pass, so long as the author makes the reader aware that there is very little actual data and of what that data is.  However, when later in the book he  refers to some of his past \\"might haves\\" as confirmed issues upon which he can make further suppositions, a bell goes off in my head, as it should in every reader's.<br />One might provide some leeway for such tenuous suppositions based on little data, were it not that Mr. White's credulity as a researcher is a little overworked at times.  He seems to buy into sensationalism almost whole sale, with no references given to support his \\"facts.\\"  At one point he describes Lucretia Borgia and her family in very unflattering terms (P. 77) (not a totally unjustifiable stance on the whole)  without bibliographic entries of any kind.  The stories he relates are probably taken from accounts of the Borgias circulated at the time by political detractors with their own agendas, and not on the more extensive primary data on the family and their times or on competent secondary sources that provide a more realistic portrait of the family (as in Lucretia Borgia by Ferdinand Gregorovius, which while old is excellent especially for the citation of its source material on the topic).  One has to admit the twice told tales of political enemies makes for more interesting reading, but that's not history; that's good story telling.<br />White probably spends more time laboring over Leonardo's sexual identity and his childhood than Leonardo did.  Certainly more than one would expect for a work on the man as scientist. He labors in detail over the possible relationship the artist might have had with his mother during his formative years while he lived with his grandfather Antonio and while his mother lived in a near by town, and puts forth all manner of suggestions as to identities of Leonardo's possible lovers, even citing specific expenditures for clothing and other items made for Leonardo's companion Salai.<br />White's book is not a total bust.  His insights into the scientist's career as engineer and anatomist are quite good, though all too brief (they occupy only about 4 chapters of the book).  One could have hoped for more insights into the science and more illustrations from the notebooks to embellish the work.  Their lack at crucial points, especially when describing some of the existing  paintings or the designs for inventions, is frustrating.  One hangs on White's verbal description, turning the page in expectation of seeing the described item, and....nothing!  The best entries are the sketches of the crossbows and catapults on p. 89, the tanks on p. 163, the muscles of the arm and shoulder on 280, and  the oft illustrated Vitruvian Man on p. 165.  Of particular interest is the section on the science of art, particularly the material on vision.  The Renaissance was premier in the understanding and use of visual perspective in the art work of the time, both painting and architecture, and this single chapter is a good start for anyone interested in the topic.<br /><br />Overall I came away with a sense of Leonardo, the artist who rarely finished anything he started, and Leonardo the scientist who spread himself too thin.  If you just want to know a little bit about Leonardo, this might be adequate-if you're critical when you read it.  If you're a Leonardo enthusiast I suggest the works on his art and life by Kenneth Clark or Martin Kemp or some of the modern publications of translations of his writings.

I would find the fact far less irritating if those who have charge of the process would stop tinkering with it long enough for me to use it with the &quot;efficiency&quot; that was originally intended, but such is never the case.  To help me get a feeling for what the IMS people are doing so that I can better understand the entire process, I decided to take a mini-course on beginning programming.  Wallace Wang's Beginning Programming for Dummies was the suggested course text, and although I started out convinced that I could never understand even a fraction of the information, I was pleasantly surprised.  As advertised the fundamentals of programming presented in the text were understandable and doable.  I was completely surprised to discover that my home computer already had a QBASIC program available on it and that I could use it to make simple programs.  By following the book step by step, I was able to accomplish the tasks as designed and was amazed at the types of things the programs I wrote could do.  I'm not sure that I have anything earth shaking to design for computers or that I'll be so taken with programming that I will give up surgical ICU to take it up, but I feel far more aware of computers and their inner workings now than I ever was and maybe a little more patient with them.

I'm one of those people who considers &quot;modern history&quot; to be everything after 1200 BC (No, that's not a mistake, I did say BC!)  However I recently took a class on Civil War history---mostly because it was the only history course in the context offered that I hadn't already taken---and  Battle Cry of Freedom by James M. McPherson was the primary course text.  All I can say is &quot;I'm converted!&quot;  The book well deserves the Pulitzer prize it received.  It reads like a novel, pulling one from chapter to chapter through all of  its 862 pages with a &quot;can hardly put it down&quot; forcefulness.  Even though I know the outcome, as who doesn't, the events described create an ambiance of &quot;being there&quot; that leaves the heart thumping.<br /><br />The author  underscores the critical importance of the inability of the US founding fathers to deal head on with the incongruity of slavery in the midst of the world's first democracy.  When framing the Constitution in the 18th Century, they chose to skirt the issue of slavery publically, while privately hoping that it would go away by deferring the problem to a later generation.  Having undergone a war of revolution with the sacrifices that it entailed, these men  were loath to force their new constituency to make further sacrifices.  They also left the Constitutional document itself vague enough to produce a variety of  interpretations; both the Constitution's greatest strength and its greatest weakness.  This flexibility left  the issue of the preeminence of states' rights versus federal sovereignly open for debate.  And debates there were, to the point of violence in the halls of Congress!<br />The author discuses the early 19th Century social, demographic, and political background of the war, setting the stage for the drama that follows.  His narrative describes a vigorous young country expanding in all directions, many times with that characteristic lack of concern over the rights and well being of others of many adolescents.  Like a skilled novelist, McPherson  introduces the central characters of the Civil War conflict as they arose on the scene during the Mexican-American War.  This venue was a good choice.  Nearly all of the Civil War generals of  significance had also participated in this event.  Furthermore  the Mexican-American war  itself and the territory it gained the young country were key to setting the stage for the lengthy struggle that was to follow.  Both  the issues of slavery and that of States' Rights were forced into the public eye by the possible addition of new states to the union as slave or free.  The outcome of this process had the potential of  imbalancing the US legislature in favor of one political entity or the other.  Almost every event of political importance in the US, both foreign and domestic, occurring between  the years after the Mexican War and before the Civil War arose as a result of this political reality.<br /> Although the author devotes a goodly amount of his narrative to the discussion of the chief Civil War personalities, he does not neglect the common soldier.  He discusses the character, motivation, and responses of the recruit and quotes from personal letters of the common man as well as from the correspondence of the more noted players in the conflict.  Battle sites and the movements of personnel on them are described but not belabored.  The development of Lincoln's stand on the slavery issue is also discussed in some detail, not in a block as a topic but within the body of the narrative against the backdrop of events within which it occurred.<br /> The bibliography is extensive and written in narrative form, giving titles according to topic with some comments on them by group.  As the author states, the subject of the Civil War is a popular one, with some 50,000 books and pamphlets available on the war years, and &quot;more works in English on Abraham Lincoln than on any other persons except Jesus of Nazareth and William Shakespeare (p. 865).&quot;  For those, like myself, who have only just developed an interest in the subject, this will be a gold mine of sources for further reading.<br />Although the book is a little lengthy and complex, it  might well make a good focus for a senior high class in American and world history.  One might look at the development of US world politics and the part that the Civil War played in that development; how these years effected subsequent and more recent relations between the US and various countries, most particularly Cuba and Nicaragua.  There were a number of changes in technology that presaged the modern world during this time and one might investigate the way in which these developments brought about our own way of life.  One might also discuss whether slavery might have died out in the United States, without the major loss of human life, as it had in other countries, and the subject of racial equality and its path from Emancipation Proclamation to the Civil Rights movements of the 1960s.<br />In all, a suburb book.rs, and &quot;more works in English on Abraham Lincoln than on any other persons except Jesus of Nazareth and William Shakespeare (p. 865).&quot;  For those, like myself, who have only just developed an interest in the subject, this will be a gold mine of sources for further reading.  <br />Although the book is a little lengthy and complex, it  might well make a good focus for a senior high class in American and world history.

This work, first printed in 1971,  is still in print and still widely read, and it very much deserves to be.  Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee is probably one of the most eloquent, intense and moving works of exposition I've ever read.<br />For the most part the author, Dee Brown, lets the records and the personal reports of the various participants in the events of the American Indian wars of the 19th Century speak for themselves.  He creates thereby a narrative that is more riveting than any modern adventure novel and more poignant than even the finest of the Greek tragedies.  The work is very well researched, with an excellent bibliography of the author's sources.  It is also well illustrated, with photos or paintings of the various leaders of the native American tribes of the time.  It is a veritable who's who of the native west.  There are short biographies of many of the more important individuals.  Names like Black Kettle of the Cheyennes, Little Crow of the Santee Sioux,  Red Cloud and Crazy Horse of the Oglala Sioux, Chief Joseph of the Nez Perces  (&quot;I will fight no more forever,&quot;) Sitting Bull of the Hunkpapa Sioux, and Cochise and Geronimo of the Chiricahua Apaches are among those most likely to be recognized by non-native Americans.<br />What I found most interesting was the extent to which the various tribes were able to hold out against the odds, even resoundingly defeating the US military that hounded them nearly to extinction.  It is evident from even a quick reading that it was less military superiority than the policy of starving out the people by destruction of land, animals, and other property that brought about defeat of the tribes.  The US military of the time  made a war on women, children and the elderly, slaughtering even infants in surprise raids made in undeclared wars or in provoked confrontations.  Starvation, freezing weather, and disease brought these proud people to their knees, not military might.<br />In these times of international conflict the tragic treatment of the native American population should be a cautionary tale of what can happen when the self righteous, the culturally narrow, the ambitious, and the greedy use the military to achieve their own agenda.  The types of people responsible for the near eradication of a race of people in the 19th Century are still common enough today.  In my opinion this book should be required reading for any American history course from junior high school level and beyond it.  Only by raising the consciousness of the average citizen from youth onward can the specter of racism on this scale be avoided./>In these times of international conflict the tragic treatment of the native American population should be a cautionary tale of what can happen when the self righteous, the culturally narrow, the ambitious, and the greedy use the military to achieve their own agenda.

It's<br />something that most of us don't often contemplate.  Some of us may know that zero, at least as a place holder,<br />was invented/discovered by the Mayans, but beyond that most of us haven't a clue.  At least I hadn't.<br />  Charles Seife begins his discourse with the earliest history of numbers.  Counted things first appear in the<br />archaeological record as marks on bones in the the stone age.  Early civilizations had little use for a concept<br />of zero; one rarely counts no apples or no sheep, etc.  Ancient Egyptian mathematics seems to have been limited to measuring land areas and calendaric time for which zero in their method was unnecessary.  In fact, it is the early calendar's persistent lack of zero in day and year counting that led to the confusion over when the 21st century started.  The Babylonians likewise used<br />math for celestial observation and calendars, but they also introduced zero as a place holder which simplified the writing of numbers and doing simple arithmetic.<br />  It is among the Greek philosophers that Seife sees an outright distaste for the concept of zero as nothing, a void.  It conflicted with their particular notions of the universe and how it operated.  Their aversion to it seems to have<br />carried over into the Mediaeval European period by way of the offended established principles of the church.<br />  Seife follows the history of zero to modern times and discusses some of the ways that zero and infinity are<br />the same and some of the ways that they oppose one another.  He brings both quantum mechanics and relativity theory into the discussion, revealing some of the ways that looking at zero and infinity have led to advances in physics in more recent times.<br />  The author is a science writer with an MS in mathematics.  As a journalist his style is both enjoyable and readable, making a complex subject more accessible to the average individual--that is, he doesn't bog one down with a lot of complicated equations.  I'm no math wiz by any means, but I understood his thesis in its<br />entirety. Those who've studied math in greater depth may find the book a little patronizing or at least a little too heavy on the verbal form and a little too light on the math.ct more accessible to the average individual--that is, he doesn't bog one down with a lot of complicated equations.

Bring Warm Clothes : Letters and Photos from Minnesota's Past was written by a former columnist for the Minnesota Star and Tribune,  Peg Meier.  It is a great treat, both as a peek into the past and as a well &quot;written&quot; work of history.  The author includes pictures, diary entries, newspaper articles, letters, and government documents to create her biography of the state.<br />The book is heavily illustrated.  Among the visual works are  paintings of Minnesota from its exploration years, mostly by Seth Eastman and Karl Bodmer, which capture the rustic and wild character of a land yet untrammeled by the fences, industrial complexes and housing developments with which most of us are familiar.  For those who like to see photographic reality, there are photos of Minnesota's early pre- and post-statehood years during the 19th Century and of  the 20th Century up to World War II.  The former include pictures of the Civil War in which the volunteers of the First Minnesota Regiment participated.  In all some 25,000 men from the state fought in battles like Bull Run, Antietam, and Gettysburg, losing some 2,500 men, almost one out of every ten.  Other photos show the old homes, city and town streets, early industry, sod homes, and family and other groups that bring to life a time past.<br />Particularly enjoyable were the letters from the early settlement of Saint Paul and Minneapolis as presented in the merry correspondence of the Fuller family, and the witty press releases of Jane Grey Swisshelm in her paper the St Cloud Visiter, later the St. Cloud Democrat.  The letters of Harriet Griswold reveal the fact that boom and bust economy is not new to our era, when her correspondence goes from exuberence and big plans in October of 1856 to bearly hanging on in September of 1858.  The Civil War diaries of Sam Bloomer and Isaac Taylor and the World War I letters of Philip Longyear, an ambulance driver at the French front, bring those conflicts to a more vivid reality.  The plight of the Native Americans and the fear and reactionism that the Indian Wars generated is also covered.<br />The author has, wisely in my opinion, allowed the primary sources speak for themselves.  She adds very little interpretive material of her own and then only to clarify where necessary or to provide follow up information.<br />One of the principle points of note is the fact that most of these people had many of the same problems we have, and that they bring some of the same perspectives, same blind spots, and same sense of humor that we bring to our own daily lives.  They lived one day at a time, facing an unknown future with the same uncertainty that we do.  Some stories came out with a happy ending, some did not.  It makes one wonder what some future writer of Minnesota history will say and think of our own times..

It is an interesting and quick read for the most part.  I have read other books on self organized criticality that were far less understandable and more limited in their scope of applicability.<br />Although there were portions of Bak's work that were a little belabored-I found my interest in sand piles began to sag after the initial discussion, for instance-much of the rest of the book was enlightening.  The discussion in Chapter 1 of the contrast between the clarity and simplicity of the laws of physics and the complexity and unpredictability of nature was particularly interesting as was the discussion of the difference between chaos and complexity.  His explanation in Chapter 2 of the theory of self organized criticality and the history of its development is far clearer than I found Stuart Kauffman's to be.  It might make a better starting place for anyone wishing to understand the theory a little better before going on to Kauffman's and other books on the subject.<br />Essentially the theme of the book involves the self organization of  much of the universe,  from stars and volcanoes to traffic jams and economics, into critical states sustained as stable systems until they evolve through cascade events or what Bak calls avalanches (after his sand pile paradigm)  or catastrophes.  Bak explains that the system maintains itself along a critical  line, above which chaos rules and nothing can be predicted and below which nothing happens so there is nothing to predict!<br />Chapter 5 which deals with earthquakes and volcanic eruptions interested me in particular because of my own study of geology.  Here Bak suggests  that geophysicists' attempts at  prediction of events is a lost cause.  He believes it to be based upon the mistaken human habit of looking at random events for patterns and periodicity where none exists.  While the history of a given event can be studied in some detail after the fact, the information derived is useless in predicting the future.  In Bak's opinion, the variables involved are so legion and are interrelated in so convoluted a way as to be impossible to monitor before the fact.<br />In chapters 7,  8, and 9 the author attempts to model Darwin's gradual evolution, Gould's punctuated equilibrium, and the Santa Fe Institute's fitness landscape to see which fits the facts better.  In general Darwin's theories are vindicated---no real surprise there---while punctuated equilibrium is also found to have it's place in a complete theory of evolution.  Chapter 11 contained a section on the unavoidability of catastrophes and fluctuations---and by their extension, one supposes, biological evolution-which casts light on the boom and bust character of economics among other things.  This chapter extends the use of the theory of SOC to human activities as well as to human evolution.<br />The author's style is very chatty, which makes it readable and personable.  By filling in the human details of the discoverers, he makes the book more personal.  In all, though I found myself occasionally  losing the thread of the author's theme, I nevertheless found the content of each chapter well worth.re none exists.

They have been light hearted and eventful and have dealt with coming of age issues in a way that captures the interest of an adult without losing the interest of a child.  I can't imagine a better set of bedtime reading books to share with children even as old as 10 or 12 years.<br />Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the fourth in the series, is another good one, but I found it difficult to get into after the first chapter.  The characters are again some of them charming, some of them intriguing, and the setting just as wondrous as in the other books, but here the narrative seemed to wander.  After a wonderful and arresting opening, the book seemed to stall out.  The gap between the almost Agatha Christie opening and the by now almost banal Qwiddich match left one wondering what the point of the whole thing was.  Rowling's stories heretofore have been fast moving, with few digressions and a tapestry of characters whose roles have been fairly clear cut even when they have been designed to throw the reader off the track.  (One is used to the latter device when one has read enough murder mysteries.)  Here it takes almost 500 pages before their purpose in the story becomes clear.  In fact it took the device of the Pensieve to bring the plot again into focus for me.<br />While it took me minutes to read the first chapter, and I was riveted again from chapter 29 to the end, the 28 chapters in between took me almost two months to get through.  In fact I only persisted because I was certain that the end would make them somehow more pertinent, and it did.  Unlike Rawling's previous three books, the chapters in this one seemed to lack the connecting suspense that kept me moving from one to the next in order to find out &quot;what happened next.&quot;  I could easily set the book aside at the end of a chapter and not get back to it for days, where previous books had been finished in a single day.<br />I still think these are charming books with much to say to everyone.  I can't imagine not having a complete collection especially for a family with young children, but  I think that this book is definitely the one for which I'd wait for the paperback edition or a lower price before adding it.r />I still think these are charming books with much to say to everyone.

This usually happens when one of my coworkers with kids is confronted with a math problem that stumps them, and they refer to me for &quot;guidance!&quot;  Since I was recently in such a situation, I decided to browse Amazons selection of review material for algebra and found Longstreets CD &quot;Algebra: A Visual Approach&quot; and decided to try it.<br /> I liked the motion graphics approach to teaching.  It tended to focus attention on method better than a text would.  It also gave the student the opportunity to make an attempt to solve the problem and use the programs solution to check their own work, much like programmed learning texts do.  The approach also left the &quot;page&quot; less cluttered with extraneous material that can sometimes be distracting rather than helpful.<br />On the down side, and a serious defect in my opinion, the material covered was too brief, and there were too few problems for the student to solve independently.  In fact, the problems for the student to solve are the demonstration problems just solved by the program instructor, which tended to make it too repetitious and lacking in challenge.  There was also no &quot;test&quot; of the overall course content to gage the students understanding of and ability to apply the material.<br />The subject matter is a little too simple for a review of the subject by someone who has already studied algebra to a higher level.  It might help new students to understand it a little better, especially those who require more active participation in their learning and who are captivated by computers to begin with.  On the whole though, for the price I suspect there are better programs out there.  If there arent, there should be.	2001-11-30

When I studied ancient near eastern history years ago, one of the more frustrating regions to gain insight into was the Levant.  The area was rife with petty and ephemeral kingdoms contending for supremacy among their peers and for survival in the face of the imperialistic enterprises of the mightier rulers on their world scene.  Rarely were these more than infrequently mentioned names.  The notable exception was, not surprisingly, ancient Israel whose history, mythology, and culture are still known to most of us through the mechanism of the written work popularly known as The Old Testament.  Though it contains information about many of the players in the political drama played out in the region over several thousand years, it is not an easy document to use.  Dr. Mendenhall in his book Ancient Israel's Faith and History has done a superlative job of presenting the material in a very clear, organized, and informative manner.<br />One of the problems with studying the Bible as a historical document lies in the fact that it has such a diverse history of its own. The authors of various portions of it had their own motives, information sources, and world view, the redactors their own set, modern day interpreters theirs, etc.  As Dr. Mendenhall writes in his preface, &quot;Through the ages, whether through ignorance or malice, the Bible has frequently been misinterpreted, misunderstood, and misused (p. xvii),&quot; and he notes that the &quot;scribes were less interested in understanding their own history than they were in exploiting it (p. xviii).&quot;<br />Nor are the motives of ancient scribes the only source of difficulties.  Modern day scholarship has also lent it`s particular spin to Biblical interpretations.  Again in Mendenhall`s words, &quot;Modern biblical scholars--who should be in the best position to help our understanding--are themselves frequently hamstrung by the enormously broad range of requisite knowledge (including ancient history and languages) and by the inability or unwillingness to separate their scholarship from the presumptions and orthodoxies of their peer groups (xvii).&quot;<br />Dr. Mendenhall does not seem to suffer from any such problem.  According to the forward by Gary Herion, the gentleman has an extensive knowledge of ancient languages, a first hand knowledge of modern day local cultures in the Middle East, and a knowledge of the archaeology of the area.  In reading the book, I would also add to this list, that I found very little to indicate a religious bias of his own to defend.  He approaches the subject with the objectivity and organization of one who is fond of puzzels and their solution.<br />In writing his book, which bears clear signs of its origin in lecture notes, Dr. Mendenhall has methodically begun at the beginning.  The introduction to Ancient Israel's Faith and History begins, not with the biblical narrative, but with a description of religion itself.  He asks and answers five questions:  What is one`s religion, what are religious communities, what does religion actually do, how are religious values transmitted, and how does a religious system change over time?  He also enumerates and describes five key &quot;observations&quot; or &quot;laws&quot; about religion:  The law of transference, the law of  functional shift, the law of elaboration, the law of contrast, and the law of finality.  And finally he sets out how religions develop:  The prologue to the religion, the formative period, the adaptive period, the traditional period, and the reform period.  Armed with this instructive information, the reader is able to follow the author's progress through the various books--and by them the history--of ancient Israel and its religion.<br />Of most interest to me was the formative period of Israel's post exilic years of which he provides a very cogent discussion.  Anyone who has studied the Bible as history knows of the Habiru, of the Hyksos, of the Merneptah stele, and so on, but Dr. Mendenhall brings these early years into far greater perspective.  Certainly his discussion of the Ten Commandments as ten commitments makes the history of the Exodus and its later effect on Israel's development and ultimate collapse as an ancient state clearer.<br />Of some significance is the pertinence of the work to modern day events in the Middle East.  In his discussion of the meaning of some of the commandments in the historical context of their development, Mendenhall makes some very important points, especially with respect to values.  When one realizes that what one values most and fears the loss of most is what is &quot;worshipped&quot; in one's culture, one can see why those with a stricter sense of &quot;godliness&quot; and commitment, like the members of the Taliban community or of Bin Ladin's followers, would find the western world's habit of valuing possessions to be godless behavior, and to some extent it is.<br />Of importance too, at least to me, is the gentleman's inclusion of a short bibliography at the end of each chapter which provides the reader with sources of further information.  Although Dr. Mendenhall is himself now retired, the bibliographical entries vary widely in date.  Included are works like Gurney's The Hittites, Samuel Noah Kramer's The Sumerians, and John Wilson's The Culture of Ancient Egypt, all dating to the 1960s.  Later works like  Sheler's Is the Bible True? (1999) and  Frerichs and Lesko's Exodus: the Egyptian Evidence (1997), suggest that he has kept his overall knowledge base current.  Journal articles, however, seem to be 1980 and earlier, which suggest that he may be falling behind in the venue of  the professional literature.<br />Overall I found this a very readable, informative and interesting book.  I would recommend it highly to anyone with an interest in the history of the ancient world, in Biblical history, or in the history of the bible itself.  It would make a nice gift for a religious person who enjoys studying the bible and who is able to do so with an open mind.  For those who are inclined to view the Bible and religion from a more rigid perspective, I suspect it would offend their sense of Divine Word.but Dr. Mendenhall brings these early years into far greater perspective.

Jean Baker's biography of Mary Todd Lincoln is a well written work on an individual whose life was at once extraordinarily blessed and tragically cursed.  Born in<br />Lexington to an upper middle class family with a long history in Kentucky, Mary was given both the traditional lifestyle of the young southern belle and the unusual<br />opportunity of an education.  During a time when most women of her social class were almost invisible to the public world, Mary was better educated, more<br />outgoing, more inclined to express a personal opinion, and more ambitious than others of her set.  To some extent these are the reasons she reached the White<br />House.  They are also responsible for some of her social problems after leaving Washington.  In fact, except for the early loss of her husband and children--a<br />common tragedy for many women of the time--most of Mary Lincoln's troubles were the outcome of her attitudes toward others and her extraordinary self<br />absorption.  Even the loss of close family members merely presented an opportunity for her to assume the role of heroine in her own tragic drama, and she carried<br />her mourning to extremes rather than give up center stage.  Focus became not the sad death of young men at the very beginning of their lives or of a national loss<br />of a great leader, but Mary Todd Lincoln's grief.  When others refused to make her the center of their attention indefinitely, she apparently felt they were<br />unreasonable, and her outbursts alienated many who might have helped her far more and more readily than they ultimately did.  To say that she was a woman with<br />great psychological and situation problems is an understatement.<br />Professor Baker tends to put a feminist spin on the events of Mary Lincoln's life, seeing her as a victim of the misogynistic, paternalistic environment of her times<br />and, as a woman ahead of her time, a prime target for male backlash.  To some extent this may be--probably is--true, but not entirely.  Certainly there were as<br />many, if not probably more, women who disliked her, some of them formerly close friends.  In defense of the men and women of the mid nineteenth century, the<br />behavioral expectations of the day simply were what they were and putting their social mores on trial at this late date is not only unjust, it's pointless.  Even in our<br />own society, which tolerates a far greater variance in behavior and where rapid communication allows us to share what's new more globally,  there are still<br />behaviors that raise eyebrows.  Like the society of Mary's day, we don't like to have our sense of what's &quot;right&quot; offended.  To see this more personally, one has<br />merely to cross cultural lines, from say western to middle easter for instance, to feel the high dudgeon that the people of Mary's environment may have felt over her<br />breeches of expected behavior.<br />One of the figures in the story, most often vilified as the Bad Son, is Robert Lincoln.  I had heard before the story of his consigning his mother to a sanitarium.  The<br />book, while it makes of him just as much a villain, also provides enough details so the more critical reader might decern a less sinister view of these events.  In his<br />defense I don't think that Robert Lincoln was quite the conniving, greedy man he is depicted--although I have to admit I've not read a biography of the man.  He<br />certainly was able to provide a clear accounting of his management of his mother's funds.  I  suspect that he was merely  a product of his age.  That he was a very<br />rigid, conservative individual--as lawyers tend to be in any age--with political ambitions of his own can hardly be held against him.  He certainly doesn't seem to<br />have used his mother's income to further his own agenda.  From the author's own description of her, Mary Lincoln was self centered, outspoken, and eccentric.<br />She was also inclined to see others in black and white rather than in shades of gray, either for or against her, a friend to be clutched to her bosom or an enemy to<br />be driven away with every means available to her.  Furthermore her shopping, which became the focus of her insanity trial, apparently was abnormal for the age.  In<br />fact, even in our own time, excessive spending can be seen as a type of addictive or compulsive behavior and can and occasionally does lead to the bankruptcy<br />that Robert Lincoln feared would be his mother's fate if left to her own devises.  Her 64 trunks--and the old Saratogas were not exactly carry-ons--of<br />possessions, weighing some 4 tons, would suggest that maybe her behavior really was a little out of hand.  In his defense is the fact that he was surrounded by a<br />society that saw his mother's behavior as embarrassing if not outright insane and by advisors who agreed with his point of view and urged him to pursue the<br />course he did.  That he should suborn perjury in an effort to bring his mother's behavior more in line with public expectations and her spending under better control<br />is tragic perhaps, but not necessarily evil.  It might be pointed out that in growing up in the LIncoln household, there appeared to be only two methods of dealing<br />with mother, either rebel and fight for your own identity, as Robert Lincoln seems to have done, or allow oneself to be totally absorbed by her personality, as the<br />other sons seem to have done.  Robert was never going to be his mother's favorite son.  It might be pointed out, that he is also the only one to have survived her.<br />For those who are more inclined to understand the period itself, one of the more interesting aspects of Professor Baker's work is the clearer picture of the man<br />Lincoln that arises when he becomes a collateral, almost an incidental, character in the story.  The events that lead to his death and ultimate cultural &quot;deification&quot;<br />are more evident, and his personality becomes more human.  Factors in his personal life which may have effected his presidency are certainly much clearer.<br />Although I don't necessarily agree with some of Professor Baker's assessments, I think the book was very well written.  It certainly kept my attention from beginning<br />to end.  It is also very thoroughly researched.

1810851:US	50669529	RXZZBLD14MRNX	040508580X	148035965	Lucretia Borgia	Books	5	42	43	N	Y	A gem despite its age	Years ago I saw a series on Cesare Borgia that intrigued me greatly.  The pomp and pageantry, the dissolute state of the papacy, the treachery and violence<br />of the time and the political intrigues arising from diverse interests attempting to unite various parts of the post classical world into some semblance of a nation<br />made for exciting entertainment.  Among all of the players the only one whose name was well known to me, as probably to others, was that of Lucretia Borgia,<br />the famous &quot;poisoner.&quot;  A more recent television program, however, provided me with more information on this lady, and I discovered to my surprise that what<br />little I thought I knew about her was actually more myth than reality.  It is often said that it is to the victors the privilege of writing history is given, and it was<br />obviously to the enemies of the Borgias that the privilege of writing Italian Renaissance history was given.  Lucretia did not come out of it unscathed.  Since<br />seeing this last production, I have looked for books about the Borgias, particularly Lucretia, but had not found one until Ferdinand Gregorovius' volume.  The<br />book is old--the dedication was dictated March 9, 1874--but has apparently stood the test of time, as the first English publication by translator John Leslie<br />Garner was copyrighted in 1904, and the present edition is dated 1999.  I can honestly say I can see why it has endured.<br />The book is superb research.  The author has created a masterful portrait of his subject using primary sources taken from documents, paintings, letters and<br />diaries of the time, identifying the sources and their (then) location.  Furthermore, he quotes the sources extensively when doing so furthers the story and<br />includes the Latin or Italian version in footnotes should the reader wish to verify his translation.  The author covers the Borgia saga far more thoroughly than<br />many modern biographical works are inclined to do.  The fortunes of Lucretia's ancestors, her contemporaries and her descendants are covered, and though<br />at times confusing, the fortunes of many of the other players on the political scene of her time and place.<br />A colorful recreation of Lucretia's world, through first hand descriptions of the Vatican, of Papal Rome, of courtly processions, personal finery, and the<br />entertainment, arts and literature of the time, immerse the reader in the reality of the Renaissance during the Papal period of Alexander VI.  It also reveals a<br />world in transition, where the papacy itself has become secularized and is part of a larger chess game among world powers.  Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain<br />and Henry VII of England are among the more generally recognizable of the participants.  The story is also an intimate drama of sorts, with intrigue, sudden<br />death, battles won or lost, children's futures determined by political agendas, family loyalties, and personal passions.<br />The work reads rapidly, does not have that archaic flowery style that makes other authors of the period so difficult to get used to, is well researched, and<br />except for the obvious limitations of 19th Century perspective--alot has happened since 1874--is still worth reading.  In fact, unless one makes a concerted<br />effort to recall it, one is inclined to think in terms of a modern day work.  It is only when a building is quoted as &quot;still standing&quot; or a document &quot;still exists&quot; in<br />someone's library, that one wonders, &quot;Is/does it?&quot;  The author is also inclined to see his own time as &quot;above it all,&quot; less ruthless, less malleable with respect<br />to ethics and morals.  He may be right, although I doubt it.  History has not had the last say about the 19th Century either.unes of Lucretia's ancestors, her contemporaries and her descendants are covered, and though <BR>at times confusing, the fortunes of many of the other players on the political scene of her time and place.  <br />A colorful recreation of Lucretia's world, through first hand descriptions of the Vatican, of Papal Rome, of courtly processions, personal finery, and the <BR>entertainment, arts and literature of the time, immerse the reader in the reality of the Renaissance during the Papal period of Alexander VI.

Theodore Nottingham is primarily a writer of religious books and  fiction with a religious and/or historical bent.  In The Curse of Cain, purportedly a biography of the assassin of Abraham Lincoln, he creates a work that is both a religious parable and a work that is at once  history and historical fiction.  His rationale for doing so is his desire to put across the torment and the motivation of a man reviled by history as the murderer of both the man Lincoln and of the ultimate well being of the post Civil War South.  His reason for doing that is his family connection to the protagonist, for Nottingham is the great, great, great grandson of John Wilkes Booth.<br />As I said when I reviewed the biography of the Empress Josephine, I tend to like my history &quot;neat,&quot; and this is no exception.  That doesn't mean that the book is a total waste, however, for a number of reasons.  For those readers who prefer the story behind history, the first half of the book should be quite captivating, for it certainly  reads like a Shakespearean drama.  Nottingham claims to have received some of his ancestor's propensity for drama and grim intensity,  and he certainly reveals that when he throws himself into Booth's tale.  The setting, character, and plot, including the implication of important figures pulling strings behind the scenes,  are interesting enough to hold the attention.  I read the first 142 pages in about 2 hours.  To some extent the author's choice of words and phrases was a little trite, or perhaps more fairly, a little adolescent.  In fact the book might well appeal to adolescent boys who find history too dull because history books are too &quot;dry,&quot; a mere collection of names, dates, and places to be memorized for tests if one is to pass them<br />On a more redeeming note, from my perspective at least, is the final few pages of the volume which are mostly historical data drawn in part form family diaries, reminiscences, photos and documents and in part from public documents.  The hurried summation of this data in these final pages certainly provided some justification for the more theatrical pages that preceded it.  It also provided data that seemed to support the intimation in the earlier pages of collusion in high places.  If nothing else it rubbed away the patina of the ages from the events of that era and revealed the solid brass of the time.  Like our own world, full of subterfuge and hidden agendas, political posturing and diplomatic positioning, the post Civil War Era was filled with urgency and moment, with people who won big time and those who lost big time.  It demonstrates that nothing under the sun is truly new, especially when it comes to human drama, something that both Shakespeare and Booth would have understood.<br />I think it's a pity that so little space was given to the documentation and the conclusions to be drawn from it.  When I ordered the book, it was that that I expected from it.  Given his access to family material, Nottingham could have made it a far more major and serious work of history.part from public documents.

With the recent troubled world seeming to fall<br />apart around me, I took the opportunity of reading it as &quot;light&quot; fiction, and found myself engrossed in the<br />characters, the carefully woven plot and the imaginative setting.  I had already read the first two Harry Potter<br />books and had found them charming enough, but this episode seems to be somewhat more developed than<br />the previous two.  The various elements of the plot were almost as skillfully interwoven as those of a well<br />written murder mystery (the only other type of narrative prose I indulge in with regularity).<br />Although a little predictable in some respects, this did not detract from the story.  Here as in the earlier books,<br />the author has taken up some very grown up motives.  Among these are: the death of parents, the loss and/or<br />death of pets, the occasional falling out of friends, the unexpected goodness of individuals thought to be &quot;evil,&quot;<br />the fact that what &quot;everyone&quot; believes about an individual may not be true, that it's important to give the other<br />guy a chance to fully explain his point of view, the fact that fairness and justice are not always in the cards<br />even for the &quot;good guys,&quot; the fact that some individuals can influence events according to their own agenda<br />because they have power and wealth, etc.<br />For children learning to live in a grown up world, the book certainly gives small doses of reality orientation<br />along with its fantasy.  The hero, as usual, comes out on top of the central action, but he does not always<br />prove to be totally correct about his understanding of events, and everything doesn't work out entirely his way.<br />Above all the book underscores the notion that it is best to make value judgments with caution, and when<br />contrary data come ones way to be willing to change opinions accordingly--something even adults aren't<br />always good at doing.<br />Although many of the &quot;lessons&quot; in living could become platitudinous, in fact to a degree are so, on the whole<br />the parable is delivered without being saccharine enough to put off an adult reader or so condescending as to<br />put off a younger reader.  Here as in the earlier books, Rowling has managed to capture a very broad audience<br />successfully because she has many things to say to each reader.  I enjoyed it immensely and have<br />recommended it to a number of people, none of them children.  I also plan on giving the book to a friend with<br />several children--but only after my husband reads it!<BR>always good at doing.  <br />Although many of the &quot;lessons&quot; in living could become platitudinous, in fact to a degree are so, on the whole <BR>the parable is delivered without being saccharine enough to put off an adult reader or so condescending as to <BR>put off a younger reader.

1835949:US	50669529	R11D2F4U8N89FT	0679758941	861058090	Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny	Books	5	6	6	N	N	A global look at societal and technological history	Non Zero is a very unusual book.  For one thing, it's actually two books in one.  In the first half the author follows world history as the tandem evolution of technology and social organization.  Other authors tend to view history as a long march forward interrupted by major backsliding in different areas of the world at different times.  Wright, on the other hand, views the process as an increase in complexity in society  in response to technology, as well as an increase in the latter in response to the former, in a continuous process viewed from a global perspective.  Just as biological evolution has come at the expense of the &quot;weak&quot; and the &quot;unfit,&quot; so too do technological changes come as a fitness competition.  As technology changes, particularly information technology, so too does the society that uses it.  Wright points out that much of what we consider new in the way of social reaction to technological advances actually isn't.  He uses the rise of the printing press as an prime example of mass dissemination of information and points to the overwhelming changes that occurred after its introduction.  He compares it with the internet's effect on modern day society. Wright also suggests that the global trends over time have tended to create a global culture with increased freedom and greater access to information.  He seems to believe that the overall trends can allow one to predict, within limits, what the future is likely to be.<br />In the second half of the book  the evolution of life is seen as an outcome of non-zero sum solutions--win-win for those of you in business and economics--to randomly arising problems faced first by nonliving molecules then by ever more complex living organisms.  Wright actually suggests that the evolution of social organization and of technology might be viewed as extensions of the evolution of life itself and a situation which might be construed as integral to the process, almost inevitable. The author's discussion of the evolution of life and its direction and meaning are interesting in that he introduces a number of other, often earlier authors, many of whom are philosophers or of a philosophical bent.  One may not agree with his observations, but his examination of the topics seems quite thorough given the space devoted to them.<br />Wright, who is a journalist with impressive credentials, is neither a historian nor an evolutionary biologist, but he still appears to have more than the casual observer's knowledge of both fields.  If nothing else he is staggeringly well read on a wide variety of subjects.  He also has an excellent, thoroughly readable writing style, and a wonderful sense of &quot;the total picture.&quot;<br />From the unique  perspective of the global history of social complexification and technological change, Wright makes  even the advance of the Huns on Rome, the collapse of China before the Mongols,  and  the European Dark Ages seem merely the catalysts of change rather than as the major &quot;set backs&quot; they are seen by most other authors.  Wright is no total Polyanna, however, for while the author sees the future in fairly optimistic terms, he notes that the over all advancement of both technology and human social organization may--in fact almost certainly will--come at the expense of the suffering of many.  It has been so in the past and will be so in the future.  As he writes,  &quot;When technologies change fundamentally, the economic, social, and political relationships premised on them must sooner or later change as well.  The ensuing adjustments can be wrenching.  Still, chaos is not the natural culmination of basic historical forces.  What basic historical forces are doing is driving the system toward a new equilibrium, in which social structures will be compatible with technology.  The big question is how chaotic the transition will be--a question that is for the human species to decide.&quot;<br />I suspect the author is quite right.  Even now as the tragedy of the World Trade Towers seems a clarion call to arms for the technologically advanced world against the more &quot;backward&quot; terrorists, one can hardly but wonder &quot;for whom the bell tolls.&quot;  Wright's words also bring to mind a point made in the book Cosmos years ago by Carl Sagan.  In that work a graph created by an earlier author suggested that the war deaths per population charted over time placed the end of all life at somewhere after the year 2000.  One can only hope that Wright's more hopeful view will still find sentient beings to carry on the torch of civilization and technology!uite right.

1858999:US	50669529	R22VOEDXJ2C4LW	0140282025	132792490	The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence	Books	5	16	19	N	N	Is it us or them or us is them!?	An online Amazon.com friend, Dan McCreary, suggested this book to me when he learned I was interested in the concept of sentience in computers. I have to admit The Age of Spiritual Machines is very impressive. I'm not sure I'm totally in agreement with the author's rather euphoric prognostication with respect to the future of computer technology however, especially in view of the human capacity to screw things up royally. Perhaps if the consciousness of machines and their degree of control and intervention is able to forestall our peculiar bent for self-destruction, the world may become the place that Mr. Kurzwell foresees; but I bet it's a close race! Actually Kurzwell's belief that a machine will ultimately pass the Turing test and that when it says it's sentient we will believe it was an interesting concept, more especially still, since he believes it will probably occur before the end of the century. Personally I'd be more inclined to believe it'll end up a case of &quot;they are us&quot; instead. Certainly it appears that Kurzwell thinks that that kind of phenomenon will occur along with the increasing sentience of machines. Working as I do in intensive care nursing, I have already seen some remarkable achievements with respect to equipment designed to improve and lengthen life. Even the recent neural implants to help control intractable seizures and clinical depression are already being tried at our medical institution. These devices are really only a step away from the more massive changes in personal &quot;equipment&quot; that Kurzwell sees as the ultimate destiny of mankind. I'm not too sure, however, that I could cope with the kind of constant paradigm shift that would be involved in, among other things, downloading myself to a more &quot;permanent&quot; me. Already I feel the difficulty of dealing with the stress of a world that changes technologically, morally, and ethically with almost staggering speed with each passing year. What took a century to do in my grandfather's time, half a century in my father's time, and a decade in my youth, is now taking a year to occur. In the not too distant future--baring a cataclysmic event, some sort of modern day &quot;dark age&quot;--major changes may well occur over months or even days. I'm not certain my capacity to change along with the times will be quite up to it. I can't help but think of my own mother's unwillingness to make use of common &quot;conveniences&quot; like ATMs, answering machines, etc. She's dropping further and further out of the loop as she ages, because she no longer sees the changes of modern life as &quot;helpful&quot; but more as needless complications. Perhaps if my silicone or nanotech &quot;me&quot; is inherently changed in some way--able to think faster, more globally, etc.--by virtue of changes in my &quot;software&quot; design and an enhanced memory capacity, I might adjust. I'm sure that's what the author would say. But I'm left wondering who the &quot;I&quot; of me would be then, after all the changes, not just from carbon me to silicone me, but from the ethical me of here and now to a me who changes her ethics prn (as needed). Sounds a little psychotic. I also found the notion that chaos and increased complexity (such as is seen in evolution) are intertwined in a feedback loop of particular interest. So was the theory that both evolution and technology are growing exponentially. In fact the author believes the exponential growth of technology is growing exponentially. In support of this contention he provides both a graph (p. 24) and a time line (pp. 261-280). The latter makes interesting and informative reading all by itself! One of the things I definitely agree with is Kurzwell's time line for computer advances. That we will see a 1000$ machine (after accounting for inflation, of course!) computing with the power of a human brain in 20 years seems entirely likely. If you think at all about it, as I have ever since I was a kid, the first chipped rock of early man has evolved into the computer/space age in only about 100,000 years--depending upon with which of our species you start. Given the almost unstoppable momentum of these changes, I'd be inclined to say that, if anything, Kurzwell may have over estimated the length of time it'll take to achieve that goal. The Age of Spiritual Machines certainly gives one a lot to think about. It's definitely worth a read.pped rock of early man has evolved into the computer/space age in only about 100,000 years--depending upon with which of our species you start.

The Moral Animal has a rather clever premise, namely that psychological evolution in humans has a  Darwinian basis some of the tenants of which can be intuited, and that Darwin himself and the events of his life  can be used as a type-test of validity.  Most of Wright's proposals seemed entirely possible and all were  interesting.  Most interesting was the way that much of Darwin's history did in fact seem to bear out the  author's point of view, although I suspect this was due in large part to Wright's careful selection of the details  of Darwin's life used as evidence of his thesis!<br />One of the more curious of the book's proposals was that humans grieve by degree, and that they tend to  grieve more intensely the loss of those who are approaching reproductive age.  The author states that in a  survey of individuals in Canada who were asked to rank their probable sense of loss according to the age of  the deceased, it was found that the subjects would grieve less for the very young or the very old.  It was found  that the curve that arose from the data was a near fit for maturation curves of modern Canadians and an exact  fit for that of the San people of South Africa.  Wright pointed out that the San are living a life more like that in  which the human animal evolved.  He proposed that the loss of an individual who would just be starting to  contribute to the gene pool would be a more significant loss than either the youngest or oldest individuals.  Interesting.  I'm not certain I would agree however.  Having dealt with a number of grieving individuals over the  years, I know that irrespective of the age of the deceased, the degree of loss that &quot;might be felt&quot; is often not the  degree of loss that actually is felt.  I also know from the experience of losing my beloved Great Dane  Courageous recently, that humans are capable of intense grief over a non human member of their family, a  creature definitely not capable of passing on their genetic heritage.  I suspect the human psyche is far more  complex than Wright's simple ABC of genetic fitness would have one believe.<br />The book is definitely worth reading, as it brings up a wide variety of interesting points about human behavior  and some very plausible explanations for it..

This book was actually a gift from my Mother who knows I enjoy things archaeological and historical.  Since she`s more than a trifle eccentric and has a marvelous sense of the absurd, I've a sneaking suspicion she was poking a little fun at me--which is something I probably need once in a while for my own good.<br />The Motel of the Mysteries is a wonderful send up of the fields of archaeology and history.  It's aim is doubtless to entertain, at which it's vastly successful, but over and above that the book makes quite clear what archaeology legitimately can and cannot do.  I think it also points out that what is taken as &quot;The Reality&quot; of the past is often as much a function of current cultural biases and of the personal motives of individual  researchers as it is of what actually occurred in the past.  (This was made quite clear to me when I saw Knossos on Crete for the first time and realized that a great deal of imagination had gone into the reconstruction of the &quot;Minoan&quot; buildings there).<br />My favorite parts of Motel were Archaeologist Carson's interpretation of the hotel bathroom as the inner sanctum of a religious structure and the subsequent depiction of his assistant--ala Heinrich Schliemann with the Trojan treasure and Leonard Wooley with the Ur III treasure--wearing bathroom accoutrements as religious paraphernalia.<br />The author also pokes fun at museums and at all of us, when he includes a collection of &quot;Souvenirs and Quality Reproductions&quot; available for sale at the end of the book.  My favorite is the coffee set based on the &quot;sacred urn&quot; (toilet).  Goodness knows I've purchased my fair share of quality reproductions on my travels throughout the world!<br />This should be suggested reading for every college history and archeology major and required for those seeking degrees over BA in these fields!	2001-08-18

Essentially  Bartlett's work is an expansion of an epoch of English history from, roughly, 1066 to 1200 and covers the  reigns of William the Conqueror and the generations of Norman and Angevin kings succeeding him on the  throne.  Like the Cambridge History series, England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings dissects the  period, examining life from nearly every aspect:  military events of each reign, relations between king and  nobility, king and commoner and king and heirs, social strata, cost of armaments, land holding and land use,  cost of living and inflationary trends,  law courts, rise of a merchant middle class, growth of cities, etc.  The  volume is incredibly thorough in its coverage of the period, and its bibliography is impressive.  Original  documents are described and cited throughout the book, providing the dedicated reader with primary sources  with which to follow up his/her interests.  It would be an excellent secondary source book for someone doing  research on the period.  It is however very deep and detailed and takes considerable time to read.  Light  reading it isn't, even for the history buff, but it is worth doing for anyone interested in this very active, very  complex period.	2001-08-11

The author, Malcolm Longair, is both an accomplished scientist and a noted lecturer on astronomy for young peoples' programs, which makes his book an ideal volume for those with a non-professional interest in this topic.<br />The photos are colorful and reveal the impressive advances that observational astronomy has made since the introduction of newer technology.  This is made most apparent in the comparison of images of stars in the cluster 30 Doradus as observed from a ground observatory and from the Hubble telescope before and after the lens correction.  My favorites are the color enhanced map images taken by means of xray, gamma ray, and infrared wavebands.<br />Although some of the material will be more accessible to those with a solid background in physics--the author explains in slightly more detail, for instance, wave-particle and stellar/solar physics than most beginning texts--the development of the theme of the book will still be understandable to the average reader with an interest in astronomy and cosmology.  A good handle on interpretation of graphic data is a must, though, since the volume includes a number of graphic illustrations of concepts which will help the reader understand on an intuitive level the meaning of the formulae that the author includes.  My own comprehension of physics is quite average, and I found the book understandable.  This might in fact be a good way to introduce high school physics students to the practical application of the principles learned in their texts.<br />For those readers who feel intimidated by the introduction of formulae or for the interested individual of junior high level, the books Nightwatch A Practical Guide to Viewing the Universe or the Universe and Beyond, both by Terence Dickinson, might be a better place to start ones reading before embarking on the Longair book.	2001-07-26

Books	5	7	10	N	N	It makes one think	I found I was of two minds as I read Michael Ruse's Mystery of Mysteries.  In fact I was of several minds.  On the whole I found much material for thought, but I was also left with a feeling that the author might have subtle ulterior motives of his own to promote.<br />I attempted to begin with chapter one, only to find that it started out as though the author was &quot;mid-conversation.&quot;  That propelled me to the prologue, only to be confronted with a similar sense of &quot;something is missing.&quot;  Although I don't generally read what I usually find are just an author's favorite quotes--for which read, &quot;I liked this when I read it, and this is the only way I've found to make use of it.&quot;  With Ruse, however, the quote that opened the volume, though gobblety gook itself, was absolutely essential to understanding his thesis.  Taken as a whole, I thought his style was a very cleaver device.  One worthy of a good novelist.  It certainly pulled me through the work from start to finish.  As I read the prologue, I had to admit that there was certainly meat to the subject:  how objective is science?<br />Though I had been aware of the skirmish between the social and the &quot;hard&quot; sciences--finding myself on the former team by natural ability and wistfully a &quot;wanna be&quot; on the latter by a lack of it--I had not given the matter great attention.  Ruse does.  He makes it abundantly clear that the two have been in a struggle for society's respect and financial support for decades, sort of an academic survival of the fittest, and that the rancor on both sides is both intense and legitimate.<br />Probably the most important theme he posits in this introduction and develops throughout the book is that society has certain preconceived ideas about science and those that practice the discipline, namely that there are no other motives than the pursuit of knowledge and the betterment of society.  This is not always the case.  As any of you who've read Iceman : Uncovering the Life and Times of a Prehistoric Man Found in an Alpine Glacier by Brenda Fowler (see my review) are aware, cultural biases, personal quirks, and professional jealousies can all distort what passes for objective research.  The lack of accountability for the spill-over costs to society of research gone bad and the priority of financial interests in directing the goals of science were the basis for the now very famous novel Jurassic Park.  Ruse's contention, then, that the distrust by the social sciences of the physical sciences is not altogether a matter of self interest is a valid one, and one we need to seriously consider.  Just what agenda might a person have whose research indicates that black people aren't as bright as white people or women as mathematically inclined as men.  How might their personal biases direct his/her research and his/her interpretation of results?  The recent book Bell Curve, is a case in point.<br />As a means of demonstrating what is expected of &quot;good science&quot; and of its practitioners, Ruse has chosen to discuss the development of the theory of evolution, its own evolution as a &quot;hard&quot; science, and the personal history of some of the more famous of its researchers from Erasmus Darwin, grandfather of Charles, to Dobzhansky, Dawkins, Gould, Lewontin, Wilson and others.  It was very interesting to see how cultural values permeated research from the choice of a topic to the selection of data and interpretation of results.  While Ruse does not outright accuse individuals of bias, he definitely makes it clear that scientific research is not as value free as society and even the researchers themselves may believe.<br />This said, I have several points of my own to make.  I feel that at times Ruse makes almost personal attacks, and only thinly disguised ones at that, on some of the individuals reviewed, particularly the popular writer Stephen J. Gould.  Furthermore he, or more correctly &quot;scientists,&quot; seem to hold such popular writers in at least mild disgust.  (I was made aware of the animosity directed toward Carl Sagan for his popularization of cosmology when I was taking an astronomy class and the professor, a well known researcher himself, made disparaging remarks.)  It would almost appear that anyone with a gift for putting hard science across to the rest of us--who are after all paying the bills for most of it--is considered to be betraying the inner sanctum.  Science is apparently supposed to be &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;mysterious,&quot; otherwise why would we be obliged to pay so much for it!<br />Secondly, why Evolution?  Certainly it is a very contentious subject and at the center of a societal debate in almost every decade, but if one wants to pick on &quot;science&quot; why not one of the heavy duty ones like physics?  It's not that there aren't eccentric personalities in abundance, as Ruse himself points out when he discuses Newton.  Perhaps its because there would be less of a need to discuss bias and the existence of objective reality as he does in the final chapter.  With physics, the existence of objective reality is irrelevant or nearly so.  It's what &quot;works&quot; and an effective explanation of &quot;what works&quot; that's important, as quantum mechanics makes abundantly clear.  Newton may have been a complete lunitic, but the theory of gravitation was a major break through in thinking and has contributed to further scientific and technological break throughs.  Furthermore, gravitation is just that, &quot;a discovery.&quot;  If not made by the lunatic Newton, then sooner or later by someone else with some other foible.<br />What I think that the author fails to make clear, or perhaps even understand himself, is that science is responsible for the discoveries while technology puts them to use.  It is then society itself that dictates what is &quot;wanted&quot; and what is &quot;good.&quot;  And that is the domain of the social sciences: philosophy, ethics, sociology, psychology, anthropology, etc.  If scientists are motivated by cultural standards and beliefs and produce technological and social effects with which we are displeased, then it behooves us to make changes in our values, the way we motivate people, the way we use technology, they kinds of technology we chose to employ, and the way we think of and treat others.  For this reason I believe we need both the social and physical sciences.  They keep us in balance.<br />I gave this book a very high rating because of the thinking it made me do!ists,&quot; seem to hold such popular writers in at least mild disgust.

In reading The Emotional Brain I was reminded vividly why I never went very far in any field that required a concentrated attention to minutia.  I just don't have the patience for it.  The book is a good one, but you really do need to want to learn about most of the primary experimentation that has gone into creating a theory of mind and consciousness.  If the outcome of experiments conducted on the brains and behaviors of rats, cats and monkeys is your thing, this is the book for you.  If you are even a little impatient and want to &quot;cut to the chase,&quot; I'd give it a miss and spend the money on Mapping the Mind by Rita Carter.  I chose to read The Emotional Brain because I felt it would teach me a little more about the subject--which it did--and because I thought it was &quot;good for me&quot; to follow up on the details of the subject matter I had found in Carter`s book.  More readable books like Mapping the Mind can easily lead the unwary down a garden path unless one is well prepared.  LeDoux provides that kind of preparedness.  It is more in the nature of a textbook than a popular presentation of mind and consciousness.<br />My only  criticism of the textual content is of LeDoux's statement (p. 259), apparently based on observations by Wolpe, that hyperventilation during a panic attack &quot;increases the carbon dioxide in the lungs and blood and results in a variety of unpleasant bodily sensations....&quot;  Indeed hyperventilation can and does produce unpleasant bodily sensations.  If sustained long enough it can actually cause the subject to faint--and therefore stop the hyperventilation unless it arises from a metabolic condition.  It does so, however,  by decreasing the blood CO2 and producing an alkalosis.	2001-07-10

The book is divided into four sections, the last three followed by a question and answer session, themselves very informative.  The lectures reveal that the process of Biblical textual analysis is always a work in progress--and that what is extracted reflects as much on the evolution of our modern society as on the ancient one.

While its purported topic is the possibility of alien life, it also covers and covers more extensively the various theories of sentience, what it is, why it is, and how common it might be.  It also explains the anthropic principle, which uses the fact that we exist to explain why the universe is as it is.  The volume is a little too short to cover the topics well, but it is definitely very lucid.  It also contains a very nice bibliography, a veritable who's who of cosmology and the extraterrestrial question, including Barrow and Tipler (The Anthropic Cosmological Principle), Crick (Life Itself), Dawkins (The Blind Watchmaker), Drake (Is Anyone Out There?), Gould (Wonderful Life), Hoyle (The Intelligent Universe), and Sagan (The Cosmic Connection).  This book definitely makes a fine start to understanding the topic of intelligent life and the possibility of its existence elsewhere.	2001-06-24

While it cannot be denied that the Church has had a pervasive influence through time and space, the Chronicle of the Popes by P. G. Maxwell-Stuart makes it abundantly clear that the Roman Catholic Church and its head were much more than mere relgious bystanders in world history.  For much of its existance the Papacy was a temporal power subject to the political realities of its times, the luck, stengths and weaknesses of the individuals serving in the role of Pope, and the machinations of the other powers around it with agendas of their own.  Setting aside the religious aspect of the institution, Chronicle of the Popes reads like the history of a small kingdom struggling to exist in the face of fierce competition, international intrigue and vast social changes.<br />Maxwell-Stuart discusses the excesses of some of the Popes, their attempts to advance the causes of members of their own families,  the furtherence of the interests of illegitimate children, the sale of church offices and indulgences, and the repression of other religious points of view.  He discusses the bravery of early leaders who persisted in their pursuit of their religious beliefs despite the personal danger in which this placed them, and the efforts of church leaders to define the institution as a religious construct in times as rapidly changing as our own.  It becomes apparent that the Church underwent changes in orientation, stressing temporal over spiritual or the reverese, as political circumstances dictated the need.  In fact one might almost compare this to the invisble hand that directs supply and demand economics.  Though from a strictly religious standpoint it often failed to meet the expectations of its purported founders, the Papacy served a mediating political influence on the behaviors of the world powers around it and contributed to the evolution of the world in which we presently live.  Given that it outlived most of the political entities that it encountered throughout it's history, one might almost say it provided a critical element of stability that permitted that evolution.<br />The author, Peter Maxwell-Stuart, has served as Head of both the History Department and the Classics Faculty at Chesterton College, Cambridge, and his present work reflects this orientation; he does not appear to have any pet religious orientation to advance.  Like any good historian he approaches his subject as a study of a political and social institution and one of considerable longevity.<br />The book is beautifully illustrated with reproductions of early art and architecture, which make the personalities of the various Popes and their world setting clearer for the reader.  Charts recording the known data regarding each church leader summarize the pertinate information in a manner that clarifies the text well.<br />This is a truely readable book and one which I will pass on to a friend with similar interests.ical influence on the behaviors of the world powers around it and contributed to the evolution of the world in which we presently live.

1954303:US	50669529	R213E2SNNQGQMI	0195138260	430168555	Are We Hardwired?: The Role of Genes in Human Behavior	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Interesting volume	Are We Hardwired? is an interesting discussion of the recent progress made in the genetics of behavior.  The authors begin their book by describing some of the data found in the now famous Minnesota twin studies and proceed to discuss some of the information derived from study of much simpler organisms.  They link information on the paramecium, the round worm C. elegans, the much studied fruit fly Drosophila, and the humble mouse to similar biological events in humans and show how the research has helped us better understand our own kind, its strengths and weaknesses.<br />The first chapter is dedicated to the amazing degree to which genetically identical individuals share similar behavioral characteristics.  Even when reared in different environments and completely unaware of their genetically identical siblings, twins are seen to share much more in common with one another and their biological family than they do with their adoptive family.  This is seen especially clearly in the studies on obesity, substance abuse and sexual preference.<br />Chapters 2 through 8 reveal what simpler organisms have to say about behavior.  By studying these animals, which possess very simple genetics and biological systems, scientists have been able to more closely pinpoint genetic sites active in mammalian organisms which perform similar functions.  What is most surprising is the degree to which nature has conserved &quot;what works&quot; over time.  The simple response of a single celled animal to its environment and it's ability to learn or to habituate to a stimulus over time suggests some of the chemical underpinnings of behavior in much more complex animals.  The simple neural pathways of the round worm, for instance, allow identification of specific responses to stimulation or inhibition of these pathways.  Even the time keeping propensities of yeast and fruitflies is studied and has implications for the circadian clocks of humans and other mammals.<br />Given the dark history of the first half of the last century with respect to human biology, the information provided in the last chapters--having to do with eating disorders, substance abuse, mental functioning, and sexual preference--will be the most controversial for readers.  These chapters discuss recent genetic data that indicate a strong heritability for many of these behaviors and point out the caveats for research in these sensitive areas.  The authors are especially quick to point out that IQ is a murky measurement at best and has often been used as a means of justifying social inequality but they also note that intelligence, like other human behaviors, is genetically perpetuated and therefore a valid subject of study.  They also point out that the genome project, while it might easily be used to discriminate unjustly, provides an avenue of remarkable opportunity to remedy the ills of mankind.<br />Whether one agrees or disagrees with the authors on the ethical issues and the dangers of research in the area of human genetics, the book is a wonderful, readable volume on what modern research has to say about behavior.  I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in the science of genetics or in behavior.  It might be a little more difficult for the junior high student, but those in senior high or older should be able to understand it.ory of the first half of the last century with respect to human biology, the information provided in the last chapters--having to do with eating disorders, substance abuse, mental functioning, and sexual preference--will be the most controversial for readers.

I have to admit, it fares well despite the passing of time ( it was written in the mid-80s).  This is in part because it is one of the better and simpler introductions to cosmology and the history of the Big Bang Theory.  It is also due to the charming personal details woven through the book by its author and relating to Stephen Hawking the man.<br />As most of those who follow cosmology probably already know, Stephen Hawking is afflicted with a serious neuromuscular disease.  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease (after the baseball player who died of the disorder) had confined Hawking to a wheelchair by the writing of the book and has since put him on a portable ventilator.  Having worked with people suffering with this disorder earlier in my career, I can attest both to the seriousness of the malady and to my surprise that the gentleman has survived as long as he has.  Both facts make his intellectual achievements, the dedication of his caretakers, and his own personal tenacity for life very real to me and very impressive.<br />John Boslough, the author, is a scientific journalist.  He appears to understand  physics at least well enough to describe it for the layperson, and does so in a readable style.  He also creates a biography that is flattering to the subject without diminishing the contributions of others to the field.  The book is, however, extremely simple, more of a history of the development of the theory of the big bang and black holes than a thorough explanation of them, and the interested reader would do well to look at Hawking's own popular writings on the subject for a more thorough and professional point of view. My only complaint about the book would be that it does not contain any form of bibliography, a resource I always consider one of a book's most valuable assets.  It helps the reader to find material for further study, and it also provides a measure of the preparedness of the author on his topic!<br />I'd recommend the book to any beginner who is curious about the Big Bang Theory, about black holes, the Theory of Relativity, the Theory of Quantum Mechanics, or about Stephen Hawking.  I would also say that any person from junior high level or above would be able to understand the material.helps the reader to find material for further study, and it also provides a measure of the preparedness of the author on his topic!<br />I'd recommend the book to any beginner who is curious about the Big Bang Theory, about black holes, the Theory of Relativity, the Theory of Quantum Mechanics, or about Stephen Hawking.

My friend Mo recommended Kathy Reichs' Death du Jour to me because of my interest in the sciences and anthropology.  I have to admit the book sat on my shelf for about 3 months before I finally got around to examining even the cover, but when I did the author's professional credentials engaged my attention.  Dr Reichs is a forensic anthropologist trained at Northwestern University and employed by both the state of North Carolina and the Province of Quebec as an expert in forensics and by the University of North Carolina as a professor of anthropology.  Her expertise is definitely reflected in the content of the novel.  After reading the first few lines of the book I was hooked.  So much was this the case that I finished it in the space of a single afternoon.<br />Each of the characters is a real person with a distinct personality.  The heroine Tempe, a forensic anthropologist--who is much as I imagine Dr. Reichs to be herself--is clearly defined as an individual.  She has a past and a present and family relationships and problems much as we all do.  Her sister Harry is not simply a carbon copy of the heroine.  She too is an individual.<br />The mise en scene of the action in both Quebec and North Carolina are vividly recreated for the reader.  One can almost feel the damp bone-chilling cold of a Canadian winter and the balmy days of a southeastern coastline.  Incorporating the little details of activity such as specific restaurants eaten at and things ordered there, specifics of the medical examiners' offices in Montreal and how the character proceeds with her work there add  verisimilitude to the narrative.  It is abundantly apparent that the author knows her setting and her topic with the thoroughness of the professional participant as opposed to the diligent journalist.  To a certain extent, there is a rather more graphic description of each of the deceased than in many mysteries that I've read with a similar format, but there is no attempt to make the subject particularly sensational, just very, very real.<br />Dr. Reichs' writing style is engaging and carries the reader along swiftly.  The central characters are likable and human, much as those of Rita Mae Brown who's mysteries I tend to read just to &quot;visit&quot; old friends.  Dialogue is realistic and is not gratuitous and designed to fill space but forwards the story well.

1965333:US	50669529	R39A5XNJ59ZZLZ	0789451875	480331724	Walking with Dinosaurs: A Natural History	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Lost World	I have a nearly complete degree in geology with a special emphasis in paleontology, so I  found this book to be a wonderful &quot;walk&quot; through the forests, plains, and seas of the early earth from the Triassic to the late Cretaceous.  The colorfully combined photos of actual present day landscapes and CGI animal life gave the work a sense of reality.  They also made what I had learned during my classes on earth history come more alive, so I definitely enjoyed the book.<br />Walking with Dinosaurs  is based on the material for an educational program by the BBC which has been shown on the Discovery Channel, and it is meant to accompany and compliment that production.  The written narrative is very well done, evoking a clear picture of the life of the time. Though it is a fictional recreation, it is based upon what scientists have gleaned from the fossil material available from a number of sites world wide.  Each chapter has side boxes of scientific information given in textbook rather than narrative style which, though brief, should help the reader learn on what basis the authors of the film/text created their various scenarios.  More than anything, it should capture the imagination and fire up enthusiasm for more information about the past; always a good thing.<br />Now for my complaints.<br />1.  I felt that the very &quot;realness&quot; of the narrative--and probably the film, which I have not yet seen--give what is actually speculative the impact of  definiteness.  Though the introduction states that &quot;The behavior that created these clues [trace fossils] does not fossilize&quot;  and that &quot;the truth about them will never be known for sure (p. 10),&quot; the narrative may lead the more credulous and less careful reader to believe that more is definitely known about life in that distant time than actually is.  Things like eye color  (Ornithocheirus`s blue eyes) , skin color and patterning  (Iguanodon's strips and  Tapejara's crimson flushed crests), mating display and courtship behaviors (Diplodocus' tail swishing and Tyrannosaurus`s courtship feeding) are entirely speculative and often drawn from observation of modern species which, with rare exception, evolved comparatively recently.  Though there is side box information which occasionally makes it clear why scientists believe some of the information is true, there is not enough of this data in the book to make it clear that much is still in the realm of the educated guess, and<br />  2.  The bibliography, which might well have remedied some of this distortion by giving the reader a bonanza of  resources with which to follow up any aspect of the dinosaur world that appealed to them--or reassure the critical thinker that more than an attempt at entertainment was intended--is definitely weak.  Although books by some of the titans of evolutionary studies and dinosaur life are mentioned--Robert Bakker and Steven Jay Gould being the ones most recognizable to readers on these subjects--for the most part it is a compendium of encyclopedic works.<br />In summary, if purchasing the book, do so with the caveat that much of the material is what is the best estimate to date but that it is subject to change.  (Remember dinosaurs were once all thought of as slow moving, cold blooded organisms that dragged their tails and abandoned their young, and that the erstwhile Brontosaurus not only underwent a name change, it suffered display and illustration with the wrong head for decades!)  If buying it for a young person, remind them of the same, or better yet read it with them.  Otherwise just sit back and enjoy your visit to the lost world.ests), mating display and courtship behaviors (Diplodocus' tail swishing and Tyrannosaurus`s courtship feeding) are entirely speculative and often drawn from observation of modern species which, with rare exception, evolved comparatively recently.

1981980:US	50669529	R1Y55EMGQ3EM7H	0812932560	190608184	Little Bighorn Remembered: The Untold Indian Story of Custer's Last Stand	Books	5	35	40	N	N	A major work.	In general I'm not really big on modern history (my notion of &quot;modern&quot; being everything after 1200 BC!), but Viola's book &quot;Little Bighorn Remembered,&quot; featured as it was as the &quot;untold Indian story of Custer's last stand,&quot; intrigued me.  I have to admit to having had to take a second run at it before I really got into the subject.  It isn't that the work is poorly written; it isn't.  I think that the up front and in your face brutality of the 19th Century US government in dealing with the Native American population was just hard to deal with for me.  It`s not that I am myself Native American; I just have a strong sense of fairness and fairness had no part in it.  When I finally did settle into the material, however, it read rapidly.  In fact it probably classifies highly with some of those I-couldn't-put-it-down novels over which people burn the midnight oil.  (In my case I should have been getting a quick nap between patients while I was on-call for the OR on a night shift).<br />The first two chapters of the book concern the antecedents leading up to the Indian confrontation with Custer and the 7th Cavalry.  These included Custer's own pre-dawn attack on a sleeping Cheyenne village under the leadership of Chief Black Kettle on the Washita River in 1868 and an earlier similar attack on Plains Tribes camping at Sand Creek in 1864.  In both instances dozens of men, women, and children were hunted down and shot and their bodies butchered.  In the 1868 attack even the Cheyenne pony herd, some 900 animals, was also killed, severely crippling the people's ability to pursue their traditional lifestyle.  The narrative of these two chapters is filled with unfulfilled promises and broken treaties with Native Americans in the furtherance of US territorial expansion during the 19th Century.  Certainly anyone familiar with the attitudes of Europeans toward technologically less advanced populations world wide in areas they wished to exploit will recognize the pattern.<br />The remainder of the book is divided into chapters each dealing with various perspectives on the battle of the Little Bighorn.  Here is where the book rises above others on the subject, for Viola makes use of very diverse sources in his effort to thoroughly and fairly cover the subject .<br />Included are the oral histories passed on by the Indian participants, stories from the Cheyenne and the Dakota on one side and from the Crow and Arikara scouts with Custer on the other.  Probably the most interesting part of this material is the fact that not all Plains Indians felt the same about the coming of the army into the area.  In fact the imperialism of the US government was actually superimposed upon on-going events among traditional enemies within the community of local people.  The long standing enmity of certain groups actually facilitated the ultimate defeat of the Plains Indians.  Even allies weren't necessarily of one mind and still are not.  A popular saying among the modern Cheyenne is that &quot;The Sioux got the glory, the Crows got the land, but the Cheyennes did the fighting(p. 27).&quot;<br />Also among the narratives are notes left by Edward S. Curtis who undertook the mission of creating a photographic preservation of Native American Indian lifestyles before they disappeared.  During the pursuit of this work Curtis took the opportunity of covering the battle site in the company of three of Custer's Crow scouts.  From information about events provided by these individuals he came to the conclusion that the battle had not proceeded as recorded thirty years previously.  His intent to publish his conclusions in his project was discouraged by President Theodore Roosevelt, primarily because the latter was concerned that pro-Custer factions would ruin Curtis.  The information was preserved and given over to the National Museum of American History by his son Harold just prior to Harold's death at the age of 95 in 1988.<br />Among the &quot;documents&quot; preserving the Battle at Little Bighorn are the Indian drawings of the event of which Viola includes illustrations of many.  Though simple line drawings they give every bit as clear an image of the violence and carnage of the battle field as do the photo images of the Civil War.  Included are drawings by the Dakota, Red Horse, and some etched drawings by an unknown artists on flattened metal from trade kettles.  Also presented, many for the first time, are some of the victory memorabilia collected from the battlefield and preserved by family members of the Indian participants through the generations.<br />A fire across the battlefield in 1983 made an archaeological examination of the site possible and almost imperative.  Application of modern techniques to the charting, recovery and analysis of the material remains on the site by professionals and trained volunteers in the decade between 1985 and 1995 have allowed a reinterpretation of what occurred and an external verification of the stories of various participants.  (For a more in-depth account of which see my review of  &quot;They Died With Custer : Soldiers' Bones from the Battle of the Little Bighorn.&quot;)<br />Among the most amazing reports of the battle and its events is that of the contribution of suicide to the death toll.  Apparently the notion of torture at the hands of Indian combatants, fostered in part by the tradition of post mortem mutilation of enemy bodies (to prevent their full enjoyment of the afterlife) produced a &quot;save the last bullet for yourself&quot; mentality that led to a far higher mortality than might have occurred.  One Indian witness reported having seen a man &quot;murder&quot; a compatriot and than shoot himself.  Apparently he was not the only individual to have seen this puzzling behavior either.<br />Probably the most arresting facets of Viola's book, and certainly the ones I found most enjoyable, were the many rotogravure/tintype portraits of the various American Indian personalities involved in the drama of the Plains.  The faces are filled with dignity, composure, and intelligence.  It leaves the viewer with a sense of compassion and loss.

1985426:US	50669529	R1ZFRYGRBFVRKK	0486258130	789145878	Tatting Patterns and Designs (Dover Knitting, Crochet, Tatting, Lace)	Books	5	24	24	N	N	Enduring and endearing.	I first learned to do tatted lace as a teenager and quickly learned that it was a good way to relieve tension and to while away time when doing any kind of waiting.  A ball of white or colored thread and a shuttle or two fit easily into a pocket or purse.  I found Blomqvist and Persson's book at a public library in 1980 while visiting my family in Arizona and Xeroxed a few patterns to take with me when I went to live for a few months in Cairo.  Since that time, I've purchased the book and enjoy even just browsing the patterns.<br />The introduction of the book has a short history of tatting and some illustrations of antique shuttles and samples of 19th and early 20th century laces.  Chapter 1 is a brief discussion of materials.  Although chapter 2 provides probably one of the most lucid illustrations of tatting technique I've seen,  I suspect the beginner will still need the assistance of an experienced tatter to really make the knotting process apparent; I know I did.  Generally speaking for most who are right handed, it comes naturally to use this hand in an active way.  In tatting that will get one a lot of knots, but not slip knots.  In tatting it is the non-dominant hand that does the work of wrapping the thread, while the dominant hand stabilizes the base thread.  Like I said, advice from an experienced lace maker will help.  Once shown, it will make complete sense.<br />One of the things I like most about tatted as opposed to knitted or crocheted lace is that it produces the most charming results with the least effort.  There are essentially two stitches, the slipknot and picot, and these with the joining technique produce all the results.  Furthermore, gaining skill progresses rapidly.  Probably the most difficult part of the process is figuring out the stitch codes.  Here the book can be somewhat more difficult to follow than others I've read.  Persistence, however, will provide great rewards.<br />Tatting Patterns and Designs provides both the beginner and the advanced lace maker with some very lovely patterns.  I've used the clover leaf designs of &quot;Astrid&quot; (p. 22) and &quot;Boel&quot; (p. 26) for edgings on collars and cuffs and did almost 200 diamond shaped medallions like star #4 on page 37 for a wedding gown.  I've decorated my Christmas tree with 30 sugar-starched snowflakes using 5 different star patterns chosen from among the 45 included in the book.  The mobile shown in the book using the same patterns would be fun to make, although I have to admit I`ve never done one.<br />For those who like a challenge there are several patterns for runners, mats and doilies, and for those who do lace for weddings there are two tatted cross bookmarks for bibles, and several patterns that would make nice bridal or 1st communion crowns.  I've been tempted to try them, but have yet to do so.  Perhaps when my friend Ann`s little girls do their communions, I`ll finally find motivation.<br />This is truly a book that is enduring and endearing.the advanced lace maker with some very lovely patterns.

Like so many people, I had assumed Einstein had been an atheist.  I have to admit to little previous knowledge of the man beyond his theory of relativity and a few charming stories about his eccentricities, many probably apocryphal.  This book certainly provided a nice introduction to the man as human being, intellectual, and philosopher.<br />One of the most impressive facets of Einstein's life made obvious in Professor Jammer's work was the impact the physicist's pronouncements, even on subjects outside of his professional expertise, had upon the public in general.  It was apparent from some of his personal correspondence and from news articles in response to his papers on science and religion that the general public held the man in considerable esteem.  There seemed an almost awed reverence for his intellect to the extent that his personal position on a topic as emotional and as arbitrarily individual as religion could assume an almost scientific finality, eliciting the commendations of those who agreed and an almost knee jerk response from those who disagreed.  Few remained without an opinion.  So potent were Einstein's mere personal, albeit well schooled, philosophical opinions that they could elicit outright attack from those who felt their cherished beliefs were under siege.  A theologian as eminent as Dr. Fulton Sheen (later Bishop Sheen) attacked his position on the existence of a personal god as the &quot;sheerest kind of stupidity and nonsense.&quot;  While a private individual wrote to him suggesting he &quot;take your crazy, fallacious theory of evolution [sic] and go back to Germany where you came from, or stop trying to break down the faith of a people who gave you a welcome....&quot;<br />It becomes evident when one reads some of Jammer's biographical material on Einstein that the man's impact on the people of his day lay in his character.  His  honesty, simplicity, and wit, for example, lent him an approachability and charm.  His intellectual independence and courage in the face of the opinions of others made him both worthy of admiration and a formidable adversary, almost impervious to criticism.  (When one of the propositions arising from his theory was proven correct by experimental results, he was asked what he would have said it hadn't been.  His reply was that he would feel sorry for God, because the theory was correct.)<br />  Professor Jammer seems never to tire of repeating Einstein's dictum, &quot;Science without religion is lame; religion without science is blind,&quot; as though it could somehow make Einstein's position on the subject clearer for the reader.  However, much of his supporting documentation, while interesting, leaves one with a nagging feeling that one is no closer to Einstein's sense of religion than one started.  In fact one is left with the sense that for Einstein the mere sense of awe over the majesty of the universe and its workings was all the &quot;religion&quot; he needed.  He required no formal institutions, no religious acts other than being true to his intellectual curiosity, had no missionary zeal to convert others to his position, and was without a personal need for immortality.  If he was asked about the subject of religion he responded with customary honesty; if his response made the asker uncomfortable, that was their problem.<br />Probably the most interesting part of the book is the final chapter.  Here, the subject of Einstein on religion is transposed to religion on Einstein (or at least on his theory of relativity.)  Jammer's final chapter deals with some of the more amazing attempts by physicists and theologians to elucidate the existence and character of God by means of physics, in particular by means of the theory of relativity.  It certainly casts in high relief the impact of the man on modern day religious thought.<br />The last chapter also contains philosophical and theological outgrowths of the theory ofquantum physics and some of its more esoteric premises.  It also looks at the theological implications of the Big Bang theory of cosmology, and mentions the books comparing Eastern religion and quantum theory that were so popular in the late 70s and early 80s (The Tao of  Physics and The Dancing Wu-Li Masters among them).  As a mental exercise, Jammer tries to analyze what Einstein might have thought about each of these concepts, and generally believes he would have cast a resounding &quot;NO&quot; vote.quantum physics and some of its more esoteric premises.

Normally I have my doubts about writers delving in areas in which they have little or no expertise; however, I also have great difficulty plowing through the sometimes arcane and ponderous prose of professionals.  Ms Carter&#8217;s careful work and her collaboration with respected researchers in the field of neurophysiology and neuropsychology make her work a very reliable and useful overview of the current knowledge in those fields.<br />When I first purchased Mapping the Mind for a class on mind and the brain, I looked at some of the illustrations and thought \\"..., this is going to be dull as dust!\\"  Since it was on the \\"suggested reading\\" list, I ignored it until the class was completed and didn&#8217;t manage to get back to it again until just recently.<br />Wow!  Was I wrong.  Instead of a boring recitation of anatomy-phys and a collection of totally unmemorable biochemical detail, the book is a fascinating compendium of what is known of brain anatomy and it&#8217;s function and how these combine to create what we consider to be the \\"I\\" of me.  Most of the information has been compiled over years of research on the unfortunates of this world, individuals who have suffered accidents, malignancies, occlusive strokes or cerebral bleeds in or to clearly defined areas of their brains.  By studying what nature and happenstance have put in their path, neuroscientists have been able to produced a map of the brain and of the mental or physical deficits that arise from the malfunction of any given region of it.<br />More recently both normal and aberrant psychological states and even the facility for language have been studied using PET scans which illuminate the portions of the brain active during specific tasks.  The patterns associated with musical ability, abstract thought, memory and other mental skills have also been subject to study in a way that was not possible before the invention of noninvasive medical technology.  While nowhere near the point of a \\"complete\\" understanding of brain function--let alone how it works together to create consciousness and what we consider the individual mind--scientists have managed to make great strides in that direction.  If they continue to make as many discoveries as they have over the past decade, they may even get to a point where some severely disabling psychological states, like clinical depression or schizophrenia, could be treatable.  As a nurse I have had experience with patients just recently who have had electrical devices implanted in their brains.  Much like pacemakers and internal defibrillators for heart disease, this equipment stimulates certain areas of the brain associated with depression in an effort to prevent it.  This was made possible only by virtue of some of the research covered so expertly and readably by Carter in her book Mapping the Mind.way that was not possible before the invention of noninvasive medical technology.

Although I found Michael Denton's book Evolution: a Theory in Crisis well written and thorough in many ways, I also found it a bit frustrating!  Mr. Denton does a superb job of putting Darwin and his theory into historical perspective.  This was something that I had not come across before despite having read a number of books on evolution which made Darwin's biography a subject.  Denton points out that the theory of evolution by natural selection was not at all a clear winner in his time.  One of its major flaws was its inability to provide a mechanism by which natural selection could bring about it's changes.  He also points out that while after Darwin it was intellectually acceptable to view life as a purely natural process rather than as divinely inspired creation, &quot;Changing one's interpretation of the world is not the same as establishing a new fact (p. 74).&quot;  It simply opened up the natural world to the same scientific scrutiny to which the physical world had been subject for quite some time.  By doing so it also allowed major strides to be made in biology, medicine and other fields of natural science.  He also points out that over time Darwin's theory has taken on a &quot;hallowed&quot; status of its own that some blindly accept and others are afraid to challenge.  It has become after a fashion, a religion of sorts itself.<br />Denton also points out that while some of the theologians of the time attempted to put a fine face on the issue, the effects of evolutionary thinking on religious doctrine was irreconcilable.  This clash of orientations produced major emotional upheavals in individuals, in families--including Darwin's own--and in societies.  Elimination of an anthropocentric point of view was incompatible with the concept of intelligent creativity, since chance and design are in themselves antithetical.  In our own time of agnosticism, the iemotional mpact of the theory of evolution is probably less clear.<br />In Evolution: a Theory in Crisis, Denton provides the reader with an overview of the paleontological evidence for evolution, pointing out some of the problems that arise in using fossil evidence.  He discusses:  1) the apparent incompleteness of the record, 2) the absence of soft tissue evidence with which to verify purported  relationships among genera and species, 3) the lack of supporting genetic and embryological evidence of relatedness of living genera, and 4) the disagreement among paleontologists themselves over whether speciation occurs in the accumulation of minute changes over great periods of time or in quantum leaps among isolated populations through time.  All points well made.<br />I found the material Dr. Denton presents very informative but also felt he was disguising something among all the rhetoric, namely that nature itself carries certain caveats that might well channel &quot;chance&quot; in a manner that could suggest &quot;intelligent design&quot; where it did not exist.  Nature might serve as a mesh screen of sorts that, while it prevents certain sized particles from passing through it, allows a variety of other sizes to pass unimpeded.  I think the cladistic view, that simply avoids dealing with ancestral forms but indicates degrees of relatedness among present day species as &quot;evolved&quot; representatives of earlier forms, is probably not given the credit it deserves.  I think most paleontologists would agree that none of the present day animals is &quot;ancestral&quot; to another but that they may be related in differing degrees to one another by way of a common ancestor.<br />One of the most frustrating things I found about the book was the difficulty determining quite what position Dr. Denton took with respect to the issue.  In the end it appeared that he had little to add to the situation other than a summation of the pros and cons of the various theories in circulation.  I suppose it's a useful thing to draw up the battle lines between the combatants.

If the gentleman was supporting &quot;God's&quot; side of the debate, I suspect he will fare no better than most.  God is a non-testable hypothesis.  I think that despite Denton's fine discussion of the subject, the most basic support for the theory of evolution is that, while it may not be correct in all it's details, its tenants have permitted major strides in biology, ecology and other fields of endeavor, and until there is a more workable hypothesis, like it or not, evolution is here to stay.certainly clears the air to some degree and helps the various parties see where their weaknesses lie--if they aren't already painfully aware of them!

I also have great respect for scientific methodology.  That said, I also have to admit to an innate curiosity about alternative approaches to health care, and so when my license needed 30 CEUs for renewal, one of the courses I decided to take was one on reflexology.  I purchased The Joy of Reflexology for that course and began reading it with more than a little skepticism.  Although it suggested that practicing the art on oneself was less effective than doing so on another subject, I happened to have no one else at hand on whom to practice the techniques, so it was me or nobody.  I was totally prepared to pooh-pooh the entire thing as so much bumpkin, when I discovered that the very unpleasant hip pain from which I was suffering at the time resolved and didn't return when certain pressure points on my feet were massaged as indicated in the text.  Since I had been kept awake nights over the preceding several months, turning over and repositioning myself about every half hour trying find a more comfortable way to rest, I can tell you I was fully prepared to eat crow when the massage technique worked!  True, a population of 1 isn't the best statistics, and a test on oneself is hardly the makings of a double blind study.  So, coincidence?  Maybe. But I got the first uninterrupted eight hours of sleep I'd gotten in months!  I'll take it.  Thank you Miss Gillanders.	2001-05-03

I recently became co-owner of a baby ferret, Tycho--after the astronomer.  Just lately Tycho has exhibited a rather alarming weight drop.  Morton's book suggested itself as a useful resource for the nervous ferret &quot;parent,&quot; and indeed it has been.  In reading the section on weight cycles, we learned that the ferret tends to gain and loose weight according to the seasons and light intensity.  What a relief!  The little guy has been a dear and amusing pet, full of bouncing, peppy mischief, and we'd hate to loose him.  It's nice to know we'll be better able to care for the newest member of our household with this new book.	2001-04-28

Because my special interest is paleontology, I got into sedimentary petrology and geomorphology.  It'd been years since I'd read anything on these subjects, so I decided to get back into it by reading the Textbook of Limnology.  I enjoyed the first half of the book.  It deals with more general information on rivers and lakes and their formation, but I found the later chapters on specific chemistry of fresh water bodies and their flora and fauna more tedious.  Unless this is your special area of interest, I suspect you will find it as slow going and unmemorable as I did.  This is more a reflection of my own personal interests than a criticism of the content.  Certainly for someone with an interest in watershed management this would be a superb general resource.  Since I live in Minnesota, a state which has some 10,000 lakes and many rivers including the Mississippi, was covered by and therefore topographically effected by the glaciers, and has a variety of biomes all effected by water distribution, I still found the final chapters of the volume of interest.  I've recently started volunteering at the Minnesota Zoo which exhibits animals of the three biomes, so I may reread the text just to get a clearer understanding of the relationship between freshwater bodies and animal life distribution in our state.	2001-04-23

I have often thought about writing children's books and bought Tracey Dils' book &quot;You Can Write Children's Books&quot; because I thought it might help me to do that.  On first exposure it seemed that all it did was make me feel disinclined to do any such thing.  On second reading, it made me more realistic about the venture.  What I believe it definitely does is provide one with the necessary basics for writing books for a younger audience:  professional style and technique, selection of appropriate venue, cover letters, submission formats, etc.  It also helps one define just what type of book one would like to write by providing one with thematic writing exercises and self-examination questions.<br />I was a non-reader until well into the 4th grade when my teacher began to read to the class.  Until that time I had been totally underwhelmed by the contents of most of my readers.  Frankly I could have cared less about Dick and Jane.  In that one year I went from the simple books designed for 4th graders to &quot;Queen Elizabeth and the Spanish Armada,&quot; a junior high level book.  The key had been INTEREST!  Through the efforts of this one teacher, I learned the crucial fact that there were books out there about topics that interested me personally.<br />Knowing how I felt as a child learning to read, I will probably try my hand at composing books on subjects that help younger readers develop their interests.  It would certainly be a good way for me to use some of the education I've acquired over the years.  It will also give me a good reason to research new topics.  I may not be successful at getting myself into print, but I bet I have a good time trying.  Thank you Miss Dils.	2001-04-16

In his book the Astonishing Hypothesis he tackles a topic hardly less complex, the origin of awareness.  Although the subtitle would suggest that the discussion is the scientific proof for the existence of the soul--and possibly thereby the existence of  God--the reader who takes up the book with this expectation will be resoundingly disappointed.  Instead he or she will find a very convoluted discussion of brain neurophysiology, the theoretical basis of sensory systems, the attempts to synthesize human neural function in computers, and the author's personal theory of free will. What if anything any of this has to do with the soul is anybody's guess.<br />On the whole, I have no quarrel with the author's choice of subject matter, but I found the book at times overly in depth and at others too brief in its discourse.  I also found that the train of thought was a little confusing, as though the author went off on interesting tangents at great lengths and could only with great effort get back on track.  It was as though he could have used a better outline to begin with or had attempted to cover too much in too small a space.  It might also have arisen from his need to extensively paraphrase the work of others in fields in which he himself has less expertise.  The discussion of the neural function of the human brain, particularly the oddities of its dysfunction were quite good.  Indeed I felt it was an excellent update on what I had learned years ago in A&amp;P for nursing school.  The discussion of neural networks and artificial intelligence got a little too detailed for me, but if you're the type who finds Roger Penrose a pleasant afternoon's read, then Crick's account might actually be a little too light minded for you.<br />In general I found the writer's style was labored enough for it to require a concerted effort to plow my way through it.  It took several attempts, during which I read several other books on wholly different topics, before I could actually finish it.  I even went to the extreme of taking it with me to my health club where I would be a &quot;captive audience&quot; with nothing better to take my mind off the boredom of my half hour on the tread mill.  On the whole, I preferred boredom.  While I've no doubt the gentleman is a very learned individual, I've undertaken more readable books on the subject of  mind and awareness.  States of Mind by Conlon and Hobson would probably be more understandable by and enjoyable to the average reader, although this book too tends to try to cover too much in too little space.concerted effort to plow my way through it.

I'm not a math-physics type person really.  More of a math-physics wanna-be!  Because I have more of a verbal/visual than a math mind, I avail myself of every opportunity to read books on quantum and relativity physics that are written for that type of reader.  Two of my on-line friends, Steve and Roger, both recommended Paul Davis' books, and I found Matter Myth an extraordinary example of the genre.<br />Davis and his coauthor, John Gribbin, begin their book with a discussion of Newtonian physics and the 17th Century concept of a &quot;clockwork universe.&quot;  In this approach to the physical world, every event in the universe might conceivably be predicted given a thorough knowledge of  initial conditions.  The success with which Newtonian physics described the behavior of the macroscopic world gave rise to a philosophy of  materialism that gripped the thinking of succeeding centuries.  Davis and Gribbin see the rise of relativity and quantum physics, with the concepts of chaos, uncertainty and virtual particles, as an antidote for the stultifying effects of grim determinism.  The attempts to make the two theories compliment one another and the efforts to unify the four primary forces in nature (strong, weak, electromagnetic and gravity) in an all encompassing theory are viewed as setting the stage for a universe where free will in fact has some place.<br />The book also discusses the string theory and small particle physics, both of which help cosmologists gain some insight into the beginning of the universe, its likely history, and its ultimate end.  It also discusses some of the theories regarding parallel universes and anti-universes.  The authors also discuss time and its nature, but the interested reader might prefer Davis' book About Time, which goes into the subject in greater depth.<br />Although The Matter Myth is listed as a religious apologia, in fact there is very little about religion or god in the book.  The discussion of multiple words in association with the uncertainty principle and the famous Shrodinger's Cat thought experiment certainly leaves it open to assume the need for an ultimate &quot;observer,&quot; but the authors themselves seem to adhere to the scientific position that such an observer is non-testable and therefore outside the realm of scientific investigation.  They certainly do not espouse any particular religious outlook.<br />This is an altogether engrossing volume for anyone interested in the subject.  It's very readable; enough so that even someone with very little knowledge of the topic would be able to understand the clearly written descriptions of the scientific concepts.  At least three people at work, two nurses and a nursing assistant, after a casual perusal of the contents asked to read the book when I've finished it.in association with the uncertainty principle and the famous Shrodinger's Cat thought experiment certainly leaves it open to assume the need for an ultimate &quot;observer,&quot; but the authors themselves seem to adhere to the scientific position that such an observer is non-testable and therefore outside the realm of scientific investigation.

It tends to focus ones attention on the flashy action center stage while more important events are often happening in the wings.  Its spotlight brings out in high relief the massive endeavor of the pyramids, the power and grandeur of the Roman empire, the longevity of Chinese culture, or the blood rituals of the Aztecs.  In doing so it tends to neglect the margins, places where cultural synthesis and mere survival of local polities brings the real issues of life during the time into sharper focus.  Eric Cline is a master at redirecting ones attention to precisely these issues of history.  In The Battles of Armageddon he chronicles the &quot;life&quot; history of a region that was for most of that history on the margins of the action in the Middle East and in the world.<br />The Jezreel Valley and ancient Megiddo, the Armageddon of Revelation, are brought to center stage in this well researched and thoroughly entertaining book.  Here the armies of the world have fought battles deciding the course of human history, and here too it is suggested that the final battle between good and evil will be fought in the future.  All tolled, some 34 major battles have been fought in this valley, often if not usually between combatants who are foreign to the area.<br />In documenting the drama of conflict that has played itself out on this valley floor, Professor Cline has examined a wide variety of data recording human events in the area. He discusses the records of ancient Egypt, the Biblical texts, the cuneiform documents of Anatolia, Assyria, Babylonia, and Persia, the written material of both the Moslem and the Christian participants of the Crusades, French documentation of the Napoleonic wars in the Middle East, the Allenby diaries, letters, etc. for the World War I conflict with the Ottoman Empire, and the more recent evidence for the Arab-Israeli conflicts in the area.  In short, he addresses an impressive collection of data and with it constructs an absorbing &quot;biography&quot; of the region, and in doing so brings the history of the world itself into sharper focus.<br />I found Cline's willingness to entertain alternative proposals for events of the Israelite conquest of the Levant particularly impressive.  He does not seem wedded to any particular theme or version of early Biblical history, a fact which gives one confidence in his critical judgment with respect to early documents, both Biblical and extra-Biblical.  Where he is uncertain of the order of or veracity of events or their documentation, he is willing to say as much.  There is no effort to make the evidence appear more concrete than it is.  He also seems to have no preferred &quot;side&quot; in the Arab-Israeli conflict at least as a historian and archaeologist--whether he has one as an individual is his own business.  The author also sticks to historical information and its interpretation and only introduces archaeological data where it is pertinent to the discussion.  He doesn't burden the amateur enthusiast with more detail than they are willing or able to imbibe.  In short he doesn't slow down the &quot;story&quot; of the Jezreel which makes the volume more readable.<br />Although I certainly found the earlier history of the Valley of interest--my degree is in ancient history--I actually found Professor Cline's treatment of the era of the Crusades more engaging because I learned more.  I also enjoyed the discussion of General Allenby's possible foreknowledge of the war between Thutmose III and the Canaanites at Megiddo an excellent demonstration of good historic detective work.  (It was definitely a good illustration of the value of a thorough knowledge of history.)  The bibliography of The Battles of Armageddon is a veritable who's who of historical and archaeological research since the 19th century, including authors of topical works, of edited collections and encyclopedias, and of journal articles.  For anyone witha specific interest this would definitely be a good starting point for the pursuit of information on tangential topics.  I will probably use it to help fill in my knowledge of the Crusades.  Without doubt this book would appeal to anyone with an interest in history, particularly that of the Levant or of peripheral areas in general, or in political and military history.  One might even use it to teach world history, as so many of the main &quot;players&quot; in the events of human activity have passed through this valley and left their mark on it.  Definitely a work worth reading.ne with a specific interest this would definitely be a good starting point for the pursuit of information on tangential topics.

They reflect his marvelous insight into the heart of current arguments in evolution studies, his knowledge of the history of the subject, and his take on life in general.  The Panda's Thumb, entitled from one of these essays, is not quite as witty as his later works are, but his personable style and conversational approach make the book very readable.<br />One of the more interesting topics included is his discussion of the 19th Century rationale for prejudice against women and individuals of non-Western cultures.  I found the very circular reasoning on the correlation between brain size and intellect and the misbegotten comparison of developmentally delayed individuals with individuals of other races particularly informative.  The same kind of reasoning appears to be enjoying a destructive renaissance among social biologists today, most notably the authors of the notorious Bell Curve.  The dissection of this type of faulty reasoning by an expert is instructive and a process well worth learning oneself and teaching to young people.<br />Some of the more admirable of Gould's writing habits, and well displayed in this book, are his ability to give fair voice to the opposition, his acknowledgement of the work of others, and his capacity to find value even in the faulty work of others.  The latter is well demonstrated in his discussion of the 19th Century effort to locate a representative of a basic life form, a link between the living and the inert.  In this essay he shows that good science is part hard work, part individual brilliance, and part being able to say &quot;I was wrong in my thinking here.&quot;<br />The casual, approachable style, the brilliant and open mind, the logical approach to argument all make this an excellent book for anyone but would definitely make it a good book for high school students to learn the process of critical thought.	2001-03-08

My friend Roger recommended this book to me some time ago.  I had added it to my wish list but never seemed to get around to ordering it, because I had such a tremendous pile to read already!  He thoughtfully sent me a copy as a Christmas gift, and all I can say is, &quot;Boy, Roger, this a wonderful book!  Thanks so much for sending it.&quot;  Never have I encountered such lucid reflection regarding a topic about which I thought I  knew considerable already and such an innovative approach to a familiar subject within the confines of a single written work.  I am definitely impressed.<br />  Diamond starts with the quarry,  why did some national groups overcome others in their quest for space and the wherewithal of nature; why for instance did the Spaniards conquer the Inca and the Aztec, and not the Inca and/or the Aztec the Spaniards?  It would appear self evident to most people, but when Diamond presents some of the rationales suggested by previous investigators  (superior intelligence, superior culture, etc.) it rapidly becomes obvious that it isn't quite so clear cut after all.  He knocks these theories over one by one like so many paper tigers.<br />  The author looks at the earliest evidence for human achievements in different areas, examines the potential of the environment for that achievement, then looks at other like environments where similar innovations did not arise to identify what was lacking.  Agriculture, which appears to have arisen first in the area of the Fertile Crescent, seems to have arisen in an environment wherein useable plants occurred in abundance in a climate conducive to their growth and domestication.  Furthermore, the simple stone technology and the capacity to undertake a settled existence in the area long enough for these advances to arise occurred at the same time.  In looking at each area where agriculture arose independently this appears to have been the case.  It did however require considerable time, and where ever conditions were slightly sub optimal but the region was not confined by geographical barriers, diffusion of the concept or of the actual agrarians themselves brought about the change before the indigenous population was able to create their own alternatives.  This provided advantages for one group vise a vie another.<br /> Nor is agriculture the only innovation that arose and spread on similar principles.  Pottery, writing, the wheel, draught animals, metallurgy, group structures, etc,  all seem to have arisen in response to local conditions and spread from their point of origin to surrounding areas, providing similar advantages to migrating groups.  Even crowd diseases, though hardly what one would classify an &quot;advance,&quot; arose among people who lived in close proximity to domesticated animals, becoming immune to or at least more tolerant of diseases arising from these animals.  Naive groups were therefore at risk of near total annihilation when these diseases were introduced suddenly, as native Americans, native Australians and Polynesian populations among others discovered to their great disadvantage.  In areas where non-crowd diseases occurred to which local inhabitants might be immune, the technologically &quot;superior&quot; groups often found it difficult to make headway, as for instance against malaria by Europeans attempting to take control of New Guinea.<br />  One of the more interesting of Diamond's concepts (at least to me) was his examination of the barriers that might prevent dispersal of cultural traits: especially geography, past practice, utility and ideology.  I was most impressed by his discussion of the simple concept of latitude as a promoter or inhibitor of disbursal.  Limiting  factors arose due to the human tolerance of ultraviolet light, a need for or toxicity from vitamin D, the ability of plants to adjust to different temperature, light intensity or daylight duration,  or to the seasonal fluxuation in temperature, and so forth.  His examination of the east-west verses north-south axis of orientation among the continents as a factor effecting numbers of species of plants and animals available for domestication was also informative.  Another key point, certainly one crucial to our own age of environmental mismanagement, is the importance of starting conditions and of the effects of decisions made by early people on the state of affairs of their descendants.  Large mammals that might have been used as domesticates by early Australians, New Zealanders or native Americans may have been, in fact almost certainly were in some circumstances, hunted to extinction or displaced by non-native animals introduced by early people arriving on islands and continents previously uninhabited by humans.  Their initial decisions reduced the options of their descendants in serious ways.<br /> Probably one of the most important points in Diamond's discussion is that much of what we see as &quot;primitive&quot; or &quot;backward&quot; about the indigenous cultures of some of the losers in the colonialization confrontations of the 19th and early 20th centuries were in fact a reflection of the skill, adaptiveness and creativity of earlier settlers in dealing with difficult terrains with a limited technology.  Furthermore, much of what we consider the &quot;progressive&quot; and &quot;superior&quot; characteristics of  the winners' cultures were in fact shearly the luck of the draw.<br />  In my opinion this book would make a terrific text for a course in anthropology,  history,  sociology, or political science.  Because it presents the information in a clear and simple manner, it might also be a welcome addition to a high school social science course.  I know there are several people with a variety of backgrounds who have qued up at home and at work to read my copy.

To some extent I did, but for the most part I found it somewhat confusing.  I had expected the author's main thrust to be the newer archaeological data on the biblical period and a clarification of the life and cultures of that period.  Instead what I found was an overview of some of that data, of the personalities involved in the research and of the on going problems in the modern Middle East.  The author is a journalist rather than an archaeologist, and while her vita might not lend itself to &quot;expert&quot; views on the topic under discussion, it should have led to a less biased view of the overall work in the field.  Instead the book seems to wander from topic to topic, starting off well in some parts but then going off the rails or at least onto side tracks all over the Middle East using biblical narrative as justification for the digressions.<br /> I found particularly confusing the author's embarrassing confrontation with modern Egyptian archaeologists and museologists over the Exodus tradition.  I wasn't quite sure what had she expected to accomplish other than to irritate her hosts.  With an extensive native history of its own, with limited funds for excavation, preservation, presentation, and publication, and with a tumultuous relationship with modern Israel, why would Egypt feel compelled to study or present the history of the Exodus?  Were they expected to be &quot;good sports?&quot;  Were they expected to emulate the recent papal move, and as to Galileo, apologize?  For what?  I couldn't help but suspect the trip had functioned as a tax write-off for an exotic vacation.<br /> I was also rather surprised to have the Exodus used to date the explosion on ancient Thera.  The occurrence of the Exodus itself is difficult to document; certainly people of Levantine origin crossed and recrossed Egypt's borders in antiquity, and doubtless some of these people contributed genetic material to the creators of the Israelite nation state.  That this occurred in the manner in which it was described in the Bible, which is hard put to it to remain consistent with its own narrative, would be--indeed has been--difficult to prove.  The event on Santorini  (ancient Thera), though it would conveniently explain a lot about the biblical plagues and the tsunami like behavior of the Sea of Reeds, can be dated by geophysical methods and  core samples taken from the northern and southern ice sheets.  A volcanic event is an indisputable fact of nature, and geologists would place this one at a much earlier date than 1500 BCE.  If the author wants to use it to date the Exodus, then the Exodus occurred considerably earlier, the reverse dating is not doable!<br />  What I felt the author did do extremely well in the book was to point out how &quot;history&quot; is reshaped by each new generation to meet it's own needs and philosophy and to point out that historical &quot;truth&quot; is something redefined with each rewriting of the narrative.  It reminded me of Shaw's general in the Devil's Disciple.  When asked by his aide what history would say when the British army surrendered to the Americans during the civil war, he responded that &quot;History would lie as usual.&quot;  And again of Napoleon's &quot;History is lies agreed upon.&quot;  As  the author points out, each of the modern day states in the Middle East has chosen its particular brand of historical truth to achieve its own agenda.borders in antiquity, and doubtless some of these people contributed genetic material to the creators of the Israelite nation state.

When asked by his aide what history would say when the British army surrendered to the Americans during the civil war, he responded that &quot;History would lie as usual.&quot;   And again of Napoleon's &quot;History is lies agreed upon.&quot;   As  the author points out, each of the modern day states in the Middle East has chosen its particular brand of historical truth to achieve its own agenda.	2001-02-17

One of my areas of interest is geology, in which I am a few credits shy of a bachelor's degree, and my particular area of concentration was paleontology.  I have to admit that my favorites are the invertebrates, but I thought that a book on fossil fish might improve my appreciation for them.  In this I was a little disappointed.  Although I enjoyed the material on the origin of various structures, ie) calcified bones, the jaws, etc. much of it was already familiar to me from other sources.  I have to agree with the other reviewers, the book is splendidly illustrated, both with the fossel specimen themselves and with artistic interpretation of them.  But although it is a &quot;pretty&quot; book, it is probably a little too detailed for the casual reader on paleontology and a little to general for a specialist.  The former might easily get bogged down in the details of the fish lineages, while the former might prefer an encyclopedia of fossel fish types to use as a source for identification of field specimen.  On the whole just a so-so book.	2001-01-20

I am a box connoisseur, especially an Origami box connoisseur, and I have yet to find a master craftsman with the genius of Fuse.  I am always looking for something new to push the envelope, however, so I purchased this book to add to my growing collection.  Although I was impressed by the luxurious paper selections made by the author of the book (one assumes) with which to present the box patterns, I found nothing original with respect to design.  Furthermore, the photo illustrations, while they display the finished artwork nicely, are somewhat less satisfactory when it comes to demonstrating the sometimes intricate and confusing folds involved.  Although the diagramatic line drawings of other origami books seem less colorful and eye pleasing, they are none the less much easier to follow, especially for the beginner.  Even though I have done origami for several decades, I would almost certainly have had to refer to Fuse's line drawings to clarify Dirk's photo demonstrations.  One thing that the later does have over the former, though, is that the method of folding the stand-up tabs for the lids of some of the boxes is clearer in the photos than in the diagrams.  Although less satisfied with it than with my Fuse's, I don't regret having purchased the book, as it is visually satisfying, provides one with ideas for using the boxes, and certainly enlarges ones sense of the artistic use of various types of paper.  From my amateurish attempts to work in stained glass, I know that in the practice of any art genius comes in many forms.  Fuse's is that of original design.  Dirk's is in her precise technique--her finished work (if it is hers) seems absolutely flawless--and in her decisions regarding color, pattern, and line.	2001-01-02

As a kid I even treasured shoe boxes and old cigar boxes.  When I found Fuse's book Origami boxes I bought it immediately and have enjoyed some of the delightful patterns in it.  This year when the hospital auxillary had its craft and bake sale to raise money for its various charitable projects, it requested that donated baked goods be in &quot;containers that don't have to be returned.&quot;  I used Fuse's square, triangular and hexagonal boxes shapes, done in Christmas wrapping paper for the tops and sturdy white craft paper for the bottoms, with which to package my contribution.  When I stopped by the sale to see how it was going and to make my own purchases, every single box I had donated had already been purchased.  Although my cookies are pretty good, I still think it was Fuse's clever boxes that made the items so salable.  I purchased Fabulous Origami Boxes to add to my collection, and I must say the lady has outdone herself.  I was curious to see if she could possibly come up with new shapes, and she has.  Her lamp-shaped bowl and her party plates are both new to me.  I can certainly see where the latter would make novel serving dishes for chips or other dry snacks for parties.  More than this, however, Fuse has embellished her simple square box pattern in several novel ways that, with change in paper choice, could yield an infinite variety of styles suitable for any occasion.  My favorites are the box decorated with four folded lilies, the one with the origami rabbit, and the one with the paper heart.  All would make charming gift boxes.  In fact, I'm planning on starting after the New Year with my new project for next Christmas' craft and bake sale.  Dozens of origami gift boxes in every conceivable size, shape and paper!  Am I going to have fun or what?	2001-01-01

I love boxes and have collected examples from all over the world in a variety of materials.  When I found Fuse's Origami Boxes, I fell in love.  They were challenging without being frustrating, effective without being extravagantly expensive to make.  This year before Christmas I found Fabulous Origami Boxes and bought it to add to my collection.  I had hoped the lady would have added additional shapes and ideas and was definitely not disappointed. When I found Joyful Origami, I wasn't quite sure if I should spend the money on yet another box book by the same author, a book that might just be a re-hash of what I already knew.  It seemed inconceivable that Fuse could have come up with anything beyond her impressive collection to date.  Still I couldn't resist; I purchased the book.  Well I was wrong; the lady is a genius at the paper folding art!  Not only are there newer embellishments of her square, triangular, octagonal, and hexagonal boxes, but she has added an heptagonal shape of all things.  I had thought it was a misprint at first, but counting the sides did indeed prove that there were seven.  If one wonders what conceivable difference one more or one less side could possibly make, one has only to look at the color photo illustrating finished items.  Gorgeous, especially in the paper she has chosen for them.  The lady has also added steeple shaped and pyramidal lids, and several new patterns for &quot;plates&quot;--actually more bowl shaped than flat--in folded petals.  Lovely.  She has also added somthing she calls &quot;docking boxes,&quot; some of the simplist patterns I've ever seen for a box, yet some of the most useful and effective.  They require only two pieces of paper, have simple folds and can be made of either square or rectangular starting sheets.  Another interesting design, also very simple and made in much the same manner as the docking boxes are her &quot;trays with stand.&quot;  These are also made of two pieces of paper, again either square or rectangular, that make a one piece shallow tray with &quot;legs&quot; beneath.  I could see these as very effective containers for jewelry, coins or other small items normally kept on bureau draws, or as candy or nut dishes for parties, or in sturdy enough paper as trays from which to serve slices of cake, cookies or dessert bars.  Personally, I can hardly wait for the lady's &quot;next act!&quot;or rectangular, that make a one piece shallow tray with &quot;legs&quot; beneath.

I decided to reviw on my own and cast about for books that would help me do that.  One very similar to this, which I have since given away to another nurse preparing for exams, was what I found the most helpful, and I passed with quite good scores.  When I decided to review recently and take the exam again to bring myself up to date, I looked for a similar text.  This one is superb.  It's based on a programed learning format.  It gives the reader a basic amount of information, poses a question, gives a selection of answers--just as does the exam--and provides one the immediate feedback of an answer.  (One of my main objections to the CCRN exam when I took it was that it was boring.  It seemed to go on forever, and never gave one the satisfaction of learning anything new, because it never provided the answers in this instructive way!) This book also provides the test taker with the rationales for why the correct answer is correct and the incorrect ones are wrong.  Always helpful to the learning process.  I found the book an excellant way to get current.  I was also surprised at how much new information is available and tested, especially in the area of anatomy-phys.  It's quite apparent that nurses, especially critical care nurses, are some exceptionally bright and well educated people!	2000-12-30

In my opinion it's more concise, more organized, more accurate, and more objectively supported by epigraphic research than the Budge.  My only complaint, and it's a minor one at that considering the use to which it's most commonly put, is that there is no English to Egyptian section.  Who knows?  I might want to write letters in Egyptian, and searching for just that &quot;right&quot; word would be so much easier with an English to Egyptian portion!	2000-12-30

In 1970 I had that opportunity, and I've always treasured the experience.  Gardiner's grammar was the book we used, and it's still one of the most seminal texts on the subject.  It includes gradually more complex grammar and exercises that train the student to transliterate and translate from the Egyptian to English and from English into Egyptian.  For the professional, or the amateur enthusiast, sidebars give additional information on unusual word forms and make textual references to epigraphic data/research to be found in journal sources, most particularly the Journal of Egyptian Archaeology.  The appendicies include extensive sign lists in catagorical form that are easy to use.  They also include a fairly extensive vocabulary which, along with Faulkner's Dictionary, makes a useful resource for translating the more common texts.  This is no small amount of work, however, the volume is several hundred pages long and gets into some very arcane phrases and usages.  The person more intrigued than enthused by heiroglyps should probably look for a book called Egyptian Hieroglyphics by Patrick F. O'Mara. For the person who really gets into it, I'd suggest the book Middle Egyptian Stories by Aylward M. Blackman, a truely delightful book of short stories in hieroglyphic form.	2000-12-30

Before the advent of computer learning was even on the horizon, there was the programed learning text.  One of the most useful purposes to which it was put was language learning, and Drs Sweet and Sonkowski have produced among the most satisfying ways to learn Latin by using it.  The books and cassettes have been around since the 70's when I first ran into them while working on my MA in ancient history.  I truely enjoyed the course and learned amazingly well, certainly better than I did most of the other languages I took, with the possible exception of Egyptian heiroglyphics.  I review from time to time, not because I use it but because I enjoy the endevour, and Latin is what I enjoy reviewing the most, probably because the programed format is so easy to get into again.  One nice thing about this series is that it now comes in a CD form so you can work with it on a computer. The text is on screen and the cassettes are now part of it, making the visual, textual, and auditory inputs a more completely integrated experience.  As another reviewer points out, however, the entire series, in whatever its format, is not cheap.  It is never-the-less definitely a keeper, and therefore worth it.  I still have some of the original series after almost 25 years.  How many other books can one say that about?	2000-12-30

I like surgical patients because when they &quot;go down,&quot; it's usually pretty clear why.  Frankly CCU type patients always trouble me.  Like most ICU nurses I can pick out your basic abnormal beats and rhythms, but when it comes to a &quot;designer&quot; strip, I head next door to MICU where the &quot;whiz kids&quot; of the EKG monitor hang out!  One of the best books I've ever come across for learning almost everything you could possibly want to know about an EKG--either the monitor or the 12-lead--is this book.  It's been around at least since the 70s, when I first came across it, and it's still around.  Take it from me, there's a good reason for it too.  Every few years, I try to review the book again to refresh my memory on &quot;everything you ever wanted to know about EKGs and then some,&quot; and I always enjoy the experience.  I come away with a sense that I've truely gain something.  The book is designed on a programed learning format--an old method perhaps, but in my opinion, still the best one--so you learn a small incriment of information, are asked a question about it and then given the answer immediately thereafter.  It really sticks in the memory well, and when reviewing even up to 5 years later, I find I can get through the book rapidly even with the topics I don't regularly use.  The book also containes some useful &quot;cards&quot; which can be reproduced and carried conveniently in ones pocket.  I still have a set I had laminated for me years ago.  Very definately a book worth buying, one worth keeping, and one worth reviewing from time to time.	2000-12-30

While I take a profound, almost religious, satisfaction in physics, especially the more exotic concepts of relativity and quantum theory, I have not the math-physics type of mind that my friend Steve Smith has--lucky fellow.  I found this book readable enough, though, because it doesn't belabor the math side of physics, nor is it one long list of arcane physics formulae. It is still a little more advanced in places than I was fully able to appreciate, but I do enjoy the mental exercise that this kind of a challenge provides.  I had heard of the Superstring theory when it first arose, but I did not take the time then to find out much about it.  It took Steve's intervention to bring it again to my attention, and this book seemed a good place to start.  As a person with an interest in history, especially the history of science, I found the background data on the individual physicists responsible for the various components of the Big Bang Theory and of the Superstring theory of especial interest.  It certainly made the acheivements of these people more human to me and therefore more wonderful.  It also helped me put together, at least at my rudimentary level of understanding, the thought processes that went into making each advance, much as the works of Australian physicist Paul Davis' books do.  Both have a facility for taking the average person through the processes in constructing and testing a theory of the universe.  With each step forward presented by the author, the theory made a little more sense.  I thoroughly enjoyed the learning expereince and plan on reading some of the other books by the same author.	2000-12-27

This volume suggested itself to me as a worthy source of useful information on the subject, and indeed it is.  Although I liked &quot;Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers&quot; better (for which check my review or the listing), it was more because I enjoyed that author's slightly flip and irreverant style, than because this book is less informative.  In fact, the two books have different purposes altogether, and each is successful.  Whereas the former book is dedicated to explaining how the mind effects us physically, &quot;States of Mind&quot; is a collection of short essays on the research into the anatomy of the human brain, and into conciousness, emotional behavior, memory, etc.  They are the written adaptations of a series of lectures delivered at a conference entitled &quot;Understanding the Human Psyche.&quot;  For anyone who has not attended such a conference or a colloquium given in honor of a respected academic, the format familiar to those of us who have is that such a collection consists of brief essays on selected, loosely related topics chosen from a given area of enquirey, each preceded by an introduction of the speaker/writter by the coordinator of the conference.  This tends to produce a book that is less smooth in its transitions between chapters than one produced by an individual mind, like Zebras.  The information in each chapter, while it certainly brings one up to date on some of the newer research and is a self contained unit, is not intended to carry one logically from chapter to chapter to an overriding conclusion.  It is instead more like a professional journal in hard cover.  The lay person will still find much of interest, as all of the authors have made their topics narrow, their terms clear, and have introduced pertinent information on results rather than on methods--although these too were added where they were significant to the discussion.  The book is a quite practical volume in some respects, not merely a collection of unusual findings for the the curious;  I found the subject of memory of particular significance.  A friend of mine is having problems with her mother whose memory is starting to fail her.  Some of the recent problems that have arisen between them might be avoided by simply knowing which areas of memory my friend's mother is most likely to have difficulty with and which are likely to remain dependable. I plan on loaning my friend the book so that she can read the appropriate chapters.  I suspect she will find at least some comfort in them.  I know I did.

Sigurdsson has created a marvelous compendium of sources on the subject of volcanism from mythologies among people native to areas of techtonic activity through Roman authors on the natural sciences to European and American scientists and philosophers into the early 20th Century.  Probably one of the most significant things I discovered in reading the book was the underlying cause for the distain of the average person for the &quot;rational&quot; approach of the scientist.  In laying before me the various theories for the cause of volcanism and earthquakes, Sigurdsson indirectly makes it clear that the &quot;logical&quot; assumptions of men of science can prove to be wrong, and the best research--for the technology of the time--can still lead to erroneous evaluations shaped by preconceived notions of the world, whether those concepts are biblico/religious ideology or a strongly held school of scientific thinking.  Only by reading the entire book does one realize, also indirectly, that the scientific method of enquirey is the only way of gaining ground on the principles underlying natural processes.  While the various authors of different theories may be in part or even entirely wrong, it is only through the testing and retesting of theories against the sterling measure of reality, that a clearer, working model of how nature works will arise.  What is truely amazing is that so many early thinkers came to have at least a partial understanding of volcanism and of planetary and solar formation in modern terms.  Also impressive were the novel approaches to experimental geology that were acheived.  Many of the early investigators were truely creative people.  Sigurdsson appears to be very well read, and his appreciation of the value of the visual documentary record, in forms such as pre-literate paintings and woodcut and engraved illustrations from rare books, is impressive and worthy of an individual trained in historical research rather than in the sciences.  For anyone with an interest in geology, an interest in history, or simply someone who appreciates a good job of research, this is an excellant volume.  It would also be a useful starting point for research on most other topics in the history of science, as many of the better resources are mentioned in the text and in the bibliographic entries for each chapter at the end of it.  Some of the latter are in German, French or Italian, although many are in English translation in Sigurdsson's citing or can be found in English translations elsewhere.from rare books, is impressive and worthy of an individual trained in historical research rather than in the sciences.

I can certainly see why.  It's a very clearly written work with a heavy emphasis on planetary and solar astronomy and a lucid discussion of stellar objects visible with personal telescopes, subjects that the noviate astronomer is most likely to find of interest.  The author also dedicates two chapters to the subject of theoretical astrophysics at the very basic level of cosmology, ie) the theory of the origin, the possible ultimate destiny of the universe, and the liklihood of the existance of coevil universes parallel to our own. Dickinson also throws his lot in with those who would believe in UFOs, to the extent that while he doesn't believe in the sightings people report--however well meaningly--he does believe that intelligent life is out there and may well already know of our existance.  He gives a thorough and lucid outline of why he believes this to be the case.  He also summarizes the SETI project and the ultimate change in position on this topic of high visibility astronomers like the late Carl Sagan, Iosif Shklovskii, and Ben Zuckerman.  A very interesting book, and one that whets the appetite for further information.	2000-11-30

Most of them contained star charts that were a mass of confusion, and the printed information was hardly any more helpful.  When a friend and I decided to take a beginning observational astronomy course, I was doubtful, but Dickinson's volume is much more lucidly written and his charts are designed for the beginner.  I was able to find the planets Venus, Mars and Jupitor on a casual night time walk with my Great Dane and was absolutely thrilled.  Just as told, the planets were clearly visible despite the city lights.  Although I have been able to identify the big dipper since childhood, finding other named heavenly bodies was something I hadn't believed myself capable until trying it with this book.  Both my friend and I have enjoyed the experience.  She says she wishes she'd known about it when her &quot;kids&quot; were still kids!  Speaking of which, the book also has VERY important information for the prospective purchaser of a telescope, a must read especially for those looking to buy a gift for the amateur astronomer in their family.  This would make a fun family book for those who enjoy doing special things with the kids.	2000-11-23

Although I've come across many of the concepts in other books on quantum and relativity physics and cosmology, this is the first book I've read that was specifically dedicated to time itself.  I was amazed at the number of ways there are of analyzing time.  Among a myriad of other topics, Davies discusses it: as an historical subject of conjecture among the early Greeks, a subjective experience of the human mind as a byproduct of consciousness, a possible artifact of the &quot;big bang,&quot; a possible reversible process in the event of the &quot;big crunch,&quot; a vector quantity exhibiting directionality, rate of movement and even possibly a rate of change, the multiworld hypothesis and the possiblity of different types of time in these other worlds, and so on.  Although some of the book is a little dated--the information from the Hubble orbiting telescope is mentioned in future tense--on the whole almost everything that can be said of time is included in the book in a clear fashion.  I'm not a math-physics type person really, but I found the Davies book quite understandable.  I especially enjoyed his insertion of a &quot;devil's advocate,&quot; so to speak, who could point out problems or ask pertinent questions of the author.  It was like attending a class with a particularly gifted student in its midst.  Very much worth the time!	2000-11-22

My favorites are the triangle box, which I used as a gift box for homemade candy, and the hexagonal box, which I used to package a variety of cookies, candies and mixed nuts by using the triangles as dividers.  I've used both the hexagonal and octagonal boxes in heavy weight oversized paper and wrapping paper to make storage boxes for yarn, sweaters and other things in my closet.  Changing the starting size of the paper by as small amount easily makes a box top with the same pattern folds. Though some of the patterns may be a little beyond a very young child, some of them would be doable by the school aged child, especially with an adult demonstrating each fold and with a finished product with which to visualize and to encourage their persistance.  For the educator, the boxes might help students visualize geometric shapes and spacial relationships. Definately a fun way to spend a quiet wintery or rainy afternoon.	2000-11-17

Now don't get stressed out here!  I truely mean it, this one is fun.  No formulae to memorize, no complicated Krebs Cycles to navigate, no difficult Latin origin and insertion sites to locate, just pure fun.  The author has the knack--no let's call it for what it really is, a rare gift--for taking the dry facts of biological functioning and making an amusing but clearly informative tale of it all.  Dr Sapolsky has a purpose beyond the mere dissemination of information on anatomy physiology of humans, zebras, lab rats, or baboons to the lay person.  His intention is to show that the modern lifestyle, and how the individual reacts to it, can have a major impact on health and even on the economy of the country.  I'd recommend the book to anyone with an interest in how the body works as wonderfully as it does, to those who wonder why they get sick when they're stressed out but their neighbor never seems to, to those who want to lead a healthier lifestyle and need a little background information to get started, and to high school or college students who can't quite get into that biology class because the content seems too difficult--or just plain too boring--to manage.	2000-11-07

It not only displays much of the best of the Met's extensive collection in all artistic areas and describes them with errudition, it also gives a brief summary of the development of the collection and biographies of some of its contributors and early directors.  When I first moved to New York, this was one of the first books I purchased.  I visited a section of the museum to get a feel for the display, then read this and another book on the art styles and artists of that particular period, then returned to visit the collection with newly educated eyes.  It was a tremendous experience.  I must admit, it took me months to actually get through most of the museum, but by God, with the aid of this book, I got nearly everything out of those visits a person can!	2000-11-06

Some of the textiles displayed are worthy of a museum as are some of the pieces of equipment used to make them.  There are old photos even showing how some of the cultural equipment was actually used.  Much of the material presented was collected in the suqs (market places) in Taif, Riyadh, and Jiddah, places to which I had been myself and where I had also collected some craft objects which I display in my own home.  As growing numbers of the world's community begin to acquire and prefer the more &quot;perfect,&quot; cheaper, mass produced commodoties of our age of technology, the knowledge of these crafts will undoubtedly dwindle.  Hopefully those with an appreciation of the knowledge and artistic ability of the old crafsman will preserve with loving care some of the few pieces that remain.  I know some large silver bedouin beads I purchased in the women's suq in Riyadh have a pride of place in my home; I use them as Christmas tree ornaments every year and treasure them!	2000-11-06

The plot moves along briskly, the action and attitudes of the individuals are plausible, the narrative is neither boring to the adult nor patronizing of the young reader.

I have since seen other works in a similar style by other artists working in the Middle East and have become quite enamoured of the intensity of their works.  Jerome's Middle East works have the vividness and in-your-face-reality of artists of our own American Southwest, like Reynolds and Remington.  The character of the native people, the earthy reality of their lives, the heat and diffuse light of their environment are dipicted masterfully in &quot;Arabs Crossing the Desert&quot;.  What I found most informative in reading the volume, however, was the incredible variety of subjects, settings and styles chosen by the artist.  Because of my own interest in the Middle East, his work there was familiar to me--I have postcard copies of some of his paintings of various buildings in Cairo--but his other work was less so.  His animal studies, like &quot;Lioness and her Cubs,&quot; and &quot;Thirst&quot; (depicting a male lion drinking the last of a dwindling source of water in a vast desert), and &quot;Tiger and Cubs&quot; are amazing in their detail.  The more classical work &quot;Pygmalion and Galatea&quot; with its almost Vermeer like light, and &quot;Venus Rising&quot; a study much like that of Boticceli though derivative have their own unique spirit.  The fierce ocean scene &quot;Vision of the Captive of St Helena&quot; has an intensity, a sense that one has happened into a drama just as it is occuring.  Quintescentially representative of this awareness of the moment is my favorite of his works, &quot;Duel After the Ball,&quot; depicting the death of Harlequin in a snowy mist shouded wood.  Certainly a brilliant if not necessarily well known artist.  This is probably one of my favorite art books.	2000-10-29

That the chaos of weather leads to an orderly precession of climate through time was an interesting concept.  The necessity of the rise and application of computers to the problem of weather and climate prediction was something that had not really occured to me.  Certainly the number crunching capabilities of these modern engineering miracles that go into the science was impressive.  The book is definitely outdated with respect to politics and predictions, however.  Still a valuable book from a historical point of view and worth reading as a good beginning to understanding weather and climate.	2000-10-29

I am forever indebted.  It may not be the ultimate techniques manual, but it definitely was an enjoyable book.  The author is obviously a lady who enjoys living life and not just sitting on a fence listening to the lively tales of others' adventures!  She also has the spirit of experiment, and either tries out different philosophies or styles of sexual satisfaction or interviews others who have.  She reviews ancient asian techniques, the sexual philosophy of Tanta, and more modern approaches intended to get one &quot;in touch with ones own body.&quot;  It took me forever to read--for which I appologize to the giver--not because it was complicated, dull or lengthy, but because I enjoyed reading it a little at a time.	2000-10-22

I did however enjoy the book; it makes an interesting read, and pulls the reader along with the dash of a romance novel.  Rose Tasher, the daughter of a failing suger plantation owner in Martinique, is pulled along by the forceful currents of her times, like a cork bobbing along in a stream.  Her gift for self promotion and a flare for diplomacy carried her from a futureless life on the tropical island of her birth to a pampered if not terribly happy life as the Vicountess de Beauharnais, to that of independent courtisan, to wife of France's premire general Napoleon Boneparte, to Empress of France, and finally to honored icon of French nobility under the new Bourbon monarchy.  She survived alive through the nightmarish years of the French Revolution, even escaping a death sentence after a long confinment in hellish circumstances during Robespierre's reign of terror.  She did this through political connections she had cultivated earlier in her life.  While her then estranged husband, Alexander, the Marquess de Beauharnais, who had been an active supporter of the revolution lost his head, essentially for his pedigree.  From here on her talents for survival are tested to the limit by the shifting tides of political history.  No matter what her position at any given time, Rose is able to make it safely to the winning side by virtue of having made influential friends willing to interceed for her during the turmoil and violence of each change in regime.  Despite her relationship with Napoleon--at which time she assumes her new persona as Josephine--and her tenure as Empress, after his fall she is fortunate enough to be cultivated by the new monarchy as an icon of French nobility surviving the revolution.  What is truely amazing, over and above her own survival of these times which spared no person and during which hardly a family in France had not lost several if not most members to the violence of each succeeding political change, is that she managed to keep her son and daughter alive and to promote their fortunes through her efforts.  When one views the lady from the perspective of her times, one can hardly deny, even when one deducts for the creative license of the author, that Josephine Rose Tascher de Beauharnaise Boneparte was an amazing person.times which spared no person and during which hardly a family in France had not lost several if not most members to the violence of each succeeding political change, is that she managed to keep her son and daughter alive and to promote their fortunes through her efforts.

Okay, so children's literature is not my usual thing to read.  But when two computer people, including one PhD in computer engineering, and a cardiovascular-transplant surgeon all &quot;admitted&quot; to being addicted to the Harry Potter books, I decided maybe there was something to them.  I read this, the first, and I have to &quot;admit&quot; there is!  I found the central character Harry Potter and his friends entirely believable, despite their rather unusual milleu.  The story was well written and carefully plotted and was not as treacley as I'd expected it to be.  In fact it was quite charming, included some rather intense real-life topics--such as the unfairness of life in general and the death of parents in particular--and kept my attention well enough for me to read it in under a day's time.  I'd recommend it to anyone.	2000-09-23

I did not particularly enjoy  the book, but that was because of the person that I am, and not because the  book wasn't good.  In fact, I consider it to be well written.  The Black  Room at Longwood is a lyrical work written by an author with a strong sense  of environment and the &quot;presence&quot; of historical events.  However  it is also more of an introspective, personal experience, a mental voyage  back into time than a work of history.  Since I tend to prefer the cold,  dry facts without emotional garnish, I found it a less captivating work  than a person who finds ungarnished fact a little dull might well find it.  The prose is almost poetry, although how much of this is due to it's  translator's talent and how much to the author's I would be unable to say.  The psychological character of the environment of St. Helena and of the  house of Longwood, that housed Napoleon and his fellow exiles during the  last years of his life, is vividly recreated for the reader.  One doesn't  just learn of the personality and facts of the exile, one lives the  experience through the author's words.  Basing his description on extensive  research into the subject, Kauffmann visits the site and describes it and  the events that took place there in such a way that the reader actually  travels with him back into the early 19th Century to watch and experience.  A vividly written work.	2000-09-10

I found particularly interesting the notion  that gender is not a necessity for reproduction nor even necessarily a good  plan for projecting one generation's genes into the future. It hardly  occurs to a member of a species that places so much emphasis on sex and  gender that their occurence and persistance actually need some explanaton.  Ridley does this with flare, illustrating with examples from other species  what is possible and mathematically what is likely to occur genetically  with various approaches to reproduction.  He also provides an overview of  most of the theories of why gender occurs and reasons why most theories  don't quite hold up when examined against what actually occurs in nature.  His own theory of parasite and infectious disease resistance and an  &quot;arms race&quot; of sorts between host and parasite seems quite  plausible as an explanation for the rise of gender.  He also gives a  thorough account of how selection of certain noncounterfitable traits  exhibiting the health of prospective mates has caused a similar Red Queen  stalemate between the sexes and has led to the types of behavior seen as  characteristic of male and female humans.  An interesting book.	2000-09-06

It's a very well written guide to the realities and  fallacies of relationships between men and women.  More than anything it is  a helpful digest of men's perspectives on life and relationships, of their  experiences of socialization as children, and of the pressures to which  they are subjected as adults, all of which impact their interactions with  the significant women in their lives.  Unlike Gray's Men are from Mars...,  which often times loses one through &quot;cute&quot; sometimes patronizing  and repetitious style (although a helpful book also), Dr.  Goldberg  describes more succinctly and clearly what men can realistically deliver  emotionally in relationships. He also demonstrates how women's sometimes  unrealistic and romantic expectations can frustrate men and increase their  anxiety level at unpropitious times, and how the different life views and  communication styles of the two genders can place even loving couples at  odds with one another.  Although I sometimes found myself a little on the  defensive when reading the book, I also found that when I looked at things  more from the male perspective--to the degree that I as a woman am able to  do so--much that had occured in my failed attempts to relate to men in the  past became clearer, and I could see what part I myself had played in the  demise of those relationships.  A useful book, and one I would suggest to  anyone--man or woman--contemplating marriage or a commited relationship of  any kind.	2000-08-26

In my exposure to the process of learning the subject, it  often seemed to me that somehow god casts a spotlight on earth's stage and  the historic cast of one civilization takes center stage does its part and  departs.  When the curtain rises again, another character steps forward to  play its part.  None of these individual civilizations seems to have much  to do with any of the others.  The student is left with little sense of  connection and even the time lines seem disconnected.  This book is amazing  if for no other reason that the highlighted culture(s) of which the mummies  were a part are peripheral, marginal ones lying between the East and the  West.  In attempting to describe the origins of the mummies and the  population movements that they indicate, the authors provide a more  thorough description of the intereactions of East and West.  It's as if all  the &quot;characters&quot; are on stage together during any given  &quot;act&quot; giving the reader a far more comprehensive view of world  history in the making than any other book on an individual topic.  In  acheiving their overall goal of describing the mummies and their  background--cultural, linguistic, genetic, and historic--Mallory and Mair  have also achieved a tour de force which puts more of human history into  perspective.  I expected to learn a great deal about the Tarim mummies of  the Taklamakan Desert, I did not anticipate putting much of what I already  knew of the ancient world into a more understandable framework.  A very  impressive book.	2000-08-21

I am not personally knowledgeable about  textiles, although my mother an artist who is a consumate spinner and  weaver is, and so I have come to have an appreciation for the weaver's art  through my association with her.  I was especially impressed by the  authors' thorough knowledge of the craft and of the archaeological  implications of the textiles preserved with the famous Urumchi mummies of  the Tarim Basin of the Taklimakan Desert.  These naturally preserved  bodies, like the freeze dried mummies of the Andean mountains and the Early  Bronze age body found frozen in an Alpine glacier, provide archaeologists  with direct information about the health, genetic relationships, and  cultural affinities of the people in these regions.  In particular the  Urumchi mummies are unique in that the population appears to have been  caucasian rather than oriental, suggesting early settlement of the area  from the West.  Prior to the discovery of these bodies, it had always been  assumed that the cultures of the East and the West had developed in  relative isolation with respect to one another.  Now it is clearer that the  human populations of both areas were in far greater contact and that there  was significant potential for both genetic and cultural exchange, with  ultimate implications for the later civilizations that developed in each.  With their intensive evaluation of the fiber crafted cultural remains  entered with the bodies, the Barbers' add fine points of detail to what is  known about the people of the area and of their likely origins.  The book  clearly illustrates the value of textiles in the approach to archaeological  problems.	2000-08-12

I have to say, it was an  enchanting book.  Kingsolver's style is very readable.  Her use of dialect  creates characters that are both three dimensional and enjoyable.  Her  attention to the small details of environment instill a strong sense of  visual reality to what she describes and elicit an emotional commitment  from the reader with a success that many authors fail to acheive.  The  journey of Tayler, nee Mariette, Greer is one not only through the  landscape or even through time, but through life's experiences.  She seems  to grow in depth as she takes on each new challenge.  Her involvement with  others and their dependence on her show a strength that many of us would  like to claim as our own.  A very companionable book.	2000-08-03

I was surprised at the odd ways that decisions are made  by everyday people, and the misconceptions upon which those decisions are  made.

Both were impressed with what Wilson had to say, and I have to  agree with them.  Consilience is a very densely packed work.  The author  covers at least in brief topics as diverse as French philosophers to recent  advances in brain/mind science.  He has included something of almost every  conceivable interest which will leave nearly every reader feeling a degree  of connectedness with the material.  There are also topics in abundance for  the curious to research and also the sources to further that personal  investigation.  I found myself as happily buried in the information in the  author's end-volume footnotes as in the text itself!  Here I found several  sources, both in journals as well as books, in which to do future  study--not that with friends like Roger and Stephen I will ever lack for  titles to read!  While I can believe that the social sciences and the  physical sciences might acheive what Wilson calls consilience, I'm not  certain that I agree with him that the arts will do so.  Certainly the  various branches of the physical sciences are already beginning to do so  with very fruitful results.  An interesting read, but plan on spending a  fair amount of time in reflection!	2000-07-20

When I started reading the book, I realized that it possessed a very  chatty, narrative style not usually characteristic of the professional  archaeologist and looked at the vita of the author.  Seeing that Ms Fowler  was a journalist, I rather clenched my teeth and prepared for a  &quot;readable&quot; account of an archaeological discovery by an  interested amateur.  Much to my surprise, I found it a very skillfully  written and researched expose on how not to do scientific research!!  The  story of Otzi the Iceman is a parable of our times. Science, enshrined in  most of our minds as a clinical, abstract, and apolitical method of  thinking and problem solving, is in fact a human activity.  As such it is  encumbered with all of the frailties attendant upon that condition.  The  Iceman reveals the political, professional, financial and personal pitfalls  that a rare and unusual find of this type create for the individuals  involved in its discovery, its preservation, its study and its display.  The unfortunate man himself was probably never the focus of this much media  and public attention in his entire lifetime.  Certainly after his discovery  none of the lives of those involved with his mortal remains would be the  same again.  The drama of the discovery is the center of Fowler's work,  which questions the degree to which scientists as people can really be as  divorced from the realities and pressures of life and as neutral in their  perspectives as the discipline in theory demands.  It certainly points out  that there are differences in quality among various scientists, and that  their personal motives can not be entirely ignored in evaluating the work  they do.  The book also points out the value of open communication between  individual researchers and of peer review.  It will be interesting to see  if the discoverers of the Andean mummy, Jaunita, who are also mentioned in  the book, will have learned from the mistakes of their predecessors.ers of the Andean mummy, Jaunita, who are also mentioned in  the book, will have learned from the mistakes of their predecessors.	2000-07-09

Techniques and time periods are well illustrated with examples taken from work done all over the world.  Some of the most famous archeological sites  are discussed:  Olduvai, Zhoukoudien, Sanidar Cave, Jericho, Cahokia,  Teotihuacan, Tikal, Moche, Cuzco, Uruk, Giza, An-Yang, Great Zimbabwe,  Knossos, and others possibly more familiar to those with other areas of  archaeological interest.  This would make a lovely addition to the library  of those who have more specialized interests but who want to know more  about other areas or who enjoy learning new things about archaeology  itself. It's definitely a book I'll re-read, and I don't generally do that.	2000-07-05

This book is perhaps slightly more in depth within its alotted space than the  geology text is, but is again, a book more for the beginner.  It is a  lovely, well illustrated and comprehensive volume on working paleontology  and includes some nice information on famous fossil sites and on museums  with very nice collections in the US and abroad.  The latter pieces of  information might be especially useful for family vacations.  I plan to  give this book as well as its companion to a close friend with school aged  children.	2000-07-04

I had read a book on Monte Verde as a child but other than this modest brush  with SW archaeology, I knew little or nothing about the prehistory of the  area.  This volume was a good place to start for information about the  material data available and the way it has been assembled to create a  clearer picture of the settlement of Native Americans across this part of  the continent.  I found particularly interesting the notion careful  custodianship of available resources of an entire area allowed a fairly  large population to thrive without agriculture. The author also points out  clearly that even at the stage of nomadic existance, when little material  evidence is available, the cultural differences attendant upon a lifestyle  of wide range migration following animals as opposed to intensive plant use  within smaller areas are still distinguishable and can be seen in material  remains--or relative lack thereof--over a region under study.  Of interest  too was the concept that farming, far from being the panacea for mankind it  is often seen as being in the modern world, was actually a double edged  sword.  It encouraged increased population density--with an increase in  food and fewer problems for sedentary mothers raising children and an  increased demand for labor creating population pressures for which a  natural environment would not be able to provide in emergencies--which left  the farming peoples much more vulnerable to weather changes and episodes of  famine.  Schooled as I had been in 1960s and 70s anthropological concepts  of &quot;better life through agriculture,&quot; it was a novel notion that  the hunter-gatherer forbears of early farmers had actually been better  nourished and that their mobility and understanding of a larger range of  countryside actually had left them less vulnerable to environmental mishaps  than agrarian people.  The volume also does an excellant job of describing  some of the better known and publicized settled cultures of the SW, such as  the Hohokam and Anasazi with which I was somewhat familiar having lived in  the Phoenix area, and the less well known Mogollon and Mimbres (known more  for their lovely pottery) cultures.  The book is well illustrated with  maps, drawings and photographs that will help give the reader a fuller  understanding of the written information.  It also sticks to the  interpretation of the data described rather than going into elaborate  detail regarding actual excavation in the region, which would probably lose  the average reader on the subject.  I found the book very informative on  the subject, and wish I'd had it to read before I lived in the area.  I  would probably have gotten more out of my stay.haps  than agrarian people.

Unless you have an intense interest in knowing the details of the Italian world through  time to the extent of desiring a more thorough knowledge of more out of the  way places, I'd say this was not for you.  A similar book on Pompeii would  probably be more entertaining to the average reader because one already has  some sense of &quot;kinship&quot; with the site of so famous a natural  tragedy.  Paestum, ancient Greek Poseidonia, is somewhat less known.  Pedley's Paestum is a well ilustrated book, however, and does an adequate  job of describing the development of the site through time, admittedly an  admirable piece of archaeological workmanship and published, as so many  sites are not.  Still it will probably appeal mostly to the Greco-Roman  historian or to the college student studying classical archaeology.	2000-07-04

I remember purchasing a slender volume at that time about mummies and their preparation, making myself a  young &quot;expert&quot; on the subject.  Over the years I have had the  opportunity to see and read about other types of mummiform bodies including  the wonderful collection of pharonic aristocracy at the Egyptian Museum in  Cairo and the Inca collection in Lima, Peru. I've read with interest the  discovery of the Chalcolithic Tyrolean mummy, Otzi the Iceman, of Jaunita  and her &quot;siblings&quot; abandoned on the peaks of the Andes, and of  the Tarium mummies of the China deserts.  The Chinchorro mummies of Chile  are an even earlier group of preserved human remains with which I was only  vaguely familiar by virtue of a mention of them on an educational program  on TV.  Arriaza's book elaborates on the subject in considerable detail.  It discusses their accidental discovery, their place in the history of  South America, the methods of their creation, and of considerable interest  to me as a nurse, their health as a population. In particular I learned  that naturally occuring arsenic may have seriously affected the health of  the people of the area.  I had recently read of efforts made decades ago to  improve the safety of water in India that had inadvertently gone awry,  subjecting the population using the wells created to provide biotically  pure water to increased levels of arsenic from ground water.  Issues of  public health are of interest to me and both of these and the possible  introduction of lead into the Roman water system by it's efforts to improve  public access to water are similar.	2000-07-04

This was one of those times!  The book is a lovely, well  illustrated, practical guide to geology for the beginner.  Much of what the  authors dedicate a single paragraph or page to I have had whole courses in  already, so needless to say, I was not quite as enthused over the material  as a new comer to the field might be.  Certainly for the beginner,  especially the Junior High natural science enthusiast, this would be a  wonderful gift.  It might even make a good text for a high school natual  science course, as it covers considerable information on the earth  sciences.  I plan on giving my copy to a close friend with children  interested in these subjects.	2000-07-04

If I could have given it 6 stars I probably would have!  The authors of Zapotec Civilization have covered the field nicely for this small segment of the perhistoric Middle  American world and have set it clearly amidst the other contemporary  cultures of the region, most notably that at Teotihuacan.  Kent Flannery is  one of THE names in the field of Middle American anthropology and  archaeology and the quality of the volume shows why.  I am less  knowledgeable about Ms Marcus, although the vita provided by the book  itself suggests an impressive intellectual treasure here as well.  I  enjoyed the volume enough to keep it to read another time.  A rare kudo,  believe me.	2000-07-04

The topic is probably not noted for its exciting appeal.  I did enjoy the new information that it provided.  The concept of an almost natural change from wild harvested to domesticated  cultigen by virtue of an interface of plant and human needs rather than by  conscious efforts on the part of the harvester was interesting.  It almost  made the process seem inevitable.  The information regarding wild plant  ancestors of modern domestics, the likely site of origin for and the path  of spread of these plants were also interesting.  For some reason I found  the domestication process of animals somewhat less so.  Overall I think the  book would be best used as a resource for information rather than an  afternoon read.	2000-07-04

He generously sent it to me, and I must say I enjoyed it.  This is probably more for the individual  interested in how historical research is done than for someone looking for  an indepth account of the lady's life.  Although it will give you a very  realistic assessment of her life and times in the two concluding chapters,  it gives a scholarly assessment of available primary resoureces as its  foundation before doing so.  And rightly so, since as the first chapter  makes abundantly clear, a lot of sentimental nonsense has been written  about the person of Hypatia on next to no basis at all.  More than anything  the character of Hypatia that is presented by these authors has been  designed to illustrate some point of importance or some axe to grind by  that individual author.  Her actual personality and life history become  secondary to those goals as she becomes the center of parable.	2000-06-30

I'd read this book some years ago, but found it difficult going at the time.  I decided to re-read it recently, as it was on the wish list of a friend which reminded me I still had the volume.  This time around I found  it much more interesting and more understandable.  There definitely seems  to be a time for everything, and apparently this was the time for Greek  Science for me.  What I found of particular interest was a new perspective  that I acheived in a novel way. I recently attended a Minneapolis  Childrens' Theater production featuring events from the life of Galileo.  It was pointed out in the playbill that what seems to us in retrospect a  patent persecution of a new concept by jealous intellectuals and religious  authorities was not quite so clear cut at the time.  In fact the scientific  thinkers of Galileo's time, as those of the Hellanistic Greek and Roman  times, labored with the technological inability to test the validity of  scientific observations.  Much that passed for science during those times  might be considered philosophy or metaphysics in our own.  Without the  means of externally testing opposing explanations of natural phenomenon  little of definitive worth could be said about any given observation.  It  then became a matter of philosophical orientation, of reputation and of  religious sanction.  It was in fact anybody's guess.  We who are used to  measuring equipment as simple as a thermometer and as complex as an earth  orbiting satelite often forget that these devices were not yet available to  the researchers of ancient or even medieaval times. Some of the simpler  devices were only just being introduced in Galileo's time and were  considered untested and highly suspect themselves.  Given that a number of  ingeneous inventions of early times were engineered with the specific  intent to mislead or impress the public, the scepticism with which  something like the telescope or the microscope were greeted is not  surprising.  To the early critic, one could not necessarily believe ones  eyes; it was better to believe what the Holy Book or a learned philosopher  had to say with respect to nature than what a &quot;conjurer&quot; might  say.  Greek Science After Aristotle makes this point apparent, explaning  that only in the area of mathematics and in applied physics (engineering,  especially military engineering) could anything like trustworthy precision  be achieved.  It also points out that though modern science values  observation and experiment, the neglect of these was not necessarily due to  a laziness or disregard for precision, but due to a lack of technological  means.  In fact, much was done and some very ingeneous devices to  accomplish it were invented to perform it.  The researchers of the times  had to be very innovative and original in their approach to problem  solving; something which we with our computerized devices are rarely called  upon to do a such basic levels.  Rereading the book from this perspective  definitely gave me a greater appreciation for the achievments of our  intellectual predecessors.rly critic, one could not necessarily believe ones  eyes; it was better to believe what the Holy Book or a learned philosopher  had to say with respect to nature than what a &quot;conjurer&quot; might  say.

Since I was also &quot;raised&quot; by a Siamese cat named Impy, and kept in line over my life time by a series of  his successors, I especially enjoy this series.  The author definitely has  an appreciation for the character of the breed.  This book is no exception.  The antics of KoKo are always a joy and remind me of one of my own early  pets, Mr Sin. This particular volume is especially fun as it partakes of  some of both of Quill's lives: that of down and out reporter from  &quot;Down Under&quot; and that of the recluse multimillionaire from  &quot;up North.&quot;  Since much of the description fits the Minneapolis  and Northern Minnesota area from which I come, I also feel a certain  resonance with the characters and their settting.  The story is an  elaborate one with a slightly macabre twist.  I actually figured it out  because I had a small bit of information from my own experience that helped  me do so, but I still found the book a satisfying read	2000-06-16

I particularly enjoy the display of equestian knowledge, because  I've taken dressage lessons in the past, and find it reinforces some of  what I learned.  I found the logic of the plot of this particular book just  slightly flawed, although I'm not certain that everyone will discover that  flaw or even that those who do will necessarily care.  I also found the  attempt to defend the reputation of Jefferson a little cloying at times.  Jefferson needs no defense; for one thing, he's dead (and therefore cannot  speak in his own defense), and for another he was a man of his times and  rose head and shoulders above many of those of his times with respect to  his moral character, productivity, contribution to mankind, intellectual  achievements, etc.  To try the past seems a wasted effort; better to make  certain the present lives up to it's ideals.  As usual the staple  characters of Croiset are a never failing delight.  I always enjoy spending  time with them.  They've become old friends, and I read these books as much  to &quot;visit&quot; with them as to solve the mystery.	2000-06-16

I have been a follower of the Cadfal character since first seeing one of the mysteries on the PBS series, which definitely  brought the entire time period vividly to life.  I am also a history buff,  and although my area of specialty is ancient history, I did study mideaval  as part of my program.  Family traditional also suggests that the title to  the Earldom of Chester was declined twice by recent ancestors (grandfather  and great grandfather) and so the references to the doings of the wiley and  untrustworthy Earl in the Cadfal series is enjoyable.  This volume is one  of my favorites, despite the fact that I already suspected the outcome well  before the end of the book.  The poignacy of the solution particularly  affecting.  The language and historical setting of the times, the social  mores and attitudes of the charcaters are all enjoyable, and the plot is  well woven.  The personality and personal history of the main  character--which are elaborated upon in this volume--are particularly  engaging.  Definitely worth reading on a quiet evening.	2000-06-16

The author is a master craftsman who can out-Christie Christie when it comes to plot twists that still  follow the &quot;rules,&quot; and this book was no exception.  I  particularly enjoyed it because it involves a bit of history--one of my  favorite persuits--and embroils the ailing Inspector in a mind game that  brings to resolution a crime committed decades before his birth.  A  consumate juggler of details, Dexter is a master at plausable solutions,  always providing at least two.  He delightfully misleads his inspector and  his readers with a trail of clues and interpretations that seem entirely  probable only to delight his followers with a &quot;true&quot; solution  which fits the facts with even greater plausibility.  My only complaint  with respect to the series is that I become impatient with Morse's  alchoholism and untreated depression.  As a nurse I keep wanting to urge  him to get proper treatment!  On the whole I find his seargeant a much more  balanced and satisfying character.	2000-06-16

I usually enjoy the &quot;who dunnit&quot; type of murder mystery that focuses on the puzzel of the murder rather than on the psychology of the individual characters.  The  Morse mysteries of Dexter are the closest thing I've come to this kind of  psychological mystery.  This work was presented on the PBS mystery series,  and I enjoyed the film so much I decided to read the book. The unusual  characters of the three women and the secret that holds them together--in  fact imprisons them together--are the major focus of the story.  That of  the two policemen interacting with them keeps the story moving forward and  the reader rivited to the action.  The tension among them almost makes one  forget that a murder has been committed and an investigation is underway!	2000-06-16

This is certainly one of those.  Marsh is a superb teller of tales, creating  colorful characters with a greater sense of depth and motivation than does  Christie, with whom she was contemporary.  She shares with Christie that  unfailable ability to devise an unusual end for the victim and a strict  adherence to the &quot;rules&quot; of genre--they don't cheat by some  manipulation of their plot to make it virtually impossible to find the  solution--something about which the writers of the Ellery Queen series, for  instance, were not always  scrupulous.  I find myself satisfied at the end  that I was truely fooled, not simply bamboozled, when I read Marsh, and  this book was no exception. I also find that I learn something from Marsh:  information about social attitudes--some of those expressed in the 30's  sounded very familiar--about the theater, about the world in general.  This  one was especially satisfying in that I had a small bit of arcane knowledge  at my disposal that helped me solve the mystery.  Instead of feeling the  solution was too easy, I could congratulate myself on being aware of  oddities and of having a broad background of experiences and knowledge.  For the reader who enjoys a &quot;vacation&quot; and a &quot;trip  abroad&quot; and into the past, this is certainly the book for you.  I  enjoyed my trip; &quot;book&quot; yours!	2000-06-16

Dr. Gould is a truely gifted writer with a wonderful wit and colorful style.  He has a broad range of interests and knowledge and an interesting circle of friends and collegues  upon whose wisdom he also draws (Astronomer Sagan, Geologists Press and  Siever, were among those with whose work I was familiar).  He also manages  to approach &quot;accepted&quot; theories from unusual directions,  sometimes with novel and provokative results!  The collection of essays  includes an interesting work on the effects of the personality of the  Captain of the Beagle on the formulation of Darwin's theories; a subject  that had certainly never occurred to me.  There is also an interesting  discussion of the human baby as an unfinished embryo, with interesting  implications for the upper limit on brain size and for human evolution as a  whole. The effect of size on intellectual potential of the brains of  different species, for instance ants vs humans, is the topic under  discussion in the Sizing up of Human Intelligence.  The interaction of  planetary size and surface area and the concommitant implications for  development of life is the subject of another article.  The effect of  social millieu on the development and acceptance of scientific theories is  also discussed as is the hindsight criticism of &quot;wrong&quot; theories  and their proponents.  Probably most interesting, and certainly most  urgently in need of repetition even now, is the tendency to use scientific  &quot;fact&quot; or verbal slight of hand to support social status quo or  even abuse by those with a political agenda.  Many of the essays could be  well used in high school classes to teach and encourage critical thinking  and novel approaches to what is commonly held as &quot;fact.&quot;  I would  not just recommend the book to you, I would encourage you to read it cover  to cover!	2000-06-15

I almost put it aside as I felt some of the first few pages were over my head, but I decided to look upon it as  stretching exercises for the mind, and managed to reach a tolerable  comprehension of the material.  Thereafter the book was both understandable  and thoroughly readible.  I found intriguing the philosophical implications  of quantum physics.  Particularly interesting was the author's discussion  of Popper and Eccles's concepts of the 3 worlds of reality: the world of  objects, of the human mind and of the products of the human mind.  The  implication of human consciousness in cetain physical interactions and the  possiblity that consciousness actually creates reality itself was the topic  of several pages.  The author also briefly touches upon artificial  intelligence, multiple-world hypothesis, the effect of size on expected  theoretical outcomes, and time and its direction.  It was a thoroughly  enjoyable book.	2000-05-21

I felt the author explained the topic clearly for those of us who do not routinely subscribe to physics or math journals.  For most of us, the  sciences are rather arcane subjects approached with caution if not down  right suspicion.  That's really too bad, especially for scientists.  They'd  probably get more financial support from those of us who feel like  outsiders if we better understood something of their fields. Certainly  Feynman and Sagan were brilliant at putting this across in their time.  If  those who would pooh-pooh this or any other book like it would have the  rest of us better educated in the topics dear to their heart, it might  behove them to direct us to better ones.	2000-05-10

Like most of his work, Sagan puts across the sciences and professions of astronomy and astrophysics across for the lay reader with great ability and an obvious feeling for his subject and his readers.  I enjoyed the humanness of his characters, the realities of their work world, and the  science in which they were involved.  I read the book before watching the  video and felt, as I usually do, that the book was better.  One can always  create more side plots and develop to a greater extent the individual  characters in a volume of so many pages, which the reader can set aside at  will and return to as needed.  The director must stick to a central theme  and be constantly mindful of budgetary constraints.  I also thought the  relationship of the heroine with her father was more intense and surprising  in the book than in the movie.	2000-05-10

She certainly seems erudite, whether it is through formal education or being impressively well read and enviably associated is hard to tell.  The information, however, is sometimes buried in flowery, almost poetic rhetoric, which if you enjoy  reading or are especially sensitive to the topic of sex might not bother  you.

Books	5	6	6	N	Y	Extinction	This is a delightfully well written book on the phenomenon of extinction, from the background rates of species death to the massive die-offs of the KT and other major extinction events.  The author approaches the subject from a statistical/probabilities standpoint, looking at extinction as a  continuum which is characterised, as he notes, by &quot;long periods of  boredom interrupted occasionally by panic.&quot;  He introduces the concept  of Gambler's Ruin, which makes his thesis understandable even to the  statistically challenged like myself.  The sense of humor with which he  injects his work makes a complex subject entirely enjoyable.	2000-04-24

But I usually get  stuck in reading jags, and sex has been the topic lately.  This was one of  the more obvious books to take up under the circumstances, and I must say,  I wish I'd read it earlier.  I certainly found myself and some of my  relationships among the pages.  I found the information very helpful in  clearing up some of the causes of failed romances in the past.

The author thoroughly discusses the pertinent sources, their provinence, accuracy, contemporanety, and biases.  Using a variety of these  sources he paints a very clear and interesting portrait of both MacBeth and  to some extent his queen, for whom there is even scanter evidence.  Thereafter Aitchison follows the development of the myths of MacBeth, two  of which began in the king's lifetime or shortly thereafter.  Because  Shakespeare's MacBeth is one of the threads of this mythologizing  tradition, he also discusses the manner in which Shakespeare changed the  story and for what purposes.  Probably the most important aspect of this  book is the fact that the author is able to give a balance account of  MacBeth.  He neither indulges in the condemnation of some authors or the  almost unrealistic praise of the appologists, both of whose efforts he  evaluates as part of his study of the effects of the myth on modern times.  Of considerable interest is the discussion of modern cinimatic recreations  of MacBeth, including my favorite, the Japanese version Throne of Blood.	2000-04-18

It also makes apparent that other simpler  organisms are in a more anomolous position, dividing indefinately into  separate organisms, making the original cell virtually immortal.  One  interesting example of cellular immortality is the on going life of  cancerous tissue preserved in a culture medium for decades after the death  of the person from whom it was removed.  The ambiguous concept of death is  also discussed as our society grows more technologically able to prolong  the dying process without acheiving a guality of life for that individual.  The ethical issues that have arisen are discussed thoroughly not only from  the perspective of death in the United States, but from that of other  countries with other cultures and legal standards regarding the dying.  An  excellant book on a difficult subject.	2000-04-18

So many theories of the KT extinctions have been forwarded by scientist and lay person alike that it is almost refreshing to have it come down to the confrontation between two, or a few, major theories, in this case the  &quot;impactist&quot; and &quot;volcanist&quot; theories.  Frankel does a  fine job of presenting a balanced and fair account of the contenting  theories, particularly Courtillot's Deccan Traps volcanism (for which see  Evolutionary Catastrophies or my review of it) and their supporting data.  He is, however, thoroughly in the impactist camp.  He gives an excellent  description of the astroid and of how scientists were able to work out its  size, the size of its crater, and its subsequent atmospheric and  environmental effects.  This is probably the best of the three books (T.  Rex and the Crater of Doom, Evolutionary Catastrophies, and End of the  Dinosaurs) I've recently read on the subject, although all three are worth  reading.	2000-04-11

Probably no single mass extinction of the five known to have occurred has captured popular notice so thoroughly as has the KT event.  Ideas about what might have caused this disaster, which may have brought about the end  of the dinosaurs, abound and range from change in the oxygen content of the  atmosphere to astroid impacts.  Mr. Courtillot, a French investigator of  the Deccan Traps in India and China, has been the leading proponent of the  volcanic-climatic disaster motif. In this book he defends his hypothesis,  primarily against its leading opponent the Alvarez' astroidal impact  theory, and believes that the evidence from the field more completely  supports his theory of the cause of extinctions, not only at the KT  boundary but through most of life's history.  The volume is somewhat less  readable than the Alvarez book (see T. Rex and the Crater of Doom or the  review of it under my name), because it contains more technical  information.  The author defines many of his terms for the lay reader, but  the discussion is definitely more understandable for the reader with some  knowledge of geology in his/her background.	2000-04-11

Rex:  KT boundary once again	Probably the most investigated mass extinction of the five major events known to have occurred has been the KT boundary event.  This is probably because the dinosaur, especially T. Rex--as notice how much the dino named  Sue fetched at auction--has captured the popular imagination more than any  other animal.  It was also the demise of these animals that openned up a  world of opportunity for mammals, among which our own species is numbered.  We therefore have a vested interest in, a sense of ownership of that  catastrophic event as of no other.  The notion of an astroid impact as the  bringer of the end to the &quot;terrible lizards&quot; is also almost  Biblical in proportion.  It grabs the imagination.  Certainly it has  grabbed the media, as several TV programs and at least two movies about  astroid impacts have been produced since the introduction of the theory  advanced by the Alvarez, father and son.  This book is a well written  account by Walter Alvarez of the discovery of the clues to that event, of  the gradual developement of the theory by many contributors, and of the  defense of the theory before the scientific community.  In fact the book is  a good demonstration of the rigour with which new theories are challenged  and defended and of the scientific process itself.  It is also a landmark  episode of the multidisciplinary approach to research and the growing  dialogue between scientists from different fields.  (For an opposing  theory, also in itself compelling, see Evolution Catastrophies by  Courtillot, or click on my name for my review of it.  For a more thorough  account of the prevailing theories of the KT and other extinctions see End  of the Dinosaurs by Frankel or the review of it under my name).	2000-04-10

For most of us the very word &quot;Atlantis&quot; conjures up the image of an ultra futuristic civilization fated to destroy itself and sink into the ocean.  Sort of the Hollywood version.  Certainly it is this version that  inspires so many New Age thinkers to look for its remains throughout the  world.  A geologist would tell them that continents can't sink; they can be  transgressed (by elevated sea levels) or depressed (by glaciers) but the  density gradients among continental granites, oceanic basalts and the  materials of the mantal prevent continents from sinking.  For the historian  working with Plato's tale, it represents a mystery. Mr. Castleden has  followed the leads in this mystery and ultimately identified the island of  Thera, modern Santorini, as the most likely candidate for the original  inspiration for Plato's tale.  Sometime during the 1500s BC (or according  to others the 1700s BC) the volcano on this island is known to have  collapsed causing an eruption that has been estimated by some to have been  100 times more violent than that on Krakatoa during the 19th Century AD.  The civilization that was buried when much of the island was destroyed was  quite advanced for the time.  Although much of the data Castleden has  amassed supports this identification, his ultimate thesis is that the story  was reworked by Plato for his own purposes.  Though it may have been a  tale known to him from other sources, it became in Plato's hands, a  parable.  Castleden believes that Atlantis became a paradigm for the cities  of Sicily and Athens during Plato's time.  The book is an interesting and  thorough treatment of the subject but can be tough going at times.  I put  it down several times before I really got into it enough to finish it--and  kept checking to see how many pages were left to go!	2000-04-08

Thereafter each chapter is deducated to a specific site, its architecture,  the written material illuminating its history, and its public  personalities.  Ms Schele's book brings to life the ancient people, making  them more real to the reader.  It, like &quot;Lords of Tikal&quot; by Peter  Harrison (for which see my review list by clicking on my name or go to the  book itself), helps the reader appreaciate the accomplishments of this  society and of the researchers who have reclaimed it.	2000-04-08

The final chapters also deal with the turbulent relationship between Heinrich  Schliemann, the individual most often associated with that discovery, and  the Calverts.  It is a story of a passion for the Homeric epics and of the  struggle for priority in finding the site of the famous battle.  Frank  Calvert, in particular, is depicted as the unfortunate victim of the  machinations of the ambitious and apparently unscrupulous German  entrepreneur.  (The family photo of the man, seated on his doorstep, looks  like a study in defeat).  Indeed there has been recent doubt expressed by  members of the present day archaeological community regarding the  genuineness of some of Schliemann's most famous discoveries.  Most  importantly the golden treasure trouve traditionally accepted as having  been found at Troy has come under question, including its true provenance,  authenticity, and the circumstances of its discovery.  So too has the  so-called mask of Agamemnon, which some would suggest is an artifact  altered to look more like what popular imagination has come to associate  with the Homeric heroes.  Still others believe that the mask may be the  work of a modern artist commissioned by Schliemann to produce an  &quot;artifact&quot; worthy of his hero.  Ms Allen concludes her work with  the story of the fate of the artworks from Troy, including their post WWII  disappearence, recent reappearence in Russia, and the international dispute  over their ownership and the ethical issue of right to cultural heritage.  This is a book which is understandable whether or not one knows anything  about archaeology, history, or the events of the discovery.	2000-04-08

When I was working on my MA in history in the 1970s, I could locate few good  texts on the subject, and most of those were in French.  The advances in  reading the Hittite texts have done much to fill in many of the gaps in  their history over the past 3 decades, a good reason to keep current even  in a subject that one feels one already knows.  In Bryce's book the  personalities of the Hittite kings are more defined and their  accomplishments better documented.  I found especially interesting the  correspondence between Tutankhamon's widowed queen, Ankhesenamon, and the  great Hittite king Suppiluliuma, documents that contribute to the  understanding of the final years of the XVIII Dynasty in Egypt.	2000-04-08

This was a superbly written volume outlining the archaeological reclaimation of the battlefield site of the Little Big Horn.  A military archeologist (Scott), a forensic archeologist (Conner), and a forensics  anthropologist (Willey) combined talents to preserve and identify the  material evidence of the events that took place there after a wildfire  stripped the scene of vegitation and exposed the site to erosive processes  and human curiosity.  The book details: 1) the history of the 7th Cavalry,  including among other things, the age of the soldiers, their origin, and  length of service, 2) the efforts to identify individual soldiers and the  location of their fall in battle, 3) the effect of the rigorous life on the  frontier on the health of the soldiers, 4) etc.  I found particularly  interesting the efforts to reconstruct the facial features of some of the  skulls in an effort to identify the remains with specific people.

For most of us who grew up with the Cosmos series and Carl Sagan's friendly, conversational style of introducing science to the average person, this book will probably strike a positive and familiar chord.  Feynman was for the 60's in some ways what Sagan was to the 70's and 80's  audience, a man who believe that science could only thrive in an  environment where the average person understood it at least enough to know  what it could and could not accomplish.  This little volume is a collection  of lectures delivered in the 1960s on: 1) the nature of scientific thinking  and methods, 2) the effect of science on politics, religion and moral  values, and 3) scientific and unscientific approaches to problem solving.  The text is very readable and gives a good sense of the wit, good humor,  and analytical focus of the author.

This is a superbly written book, capturing the drama behind the discovery of the concept of the Ice Age.  Bolles tells the story from the perspective of three different 19th century investigators: Kane, a gentleman  adventurer, Lyell, one of the founders of modern geology, and Agassiz, one  of the world's greatest naturalists.  Using what is almost like a diarist  method to tell the tale, the author interweaves the points of view of all  three individuals taking the reader through the stages of the theory's  conception and gestation.  It seems amazing that what seems so abundantly  apparent to modern students of earth history is blindly missed by many very  astute 19th Century scientists.  Furthermore, when a clear arguement with  supporting data is resisted, it seems almost a willful desire to deny the  existance of an Ice Age.  Indeed such it may have been, as this was an era  when strongly held religious beliefs, which had shaped much of the thinking  up to that time, were beginning to crumble.  In Ice Finders Bolles expertly  creates an exciting and informative history of one of the intellectual  adventures of science.	2000-04-01

In general it covers the growth of cooperation from a genetic probabilities perspective.  It is a sort of &quot;cost accounting&quot; of cooperation to  the participants, whether related individuals in a &quot;family&quot; or  only very distantly related individuals in a societal group.

The book is not a romantic, detailed description of the queen and her life and times; it covers the artistic and  epigraphic data dealing with the Amarna period, a particularly complex and  confusing time in Egypt's history.  The personalities of the period first  came to public awareness during the 1920s, when the famous bust of the  queen was put on display, and since that time a number of speculative  theories have enjoyed a vogue among experts and amateur enthusiasts.  Ms  Tyldesley covers the history of these theories, the data supporting or  refuting them, and poses some of her own.  (Some of these I first came  across in Week's &quot;The Lost Tomb,&quot; where he introduces the  concept--borrowed from Ms Tyldesley and others--that some of the novelties  of the Armarna court were actually in evidence during the reign of the  preceeding monarch, Amenhotep III, and were simply driven to extremes under  Akhenaten).  Ms Tyledesley also makes it quite evident than much of the  evidence that might have gone far to clearing up some of the confusion in  the reigns of the Armarna monarchs has been lost to the vandalism, theft  and neglect of centuries.  Although she goes far in creating a profile of  the queen and her contemporaries, I think that the reader will still come  away with a feeling that the only certain thing about the period is its  continued mystery.	2000-03-29

The book is, however, quite thorough and uses an interesting approach to the subjects of political and social  development in the early Greek world, focusing on the archaeology of  specific type sites.  Since much of what emerged during this critical  period in European history has an impact still felt, however unconsciously,  on modern society, the book is an important one.  It might even be useful  as part of a syllabus for selected courses in political science.	2000-03-26

For someone just learning about the subject, it would be a good book to start with as it is heavily illustrated, covers the  history of and personalities involved in the study of these early stone  structures, and includes a very nice bibliography of the subject.  The  latter includes several, in fact mostly, books and articles in French which  would require at least a reading knowledge of that language, although this  volume is itself in English.	2000-03-26

It does for part of the Mayan world what much of the early work by epigraphers did for that of ancient Egypt in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries. The translation and interpretation of  Mayan hieroglyphics is a recent phenomenon, occurring only within the last  three decades.  Through the efforts of dedicated researchers like Dr.  Harrison, who excavated at the site of Tikal, and the late Linda Schele,  who worked on Mayan hieroglyphics, a synthesis of the epigraphic material  is only just beginning to reveal the story and characters of the Maya world  for the enjoyment of the armchair enthusiast like myself.  This work is  definitely an illustration of what is likely to come from the fieldwork in  the future.	2000-03-26

It is well written and easily read and gives a good  overview of the discipline with interesting archaeological sites from all  over the world used to illustrate the techniques discussed.  I enjoyed the  volume so thoroughly I've actually read it twice and will probably read it  again in the future just for the enjoyment alone.	2000-03-26

It fails for one thing, at least within the written text itself, to give proper attention to  the extreme diversity of that population.  This is in large part due to the  fact that the starting point of the work is the North American collections  of the British Museum, which are necessarily finite and somewhat random,  having more to do with the whims of the early collectors than to the  conscious choices of curators, especially in the case of the earliest  material.  The photo illustrations of this collection, however, are worth  the price of the book.  Some of the artwork is priceless and irreplaceable.  Of interest too is the material on modern Native American artists still  working within the cultural contexts, media and traditions of their  ancestors.	2000-03-26

Although parts of the work are probably a little too technical for the non-professional, they may be much too general for the expert--ie.  the transition from the non-living chemical replicators to living  organisms.  This means both types of reader will probably be left  dissatisfied.  Topics included are a definition of what is  &quot;alive,&quot;  where life might have evolved if not on earth itself,  the increasing complexity of living things, etc, all subjects really too  great to be covered adequately in so small a space even for the  nontechnical reader. In general there are probably better written books on  these topics.	2000-03-26

It tends to bounce from biographical information on the author to accounts of workers and their lives to actual discussions of the  excavation of KV5, sometimes within the same chapter.  Some of the  descriptions of the excavation were painfully detailed--to the centimeter  of debris removed--and might not necessarily be of interest to the average  nonprofessional for whom the book is probably intended.  The final chapters  were mostly a compendium of data and professional opinions (with heavy  emphasis on the latter) regarding late 18th and early 19th dynasty kings  and queens and what they might share in common. Most interesting to me was  the information regarding some of Ramesses' sons, though very little is  known of most of them.	2000-03-15

It certainly covered a lot of territory; including computor technology, evolution, art, scientific thinking, society and socialization, etc.  Mr. Pinker was able to take even a comparative novice through his arguments regarding human and artificial intelligence,  primarily by showing the complexity of the task of creating the  &quot;awareness&quot; of human intelligence in the latter (or even of the  advisability of it).  He also gave a lucid account of why humans think as  they do--that is, not always as the scientist might advise--and how this  might have arisen evolutionarily.  It is not a book to be read quickly,  however, especially by the nonprofessional, as it is densely packed with  information and requires (and deserves) time to consider it all.	2000-03-15

The progress of the tradition of Quetzalcoatl from its ancient roots at Teotihuacan and Tula to the historic Aztec period and from one part of  Central America to another was very interesting, but the information was  often presented in a repetative way.  It was almost as though the work had  started originally as a series of journal articles or research papers  presented at conferences on Mesoamerican mythology all woven together to  produce a book length product.  The chapter on comparative literature and  the evolution of creation myths in different cultures world wide was  certainly interesting, but not necessarily original or even germaine to the  title subject.	2000-03-12

Written by the primary researcher at Tiahuanaco, Alan Kolata, the text covers the origin of the earliest  pre-Inca highland civilization, the Ayamara.  So impressive was the legacy  of this people to their successors that the Inca themselves sought to  legitimize their claim to empire by seeking to place their roots at this  site.  I found Kolata's successful test of his economic hypothesis  regarding population density and farming methods (by the reintroduction of  raised bed and canal farming at altitude) especially profound.  It  certainly made abundantly apparent the pertinance of modern day  archaeology, not only to the preservation of the world's ancient  inheritance but to the material well being of modern populations as well.  This book is a good place to start for anyone with an interest in ancient  South American cultures and to applied archaeology.	2000-03-12

Once into chapter three, however, I found it quite readable and very informative.  Still, I suspect the volume will appeal most to  those with at least some background in health care, as it's written by a  retired MD.	2000-03-12

I'd not come across a similar general text on the subject before this one, although I've read some of the data as passing references in other books on  prehistory.  Some of the discussion on the flint technology was a little  slow-going because the differences in technique, stone sources, and styles  among the various periods and regions were less apparent and less  engrossing to me than they obviously are to the authors.  In other respects  the book is an excellant starting point for anyone with an interest in  Austrilia or in prehistoric culture in general.	2000-03-12

The author gives an almost more-than-you-wanted-to-know account of the history of the theory of  evolution and the various personalities involved with shaping it since  Darwin first introduced the concept.  It's definitely for the died-in-wool  devotee only.	2000-03-12

Most texts on the field are somewhat more pedantic.  Mr.  Kunzig's approach is one of personalizing the subject by introducing the  reader to the people behind the it.  He gives the reader a greater feeling  for the excitement and enthusiasm that such individuals bring to their  field of study.  I would recommend it to anyone with at least some  knowledge of oceanography who is interested in knowing more of the  individuals who have contributed to it.	2000-03-12

A little old (c. 1992), it is still a very readable and comprehensive text on the paleontology of dinosarus.  The author covers  recent findings regarding dinosaur skeletal structure and what it tells of  lifestyle, their modes of locomotion and what it implies of  thermoregulation, etc.  The book would definitely be a valuable first line  undergraduate textbook on the subject and on paleontology as a field of  research.  It also might interest an enthusiastic younger student even to  the level of junior high as long as he or she was a reader with a  sophisticated vocabulary or one with some knowledge of the discipline  already.	2000-03-12

It would be an especially good book for the interested nonprofessional to  learn about these subjects or for a high school teacher wishing to teach  earth history/geology without boring the student.  The book is however  slightly too derivative and therefore somewhat frustrating for anyone who  has any kind of college background in these fields.  What is new here and  of interest to any reader is the use of the &quot;known,&quot; life on  earth, to predict the liklihood of the &quot;unknown,&quot; life in the  galaxy and the universe.  After reading Sagan's &quot;Cosmos&quot; in the  '70s with interest and enthusiasm and following the SETI investigation over  the interum, I found the appearance of an opposing view refreshing and long  overdue.  It certainly provided a nice counterbalance to the almost overly  optimistic notion that the universe is teaming with life--by which most of  us mean intelligent life.  Sagan and others who first proposed the  abundance of life in the universe did so on the basis of guess-timate  statistics that did not have the advantage of the more recent information  on extremophiles or on existance of other planets.  This book provides an  overview of this new information and its impact on our ideas about life  throughout the universe.	2000-03-04

Almost anyone with an interest in geology, geography, anthropology, ancient and recent  history, political science or ethnography will find this book of interest  in some aspect.  Personally I enjoyed the first half of the volume more  than the last half, as the later chapters are a depressing compendium of  the inhumanity of mankind to its brethern.  The unfortunate effects of  foreign involvement in African affairs has a long history, and Mr. Reader  dealt with the subject fully and fairly; nor did he entirely absolve native  African involvement in the down fall of some of its own cultures.  The  author seems to have a feel for the complexity of the events that occurred  through time and of the reprocussions--the almost dominoe effect--of  actions and decisions made, often times outside of Continental Africa  itself.  (A case of 20-20 hindsight, perhaps).  In all a very readable book  for anyone desiring a broad overview of Africa.	2000-02-20
