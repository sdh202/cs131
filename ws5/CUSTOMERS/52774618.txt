He's advertised for a live-in nurse so he can bring his father home to die, but so far he's had no luck. As he talks it's easy to see why. He's a man too used to his own unwanted company. He's abrupt and blunt, with no social skills.<br /><br />As he talked, \\"He looked around his house at the piles of clutter and filthy dishes....When he hung up, he looked at the mess again, seeing it in a different light, now that someone was actually coming.\\" He worked for three days clearing \\"decades\\" of accumulation, but it wasn't until the prospective nurse arrived that he realized he hadn't cleaned.<br /><br />\\"The house wasn't cluttered now; it was sparse. He'd purged it of trash and memories alike, as if there was no distinction. But he hadn't scrubbed anything. And now, as she approached, he saw the dust, the grit, the coating of neglect on everything.\\"<br /><br />But Mattie Holden, a city girl from Spokane in her mid-30s, takes the job, and moves in immediately. Too relieved to question his luck, Chas quickly moves his father home and Mattie settles in to a lot more of the cleaning and cooking than she'd planned on. Chas' father is helpless and unresponsive, in the last stages of Parkinson's.<br /><br />But there's an aura of strength about him, a presence that grows increasingly ominous. \\"He just seems bigger than he is,\\" Mattie tells Chas. \\"When I turn my head I have this sense that he's enormous. It sounds crazy.\\"<br /><br />Chas, grudgingly attempting to co-exist, tells her how his father once killed a bobcat with his own hands. \\"Illness can't diminish a man like that.\\" Slowly, haltingly, Chas reveals more.  His mother ran away when he was 10; his big, powerful sheep-ranching father was a preacher with rigid, unforgiving standards. Chas himself is gruff and hard drinking, but thinks of himself as a man who didn't live up to anyone's standards, even his own.<br /><br />Chas is a complex character, a man who looks just like his father but has none of the old man's rigidity. It doesn't take him long to realize Mattie has secrets, but he doesn't pry. When a valued customer, the only Muslim family in town, can't afford to buy the traditional lamb before Eid, Chas leaves one tethered to their porch and then denies having done so. He refuses to sign a petition banning Christmas trappings from the local school because, he says, it will only give bigots an excuse to lash out at the non-Christians.<br /><br />A few days later the Muslim family's house is torched and Chas is accused of the crime. The sheriff, an outsider, assumes there must be something to it if everyone in town is convinced Chas is guilty.<br /><br />Meanwhile Mattie is having more and more trouble sleeping, convinced Chas' father is haunting her, that he sees into the deepest recesses of her soul and her less than proud past. And maybe there's something to that. Most of Sweetwater thinks he has uncanny powers and hates him for it too, willing to visit all the old man's unforgiving destruction on the son.<br /><br />The town's near-universal willingness to come together in hatred would seem far-fetched if it didn't happen so often in real life. Sharfeddin does a good job of portraying small town insularity and mutual reinforcement and builds the novel to a complex, layered conclusion.<br /><br />Described in the jacket copy as a \\"contemporary Western,\\" \\"Blackbelly\\" has all the elements: the whisky-drinking, principled, misunderstood loner; the troubled, secretive woman who draws him out, and the evil of lesser men, which threatens to destroy his life. But Sharfeddin's treatment of these elements makes them real, with shades of ambiguity throughout, conflicts not easily settledand no simple resolution. A bit battered by life, Mattie and Chas have learned from their mistakes and flaws (Chas more than Mattie), but not overcome them.<br /><br />Sharfeddin, a sheep rancher herself, fleshes out the feel and smell of a sheep ranch.  The book's title comes from a special breed of sheep, which the reader learns a fair amount about in the course of the novel, and the rhythm of the work (it's lambing time) creates a structured flow. An impressive first novel from a writer to watch.icts not easily settled and no simple resolution.

Who will I be if I give it up?\\"  Jacobson sought out almost 300 Jewish holocaust survivors. Facing persecution and death, some had concealed their Jewishness, some embraced it, some only discovered it when it was thrust upon them by the Nazis.<br /><br />From tape-recorded interviews Jacobson chose 15 life stories and organized them into five categories, the three already mentioned and two more - those of mixed origin whose non-Jewish side protected them from some persecution, and young children whose Jewish identity was concealed from them during the war.<br /><br />For those who concealed their Jewishness, the issue was straightforward. Romulus Berliner, a Transylvanian, joined the SS when the opportunity presented itself after his escape from a forced-labor camp. He never forgot who he was although he tried. \\"You have to switch yourself off,\\" he said, believing that Germany would win the war and \\"Jewry will no longer exist.\\" He imagined a life in hiding, deep in Russia, where he wouldn't be \\"taken prisoner for not being who I was supposed to be.\\" When it became clear Germany would lose, he cast off his assumed identity and \\"out of joy\\" proclaimed his Jewishness to the officer he served - who got up and never spoke to him again.<br /><br />Hilda Dujardin, half-Jewish, married to an Aryan, joined the Jewish community when it became dangerous to do so. She ended up in a concentration camp but her account is full of the small acts of bravery and compassion committed by people around her and her own sometimes irrational acts of defiance - refusing to vacate the path of an SS horseman, for instance - which led to condemnation from frightened Jews who hoped to stay alive by attracting no notice.<br /><br />The young experienced the most confusion. Ariel Levy's mother was arrested in 1942 when he was 8 years old. \\"When she disappeared I somehow knew: 'I'm in the nightmare.' \\" He spent the war shunted from family to family and joined a Hitler youth group. \\"I had to become something else completely and to repress that part of me which was Jewish so deeply that I wouldn't be bothered all the time thinking about the duality....When you are in the nightmare, you are no longer troubled by things changing.\\" After the war he went \\"to save Israel,\\" but was soon disillusioned by the hard work and the rigid system, though he kept the Hebraicized version of his name.<br /><br />Jacobson's focus on identity offers a different perspective, but however intellectual the approach, sheer survival becomes the riveting force in any holocaust account. Luck, the occasional act of bravery or craven betrayal capture the reader's attention more completely than any questions of identity.d joined a Hitler youth group. \\"I had to become something else completely and to repress that part of me which was Jewish so deeply that I wouldn't be bothered all the time thinking about the duality....When you are in the nightmare, you are no longer troubled by things changing.\\" After the war he went \\"to save Israel,\\" but was soon disillusioned by the hard work and the rigid system, though he kept the Hebraicized version of his name. <br /> <br />Jacobson's focus on identity offers a different perspective, but however intellectual the approach, sheer survival becomes the riveting force in any holocaust account.

Two-thirds of the world's biodiversity, according to Baskin (and her footnoted sources) lives underground, \\"the most diverse and abundant web of life known in the universe.\\"<br /><br />Baskin introduces us to a few of these creatures - nematodes earthworms, slime molds, fungi, water bears - and takes us to frozen tundra, wetlands, forests and seabeds where they live.<br /><br />And she introduces us to the people who study them. People like the Wormherders of Antarctica who study nematodes (tiny worms), the most abundant animal on the planet. They study them in Antarctica because it's the one place in the world where if you change something in the soil, or remove one species, you can see the effect. Antarctica is the only place on earth where you can pick up a handful of soil and possibly not find nematodes.<br /><br />Cindy Hale studies earthworms in the forests of Minnesota - a place where there aren't supposed to be any earthworms. Marine biologist Melanie Austen measures nutrient recycling on the ocean floor and the effect of fishing draggers on the tiny living recyclers. And Renata Outerbridge and Tony Trofymow show how selective tree cutting can help the loggers as well as the forest.<br /><br />The creatures themselves are fascinating, not least because of the intricacy and complexity of their interaction with their crowded environment. Like the symbiotic relationship of fungi and tree roots, which involves antibiotics and decay as well as nutrient sharing, and without which, in a sever clear-cut, for instance, trees can never thrive.<br /><br />These creatures are also stranger than anything we see above ground. Nematodes have a gene structure which seems to fit them for survival anywhere on earth and when conditions are inhospitable they dry themselves out and go dormant, for decades if need be. No one has yet determined the upper level of a nematode's ability to revive from a dehydrated state.<br /><br />Earthworms, hermaphrodites the world over (many capable of self-fertilizing), are not always the \\"beneficial\\" creatures we think them. It wasn't until 1995 that scientists discovered earthworms are not native to forests and don't belong there. There are no native worms in the upper US and exotics, long beloved of gardeners, are disrupting the \\"thrifty\\" nutrient recycling of forests.<br /><br />Baskin (\\"A Plague of Rats and Rubbervines: The Growing Threat of Species Invasions\\") accompanies each of these scientists (and more) on their rounds, showing us their work and enthusiasm as well as explaining the ecology involved as human acts start unseen chain reactions. Her writing is fair and balanced, pointing out the unknown and documenting her research with copious notes at the end of the book.

An icky, but essentially boring fact of life (like sewage, which also comes into the discussion). True, it is a guilt-inducing environmental hazard we ordinary mortals can't do much about, but there are all sorts of people out there for whom your detritus is a livelihood, a challenge, a crusade or all three.<br /><br />And Elizabeth Royte's lively, anecdotal adventure on the trail of trash introduces us to many of them, from the two sanitary workers who personally shift 20,000 pounds in the four hours she accompanies them, to the head of San Francisco's recycling program who manages to divert 95 percent of his household trash from the landfill in headlong pursuit of Zero Waste.<br /><br />Royte frames the story around her own household trash in Brooklyn, NY. For a year she weighs and sorts it, taking notes on its contents. She wants to know where it goes when it leaves her. Her first foray with a \\"san man\\" (New York has one female garbage collector) team is an eye opener.<br /><br />\\"The men seemed dour and angry to me and I was afraid to ask them questions. On foot, I watched and I followed. Soon I realized they seemed sour only because they were concentrating. In constant motion, lifting heavy barrels, they could get hurt if they didn't pay attention. Metal cans banged against their legs; trailer hitches poked from high SUV bumpers. Drivers honked, urging the men to hustle it up, to get their truck out of their way. Double-parked delivery vans blocked their progress. There was also a surprising amount of dog [dirt] near the garbage cans and many plastic bags were shiny with urine. Had I never noticed this before?\\"<br /><br />Garbage collection, it turns out, is three times more likely to get you killed than being a fireman or a policeman.<br /><br />A couple of transfer stations later (from which most of NYC's garbage heads to other states) Royte is ready for a real landfill. Although now closed, \\"the Fresh Kills Sanitary Landfill was the K2 of trash heaps, and I was determined to make an assault on its closed and forbidden slopes.\\" Unable to get in, she explores the evolution of landfills in grisly detail, makes a canoe foray around the place through a successful salt marsh restoration, describes state-of-the-art dump technology and its various oozing, leaching failures, and then fails to get into a lesser Pennsylvania dump -the final resting place of her own actual trash.<br /><br />People who handle large amounts of our trash, Royte discovers again and again, are more than a little secretive. \\" `This isn't goods they're transferring from place to place,' \\" she's told, \\" `This is bads.' \\"<br /><br />Amusing and adroit as Royte is, landfill descriptions lose their savor after an unsurprisingly short time, but she moves on to incinerators, waste-to-energy incinerators, sewage and sludge fertilizer and myriad forms of recycling. Not a one of them is a winner in the fight against expense, pollution and energy consumption.<br /><br />Waste to energy plants seem like a dream come true. Burn garbage and furnish energy. But the plants are very expensive and the toxins they produce - both airborne and ash - contain things like dioxins, mercury, lead and sulphuric acid, to name a few.<br /><br />Recycling efforts teem with politics, psychology and futility. Some environmentalists are avid recyclers; others object to recycling as a panacea that soothes the guilt of the average householder, making us feel like we're doing our bit, and takes the heat off manufacturers who should be held ultimately responsible for the things (especially the packaging) they produce. Yes, recycling can save trees, but recycling uses energy and produces toxins. Plastic recycling is particularly problematic.<br /><br />And, to put things in perspective, 98 percent of all trash is pre-consumer. Industrial. But Royte, who would clearly like to reduce her own garbage \\"footprint,\\" weighs it all, keeps her sense of humor, and arrives at a balance.

You can't step into your backyard without treading on interlopers, like the favored Kentucky bluegrass.<br /><br />From the hallucinogenic properties of hemp, morning glory, datura and more; to attempts to cultivate the silkworm; to rats, cockroaches and disease, Leland's essays offer an entertaining history of facts, rumors and squabbles on an exhaustive number of alien species. Whether purposely (often to rid the place of some other unwanted interloper) or accidentally introduced, aliens have long thrived in their new home and many have come to be considered natives.<br /><br />A professor of English at the Virginia Military Institute, Leland (\\"Porcher's Creek: Lives Between the Tides\\") writes with wit and a certain wicked relish, and his research is dizzyingly thorough. But the sheer width and breadth of information is overwhelming. This is a book to keep, to dip into again and again a chapter or even a few pages at a time, so as to have some hope of retention.<br /><br />With chapter titles like \\"Out of Africa,\\" \\"Cowboys: And Their Alien Habits,\\" \\"It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time,\\" and \\"Bioterror: Older than You Think,\\" Leland makes an appreciative and entertaining case for the melting pot.	2005-10-10

She was a precocious seven when her parents announced they were moving from Los Angeles to backwater Ahmednagar.<br /><br />It was there that the guru they had been devoted to since their drugged-out Berkeley college days, Meher Baba (who Brown credits with the saying, \\"Don't worry, be happy), had established an ashram. \\"Its residents usually explained where it was by saying, `Get on a train in Bombay, and go east for nine hours.' \\"<br /><br />From the start, Brown was appalled. \\"I didn't care about Baba....But I knew there was nothing I could do. There was already an envelope in Dad's dresser drawer containing three one-way tickets to India.\\" Over the next five years a deep component of sheer misery would be added to that feeling of shock and helplessness.<br /><br />She opens the book with an account of one of their rare vacations. The ashram \\"was located in what I had previously thought of as the most desolate place in India. But the expanse of brown-baked weeds about a hundred miles west of Ahmednagar was giving it some serious competition.\\"<br /><br />Stranded, Brown reads a fantasy novel while her parents squabble about whose fault it is there is no train to their mountain hotel.<br /><br />\\"The novel's heroine, Harry, was a foreign girl who gets kidnapped by desert nomads and learns to ride bareback and do magic.<br /><br />\\"Certainly I could identify with the `kidnapped and taken to a foreign desert' part, though I wished I were enjoying my experience as much as Harry was enjoying hers. I also wished three of her magnificent desert steeds would appear, so we could ride them up the mountain.<br /><br />\\"Mom poked me. `Don't just sit there with your nose in a book. Pray with me.'<br /><br />\\"On second thought, perhaps only one steed.\\"<br /><br />This pretty much sums up the family dynamic. Brown spent as much time as possible buried in a book, while her mother's response to everything was to chant, \\"Baba, Baba, Baba,\\" and her father kept clear of the fray as much as possible.<br /><br />Even the escape into books was made difficult. The ashram librarian was an unkempt, irascible Indian who took immediate exception to the compound's only child snooping around his tiny, dusty domain and began screaming at her to \\"Get out!\\" before they were even introduced.<br /><br />School was even worse. A Catholic school where Brown was the only foreigner, it had  English textbooks but classes were taught in Hindi. Brown, who had been an exceptional student, was soon failing. She might have overcome the language barrier if not for the sadism of her teacher, a type (not rare enough) whose professional zeal seems focused on the opportunity to bully those who can't fight back.<br /><br />On her first day Brown took comfort in the thought that \\"Manija,\\" the hated name that set her apart in America, would not be a problem in India and neither would its diminutive, \\"Mani,\\" which rhymes with money. But after Mrs. Joshi introduced her to the class, she had the students open their books to a comic rhyme that poked fun at \\"Mani Mao,\\" baby talk for \\"Mrs. Cat.\\" Brown was thereafter known as Mani Mao and pelted with stones in the schoolyard and whenever spotted alone on the streets of the town.<br /><br />As for her name, Brown changed it to Rachel the minute she graduated high school back in America and now delivers a word of warning: \\"Parents, if you do not want your children to write tell-all memoirs when they grow up, do not name them KhrYstYll, Pebble, or Shaka Zulu.\\"<br /><br />The ashram itself seems primarily populated by misfits and the mentally ill, whose ranks are routinely swelled with pilgrims from America. In all her years there Brown made only one friend, a boy who stayed for some months and whose father was one of the deranged visitors. Her accounts of their role-playing adventuresare the only carefree, unfettered moments in the book. The adult she most admired was, in the end, responsible for the most harrowing, disillusioning and cruel incident in her childhood.<br /><br />Although the life she describes is miserable, Brown herself never appears pitiable. Although resigned, she remains full of spunk and spirit, saved by her imagination. She never connected to Baba or spiritual life in general and comes across as practical, independent, driven and engaging. These qualities, along with her writing skill, came in handy at age 12 when her father left India and didn't take her with him. It took her six months of daily letters to persuade him.<br /><br />Brown interrupts her narrative several times, giving the reader views of her adult life (she's now an award-winning playwright and TV writer) and relations with her parents. She includes an account of her decision to confront the ashram years by writing about them, and her parents' reactions and input. This leads to a last page that is so perfectly apt it could have been fiction - but you'll know it's not.<br /><br />Funny, brave and sharp, Brown gives us a heroine and a writer to root for.<br /><br />--Portsmouth Heraldheir role-playing adventures are the only carefree, unfettered moments in the book.

She breathes in the special qualities of \\"old-growth\\" air and mourns the lack of \\"grandfather trees,\\" but most fascinating are the tales of interwoven life in the trees.<br /><br />Many of these have to do with insects.

Except aphids, which the ants protect in exchange for their \\"honeydew,\\" a euphemism for aphid urine.  Ladybugs eat aphids, but there are still plenty of them and that honeydew is also the substance found all over your car when you park it under a tree, that stuff you probably call sap.<br /><br />Exploring the teeming life of a tree  (without the sycamore alone nine other species would be lost) Maloof, a biologist, distills numerous studies and traces the relationships among the insects, lizards, fungi, mammals, birds and people who obtain benefit from the tree. With a winning combination of science and poetry, Maloof makes her case for compassion and wonder.<br /><br />--Portsmouth Herald	2005-10-10

The reader gets a mind's eyeful of down and dirty Glasgow, and a heroine bristling with raw, scrappy ambition, moral dilemmas, and the excruciating self-consciousness of youth.<br /><br />In 1981 Paddy Meehan, fresh out of school, an Irish Catholic from the tenements in sectarian Glasgow, lands an unrewarding job as a copyboy - a gofer - at the Scottish Daily News. She's mouthy and smart, but overweight and self-conscious about being female in a male profession. \\"The journalists had a lot of odd ideas about women: she was always having to stay late and lift heavy boxes to show that she could.\\"<br /><br />\\"Affecting reluctance like they all did when called to do any work,\\" Paddy is secretly pleased to be called on by the editor, \\"a skinny, agitated man,\\" who \\"lived on a diet of sugar and tea and whisky\\" whenever he needs a discreet job done. That he calls on her because she's green and uncoopted by loyalties is beside the point.<br /><br />The big story at the moment is a murdered child and Paddy notices small overlooked details even before she discovers her fianc&eacute;'s cousin is one of the two boys arrested for the crime. The boy comes from an impoverished alcoholic home and Paddy, in a moment of weakness, confides in Heather, an ambitious cub reporter. Heather exhorts her to write it up, but Paddy, mindful of her family, refuses.<br /><br />So her blood runs cold when she sees the whole sad, gossipy story in the paper the next morning. As expected, everyone turns a deaf ear to her explanation. Her fianc&eacute; refuses to see her, her family shuns her with silence, and Paddy knows things will never be quite the same.<br /><br />Angry and alone, she takes refuge in her ambitions and digs deeper and harder into the inconsistencies she's found in the police's tidy explanation of the boys' guilt. In her inquiries she uses Heather's name - Paddy's already been warned about posing as a reporter - with unforeseen and devastating consequences.<br /><br />Paddy's story is interrupted by odd diversions back to the 1960s when another Paddy Meehan, a coincidental namesake, was arrested for a murder he didn't commit. Except for its spur to her ambitions and her investigative streak (he was exonerated by a persistent journalist), his sad sack narrative has little to do with the main action.<br /><br />Mina's (\\"Garnethill,\\" \\"Deception\\") story is seamless in its relations of character to plot and setting.

Poor, without prospects, Mila is persuaded to emigrate to America with the promise of a good job. But once she and the other six girls have embarked it becomes obvious her guides are actually captors. Crossing the border from Mexico into the U.S. they are greeted by four American men who brutally rape them, then shoot one who tries to run away, leaving her body for the vultures.<br /><br />The narrative then switches to Maura Isles. It's a summer night after a long day and the medical examiner enters her gleaming, deserted morgue to check the position of a corpse's tattoo. As she zips the body bag and turns to leave she hears a noise, dismisses it, then hears it again. Something moving in a body bag. There's a row of them in the busy city morgue and Isles quickly unzips one after another until she comes to a young woman with cold, bluish skin but no obvious wounds or autopsy sutures.<br /><br />\\"She pressed her fingers to the woman's neck and felt icy skin. Bending close to the lips, she waited for the whisper of a breath, the faintest puff of air against her cheek.<br /><br />The corpse opened its eyes.\\"<br /><br />Meanwhile Jane Rizzoli's baby is overdue and the homicide cop is restless and uncomfortable. Her water breaks while she's subduing an obstreperous defendant in court and she's finally ready. But while Rizzoli waits in a quiet hospital room for an Ultrasound, pandemonium breaks out upstairs.<br /><br />Isles enters the resurrected woman's hospital room to find a doctor and a security guard attempting to restrain her. As Isles moves forward the patient shoots the security guard, the doctor flees and the woman takes Isles hostage. The police scramble to cover the entrance, Isles manages to escape, and the woman darts deeper into the building - winding up in Diagnostic Imaging, where Rizzoli becomes one of six hostages.<br /><br />Gerritsen ratchets up the tension, cutting from Rizzoli's cautious dance around the desperate, uncommunicative hostage taker to Isles at the sweltering command post and Rizzoli's husband, FBI agent Gabriel Dean, doing his own tense maneuvering around the powers that be in order to try and save his wife's life from overzealous cops.<br /><br />Strange turf battles heat up between intruding FBI and locals, the SWAT teams are getting antsy, Rizzoli starts going into labor, the dead security guard turns out to be something much more complicated, and a well-armed man slips through the police perimeter and joins the hostage taker.<br /><br />Intercut scenes of Mila's narrative describes a hopeless life of brutality and debasement, which builds to a shattering climax, which she escapes with Olena, the hostage taker.<br /><br />Gerritsen supplies pulse-pounding suspense as she gathers sinister forces around her characters - shadowy people with the highest connections, people with the ability to kill with impunity. Knowing Olena's background, the reader is way ahead of Dean, Rizzoli and Isles as well as the local cops.<br /><br />Gerritsen, a doctor who took up writing while staying at home with her children, describes the medical side with detailed authority. Her characters grow more appealing and complex with every book - this is the fifth in the series - and the pace is riveting.<br /><br />She also fleshes out her narrative with real-life issues, from the personal to larger, moral, ripped-from-the-headlines situations. Sex slavery is the big one in this book and many readers will wonder how something so horrifying can go on all but unchallenged in a country like ours.<br /><br />On a personal level, Rizzoli continues her internal struggle between her need for love and family and her need for independence. Her ambivalence about motherhood - fear, helplessness, frustration and fierce love - is involving and sympathetic and her relationship with Gabriel strikes an authentic chord.<br /><br />Gerritsen has done it again with a thriller that will keep you up way past your bedtime.r love and family and her need for independence.

Playing a wily Watson to his brilliant, mercurial, gangster boss, Sonchai transcribes the statement Vikorn and Chanya have crafted, one that should satisfy the American authorities while absolving Chanya, who Sonchai hopelessly loves.<br /><br />But Mitch Turner is no ordinary American. He was CIA, sent to Bangkok in the aftermath of September 11. The local Muslims are worried, as well they should be, since the uncovering of a local Al Qaeda tie would be a feather of promotion in any agent's cap.<br /><br />Between the spies, the revelations and emerging complications concerning Chanya and the dead man, as well as the bloody developments in the ongoing feud between Vikorn and his military counterpart, drug Kingpin General Zinna, Sonchai nearly forgets the sudden email contact with his never-met American father.<br /><br />Zany, raunchy and sarcastic, Sonchai's energetic narration plunges through the dark, teeming streets of Bangkok with native skill and navigates contradictions with Buddhist aplomb. Surprises abound, skewing expectations in a pleasurably disorienting manner.<br /><br />Burdett, an Englishman who lives in Hong Kong, developed a strong interest in Theravada Buddhism, the type that is practiced in Thailand, and Sonchai's devotion creates a provocative paradox, given the story's level of violence, sex and corruption.<br /><br />Sonchai's mocking disrespect for \\"soulless\\" Western culture occasionally exhibits a particularly Western self-loathing, and his view of the Thai bar-girls as cheerful, well-respected sex workers sounds like familiar male romanticism but Burdett does it all with such wit and personality that few readers will be bothered.

If this sounds like more than you want to swallow with your murder and mayhem, wait. In Cotterill's deft hands, Siri's spirituality is a natural outgrowth of his dogged toughness and hard-earned wisdom. His heightened perceptions and cryptic ghostly visitors become fine tools in deft hands. And the ubiquitous spirits add an exotic dimension to the steamy, colorful Laotian atmosphere.<br /><br />Siri's second outing begins with two dead men who have nothing in common except that their bodies were found tangled together on a bicycle. One is a threadbare old man, the other a well-dressed functionary. With Holmesian deduction Siri quickly determines the manner and means of death, although discovering motive and murderer will involve a side trip to the capital city, Luang Prabang, where two charred bodies, a life-threatening spiritual crisis and a poignant journey into his own past and the remnants of the royal family await.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back at home in Vientiane, his loyal, quietly ambitious nurse, Dtui, is left to stop a series of grisly murders of women by what appears to be a wild beast. The only such beast known to be at large is an old, long-abused bear, recently escaped from its cage, but Dtui doubts the worn-out animal could be capable of such savagery.<br /><br />Her investigation takes her from the Russian compound, where circus acts practice alongside \\"top-secret\\" weapons work, to an island prison and a search for a \\"weretiger,\\" which she has some trouble believing exists.<br /><br />Before it's all over the government will issue an ultimatum to the spirits of Laos to hilarious effect -  \\"If the spirits wish to be part of the new democratic republican network, they have to toe the line.

Barnaby), this sixth Abel Jones novel has everything going for it.<br /><br />A straight-laced Methodist might feel a bit out of his element in roiling, seething, party-loving 1863 New Orleans. But Major Jones doesn't permit himself much self-doubt or uncertainty. Sent by President Lincoln to solve the murder of an abolitionist do-gooder in the Union-occupied city, Jones plunges into the fray from the first page, chasing a black voodoo priestess with a large snake out of a convent and through the unfamiliar, treacherous streets.<br /><br />He's not quite sure what the chase is about, since the nun who raised the alarm spoke only French, and he never does catch the woman. Quite the opposite. The woman disappears and Jones finds himself cornered by three thugs on a rooftop. He fights them off and makes his escape only to be ambushed in a bawdy house, knocked out with ether and entombed. Literally. \\"I had been buried alive. Shut in with bones and rot and rags, piled up so high they pressed me against the roof of the narrow crypt....My final breaths would be fumes off rotting corpses. The thought put my lingering toothache in its place.\\"<br /><br />The toothache will return, though, to hilarious and horrific effect, culminating in a visit to a sadistic dentist with, unknown to Jones, rebel sympathies. After the initial poking and prodding, the slovenly dentist produces a bottle of whisky:<br /><br />\\" `I have taken the pledge, sir,' I told him, not without a certain regret.<br /><br />He fortified himself with a swig from the bottle....He chose a tool that might have done for a blacksmith's shop....I tasted metal. And rust.\\"<br /><br />The \\"embarrassed\\" (naked) corpse is the daughter of a prominent northerner and it's not long before Jones has received several wildly differing views of her. Was she plain or beautiful? Naïve or scheming? Prude or libertine? Racist and mean, or principled and generous?<br /><br />Jones had not been pleased to be handed this case  - \\"in the midst of so much death I cared little for Miss Peabody, who was unknown to me.\\" And his inadvertent plunge into voodoo distracts him further. Racial tension is high in New Orleans where blacks are newly freed and their former masters have lost their freedom and much of their fortune to Yankee victors. Many former slaves have gone missing and there are rumors of mass murder, and resurrected dead. Uncertainty and fear run rampant.<br /><br />Jones makes his way through New Orleans society, gathering mostly cryptic information from the powerful of both races. Against his God-fearing will, to unravel the mysteries - the missing blacks, Miss Peabody's death, and several more gruesome murders and abductions - Jones undergoes an elaborate, terrifying voodoo ritual. Voodoo, though he cannot believe in it, lays a pall of dread and mystery over the city.<br /><br />His colleagues, the occupying soldiers, are not much help either. The new commanding general is a politician unwilling to rock the boat and the rich-boy officer assigned to Jones is a dolt. Jones, having been a soldier for many years, is sometimes caustic about his colleagues:<br /><br />\\"When you strip off an officer's uniform, you always find him smaller than he seemed. Generals are especially diminished.\\"<br /><br />When the general dismisses a servant offering coffee, Jones observes, \\"I would have valued a steaming cup myself. But generals assume that, if they do not want a thing, no one else wants it either.\\"<br /><br />Eventually Jones, with Barnaby's considerable and not always appreciated aid, unravels the complex threads of the mysteries, leaving none dangling. He keeps the action going, and mixed with scenes of high hilarity are others so grisly and cruel, they'll take your breath away. Jones himself develops as a man during the course of the story as he has over the course of the series.<br /><br />Parry's portrait of New Orleans, in all its warts and diamonds and fake tiaras, plunges the reader into this tumultuous and ugly period. And you couldn't ask for a more observant, intrepid and witty guide than Abel Jones.ity are others so grisly and cruel, they'll take your breath away.

A visual writer with an uncommon ability to recreate personal vistas of beauty in the mind's eye of her reader, Hadley has lived and gardened all over the world.<br /><br />Her current garden, on five acres of secluded beachfront property at her home on Fisher's Island, off the Connecticut coast, includes nature walks and is strictly organic. \\"I thought a seaside garden should look and be simple, easy, harmonious with sea and sky, serene, tranquil....It hadn't occurred to me that this might not always be as simple nor as easy a project as I imagined.\\"<br /><br />Luckily for Hadley, who grew up with gardeners and governesses, help is affordable. But even if you don't have someone to pick up the slack on weeding, planting, pruning and deadheading, there's much to enjoy in this lovely, well-organized and practical book. Hadley offers advice on salt and drought tolerant plants, on coping with pests like rabbits and deer, learning from mistakes, and attracting birds and butterflies.<br /><br />Roughly organized by season, she discusses her favorite plants in detail, including sources for plants, bulbs and seeds. There are entire chapters devoted to daffodils and tulips, irises, hydrangeas, geraniums and pelargonium, pinks, marsh mallows, passionflower and other vines, annuals and fruits.<br /><br />Other chapters discuss \\"The Cutting Garden,\\" \\"The Autumn Garden,\\" \\"The Winter Scene,\\" houseplants and volunteers.<br /><br />Hadley opens her flower chapters with exuberant descriptions of what she likes about these favorites. \\"the daffodils, like a waving river of flowers along the western edge of the driveway, look as though they had just been painted. Their clean, shining brightness, the scent of young leaves and damp spring earth, everything glowing and blowing, hint at the bliss of May and the hope and magic of summer ahead.\\"<br /><br />She goes on to describe the work in loving detail, from how many bulbs to buy (\\"Think wheelbarrowsful.\\") when and how to plant them (clumps of odd numbers in a diamond shape work best for her) to choosing colors, height, extending flowering and interplanting with astilbe or day lilies to hide bedraggled post-bloom foliage.<br /><br />Although her chapter on pests neglects the bane of my existence, woodchucks, she does offer numerous non-toxic ideas for ridding the garden of rabbits (\\"Best of all solutions to the rabbit problem, I've found, is to focus on plants rabbits dislike.\\"), raccoons, rats and mice, ants, slugs, aphids, mosquitoes, crab grass and poison ivy (full strength vinegar poured over the whole plant) and more. While many solutions will be familiar, others may not. I'd never heard of cornmeal for combating fungus, for instance, or Mosquito Magnets, which trap mosquitoes by mimicking human breath.<br /><br />You won't always agree with her, of course. She has banished daisies from her garden as \\"killers and dangerously invasive,\\" but I've found that these problems are (mostly) solved by yanking them out before they are quite done flowering. And masses of daisies definitely offer the \\"incandescent radiance\\" she so values in her dream garden.<br /><br />\\"My dream garden is both a white garden and a moon garden, a garden of annuals and perennials the color of snow, cream, ivory, and milk, with flower textures delicate as tissue paper, soft as velvet, smooth as silk, sleek as satin. Consider beds of creamy white roses, clusters of lilies, carpets of white violets, clematis blossoms.\\"<br /><br />The crisp, brilliant photographs are nearly as elegant as the prose, offering atmospheric views of rambling hillsides at dawn, bordered walkways, glimpses of house between masses of blooms, architectural line and ornamental accents, and close ups of her favorite varieties.<br /><br />Hadley, author of the memorable travel memoirs, \\"Give Me the World,\\" and \\"A Journey with Elsa Cloud,\\" in addition to the series, \\"Fieldings Guide to Traveling with Children in Europe,\\" has produced a joyful, intense and elegant garden book, which will be enjoyed again and again and all through the winter.to the series, \\"Fieldings Guide to Traveling with Children in Europe,\\" has produced a joyful, intense and elegant garden book, which will be enjoyed again and again and all through the winter.	2005-08-22

Did you decide to hold off on reading the latest until the lines of Muggles at the bookstore dwindled?<br /><br />Well, prepare to be re-enchanted and find yourself a book before some overexcited fan gives away the ending in your presence. This is a distinct hazard as the ending raises many more questions than it answers. The day I finished the book a young friend eagerly demanded my views. My theories and interpretations being different than hers we were soon engaged in a lively debate. When called to join the rest of the company, she balked, saying, \\"I've been waiting DAYS to discuss this with someone who's read the book.\\"<br /><br />Wow, I thought, it's a long time since I thought of a book in quite that way. Never, really. When I was a kid, the only books we all read were those assigned by a teacher and discussed in class. Not exactly occasions of great excitement. My young friend is an adult now, but she wasn't when the first book was published here in 1998 and all her friends were caught up in the phenomenon.<br /><br />And this is a series that has grown up with its fans. Rowling has long said that each book will grow darker as Harry matures and his archenemy, the evil Lord Voldemort, grows stronger. Voldemort has now gathered his old followers, the Death Eaters, and is inflicting mayhem and murder on the magical - and Muggle - world. Wizards and witches are dying and disappearing daily and the Ministry is kept busy modifying Muggles' memories to make attacks by marauding giants appear to be out-of-season hurricanes. There's no disguising death, however.<br /><br />Hogwarts, protected by powerful enchantments, is a sea of calm in all this. Potter is now 16, and while he's as stubborn as ever, he's learned to weigh consequences, at least in personal relationships. Girls are a major concern, but he worries about how a romance between his best friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley will affect their friendship, particularly if they break up. And he struggles against his own interest in Ron's younger sister, Ginny: \\"He would not risk his friendship with Ron for anything.\\"<br /><br />Harry's magic has improved, but he is not above cribbing from an old, borrowed potions book. Its previous owner, the \\"half-blood prince,\\" has scribbled improved potions recipes and antidotes in the margins, along with ingenious hexes and counter hexes, most, but not all, harmless and amusing. Thanks to the book Harry is tops in his potions class. He harbors hopes that the mysterious \\"prince\\" is actually his dead father, James.<br /><br />But while youthful crushes, Quidditch rivalries and failed attempts to apparate from one place to another without leaving behind a limb preoccupy most of the students at Hogwarts, including Harry, a dark plot is hatching within the school and Harry seems to be the only one taking it seriously.<br /><br />We know from the preface that Harry is right about his nasty classmate, Draco Malfoy. Lord Voldemort has given Draco an assignment. It's a task beyond his years and his mother is so frightened she has extracted an unbreakable vow from Professor Snape to protect her son.<br /><br />Despite his wise headmaster's inexplicable trust in Snape, a supposedly reformed Voldemort follower, Harry has always suspected him of being a secret Death Eater. With Draco sneaking around Hogwarts at all hours, often disappearing off the marauder's map (this map shows everyone's movements and is visible by saying, \\"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good\\"), Harry is more certain than ever that Snape is helping him.<br /><br />But when he tries to tell Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster refuses to hear him. Harry is spending more time with Dumbledore this year, getting private lessons to aid him against Voldemort in the coming struggle. Most of these consist of memories viewed in the pensieve. This marvelously named object is a basin in which the user can relive other people's memories as an observer. The memories concern pivotal moments in Voldemort's past: his unhappy birth, isolated childhood, and scheming schooldays at Hogwarts. The chilling portrait that emerges is the evil antithesis of Harry's own orphaned past.<br /><br />But as Rowling builds toward the great struggle between Harry Potter and the evil Voldemort, she does not neglect the humor and delightful detail that make these books such a magical world. As usual, it's many of the inconsequential moments that make the atmosphere sparkle.<br /><br />A crotchety old headmaster portrait in Dumbledore's office, for instance, is grumbling about Dumbledore's too-lenient treatment of Harry, when he hears about Harry's encounter with a thief in possession of objects from Harry's late godfather's Grimmauld Place house. \\" `That mangy old half-blood has been stealing Black heirlooms?' said Phineas Nigellus, incensed; and he stalked out of his frame, undoubtedly to visit his portrait in number twelve, Grimmauld Place.\\"<br /><br />And Ron, in potion class, during his prolonged falling out with Hermione: \\"Ron was sitting beside Harry with his mouth half open, doodling absently on his new copy of Advanced Potion-Making. Ron kept forgetting that he could no longer rely on Hermione to help him out of trouble when he failed to grasp what was going on.\\"<br /><br />Much is revealed in \\"The Half Blood Prince,\\" and much remains to be revealed. More complex and layered than previous books, I'd say this was the best so far, except that the first book, which set up the amazing wizarding world, was such a magical marvel.

Does your attic bulge with things you might find a use for someday? Are you always looking for new, innovative decorating ideas?<br /><br />Answer \\"yes\\" to any of those questions and the \\"Salvage Sisters Guide\\" will kindle a kindred spark. Like a year's subscription to a decorating magazine for yard salers, their colorful, perky and practical book teems with ideas, good and bad.<br /><br />Some of the good ideas are familiar. A patchwork quilt (or ottoman cover, tablecloth or lampshade-cum-chandelier cover), made out of your family's long-loved old clothes, for instance. Or the ball gown cut down for a table skirt. And I don't know that I've ever seen a cast-iron lobster-shaped cornbread mold used as a doorknocker, but it seems like I should have.<br /><br />Then there's the bad ideas; who hasn't seen a nifty looking throw tucked neatly over an old chair's fraying upholstery? Looks great, as long as nobody sits on it. Making outfits for the whole family out of a couple of big, ugly curtains makes for a funny picture, but I wouldn't want to try it on my family. And I get the distinct feeling that most of the newsprint ideas - wreaths, mirror-frame covers, urns filled with crinkled balls - look a lot better in the pictures than in real life. As for shell art; it's downright dangerous.<br /><br />But the twin-bed headboard set over the plain horizontal mirror (or door frame) really does smarten up the piece and the hundred and one uses for an old wine rack (from shoe rack to spa closet) are all inspirational. Plant stands make chair-side serving trays, umbrella stands, and even a whimsical toilet tissue stand.<br /><br />The toilet tissue stand perfectly expresses the Salvage Sisters' philosophy: \\"Why tuck toilet tissue behind closed doors when you can make an amusing arrangement of it in plain sight on a plant stand? The best part: There's no risk of unknowingly running out.\\"<br /><br />A lot of their ideas require no work at all or just a simple lick of pain or spot of glue. But where more is required - such as hanging an old front-door pediment over a set of standard French doors, or making bookcases from discarded drawers or covering a straight-backed chair seat - detailed directions include all materials and tools needed as well as step-by-step instructions suitable for a person with no skills or experience.<br /><br />Colorful pictures accompany everything and often feature family members, from kids on driftwood swings to husbands in homemade bow ties.

McDermid describes the killings in explicit, horrifying detail, as seems to be de rigeur these days, but the baffling twist required to keep it from being just like every other well-written serial-killer thriller, is a good one.<br /><br />The killer follows a script dictated by a voice in his head. Trouble is, the script is old. The current murders are exact copies of a series solved two years previous, when irrefutable forensic evidence - and a confession - landed the killer in a hospital for the criminally insane. The case is ironclad and Dr. Hill can't accept a copycat.<br /><br />Jordan, still traumatized from the brutal attack she suffered in their last outing (\\"The Last Temptation\\"), now heads up the new \\"major incident\\" squad. Along with the serial killings, she and the empathetic Hill are juggling a cold case of two missing, presumed murdered, boys.<br /><br />Point of view shifts primarily, though not exclusively, between the two protagonists. Hill, with his uncanny (but convincing) insights into the criminal mind, and his tortured love for Jordan, has the most intriguing view. Jordan's struggle to appear more in command than she is is well done and McDermid keeps the political maneuvering and ambition in the new squad tense. The two cases build in intensity and suspense to an excruciating and prolonged climax.<br /><br />- Portsmouth Herald	2005-07-25

The glittery models keep slim on cocaine; the dealers inhabit a world where brutality is strength and death is a teaching tool; sex is either a commodity, a sickness or both. Stella's heartfelt passion and integrity are balanced by guilt and secrets, some worse than others.<br /><br />Point of view centers on Stella but shifts frequently, from the omniscient witness of a brutal drama in the slums to the specific terror of a marked man, a murder victim, a betrayed lover, a sadistic killer. Gritty and dark, Lawrence's series should appeal to fans of Ian Rankin, Michael Connelly and Val McDermid.<br /><br />- Portsmouth Herald	2005-07-25

Each diabolically selected scholar, in the fearless ambition of youth, receives a strange, compelling book with a dragon woodcut in its center and nothing but blank pages to either side.<br /><br />The dragon holds a banner with one word on it, \\"Drakulya,\\" and the intrigued historian instantly becomes obsessed with tracing the book's origin and meaning, which clearly springs from the bloody, medieval reign of Vlad the Impaler, or Dracula. A monster who shed the blood of his own people in horrible ways, Vlad also ferociously resisted the Ottoman invasion of Eastern Europe, though he was finally defeated and beheaded by the Turkish sultan. After reading about Vlad you will be cheering the sultan, but not so fast - the story has barely begun.<br /><br />Kostova structures the book as a story within a story within a story, all linking up and moving the narrative forward under a central, framing narrator, a 53 year-old historian looking back on the events of 1972 when she was 16. An American living in Amsterdam at that time, the daughter of an historian turned diplomat (her mother is long dead), she one day finds her father's dragon book, together with a bundle of letters from a Professor Rossi, dated 1930, each beginning with the salutation, \\"My dear and unfortunate successor.\\"<br /><br />Though she reads only the first paragraph, that's enough to spark an uneasy curiosity of her own: \\"It is with regret that I imagine you, whoever you are, reading the account I must put down here. The regret is partly for myself - because I will surely be at least in trouble, maybe dead, or perhaps worse, if this is in your hands. But my regret is also for you, my yet-unknown friend, because only by someone who needs such vile information will this letter be someday read.\\"<br /><br />She bides her time, but insists her father, Paul, take her on his next diplomatic trip where, in an ancient Slavic setting she reveals her find and gently demands (she is, up until this Dracula business, a very dutiful, respectful daughter) an explanation. In a succession of colorful, atmospheric trips throughout Italy, France and eastern Europe, Paul tells his daughter the story of 1953 when he found his dragon book and his beloved advisor, Professor Rossi, disappeared, sparking Paul's quest to find Dracula's grave and somehow save his mentor.<br /><br />Within his tale is Rossi's parallel story, told in the letters, which takes place in his graduate days in 1930, when he, too, found a dragon book among his possessions and began digging into the legend of Dracula. When a close friend dies mysteriously, Rossi, driven by grief and hopes of revenge, travels to Istanbul and beyond, seeking Vlad's grave. Like Paul, Rossi abandons his search, jolted by terror into returning to normal life, and passes 20 years in tranquility, until his student, Paul, comes to him with a dragon book.<br /><br />All of this is delightfully creepy and intriguing, but the structure - Paul telling his daughter these perfectly composed stories, complete with long conversations, and even longer letters delivered verbatim while sitting on stone benches or at caf&eacute; tables - bothered me enough so that it was something of a relief when Paul disappeared and the narrative could take a more normal shape.<br /><br />That is, his daughter chases off after him, and in her possession is a large bundle of letters, written by Paul for just such an eventuality as his disappearance. As she (together with a young, graduate-student protector, foisted on her by her father before his disappearance) follows her father's footsteps from Paris to the Pyrenees, she reads his narrative, which concerns his search for Rossi, most of it in the company of Rossi's unacknowledged, illegitimate daughter, Helen, a Dracula historian.<br /><br />Paul and Helen pursue Rossi's trail through old books and older letters, through venerable libraries, ruined monasteries, and ancient crypts. Their research takes them back in time to the end of the Byzantine Empire and its conquest by the Ottomans who destroyed the churches and monasteries and imposed Islam on the conquered. They travel from Istanbul to behind the Iron Curtain, to Hungary and Romania and Bulgaria, where political dangers are second only to the diabolical. Strange encounters bring them to other scholars with dragon books and new pieces of the puzzle, both historical and modern.<br /><br />They are, naturally, shadowed by vampires, who seem determined to hinder them, and perhaps also make them join their company. But where do the dragon books come from? What mysterious entity compels these book holders to find one another and combine their knowledge to draw closer to Dracula's unquiet tomb?<br /><br />Kostova sometimes takes the scholarly conceit too far, with long prefaces to historical documents that trace their provenance in detail down through the centuries, and some serious minutiae on monasteries, monks, and Ottomans. But this also lends the book an additional dusty air of authenticity and ancient, moldering atmosphere.<br /><br />Fans of literary vampire stories steeped in history, with old stone crypts, lush, dark valleys, distrustful peasants, romance and danger will enjoy Kostova's debut.

One, I am not a dog person. Two, there can never be too many dog books. As long as they're funny and at least somewhat informative.<br /><br />Slate columnist and lifelong \\"cat person\\" Yoffe's account of how she became a dog person easily fills these requirements. It's packed with enough information to confirm a healthy resolve never to own a dog, at least not a beagle, and the self conscious are cautioned against reading it in public lest you attract stares for continuous eruptions of solitary laughter.<br /><br />Yoffe starts from the lowest point of dog ownership, the night when she single handedly removed the strap of her favorite bra from the rear-end of her relieved beagle, Sasha. The chapter goes on to share stories about other canine culinary feats. One dog wolfed down the entire rubber gasket from a refrigerator in one piece; another swallowed a seven-inch knife. This latter was discovered only because the uncomplaining dog had stopped sleeping in her customary curled-up position. Sasha's special cat litter treat gets mentioned in a later chapter.<br /><br />While most dogs will eat just about anything, beagles have other drawbacks. The beagle-rescue website has an upfront buyer-beware. \\"Getting a beagle after this was like reading about a car model in Consumer Reports: `If you want an automobile that will start reliably, requires little maintenance, runs in all kinds of weather and has a good safety record, then this model is not for you,' and then running to the dealer to put down a deposit on an Osie.\\"<br /><br />Incontinence is a recurring theme, a common trait of beagles. \\"When Sasha first arrived she did live up to the promise of being completely unhousebroken.\\" Yoffe shares some truly disgusting stories - one concerns the dining room table - but even those who think scatological humor is only for boys of 12 will be howling.<br /><br />Beagles are also notoriously difficult to train, meaning they prefer not to obey, and they cannot be allowed off the leash. \\"Sasha has made it clear that however much love and food we pour into her, if the front door is ajar for a millisecond, she will take off down the street without a farewell glance, on the scent trail of a decomposing possum, or a sewerline break.\\"<br /><br />Yoffe was pressured - guilted - into getting a dog by her husband and daughter. Her daughter's first written sentence was \\" `I love dogs.' \\" \\"Then she came home from kindergarten with a chart of everyone's favorite pet - hers was dog. When I mentioned she had cats, not a dog, she said, `They asked for my favorite, not what I have.' \\"<br /><br />And so the research. Yoffe, who will be primary caretaker for this animal and knows it, takes charge from the start, treating it like a journalistic project. She looks into breeds and their histories, and ends up rescuing the neurotic, skittish, but adorable Sasha from imminent euthanasia. She collects dog stories from vets, trainers, breeders and passing strangers, visits a pet psychic, a facility that trains food-sniffing beagles for airport security and enlists Sasha in visiting nursing home invalids.<br /><br />Attending a training session on psychic dog communication she struggles to achieve the required meditative state. \\"But as I concentrated on the thoughts of the sleeping Lulu, my mind was an utter blank. At first I felt like a failure, then I realized, this may be the mental state of a sleeping hound.\\"<br /><br />Beagles are used in airports to detect forbidden foods, like fruit and sausages. Yoffe accompanies the Beagle Brigade at work, but Sasha never strays far from her thoughts. \\"I tried to imagine Sasha patrolling the airport. All I could conjure up was her accidentally knocking over a toddler in order to pull a Twizzler out of the child's mouth.\\"<br /><br />Yoffe notices a strange transformation coming over her as time goes on. When she's away from home for too long she starts feeling anxious for Sasha - and it's not just fear of what havoc she may be wreaking in an empty house.  \\"I was so far gone that I was starting to think about getting another dog. We were set up for it, we had the fence, the crates, the food. I was already a prisoner in my own home, so why not get a companion for Sasha?\\"<br /><br />We can be sure it will make a good dog story.just fear of what havoc she may be wreaking in an empty house.  \\"I was so far gone that I was starting to think about getting another dog.

Though arising from the usual sad litany of poverty - alcohol, drugs, unpredictable tempers, frightened children, abused women and dangerous streets - these images are singular, personal and painfully complex.<br /><br />Like the time they had their roach-infested basement apartment painted, because a guy who owed the older sister's boyfriend a favor sent his crew over (this sister, Jackie, a high school drop-out, is already following in her mother's footsteps). Their mother, Sandy, exuberant at the prospect, drags the furniture away from the walls and urges the whole family to paint pictures of their own, whatever they want before the painters come to cover it up.<br /><br />On the day itself, \\"no beer bottles in sight,\\" Sandy takes them all to Coney Island, a trip which involves dragging cooler, stroller and duffle bag on two packed trains, where casual violence is always a danger. \\"Virtually every family on the train designates a hawk to detect the danger zones where action might flare....Everyone knows what happens if you interfere with teenage boys proving their manhood.\\"<br /><br />Though the lunch is only PB&J, \\"I'll be happy as long as Mom doesn't buy beer or, even worse, flirt one out of an innocent bystander.\\" She doesn't and the day is idyllic. They take turns guarding the blanket. \\"I welcome my turn to guard our stuff. Reading on the beach without any of the kids bothering me is one of the most peaceful events of my life.\\"<br /><br />Sandy caps the day by taking the whole family on the roller coaster. Her glasses fly off in mid-whoop but her daughter Joan snags them in mid-air. Unfortunately a lurch slams her hand on the bar and a lens pops out. \\"Oh boy, wait until Mom sees this. She'll lose her temper. The day will be ruined....Mom believes Joan saved her glasses, and Joan and I dread admitting the truth. Joan squeezes back her tears as she rubs her hand with pain and worry.\\" But the charmed day persists. Sandy's left eye is glass and it was the left lens that was lost.<br /><br />Sandy is a mercurial figure who envelops her surviving seven children - six girls and one silent, outnumbered, beleaguered boy - with love, pelts them with curses, and leaves them hungry while she goes off partying. The atmosphere in their dank crowded apartment seesaws between giddiness and rage. And yet, suddenly, when one of the girls is hit by a car, Sandy promises God to quit drinking if the child survives - and does.<br /><br />Not that her children trust the transformation. And the grinding cycle of poverty remains unbroken. Worn out by so many pregnancies and \\"bad habits\\" Sandy works even less, eking out their living on welfare alone and whatever her children contribute. While the fate of Mary's sisters remains precarious, her own determination is never in doubt.<br /><br />\\"Most of the time I tell myself that my family feels like a lifeline, not a prison sentence, but I always have one eye on the door.\\"<br /><br />She is the one who insists on going to school, who braves any amount of resentment and ridicule to stay on the college-bound, escape-bound path. Taunted and persecuted by neighborhood kids as well as her mother, and even teachers sometimes for her welfare-brat clothing, Mary seldom wavers, as desperate as she is for friends and approval. An adrenaline-spiked stint with a neighborhood gang ends in shame when a boy's sneer jolts her back to herself. These kids are mean, racist bullies, she realizes. \\"I rolled in laughter when I should have been racked with guilt.\\"<br /><br />There are many threads that weave through Mary's story, but the cyclic, self-perpetuating nature of poverty is the strongest. There is one message children like her read loud and clear every day: \\"People who speak well and read widely may be admirable, but if you stand out, you'll be picked out. You're inviting trouble and loneliness when you distinguish yourself from your own by choosing to care about good grades, books, accents and magazine clothes.... Against my will, I've absorbed resentment and the nagging perception that my ambitions are disloyal, and worse, punishable.\\"<br /><br />Against the turmoil of the times: the assassinations, from JFK to MLK; the race riots and rampaging gangs; the fear of crime on the subway and on the street; the stigma and inadequacy of welfare, Mary keeps her eye on the prize - college. Escape. Her tumultuous, wrenching, sometimes funny story knocks home a serious lesson about the cycle of poverty. It takes more than brains, talent and hard work to escape the underclass.

The time may yet come this summer when you tire of the same old steak, burgers and chicken on the barbecue and yearn for something a little different. Like Lemongrass-Grilled Rack of Lamb with Tamarind Sauce, perhaps, or Grilled Tuna with Soy, Wasabi, and Pickled Ginger or a Lobster Burger involving scallops, ginger mayonnaise and Tomato Confit.<br /><br />These are restaurant-style chef dishes, of course, and Bittman's responses, intended to show how simple, home-cooked food can be just as enjoyable are, respectively: Grilled Squid with Black Pepper and Sesame-Lemon Sauce, Tuna Teriyaki, and a Lobster Roll, served with melted butter on a  hot dog bun.<br /><br />It's a gimmicky idea, but fun, even if the connections sometimes seem farfetched  (rack of lamb vs. squid?). Bittman, author of \\"The Minimalist\\" column as well as many books, adheres to a simplify-without-sacrifice philosophy and consequently is wildly popular with busy but serious home cooks. This book accompanies Bittman's public television series and includes short profiles of the 13 chefs, their restaurants and their dishes juxtaposed with Bittman's responses.<br /><br />Sidebars include some of the show's repartee as well as cooking tips (like Jean-Georges Vongerichten's subtle use of cayenne instead of black pepper to season fish) and Bittman's variations, simplifications, explanations and suggestions for home cooks who want to prepare the chefs' signature dishes (Gary Danko's Duck Confit and Potato Hash as template for croquettes of many kinds; choosing lemons or persimmons, making shrimp shell stock, clarifying butter).<br /><br />The chefs run the gamut from classical French (Daniel Boulud, Michel Richard) to Vietnamese (Charles Phan), Spanish (Jose Andres), Indian (Suvir Saran) and various trendy Americans (Kerry Simon, Anna Klinger, James Boyce). Some are young, some well established; all are confident and opinionated.<br /><br />Illustrated with shots taken from the TV show, this is a clever, energetic book which offers a smorgasbord of the nation's leading cooks and an expert home cook's take on a wide range of recipes and techniques.clever, energetic book which offers a smorgasbord of the nation's leading cooks and an expert home cook's take on a wide range of recipes and techniques.	2005-06-30

Each chapter begins with a chart of recipes showing which are quick, make-ahead, and/or vegetarian, a \\"Secrets of Success\\" feature which offers guidelines for shopping, storing, and cooking, and a few frequently asked questions.<br /><br />In addition each recipe includes more \\"secrets.\\" French Onion Soup, for instance, advises a Dutch oven and European-style unsalted butter for the slow onion caramelization, a food processor for the vast quantity of onions, several methods for keeping oniony tears to a minimum, advice on cutting the bread, and the tip that onions and potatoes stored together cause each other to rot.<br /><br />The amount of information is vast, but the book is so well organized it never seems overwhelming. A cooking class between covers, it includes all the basics, from stock to risotto, from brining meats to sweating vegetables, from planning a menu to picking the perfect melon. Carucci hits on safety issues in storing, cooking and cooling foods and tells which dozen fruits and vegetables should be purchased organic in order to avoid 90 percent of ingested pesticides. She doesn't shy away from recommending brands either, be it coconut oil or cookware.<br /><br />Recipes like Braised Short Ribs, Poached Salmon with Shortcut Hollandaise, Turkey Mole, Wild Rice Pilaf, Polenta, Roasted Root Vegetables and Devils Food Cake lend themselves to advice that can be used in numerous other contexts.

A Cambodian Chicken Soup with Tamarind follows a recipe for traditional Provencal Vegetable Soup with Pistou and Franco-Vietnamese Spring Rolls follows Quiche Lorraine.<br /><br />While classic French dishes predominate, Loomis collects recipes from Asian and Middle-Eastern immigrants who are equally passionate about their favorite dishes. Thus, the poultry chapter includes Rooster in Red Wine, Roasted Lemon and Orange Guinea Hen and Syrian Chicken with Tahini, Lemon, and Yogurt Sauce and the meat chapter features Rib-eye Steak with Bordelaise Sauce, Aromatic Braised Pork Shoulder and Lamb and Dried Plum Tagine with Toasted Almonds.<br /><br />Loomis' focus, whatever the dish, is on careful attention to detail in technique and choice of ingredients. Thus a beef braise \\"needs every single minute\\" of its three hour cooking time, quinoa requires a gentle hand with herbs and pine nut oil and Leek Potage must be consumed the day it is made.<br /><br />While the recipes are not difficult, many do require time and attention.

Her escape, a thrilling couple of pages, establishes her plucky ingenuity as well as getting the reader's heart rate going.<br /><br />This latest Lincoln Rhyme novel finds the quadriplegic forensic detective working on a vigorous exercise regimen and grateful for a reprieve from a medical evaluation - what if all that hard work is for naught? The Settle case quickly proves to be more than a routine reprieve, however. The killer circles back to the scene and kills the museum's director while he's giving a statement to the police. Then his  m.o. bears similarities to two previous, unsolved killings. And he's still after Geneva.<br /><br />The narrative veers away from Rhyme and his crime scene eyes and ears, soul mate Amelia Sachs, to encompass the killer's point of view as well as Geneva's. Thomas Boyd, killer for  hire, laments his loss of human feeling as he dispassionately plans his next attempt on the teen. And Geneva burns with a single-minded passion to get herself out of the ghetto and launch a new life in Paris and London.<br /><br />As always the ending has several reverses, twists and false feints, the forensic detection is ingenious and there's plenty of action. But likable Geneva's stubborn willfulness grows tiring - first off, no math test or McDonald's job is worth risking your straight-A life for and second, she's too ready to risk other people's lives.

Or make money. Or feel good about themselves. Or all three and a lot more too. Africa itself remains elusive.<br /><br />Fitzhugh Martin, a mixed-race Kenyan and relief worker turned airline manager, tells a journalist on the first page, \\"that there is no difference between God and the Devil in Africa. Whoever understands that in his blood and bones and guts, where true understanding resides, will swim in its treacherous currents; whoever doesn't will drown.\\"<br /><br />Africans, Fitzhugh thinks, instinctively understand this, but Westerners, particularly Americans, demand that things and people be one or the other. Being of a decidedly more jaded cast than the Americans Fitzhugh usually encounters, bush pilot and mercenary Wesley Dare, a Texan in his 50s who cultivates his cowboy reputation, has settled on a simpler, more sardonic creed:  \\"As a rule he had found it useful as well as prudent to trust his fellow man to do the right thing only when the wrong thing failed to suggest itself.\\"<br /><br />Caputo centers his story in the midst of the Sudanese civil war, in which the Arab north and the government seek to impose Islam on the animist and Christian south, primarily by ridding the area of its black population through slaughter and slave raids. The war, drought and famine give rise to an aid industry and the services that spring up around it.<br /><br />One of these is Knight Air, founded by Doug Braithwaite, a brash, charismatic American pilot, burning with ambition to save people and run his own airfreight company. Hearing that Fitzhugh has been fired from his UN relief-worker job for leaking the UN practice of burning surplus food, he feels an instant kinship with a man who breaks ranks to do the right thing. He hires Fitzhugh to scout out aid requirements and manage the company.<br /><br />Knight Air intends to fly aid to the Nuba, an isolated, mountainous area of Sudan which the government has declared off limits to outsiders, including UN aid groups, while bombing its villages and encouraging Arab raids for slaughter and slaves. With the addition of Wesley Dare, who has run into a financial snag in Kenya (reinforcing his opinion of the human race), the company gets off to a busy, daring and lucrative start.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Quinette Hardin, an evangelical Christian from Iowa, represents her church at a slave buy-back, redeeming black slaves from their Arab captors. Africa, with its privations, beauty and exotic alienness, has already had a profound effect on her. Her life is something of an aimless mess and in Sudan she sees the hope of a pure, worthwhile destiny. Then, listening to the slave stories, Quinette is seized by an almost visceral desire for revenge.  Shaken by her own reaction, she reflects, \\"what was this that had caused her to see herself, so clearly, as an avenging angel? Righteous wrath or the devil's ire?\\"<br /><br />Elsewhere in the Nuba, Ibrahim Idris, a semi nomadic cattle owner and Arab tribal chief, readies his men for another raid on the blacks. Idris feels ambivalent about the raid. His body is tired, he's ready for a quieter life and he distrusts the zealotry of the new Muslim government. But loyalty is more important to him than a few qualms about slaughtering villagers. And he'd like to regain his favorite slave, a runaway.<br /><br />Caputo's characters are complex and reflective. Self deception and righteous zeal set tragic events in motion, though Caputo always leaves his characters another decision, another chance to choose a more prudent course. Personal passions - from love to revenge - drive political events on all sides. All of them - with the exception of Doug - fall into variously inappropriate, but deeply passionate love affairs.<br /><br />The narrative moves among various character's points of view, again with the exception of Doug, who, save for a few flashbacks on his past, is seen primarily through Fitzhugh and Dare's eyes. \\"Dare had come to a conclusion about his partner: Doug was willing to do almost anything, but only after he persuaded himself that it was for the greater good of the human race.\\" Gripped by the passions that war and constant danger inflame, each character acts with faith in their judgment and belief in a higher power - be it God, Rightness, Love or some unstable combination.<br /><br />Fitzhugh is the most sympathetic and subtle character. He needs to be needed but has nothing against making a living and his love for a rich white do-gooder in her 50s comes across as baffling and believable. Dare is the most fun. He gets all the humor and his cynicism is born of long experience and self-knowledge, though he often acts contrary to his better judgment. Quinette, though engaging and estimable in her ability to adapt to Africa and find her strengths, is scary in her surrender to her passions.<br /><br />Caputo's story is grand, adventurous, moving and sobering. He draws us into righteous indignation against the Sudanese Arabs and then muddies the waters, reminding us that war never has right on its side. This is an ambitious, engrossing novel, which is as entertaining as it is serious.

Proud, isolated, prickly, rugged, driven and moody, she fiercely guards her solitary life, patrolling her island against invaders and incorporating the place into her art.<br /><br />\\"She craved isolation, and thought an island the most productive place for her to work as an artist. Focused. Find a center and stand there and work in place. The natural barrier of the sea would not only keep her in place but repel others, all those who felt the need to praise or critique her work, to talk about art rather than live it.\\"<br /><br />Her patrols of the island are not just to chase off tourist kayakers, but also a defense against an unknown invader who digs holes on her fragile island, mysterious, pointless holes. Hannah has never succeeded in catching sight of this intruder, but the sight of a new hole always shakes her.<br /><br />Caught up in Coomer's graceful, muscular prose, the reader soon absorbs his sense of place and feels at home inside Hannah's head. Although the story is told in the third person (but from Hannah's point of view) this identification between place and protagonist imbues the story with a salty, windswept romanticism.<br /><br />Hannah, despite her rigidity, unfriendliness and pretension, claims our interest and sympathy from the first, when she discovers an old dog washed up in the disused quarry at the center of her little island. \\"The first thing Hannah said to the dog: `I don't know if there's enough room for you on this island. I'm already here.' \\" Of course she is also calculating how to get the exhausted dog out of the quarry, though a part of her already shies from the distraction of affection. Hannah is not a person who cuts herself a lot of slack.<br /><br />\\"She believed so stringently in natural fibers that the comfort and warmth of her Polartec made her feel as if she were a backslider, a plastic heretic.\\"<br /><br />Yet we like her. Perhaps it's her eye; so observant and full of wonder and delight. Winching the dog out of the quarry, the sunlight falls on him as he rises: \\"He was surrounded by the reflection of light off flecks of mica and facets of quartz embedded in the granite face.\\"<br /><br />Or maybe it's the love she has for the island and Arno, the great-uncle who left it to her. The island days she recalls from her childhood and college years were few, but magical. On the island she was off the grid. School and city pace forgotten, she was a sternman on her uncle's lobster boat, bagging bait and banding keepers, part of a world regulated by the sea.<br /><br />But now Hannah, 34, lives for her artwork. Successful in her art, as most of her friends were not, Hannah finds herself with fewer friends each year. After Arno's death, shaken by the suicide of a lover she could not love, she travels to the island, and without really intending to, stays on. In the six years since, she's become increasingly jealous of her isolation and any intrusion that takes time from her art. She's proud of her commercial success.<br /><br />\\"It was self-serving to avoid the market, a selfishness born of fear and lassitude, and if it didn't support you then most likely your art was little more than an indulgence, little more than a hobby, simple masturbation.\\"<br /><br />She incorporates the dog into her days, but bigger things are to come. Her half-sister Emily sends a letter announcing the arrival of a boy on the run from his abusive father, followed immediately by the unwelcome boy, Will, a shy, skittish 17-year-old who regards Hannah nearly as suspiciously as she regards him.<br /><br />We know that Will's arrival will transform Hannah's life, but it's the journey - edgy, precarious, vulnerable - that keeps the pages turning. And there's more, lots more, than one woman's awakening to her need for human contact. Uncovering long-kept secrets, Coomer explores issues that shake the foundations of self-image and self-esteem, of the story one tells to oneself to make meaning of life.<br /><br />The characters, which come to include the half sister Emily and a local girl and her father and grandfather, occasionally seem too wise and too well spoken, but Coomer remembers to undercut this tendency from time to time with frailties and the usual human misunderstandings.<br /><br />Beautifully written and atmospheric, with a bit of Coomer's trademark humor, \\"Pocketful of Names\\" will sweep you up and leave you thinking.<br /><br />-Portsmouth Heraldf self-image and self-esteem, of the story one tells to oneself to make meaning of life. <br /> <br />The characters, which come to include the half sister Emily and a local girl and her father and grandfather, occasionally seem too wise and too well spoken, but Coomer remembers to undercut this tendency from time to time with frailties and the usual human misunderstandings. <br /> <br />Beautifully written and atmospheric, with a bit of Coomer's trademark humor, \\"Pocketful of Names\\" will sweep you up and leave you thinking. <br /> <br />-Portsmouth Herald	2005-06-06

It's 2000, and \\"a neighborhood like this, in a place like this, is a little like a guy in a cheap suit accidentally invited to a gallery opening.\\"<br /><br />Sam sits on his porch staring out at the bay, drinking vodka, smoking filtered Camels and talking to his dog. But when he discovers the body of his neighbor, a mean old lady universally disliked, something stirs. Maybe it's the engineer in him noticing things that don't quite fit. He volunteers to administer her meager estate, a job no one else wants, and soon makes himself enough of a nuisance to land in the hospital, concussed.<br /><br />An amateur boxer who keeps himself in shape and is not averse to physical contact (taking after his father who was beaten to death in a barroom brawl), Sam gives the police no help in finding his attacker and keeps on probing. Along the way he meets several smart and interesting women who seem to find him as attractive as he finds them, keeping possibilities in play, and has a few more brushes with violence, not all of them defensive.<br /><br />Knopf paces this stylish debut well, revealing his narrator's complex character as he unravels the tangle of his mystery, imbuing all with a strong sense of place. Sam, though likable from the start, grows on the reader as he doggedly pursues a mystery with nothing in it for him but the satisfaction of a job well done. Though damaged and stubborn, he's a man of integrity and cautious feeling.<br /><br />A part-time resident himself, Knopf also captures the feel of the Hamptons - greed drawn by natural beauty through no fault of its own, beleaguered locals edged out by rich summer people - and transports the reader to its village streets, sprawling mansions, neighborhood watering holes and spectacular vistas.<br /><br />With its snappy (though occasionally overlong) dialogue, intelligent humor and strong protagonist, readers will be glad there's at least one more Acquillo novel in the works.<br /><br />- The Portsmouth Heraldf the Hamptons - greed drawn by natural beauty through no fault of its own, beleaguered locals edged out by rich summer people - and transports the reader to its village streets, sprawling mansions, neighborhood watering holes and spectacular vistas. <br /> <br />With its snappy (though occasionally overlong) dialogue, intelligent humor and strong protagonist, readers will be glad there's at least one more Acquillo novel in the works. <br /> <br />- The Portsmouth Herald	2005-06-06

(Dortmunder Novels)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Dortmunder takes on the mob and a penthouse apartment	A fence and a thoroughly unpleasant human being, Arnie Albright sets the new John Dortmunder caper in motion. A man who \\"finds himself so disgusting, he shaves with his back to the mirror,\\" Albright calls his sometime burglar associate Dortmunder immediately on his return from Club Med. His relatives, who were about to kill him on general principles, sent him there as an intervention to improve his personality. Predictably, Albright hated the place, particularly the sun and the ocean, but he did have the good fortune to meet someone even more dislikable than himself.<br /><br />Preston Fareweather is condemned to remain at Club Med indefinitely, avoiding his ex-wives' process servers and amusing himself tormenting the vacationing gold diggers. At home in his Manhattan penthouse apartment is a fabulous art collection, all but unguarded.<br /><br />Meanwhile, something bad is happening at the O.J. Bar and Grill, where Dortmunder and his confederates have always met in the back room to work out their jobs. The back room is now off limits and some New Jersey mobsters are hanging around ruining business. On purpose.<br /><br />The narrative, as wry and hilarious as ever, focuses primarily on Dortmunder, a man with two missions, burglary and saving the O.J. But frequent digressions encompass other points of view: Fareweather, his latest vacationing opportunist, the O.J. owners past and present, Dortmunder's usual cronies and a new one, a young eager beaver who promises to endow future capers with a puppyish sense of fun. And, as always, the writing is great; the characters' eccentricities organic rather than gimmicky, the dialogue snappy and economical, the plot tidily constructed to supply many fateful, funny, disastrous twists and leave not a single loose end.<br /><br />- Portsmouth Herald	2005-06-06

It's a match made in old-fashioned heaven.<br /><br />As wickedly funny, if not as wicked, as his earlier \\"The War of the Roses,\\" Adler's \\"The Housewife Blues\\"  is a classically choreographed comedy of manners. The story, seen primarily through Jenny's eyes, takes place in the small New York apartment building where she spends her days.<br /><br />Larry, a shark of the new school, warns Jenny against her neighborly inclinations. But Jenny can't help but take an interest in the attractive couple upstairs, inviting them to a down-home dinner which makes Larry writhe in embarrassment and does not elicit a return invitation. And she can't turn a blind eye to the glum couple whose teenage son secretly visits the gay couple in the basement.<br /><br />Being home all day it's only natural she would accept a package for the brittle career-woman with the clandestine weekend lover or look after the gay couple's errant cat, or offer tea and cookies to the teenager when he loses his keys.<br /><br />Quickly enmeshed in their lives, Jenny keeps more of her activities from Larry while worrying over his big career move. Appalled and touched to discover that hard-nosed New Yorkers, given half a drop of encouragement, are a lot less reticent about their private affairs than the staid folks back home, she lends a squeamish ear and a generous heart.<br /><br />Then, at a painfully funny dinner party, Jenny learns more than she wants to know about her Larry. Her coming-of-age is fraught with struggles to keep her comfortable illusions while rationalizing her own secret life.<br /><br />Adler's style is straightforward and understated, his humor and observation no less sharp for being laconically delivered.

But Andy's apparent suicide allows police to close the case and Quinn is on his own.<br /><br />Well, almost. His sidekick, Jen Takamura, a sultry, mid-twenties, Japanese American photographer with green eyes, a fearless disposition and a corvette, sticks with him as they paw through the rubbish of Hollywood secrets, pursuing whispers of motive into the cushy enclaves of talk-show superstar Sissy Mizzell and her venerable husband, a Lorne Greene type with aspirations to be governor.<br /><br />The narrative segues from Quinn to the increasingly deranged murderer so the reader already knows who and almost why. This does not detract from the page-turner pace but it does require Ferrigno to come up with a bang-up twisty ending. He does not.

In searching for a suitable camp in North Luangwa they set out in an ancient truck with no radio and inadequate gear. After a grueling trek that would have sent sane mortals packing for home they separate so Mark can fly his Cessna to a site that \\"would make Cessna's insurance company shudder\\" while Delia makes the two-day trip alone with the old truck and a trailer over trackless hilly, bushy, gully-filled flood-plain terrain. Tracking animals they are constantly walking smack into a startled lion or buffalo or cornered elephant.<br /><br />But the real danger comes from people. \\"The Eye of the Elephant,\\" while filled with wildlife anecdotes and tidbits of information about elephants and lions, is really about the poaching war the Owens conducted on behalf of the besieged North Luangwa elephants.<br /><br />The poachers are villagers, many armed with AK47s, backed by the local government and assisted by the corrupt and underequipped local game guards. The Owens' weapons are education, cottage industry projects financed by the Owens Foundation for Wildlife Conservation and the Cessna.<br /><br />The battle starts genially with children exclaiming over magazine pictures and their parents joining sewing circles and carpentry workshops.

The story centers on the new marriage between chef Phil Randazzo, divorced, and anthropology professor Michelle Wickham, widowed. They each have children, and Phil's live with his ex-wife, who left him because he was a workaholic who couldn't connect emotionally.<br /><br />Phil worries about this judgment and tries hard, maybe too hard, to care about the things his new family cares about. He particularly tries to make room for the grief they all feel over the death of husband and father, A.P. Savoie, a popular Cajun musician. If he feels irritation over a certain lack of discipline in the house and an overindulged cat, he suppresses it as best he can.<br /><br />Michelle entered the marriage in hopes of remaking her life, \\"starting over.\\" But lately she's been having vivid dreams of Adrien, her dead husband. The latest one ended with Phil's rotting head on a satin pillow.<br /><br />With the couple stepping carefully and Michelle's children edgily eyeing the new spouse, the last thing they need is supernatural interference. It starts with small things, like the dreams and the cat passing through locked doors, but soon accelerates. On Thanksgiving Day, Phil sees a boy who isn't there, and Michelle recognizes his description as an adolescent version of Adrien. Shocked, she says nothing.<br /><br />Attuned to his wife's preoccupation and evasion, it doesn't take Phil long to put it together. As the appearances increase in frequency and intensity, Michelle dwells increasingly in the emotions of the past, good and bad. She feels Adrien is trying to communicate with her and the children. Phil reacts like a jealous husband with no rival to challenge. He's not concerned with communicating; he wants Adrien gone from their lives and will do whatever it takes.<br /><br />While the switching of viewpoints between Phil and Michelle works well, showing their divergent emotional states and unshared thoughts, the fraught by-play between them grows tedious and slows the narrative. While the ghost story is a mystery in itself - and a good one - this sometimes gets lost in the examination of the insecurities, hopes, misunderstandings and secrets of a marriage. But Harper's (\\"The Worst Day of My Life So Far\\") descriptions of New Orleans and Cajun culture lend color and flavor to the plot and a well-done ghost story, even one interrupted by relationships, is always a treat.chelle works well, showing their divergent emotional states and unshared thoughts, the fraught by-play between them grows tedious and slows the narrative.

He demands that Martin meet him for lunch, where he delivers the meat of the novel: a long, detailed narrative fueled by numerous manhattans. Leo's story covers the summer of 1943, when he joined his doctor father as a sort of apprentice. It was a summer that changed the course of his life.<br /><br />A perceptive, observant teenager, Leo admires his father, Samuel, whose powers of diagnosis and healing are legendary in Hobart, NJ. But Samuel, wholly dedicated to his patients, willing to make house calls any time of the day or night, is nevertheless unable to cure his wife of her drug addiction, an affliction that goes unmentioned in the household.<br /><br />Accompanying his father, Leo soon learns there's more to doctoring than medicine. Samuel's judgments about treatments often have a personal component and his personal judgments often run counter to Leo's less flexible moral standards.<br /><br />But when his dad lies to him about a dead junkman's cause of death, Leo begins to suspect him of something more sinister than unorthodox adoption arrangements and excessive leniency towards drunken, negligent parents. Enlisting the aid of his musical friend Harmony, Leo worms his way into the daily business of the junkyard, whose owner (the dead man's adoptive father) nurses a deep hatred of his father.<br /><br />Leo's absorbing narrative is richly shaded with the details of small-town, wartime life, the myriad secrets kept and shared by a community, the moral dilemmas of a strong-willed man, and the black and white judgments of youthful inexperience. And when it's completed, Martin, following in his father's footsteps, worries at the loose ends in his story and travels back two generations to unravel the still-festering secrets.<br /><br />While Leo's narrative is the well-written heart of this novel, it's also its only real problem. It's too detailed and finely written to be a brooding man's drunken ramble to his son. I kept wondering why Leo couldn't have come to Martin with a box of pages, saying, \\"here's a story I should have shared with you years ago,\\" or something like that. Though I didn't find this a small flaw, it didn't stop me reading this compelling novel, and it likely won't stop most readers.father's footsteps, worries at the loose ends in his story and travels back two generations to unravel the still-festering secrets. <br /> <br />While Leo's narrative is the well-written heart of this novel, it's also its only real problem.

Ofri is still at Bellevue as an attending physician and editor of the Bellevue Literary Review.<br /><br />This second reflective and graceful book of essays ranges over her experiences since - from far-flung temp positions during a post-qualifying travel break to her own rude awakening as a patient during her first pregnancy. But the bulk of the book revolves around Bellevue; the month-long rotations on hospital wards and the ongoing clinic practice which is her base. In the hospital rotations her interaction with a patient is intense, but finite. She prefers the clinic where the people are less sick, but the relationship is ongoing.<br /><br />The book opens with Ofri's first experience as a patient dismayed by a busy doctor's delivery of fear-inducing news, the intimidation inherent in the relationship, and the medical professional's casual use of jolting jargon, like \\"high risk.\\" In one of the last essays, she delivers her baby and discovers the reality of being an ordinary patient:<br /><br />\\"I had no idea how much shame and humiliation are part of the experience: from the horrid gowns that never cover enough, to the exposure of some of the most private and embarrassing bodily functions, to the smells and sights which one is forced to wallow in, to the helplessness and inability to assert one's control.\\" Ofri does get to exert control though, when eventually she succumbs to the temptation to throw her weight around - \\"I am an attending physician on faculty here\\" - and service improves dramatically.<br /><br />She describes an ordinary chaotic day in the clinic, capped with anguish when she discovers an elderly Chinese man has a brain tumor and the language barrier prevents her from offering comfort or even information. There's lots of that - the problems of communicating in a place that encompasses so many immigrants. Communications problems do not always stem only from the lack of language interpreters, but also from cultural gulfs.<br /><br />Ofri is no saint and she's often driven to the edge by frustration - too little time, too many demands, unsympathetic patients. One woman, always accompanied by her young daughter as translator, is a non-compliant, depressed hypochondriac whose arrival fills Ofri with teeth-gritting dread. Until a simple query from the daughter opens her eyes to the real pain that reverberates through the woman's family.<br /><br />Ofri's treatments often stray outside medical boundaries. She negotiates ways for immigrant children to stay in school rather than accompany non-English speaking parents to the clinic; tutors a boy for the SAT test because her best recommendation for his long-term health was \\"to take the SAT and get into college.\\"<br /><br />Issues of poverty, helplessness, dignity and medical ethics dominate. A number of essays deal with terminal issues, two at length. In the first, \\"Living Will,\\" a man with numerous debilitating health issues stops taking essential medication and lands in the emergency room. Once there, he allows emergency personnel to bypass his living will and ventilate him. This is either a panicky instinct from a man who can't breathe or the spark of a will to live. Like most doctors, Ofri decides the man really wants to live and helps to treat his depression and equip him with a modicum of dignity and usefulness.<br /><br />The second essay is a bit more invasive. Elderly Mrs. Binet, also with multiple problems, decides to quit dialysis, in effect announcing her will to die. The resident in charge accepts this decision as does Ofri initially, but then she has second thoughts. What terminal illness does the woman have? None. Her life is a misery of pain, pills, procedures and complications, but she is not terminal. Ofri visits the woman and gently but insistently persuades her to postpone death while the doctors work harder on her pain problems. Although the case ends with Mrs. Binet going to the nursing home she so wanted to avoid, Ofri recalls the pleasure she took in eating a meal. Whether she did Mrs. Binet any favors is something with which the reader may quibble.<br /><br />Ofri is compassionate and painstakingly moral. She is keenly aware of how the structure of her job distances her and insulates her from the poverty, cultural differences, fears and illness of her patients. She takes to heart the lessons they have to teach her, and works to remember that the very fact of illness is a handicap, and the position of being a patient is a disadvantage.<br /><br />Ofri's intimate, anecdotal prose conveys wonder, humility and pride. For the duration of each essay her struggles are ours and - most of the time - the reader will applaud her judgment. Ofri's books contribute greatly to a dialogue on the doctor-patient relationship that only grows more urgent and difficult as medical treatments advance and doctors grown more specialized.<br /><br />Portsmouth Heralduades her to postpone death while the doctors work harder on her pain problems.

The pirates responsible for abandoning the sailors and stealing their boat - a rich prize captured from the French by Capt. Lewrie, Royal Navy - are four young French Creoles from New Orleans. Depraved, idle, rich and spoiled, these two brothers, their beautiful sister and a fourth man, determined to win the girl by proving his bloodlust, have taken up the cause of ousting the Spanish and returning New Orleans to its rightful French masters.<br /><br />Lewrie, who would very much like to catch these pirates, finds himself down the Mississippi without a boat of his own. He has been ordered on a covert mission to scout out the political landscape and work out the feasibility of a British invasion to take over New Orleans. Posing as a security detail for a wealthy merchant shipper, he soon makes the steamy acquaintance of Charit&eacute;, the ravishing and wanton female pirate, as well as her brothers and would-be lover, and an American contingent clearly up to the same invasion scouting as Lewrie.<br /><br />There's a cartoony element to the swashbuckling - lots of \\"gawping\\" and \\"japing\\" - and the evil characters are particularly, but colorfully, one-dimensional. And the sex scenes are lustily over-the-top. But there's humor too and the historical setting is rich, deep and fascinating. Patrick O'Brian fans may not be satisfied, but those who would just as soon leave the social byplay out of their naval adventure should enjoy it.<br /><br />Portsmouth Herald	2005-05-09

With his first novel, Worrall clearly hopes, with some success, to appeal to the latter, who are as interested in the intricacies of shipboard life as they are in the heroics of battle.<br /><br />Worrall opens his story with the British and Spanish fleets blasting away at each other.  It's 1797 and Charles Edgemont, 25, is second lieutenant on the Argonaut, a small British ship bringing up the rear and seeing little action. Until, that is, the Spanish break for Spain and the Argonaut is ordered to stop them. Horrific confusion ensues, the two senior officers are killed, and Edgemont becomes an accidental captain and an accidental hero.<br /><br />This battle launches his career, though Edgemont is keenly aware how little he had to do with any of it. Defeated Spanish ships - prizes - have made him a rich man and he heads home in triumph, a frigate command secure in his future. All he needs to complete his success is a wife, and Charles is quickly smitten. But Penelope Brown is a Quaker, a committed pacifist.<br /><br />To salve his broken heart Charles accepts a temporary command and goes looking for privateers on the Irish Sea. This is the second of three very different boats he captains during the course of this novel and each one, while seeking lots of action, offers special challenges in handling the crew.<br /><br />Worrall gets into plenty of detail on the structure and character of shipboard life, including the dilemmas facing a captain who requires discipline but is all too aware of the injustices visited upon the crew, ranging from forced conscription to death at the captain's pleasure. From the galley to the stinking bilges, Worrall knows his ships and vividly recreates them and the men who make them sail.<br /><br />Worrall's debut is promising, but there is a problem. Edgemont is too lucky, too good. He wins all his battles, makes only smart decisions, and inspires his crews and his officers. There isn't enough tension; nothing serious to overcome, no personal enemies to defeat or win over. Of course, these are fixable problems - not something serious like a dislikable protagonist or an inability to write - and this O'Brian fan is reserving judgment until Edgemont's next adventure.<br /><br />Portsmouth Heraldisions, and inspires his crews and his officers.

It's difficult to discuss the effect of this book without disclosing key elements of the plot; on the other hand part of Ishiguro's art is the gradual revelation of horrifying detail.<br /><br />Though I was careful not to read any reviews that would further \\"spoil\\" the book for me (as I will try not to for you) I knew the basic premise before I began the book and was actually rather glad I did. It helped me identify with the narrator, Kathy, who, at 31, already possesses all the knowledge she will slowly reveal to the reader, as it was slowly revealed to her.<br /><br />As the novel opens Kathy is in her last year of a career that has lasted 11 years, much longer than the average.  She is a \\"carer,\\" a nurse who looks after \\"donors,\\" people who are surgically relieved of body parts. Kathy is proud of the job she does: \\"My donors have always tended to do much better than expected. Their recovery times have been impressive, and hardly any of them have been classified as `agitated,' even before fourth donation.\\"<br /><br />As Kathy prepares herself for the next stage of her life, she looks back on her childhood at idyllic Hailsham, her home and school. Her voice is matter-of-fact plaintive; her story imbued with a quiet acceptance that heightens the emotional impact.<br /><br />Ishiguro sets the novel in 1990s England, a world we see only from Kathy's outsider view. She and the other Hailsham children live wholly at the facility. They don't mix with other people. They are not permitted outside its comfortable and spacious confines, though it never occurs to them to want to go anywhere else. Stories of unknown origin circulate among the children of horrible things that happen to children who venture out.<br /><br />Classes at Hailsham seem fairly typical except for the weekly medical exams, which Kathy mentions in passing as she recalls the importance of art and creativity among the Hailsham students. Creativity was strongly encouraged and periodic \\"Exchanges\\" were set up when students could buy art from other students in their year, building up their personal collections. But her friend Tommy, who excelled at sports, was no good at art and never contributed to the Exchanges. As a consequence he was ostracized, teased and bullied.<br /><br />Though many other things have come clear in the intervening years, Kathy has always been mystified as to why art was so important at Hailsham. Their best pieces were taken away and presented to an outsider, known only as Madame, who never spoke to the students. The kids think of her as \\"snooty,\\" until Kathy's friend Ruth declares that she's afraid of them and their group of girls decides to test this theory. It's a lighthearted dare until they actually go through with it, almost bumping into Madame on her arrival. In an instant, their mood changes.<br /><br />\\"Ruth had been right: Madame was afraid of us. But she was afraid of us in the same way someone might be afraid of spiders. We hadn't been ready for that. It had never occurred to us to wonder how we would feel, being seen like that, being the spiders.\\"<br /><br />So if the very sight of them makes her shudder, what does Madame want with their best art?<br /><br />Kathy takes us through the normal formation of cliques and crushes, small details of their \\"specialness\\" revealed as they pass from childhood into adolescence. \\"Tommy thought it possible the guardians had, throughout all our years at Hailsham, timed very carefully and deliberately everything they told us, so that we were always just too young to understand properly the latest piece of information. But of course we'd take it in at some level, so that before long all this stuff was there in our heads without us ever having examined it all properly.\\"<br /><br />Ishiguro builds this world detail by detail - love affairs, squabbles, aspirations and expectations - combining the mundane with the monstrous to create an atmosphere in which it all seems quite horribly plausible, given the feats the human mind has been capable of through history. He examines the psychology of authority, acceptance, denial, otherness and manipulation and reaches deep into the human heart to leave the reader with a dark, visceral, lingering horror.<br /><br />- Portsmouth Heraldall seems quite horribly plausible, given the feats the human mind has been capable of through history.

The novel starts with the wife of a French bureaucrat, Anna Heymes, undergoing tests to diagnose her terrifying memory lapses and hallucinations. Anna's memory gaps most often involve her husband, whose face suddenly appears a stranger's. A prominent doctor diagnoses a brain lesion, but Anna adamantly refuses a biopsy. Instead she visits a psychiatrist who suggests a traumatic shock rather than a lesion may be the cause and prescribes hypnosis to explore her past. With trauma in mind, Anna's feverish paranoia conjures up a far-fetched plot and her investigation leads to a baffling and horrifying discovery about herself.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Paris police detective Paul Nerteaux investigates a serial killer who has so far murdered three Polish women, illegal immigrants, in the Polish quarter of Paris. The killings are so grisly that some readers will prefer to avert their eyes. Paul is ambitious but not well versed in the traffic in illegals or the workings of the Polish community, particularly the sweatshops where the victims worked. So he teams up with a retired cop, Jean-Louis Schiffer, a man with an unsavory reputation for brutality.<br /><br />Alternating between the two, Grang&eacute; (\\"Blood Red Rivers,\\" \\"Flight of the Storks\\") gradually reveals a link as he explores the basest proclivities of human nature and the willingness to exploit others.

Strict rules require anonymous donors and forbid the cloning of a living person. However, given the nature of cloning, these rules seem made to be broken. Surely some eccentric billionaire will want a chance to bring himself (or herself) up properly. But that's not quite the twist Guilfoile takes in his complex and absorbing debut thriller.<br /><br />When the police are unable to discover his daughter's killer, Dr. Moore collects her effects and discovers a sample of the rapist's sperm inadvertently included. Before his rage has fully subsided, a plan has formed. He will create a clone from this sample and look into the face of his daughter's killer. While the prospect of foisting such a biological legacy on unsuspecting parents pales beside the prospect of actually creating this human being for this purpose, Moore, heretofore no monster, avidly tracks the child's rocky progress through his childhood years.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a subplot follows the exploits of Mickey the Gerund, a religious nut who indulges his murderous zeal by killing cloning doctors and abortion clinicians. And later in the novel a computer game - a mirror version of the real world - Shadowland, enters the story as a woman police detective and Justin Finn, the cloned boy, team up to search for a real (and shadow) serial killer.<br /><br />While the Shadowland echo of reality introduces a note of enjoyably mind-bending confusion, the story, from the beginning, hums with tension, and carries an aura of moving inexorably toward cataclysm. Guilfoile's approach to the implicit questions of nature versus nurture, and free will versus biological destiny is as playful as it is thoughtful.<br /><br />A talented writer, Guilfoile has produced a character-driven plot in which human choices drive the action, accident and misunderstanding play crucial roles, and the surprise ending carries a powerful sting.<br />A talented writer, Guilfoile has produced a character-driven plot in which human choices drive the action, accident and misunderstanding play crucial roles, and the surprise ending carries a powerful sting.	2005-04-19

For Rebecca Monroe, a specialist in pop culture, the daily tenor of British life in her late 1970's childhood can be measured and dated by television, while family parties - the elaborate kind which involve days of cooking and a frenzy of cleaning - mark seminal events, which tend to be catastrophic.<br /><br />The first of these was Christmas 1942 when the hostess' wartime chocolateless chocolate cake was trumped by her sister's real, honest-to-god trifle. \\"There was silence. And then the unmistakable sound of a silver spoon plunging into a combination of sponge and custard and real cream. They all visualized the action before they turned their heads and saw Alicia Cragley, twelve years old, with skin that was whiter than snow and lips that were redder than blood.\\" Alicia was Rebecca's grandmother and it was at this moment that Herbert, her first cousin, determined to marry her.<br /><br />The second of these is a celebration of Prince Charles' 1981 wedding to Diana, put on by Rebecca's mother, Doreen, which ends with her death.<br /><br />Rebecca,  slowly suffocating in marriage to Alistair, a behavioral geneticist who has enrolled her in one of his academic experiments because of her grandparents' blood relationship and her mother's instability, wants a child. But Alistair, increasingly remote, refuses.<br /><br />Is it that he doesn't want a child, she wonders, or that he doesn't want her child? Pondering this question, she looks for signs of nature and nurture in the events of her childhood, dwelling particularly on the two years before her mother's death, and ranging back to explore the years between those two fateful parties.<br /><br />In 1979 she and her cousin, Lucy, both 8-years-old, spent secret hours trying to figure out sex by studying Lucy's parents' racy books and looking up words in the dictionary (Rebecca has since retained the dictionary habit and heads chapters and sections with relevant dictionary entries).<br /><br />Rebecca's mother maintains vigorous standards of British propriety, dress and discipline, while Lucy's mother, Suzanne (Doreen's sister), embraces modernity - women's liberation, hippie informality and rebellion against the social order. Rebecca's older sister, Tiffany, the perfect one, begins to have doubts about her paternity, sparking vague ideas and observations in Rebecca who is too young to know how to handle a tiny bit of dangerous knowledge or fallacy.<br /><br />Rebecca alternates these childhood memories (footnoted with academic summaries of `70s TV shows) with her grandmother's story of forbidden love, and her own history and present with Alistair.

Ikmen's team includes a modern female sergeant and an unhappily married, but traditional upper-class male sergeant, suffering a mutual attraction, as well as a secular Jewish constable on the dismaying cusp of middle age, and an Armenian pathologist.<br /><br />Ancient animosities between Armenians and Turks bubble to the surface when a young man's body is found in a house leased by an affluent, mysterious Armenian who has disappeared, leaving the place devoid of furniture and food. The boy, pocked with needle marks, also has a garrote wound around his neck and seems to have been confined to an upstairs room. An autopsy discovers synthetic heroin in his blood, seldom found outside a medical setting, and a long-term atrophy of his limbs, as if the boy's confinement had been lengthy.<br /><br />The investigation delves into a sordid ring of pedophilia, prostitution, kidnapping and drug use and some readers will solve the case well before Ikmen.

While Moaveni battled her mother over Madonna's music, Hakakian rioted against a fanatical headmistress who found sin in a strand of female hair.<br /><br />Hakakian describes a rather idyllic childhood in a quiet house in Tehran's \\"Alley of the Distinguished.\\" She is the only daughter of a Jewish schoolmaster and scholar, beloved baby sister to three brothers. Her closest friend, Z, is a Muslim neighbor girl and her first inkling of the stirrings abroad were the political speeches Z's older sister and her devout Great-Uncle listened to in secret.<br /><br />Though one by one her three older brothers are sent out of the country, Hakakian finds herself caught up in the heady togetherness of revolution. \\"Within weeks, Tehran seemed to have matured by years. Even drunkards stopped ranting about their personal misery. Neighbors did not fight. Cars honked constantly, but not in gridlock, only to announce the advance of the uprising, or the fall of another barracks.\\"<br /><br />She explores the child's perceptions: the jangly scariness of her parents' tense arguments and distressed uncertainty contrast unfavorably with the liberation let loose in the streets. But almost immediately anti-Semitic slogans appear on walls. The Hakakians sell their home and move into an apartment. Islamic dress is imposed and then the Jewish headmistress vanishes one day, and her Muslim replacement asks Hakakian why Jewish men customarily deflower their daughters.<br /><br />Still, politics remains a youthful focal point and the young intellectuals exercise their idealism in dissent. Another moment of startling clarity comes when the group is caught with incriminating papers, and dismissed as irrelevant as soon as they are discovered to be Jewish.<br /><br />As idealism fades and repression casts a dark gloom over daily life, Hakakian discovers that her old friend Z has grown grave and distant, Z's older sister, the fervent revolutionary, jailed and tortured, her mother's spirit broken.<br /><br />Hakakian's story is a layered, nuanced remembrance of one girl's awakening to adulthood, a Jewish view of Iran's upheaval, and a chronicle of a country's nightmarish descent from liberation into a maelstrom of repression and fear.<br /><br />Portsmouth Herald, March 27, 2005ssed as irrelevant as soon as they are discovered to be Jewish. <br /> <br />As idealism fades and repression casts a dark gloom over daily life, Hakakian discovers that her old friend Z has grown grave and distant, Z's older sister, the fervent revolutionary, jailed and tortured, her mother's spirit broken. <br /> <br />Hakakian's story is a layered, nuanced remembrance of one girl's awakening to adulthood, a Jewish view of Iran's upheaval, and a chronicle of a country's nightmarish descent from liberation into a maelstrom of repression and fear. <br /> <br />Portsmouth Herald, March 27, 2005	2005-04-05

His protagonist, Nick Guest, 23 at the start, son of an antiques appraiser, has a room in the attic of an Oxford classmate's parents' London home, while he pursues his graduate work in the literature of Henry James.<br /><br />The house is home to Gerald Fedder, Member of Parliament, his wealthy wife, his unstable, angry daughter, Catherine (who Nick baby-sits when her urge for self-mutilation becomes overwhelming), and Toby, Nick's friend and secret crush. Toby, however, is thoroughly straight. A slightly older man, Leo, a black Jamaican, definitely not upper class, initiates Nick into the lusty mysteries of sex.<br /><br />Immersed in the heady realms of wealth and privilege, Nick is tentative and shy, even cowardly, but soon he has left Leo behind and immersed himself in a dangerous, fast-track, glittering world of drugs and sex and a secret affair with a super-wealthy former classmate, Wani, who is engaged to be married.<br /><br />Hollinghurst explores Thatcherite politics and scandal, and gay life in the dawn and devastating early days of AIDS, as well as issues of class, cowardice, and pleasure. The prose is exquisite, with Jamesian richness, attention to detail and character nuance, and the satire is subtle and sly. Nevertheless, a young man's obsession with sex, no matter how gorgeously and wittily described, grows tedious, and Nick's immersion in the life is his first and foremost preoccupation.<br /><br />Portmouth Herald, March 27, 2005	2005-04-05

Her memoir is intimate, but even more than that, it's youthful. It's full of youthful exuberance, impetuousness, anger and, well, self-absorption. Moaveni was born to affluent &eacute;migr&eacute; Iranians in Palo Alto, California, shortly before the Iranian revolution. While her elders pined for home, Moaveni wanted only to be let alone to be a normal California girl. But the fit was never quite right.<br /><br />Then, in her 20s, she gets a chance to try being Iranian. She arrives in Tehran, a reporter for \\"Time\\" magazine, in 2000. She shares the patriotic fervor of the early reform movement and the bitter alienation that accompanied its failure. She interviews patronizing politicians and endures regular meetings with the scary secret police. She attends volatile, heady, ultimately dangerous demonstrations. She reconnects with family and throws herself into the social/political stream. And she gravitates towards the young, who now make up the majority of the population, and don't require as much complexity from her inadequate Farsi as bureaucrats and sharp-tongued relatives.<br /><br />Ironically, growing up in a strict theocracy has made young Iranians irreligious. They lavish much of their ingenuity on circumventing the system; using holy days as pretexts for parties to show off their sexiest fashions, pushing the envelope with make-up, bared toes and elbows, and devising stratagems to meet the opposite sex and avoid the paramilitary thugs who enforce dress codes and morals with sticks and fists.<br /><br />But it's not just the young. \\"Made neurotic by the innate oppressiveness of restriction, Iranians were preoccupied with sex in the manner of dieters constantly thinking about food....Viagra had recently debuted in Tehran, and a day did not pass when I didn't hear a handful of fresh jokes about its powers. At the bank. During an interview. In line for pastry.\\"<br /><br />Moaveni embraces Iran, if not its mullahs (many of her funniest and/or bitterest passages are dedicated to their sexual and ethical depravity), enthusiastically. From the moment she arrives she thinks of herself as Iranian and expects everyone else to do the same, despite her accented Farsi, her U.S. passport, her Western notions of privacy and her Californian requirements concerning food and exercise.  This expectation makes for some fractious moments, as well as plenty of humor.<br /><br />Moaveni's observant eye and affectionate voice convey the feel of an ancient, vigorous city and its vibrant, repressed middle and upper class. We don't see the slums or the rural poor and only get glimpses of the traditional religious. But this is a memoir of one young woman's coming of age, and her portrait of Iran, delivered in lively, colorful prose is a personal and impassioned one.<br /><br />Portsmouth Herald, March 27ntly debuted in Tehran, and a day did not pass when I didn't hear a handful of fresh jokes about its powers.

It sounds like the ultimate gimmick, but in British author Kelly's skillful hands Laura Dryden's sporadic struggles to communicate are integral to the genesis and development of this quirky, unusual series.<br /><br />A former soap opera star, Laura was left in a coma after a car accident on the Cambridgeshire Fens four years earlier. Her husband Philip left his high-powered Fleet Street job to become star reporter for the local weekly and sit by her hospital bed.<br /><br />This second outing (after \\"The Water Clock\\") finds Philip at his wife's bedside on a summer day. \\"The figure on the bed didn't move. Its immobility was a constant in his life, like the heat of that summer, and equally oppressive.\\" Sharing his wife's room is a local woman, Maggie Beck, who, back in 1977, recovering from the death of her parents and son, had helped Philip's newly widowed mother.<br /><br />Maggie's parents and baby had been killed by the crash of a US military plane. Ironically, Maggie had rescued an American infant thrown free of the wreckage. Now dying, Maggie needs Philip's help to share a deathbed secret.<br /><br />Meanwhile, as Philip attempts to track down Maggie's daughter and her American traveling companion, a man is dying of thirst, tethered in a concrete bunker, a glass of water left just beyond his reach. And a young barmaid disappears after being drugged and raped, also in a bunker, according to the pornographic photographs of her making the rounds. And a group of illegal African immigrants suffer the summer's hellish heat in the back of a locked truck container.<br /><br />While Kelly tracks these story lines from various points of view, it's up to Philip to follow the leads and discover each victim's fate, with a bit of help from friends like a bird-watching police detective and an alcoholic American major, both hanging on for retirement. Then there's Humph, Philip's silent, misanthropic driver, and Laura, tapping out an occasional cryptic message between reams of gibberish.<br /><br />Kelly seems equally at home with heart-shattering pain and dark, nimble humor. Philip is cynical, kind, heart sore and responsible. Prone to private self-criticisms, his bravest acts are motivated by the fear of being discovered a coward.

Growing up in the Washington DC suburbs during World War II, graduating high school in 1950, Holland, author of 14 non-fiction books, reanimates a bygone world when \\"the Father's chair\\" was sacrosanct and mothers never sat at all but fussed endlessly over their families. Except for her mother, who belonged in a category all her own: \\"Mothers and my mother.\\"<br /><br />Holland's mother is brilliant, attractive, talented, and about as unmaternal as a mother of five can be. A skilled carpenter and artist who believes her place is in the milieu she's least suited to - the home  - she emerges as a complex, sympathetic character with dozens of quirks (not all of them endearing), who shuns housekeeping for murder mysteries.<br /><br />Holland's stepfather, on the other hand, receives no such complex attention. He's a monster with only two dimensions, cold and brutal, and at long last Holland has her revenge on him. She calls him \\" `Carl,' since that wasn't his name.\\" \\"Just thinking his name brings him back too vividly and I can even remember his smell, not noxious but sharp and distinct like a whiff of danger in the forest.\\" Her real father was lost to divorce early on and nobody explained things to children in those days. Lucky for her, her grandmother anchored her childhood, a constant, if undemonstrative presence, with whom she spent most of her weekends.<br /><br />Holland, writing as an adult, with an adult's horror and sympathy, appears comfortable with the elasticity and vagaries of memory. She conveys the immediacy of the child's world - the acuteness of perception, vulnerabilities and emotion - and accepts the large blurry patches from which islands of vividness emerge, inking the spaces with evocations of the daily round. Her chapter headings evoke the past with Dickensian humor, beginning with: \\"In Which the Chairs & Domestic Habits of Fathers Are Explored, & Nick Is Born.\\"<br /><br />She was five when Nick, her younger brother, appeared. \\"I was horrified....He howled when Carl was trying to read his paper; he howled at night when Carl needed his sleep. He fouled his diapers and made outrageous demands on Mother's time and attention, even during dinner. He was totally ignorant of the danger he was in; how could he know? He just got here.\\" It was her job to save them both from being cast out of the house into the street. \\"Apparently Mother didn't understand the danger either. She had, as I said, a great capacity for refusing to notice.\\"<br /><br />School was the bane of Holland's existence, second only to Carl: \\"School & I Struggle with Each Other, Plus Hard Times with the Old Testament.\\" The social maneuvering baffled her, numbers were a threatening mystery, each day was a looming dread. Reading, however, was a miracle, and she read voraciously, \\"shucking the self gladly like a shirt full of fleas.\\"<br /><br />In elementary school she was called on to read the Bible to her class each morning. A methodical child, unfamiliar with the Bible, she prepared herself by starting at the beginning. The \\"sheer meanness of God\\" shocked her. She cried hardest at the fate of Lot's wife: \\"Struck down for a moment's homesickness.\\" \\"I wanted no more of God. He was Carl on a cosmic scale. When He put His foot down, everyone died.\\"<br /><br />Then came war, a time of change. A girl from California came to class wearing Bermuda shorts, a Northern family descended with a white housekeeper, Republicans moved into the neighborhood. Food deteriorated but children, just as they had before the war, \\"ate what was put in front of them, without comment, and barely noticed.\\" Mother went to work. \\"Fathers, by definition, came home from the day's work exhausted and surly. Mother came home sparkling all over as if from a light fall of snow.\\"<br /><br />In school there were air raid drills and in Florida, where she spent summers, German submarines prowled the waters, sinking oil tankers, and fighter planes practiced offshore. \\"In Washington the war, though great fun, was largely imaginary; on Florida's east coast it was actually happening.\\"<br /><br />After the war there was Joe McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities Committee, which put the fear of State into many of their friends and neighbors, though not Holland's socialist grandmother, who resigned from teaching rather than sign the loyalty oath. There was also polio and the nuclear threat, which progressed from backyard shelters to evacuation to the end of life on earth.<br /><br /> \\"The Long Dark Night of Junior High School,\\" ended with the blossoming of a wonderful, intense friendship, her first with a soul mate, and high school brought a succession of bad-boy boyfriends, then after graduation she fell into a stultifying depression. But Holland leaves us on a high note, \\"In Which I Am Saved Again & Live Happily Ever After:\\" saved by a job - nothing special about it, except the independence of a paycheck, no small thing, then or now.<br /><br />Holland draws us into a time when big families were the norm, mothers stayed home and had black household help, children roamed at will, and people ate creamed chicken and pineapple upside down cake. In school history was male, girls weren't expected to do math or allowed to take shop and Latin was still offered. Funny, poignant, even savage, Holland's memoir will inspire you to seek out her other books, which cover a wide range of subjects from the irreverent presidential short takes of \\"Hail to the Chiefs,\\" to \\"They Went Whistling,\\" a wry and lively account of history's forgotten females, and \\"Gentleman's Blood,\\" a sharp-witted history of dueling.all of snow.\\" <br /> <br />In school there were air raid drills and in Florida, where she spent summers, German submarines prowled the waters, sinking oil tankers, and fighter planes practiced offshore. \\"In Washington the war, though great fun, was largely imaginary; on Florida's east coast it was actually happening.\\" <br /> <br />After the war there was Joe McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities Committee, which put the fear of State into many of their friends and neighbors, though not Holland's socialist grandmother, who resigned from teaching rather than sign the loyalty oath.

This final volume in a long and lauded career of travel writing and fiction looks back at the journey that got him started in 1934. It's actually a retelling of his first book, a mostly forgotten Wodehouse-inspired piece called \\"Spanish Adventure.\\"<br /><br />The journey begins at the behest - and expense - of Lewis' father-in-law Ernesto Corvaja, a Sicilian of Spanish ancestry. In hopes of finding his family fondly remembered in Seville, he sends his son Eugene Corvaja and Lewis to Spain to pay their respects to the Corvaja tomb. However, Spain is on the brink of its bloody civil war between the fascists and communists.<br /><br />The young men cross the border from France, with some delays and difficulties, to bask in the tranquil flow of life in San Sebastian. In contrast to France, \\"No one was in a hurry, or carried a parcel, and there were no clocks.\\" Despite a few minor inconveniences - disrupted phone service, a sightseeing drive cut short by armed guards, a sinister police visit to their hotel - the two are chiefly discomfited by the closing of the local cabaret and equally reassured by its abrupt reopening.<br /><br />The next day an official \\"State of Alarm\\" is declared, the trains stop running and both experienced  \\"a sensation that the personality of this town had undergone a remarkable change. The people of San Sebastian, as we had agreed, seemed to set great store by matters of personal deportment.\\" But, \\"at this moment San Sebastian seemed full of running figures and queues had formed at the doors of food shops with desperate would-be customers struggling to get in. Such was the confusion that even the paseos were abandoned.\\" The paseo being a delightful, healthful evening stroll at which the citizenry, particularly the young, could see and be seen.<br /><br />The upheaval continues, on again, off again. Plans are derailed but not their goal. They will reach Seville, zigzagging across Spain, taking a side jog through Portugal, moving by bus, train, truck, car and foot. Through it all, Lewis is alive to fresh enjoyments. Mounting a decrepit bus (even the driver at first refuses to board), they cross a spectacular mountain range. \\"Our exhaust thundered and rumbled as we hustled through narrow, rocky valleys, dislodging flocks of jackdaws and doves from the trees like alternating avalanches of soot and snow.\\"<br /><br />But first, Lewis and Corvaja must wend their way to Madrid, in hopes of a train to Seville. Various kindly Spaniards provide rides in defiance of the official \\"State of Alarm,\\" but 100 miles from the nearest train to Madrid, all private vehicles grind to a halt. So the young men walk.<br /><br />The country is rural and poor and many people live in caves they have dug out of the ground. \\"These could have been villagers in cottages which through an earthquake of exceptional violence had toppled into holes in the earth from which roofs, chimneys, and even a window sometimes appeared.\\" But a second glance shows the structures to be deliberately constructed, \\"rent-free and cool in summer.\\"<br /><br />Corvaja is something of a naturalist and Lewis' welcoming curiosity finds rewards in every bend in the road. His descriptions of the sun-warmed, sparsely populated plains with their silent inhabitants who ring church bells as the strangers pass to warn the next village of their approach, segue into chilly \\"winter-scented\\" rains which fall on isolated rain forests teeming with wildlife, which give way to fierce partisans in Zaragosa, a city of extreme wealth and poverty.<br /><br />Lewis is essentially an easygoing person. When Corvaja informs him fairly early on that he is a card-carrying communist who fully intends to join the insurrection, Lewis takes this in stride. Only when Corvaja is on the brink of running off does Lewis dissuade him with a very reasonable, British argument of family obligation. Not that Corvaja seems all that difficult to dissuade. The \\"Red Army\\" never materializes and the promised legions turn out to be small rag-tag bands that melt away into the countryside leaving red flags behind. But there's plenty of danger.<br /><br />Snipers in Madrid force peaceful citizens to move about with their hands in the air, or sometimes on all fours. In search of libation and a bit of social life, the pair finds themselves herded at gunpoint, questioned by the police and drinking in bullet-studded bars. Later, fleeing through brambles, Lewis tears open his leg on barbed wire.<br /><br />But his attitude remains understated in a way that captures the youthful sense of adventure, along with the old man's unstated marvel at the young's casual risk of life. Written from notes and journals as well as memory, the journey conveys immediacy, not nostalgia, but also conveys the fondness of an old man for an experience that led to a lifelong thirst for more.<br /><br />The Portsmouth Herald, April 3, 2005of family obligation.

He has the reporter's pleasure of research and nosiness, and the novelist's freedom to call on imagination to supply what's missing from the record.<br /><br />His first novel, a fictionalized memoir, \\"The Final Confession of Mabel Stark,\\" was a raucous, atmospheric portrait of a real female tiger trainer in the heyday of the big circus. His second couldn't be more different, except that it's also based on real people and real events.<br /><br />Hough sticks closer to fact in this contemporary sea story, working from participant interviews and official documents. The harrowing tale, which many readers will remember from newspaper accounts, begins with two Romanian stowaways discovered aboard the container ship Maersk Dubai in March 1996. The Filipino bosun, Rodolfo Miguel, escorts them to the Taiwanese officers who argue briefly among themselves before reaching a decision that fills Rodolfo with horror.<br /><br />What follows is a deliberate, detailed recreation of the Romanians' last moments. Though they share no common language with the Filipino crew or Taiwanese officers, understanding is not long in coming. \\"Rodolfo can see this understanding disfigure their faces and turn their skin the colour of ash. In a second, their hands are in the air, posed in a symbol of prayer, and they are pleading again, \\"Por favor, por favor, por favor....\\"<br /><br />The captain has Rodolfo and his seamen lash together a flimsy raft and throw it overboard. \\"The younger stowaway refuses to move. His knees have fused, his hands have clamped to the knotted rope banister, his words have become a torrent.\\" And when it's all over: \\"Rodolfo stands perfectly still, gaping not so much at the alacrity with which two men ceased to be, but at the impeccable ease with which evil appeared out of salty vapour, and claimed for itself the Maersk Dubai.\\"<br /><br />Intercut with the claustrophobic dread aboard the voyaging container ship, as the officers dispense small treats and bribes to the stunned crew, is the story of another young, desperate Romanian, Daniel Pacepa, as he makes his illegal way across Europe, towards a big ship and a stowaway passage to America.<br /><br />Daniel's real-life counterpart refused to co-operate in the writing of this novel, so Hough has made his adventure a composite of numerous other Romanian emigrants' experiences, involving narrow escapes, the kindness of strangers, man's ordinary inhumanity to others less fortunate, lots of drinking and drugs and work where he can get it. But Daniel never comes across as a type; he's a lonely, hopeful, cunning and resourceful individual, a bit lost and out of his depth until he meets an older, bigger, drunker, more experienced companion, Gheorghe Mihoc (real name), in the drunk tank of a Bucharest jail.<br /><br />As Daniel and Gheorghe hop trains, brawl, flee, go hungry, drink copious amounts of alcohol and work their way across Europe to that hub of illegal embarkation, Algeciras, Spain, the crewmen aboard the Maersk Dubai spiral down into an almost surreal life of fear, danger and mistrust.<br /><br />The officers no longer bribe them with delicacies and promises of promotion. In most ports they are unable to leave the boat and when they do get leave fear keeps them silent. They are watched, and when they meet secretly it's more for the comfort of solidarity than any hope of planning action. Slowly the sense of urgency and horror ebb. The men just want to make it through the trip.<br /><br />Things aboard the boat begin to break down. There's a carbon monoxide leak in the engine room, the lifeboat mechanism is malfunctioning, the emergency fire pumps are broken and the water sterilizers are faulty.

Tiny but fearless, she drew huge crowds, particularly for the wrestling act with her 500 pound Bengal, Rajah, conducted in a leather jumpsuit which became her signature costume.<br /><br />Canadian author Hough's well-researched debut novel (which won Ontario's Trillium Award) is full of the rough and tumble of circus life. As involving as it is informative, as moving as it is riveting, the book takes the form of a memoir, or confession. It's the end of a career that spanned five husbands and rose from carny girlie shows to top billing at Ringling, followed by a long denouement as a trainer at JungleLand animal park. It's 1968 and Mabel is facing her 80th birthday.<br /><br />\\"Still, I'm not a complainer, never have been never will be, so I'll skip the drawbacks and jump to the thing I do like about aging. The mind gets supple. Believe it or not, it does. You start seeing around corners. You start picturing what's behind you without having to crane your neck (which you can't do anyway, seeing as it's getting stiffer by the day). It's the one recompense of being aged and wrinkly and sore: you learn the trick of being in two places at once.\\"<br /><br />Time, she says, changes with age. From a forward march it becomes an accumulation, then something different again: \\"like gumballs in a penny machine, all mixed together, jumbled up, rubbing the colour off one another.\\" Age has affected how she sees her \\"greatest sin,\\" the event that divided her life into \\"before\\" and \\"after.\\" \\"Then one day I woke up and my worst sin had come unhobbled in time. Started wandering, it had. Suddenly it was something I'd always done, something I'd always been capable of doing. Suddenly it was a part of me.\\"<br /><br />Mabel anchors the narrative in 1968, moving between past and present. But mostly she keeps the flow chronological. An author's note at the end describes Hough's major sources of research and his considered departures from known fact. It's known that Mabel was a nurse before she became a carnival dancer, but how she got there is vague, though at least one source says she had a nervous breakdown. Hough provides her with a boorish husband and has him commit her, mostly because she found sex with him abhorrent. The horror of marriage is only exceeded by the sadistic therapy, and Mabel uses her God-given wits to get as far from both as possible. Sensing what the one kindly doctor wants to hear from her, she eventually convinces him to help her escape and thanks to another man, finds herself a carny show job.<br /><br />Men are the pattern in Mabel's life. An orphan, she's spent her life looking for love. Though she never develops much interest in sex, men mark the high and low points in her life. Cats are the constant. When lion trainer Louis Roth falls for her, he gives her her heart's desire - a chance to work with the big cats. From there it's onwards and upwards, except when some man shoots her down. And all the while, she's building toward that day in 1927 when her life changed forever, when she did something so awful, it takes most of the book to get there.<br /><br />\\"The thing that scares me the most? The thing that makes me jittery, that makes me dart for one of Dr. Brisbane's pills, that makes me contemplate rash actions: What if neither God nor luck has anything to do with it? What if we make our own luck? What if everything that happens to us happens because we wanted it that way?\\"<br /><br />An awful thought for a woman who's had a lot of luck, good and bad, and it's a fear she develops throughout the narrative as impulse and timing combine to send her soaring and tumbling. Mabel's personality drives this unsparing, tumultuos story, full of love and loss, but weighted with her inability to sustain happiness.<br /><br />Hough steeps the story in circus atmosphere - the ego and competitiveness of the performers, the strict pecking order, the downtrodden workingmen, the animals, the day-to-day tribulations of life on the road in all weather. The tedious hard work of training and the sudden heart-stopping tiger maulings. It's an exotic and exciting picture of the circus' golden age and one talented and tormented (and well scarred) star. A wonderful novel, which marks the debut of a writer to watch.eps the story in circus atmosphere - the ego and competitiveness of the performers, the strict pecking order, the downtrodden workingmen, the animals, the day-to-day tribulations of life on the road in all weather.

Novelist (\\"The Diagnosis\\" was a National Book Award finalist), essayist, and physicist, Lightman teaches both creative writing and physics at MIT.<br /><br />\\"Ever since I was a young boy, my passions have been divided between science and art,\\" says Lightman in his opening essay. Ranging over more than 20 years, these pieces explore the deep rewards and divergent modes of thinking involved in his two chosen fields. \\"Roughly speaking, the scientist tries to name things and the artist tries to avoid naming things.\\" The scientist poses questions with definite answers; the artist poses questions without answers or with many answers.<br /><br />As a boy Lightman wrote poetry, conducted experiments and built things, like the spark-generating induction coil inspired by the movie \\"Frankenstein,\\" or a remote control device for the household lights. But by college age he knew he had to choose, and his choice was made with a scientist's logic. The average age of prize-winning work in physics is 36, he points out. \\"I knew of a few scientists who later became writers...but no writers who later in life became scientists.\\"<br /><br />He describes the exhilarating highlights and devastating lows of those early years in poetic, passionate terms. Waking to find a frustrating research problem unraveling in his mind without effort, \\"I was simply spirit, in a state of pure exhilaration.\\" Later, about to publish his results on a different problem, he discovers he has been \\"scooped\\" by some Japanese scientists.<br /><br />After his initial dismay, he experiences a sense of wonder that someone completely unknown to him could reach the same conclusion, \\"within three decimal points.\\" \\"Here was powerful evidence of a thing - part science, part mathematics - that exists outside our own heads....There was terrible precision in the world.\\" His awe is followed by a depressing sense of irrelevance: if not he or the Japanese scientists, then someone else would have solved the problem a few months down the road. What use was his individual effort?<br /><br />Throughout these essays Lightman comes back to this question of precision, science's \\"great strength and its great weakness.\\" The physical world's mysteries exist and wait to be explained; there is nothing to create. Scientists may devise creative approaches, equations of exquisite beauty, and elegant, abstract theories, but the exhilaration lies in posing answers, not creating something new and unique.<br /><br />A special accomplishment - and for the mathematician, unhappily rare - is the elegant, eloquent, simple and powerful mathematical proof. \\"Gone is the civilization of ancient Greece, but not the Pythagorean theorem.\\" From the simplicity and power of Euclidian geometry to the elusive abstractions of irrational and imaginary numbers, Lightman succeeds in conveying the beauty and timelessness of mathematics.<br /><br />He offers brief, incisive portraits of greats like Einstein, Edward Teller, Richard Feynman and astronomer Vera Rubin, who discovered dark matter. He discusses the creative and perhaps all-too-human use of metaphor in science; how this essential visualization may embody individual prejudice and how metaphor becomes increasingly unwieldy as it reaches into quantum realms beyond our physical understanding. He muses on the wrenching realization that his own best work in physics is behind him at age 35 and reflects on how technology has come to drive humanity rather than serve it.<br /><br />Whatever his subject, he takes a humanist approach, inquiring into the role of personality in scientific research and the limitations of science itself as a human construct. He contrasts science and art and explores their differing and intersecting requirements. Each of these essays is cogent, eloquent and stimulating, but the best are those that convey the passionate fulfillment Lightman finds in his two disparate careers.<br /><br/>Readers unfamiliar with Lightman's fiction may want to check out \\"Einstein's Dreams,\\" in which the young Einstein, working on his theory of relativity, dreams each night of worlds where time behaves differently and people act accordingly. Time runs backward, is circular, slows with altitude, etc. In one world people are thrust into the past, in another time is frozen, in another everyone knows a year in advance when the world will end. Though not strong on plot, it is mind-bending fun.careers. <br /> <br />Readers unfamiliar with Lightman's fiction may want to check out \\"Einstein's Dreams,\\" in which the young Einstein, working on his theory of relativity, dreams each night of worlds where time behaves differently and people act accordingly.

By everyone, that is, except their father, who pleads his case to Jack, then promptly takes a header out a fourth-floor window and spends the rest of the story in a coma.<br /><br />Merchant is doing some repairs on the sailboat he calls home in Boston Harbor when Matt Coulter arrives with his outlandish story. His boat foundered off the coast of Rhode Island, he says, and an apparent rescuer scooped up his two kids and left Matt and his wife for dead. He attributes the big gaps in his story to the blow to the head he took before the Coast Guard picked him up along with the body of his wife. The children were never found. Matt wants Jack to find that phantom rescue boat.<br /><br />Out of pity, Jack agrees to spend a few days searching for the boat. The cops and Matt's friends think Jack is a sleaze for taking the man's money, especially after Matt's apparent suicide attempt, but initial research turns up a promising lead, and then another murder and soon Jack and Sarah are both in the sights of a ruthless sociopath.<br /><br />Point of view switches from Jack and Sarah to the villains and semi-villains and, in a refreshing twist, the mastermind's pathology makes him as bungling as he is dangerous. This does not, however, make Jack's task any easier and the conclusion is a breathless, deadly, struggle on the high seas. Edgy and well-structured.	2005-02-13

So how does it happen that days later, he's a fugitive with feds and local cops gunning for him (literally), accused of murdering a friend and stealing oil well funds from his own people?<br /><br />His old rival, FBI agent Michael Mangas, is quick to lead the ravening pack, but the easy assumption of guilt from everyone else never quite rings true. Put this aside, however, and you have an edge-of-the-seat chase through the backcountry of Oklahoma, complicated by Parker's unhealed chest wound. Parker does lots of outwitting, but Mangas is no slouch either, and eluding posses of cops requires numerous death-defying stunts as well as a bit of help from his friends, including a wise elder, an ex-wife and an ex-con.<br /><br />Narrative shifts mostly between Parker and Mangas, and diverts occasionally to a slippery villain who calls himself by the name of an Indian god and murders as easily as he breathes. Parker's complicated partner Anna Turnipseed does not make an appearance, but the headlong rush to the finish makes up for the lack of psychological nuance.	2005-02-13

First she wrote a memoir, \\"Open Secret,\\" and now she's produced an intelligent, fast-paced and all-too-plausible thriller of Islamic terrorism and interagency co-option and co-operation.<br /><br />The narrative shifts between the protagonist, MI5's Liz Carlyle (\\"in large part autobiographical,\\" says Rimington), and the terrorists, an Afghan man and an intense English girl, an \\"invisible\\" in spy parlance. The action begins with the Afghan's clandestine entrance into England, which culminates in the murder of one of his guides, a fisherman who dabbles in smuggling.<br /><br />The unusual armor-piercing ammunition used, and tips from two of Liz' widely separated informants, alert MI5 to a possible terrorist link. Liz joins the murder investigation in seaside Norfolk, which soon has several police units, Special Branch and MI6 swarming over it as well. Luck and error play nearly as big a role as skill and intelligence on both sides of the divide, as the terrorists and the investigators advance.<br /><br />Rimington folds professional issues seamlessly into the suspense. Liz loves the adrenaline rush of her job and the all-consuming nature of the work, but she doesn't gloss over turf battles, the extra problems women face, and the awkward balances between the personal and professional, pragmatism and ethics, the greater good and the individual good. Tightly plotted, and psychologically astute, readers will hope it's the first of many.	2005-02-13

British journalist Sandy Balfour spends a year walking its corridors and talking to its nurses, the backbone of the hospital.<br /><br />The nurses at the Med are a proud, dedicated bunch. Many are black and most of the ones Balfour talks to have been there for years. One of the things he doesn't say is how much turnover there is; going by this book, not much. Pay is the same as at private hospitals and the nurses have greater autonomy and authority. \\"We work as a team,\\" is a refrain that comes up again and again.<br /><br />He spends much of his time in the trauma center, burn unit and HIV clinic. Nurses who work trauma (including airlift trauma nurses) are a special breed; people who thrive on the challenge of emergency, and the rush of adrenaline. Most of them wouldn't work anywhere else.<br /><br />But then nurses who work the ever-depressing burn unit are a special breed too; people who can spend months with a patient in constant pain, whose best will never be as good as it was. Death is frequent. It's not one of the more popular specialties.<br /><br />And it takes a special sort of person to work with HIV patients all day. Like many of these nurses Marye Bernard takes her faith as seriously as her responsibilities. Patients respond to her determined optimism. Her goal is to prevent HIV becoming AIDS. \\"What this means is I do everything. Pap smears, teeth, dietary advice, antibiotics. You name it. I do palliative care, symptomatic care, and preventative care. I give anti-retroviral drugs. I do education.\\"<br /><br />Money and race come into the story frequently: constant threats by the state to shut down a place that runs deeply in the red; the differences in ambiance between a place like the Med and the private hospitals where everyone has insurance; the chasm in general health between people who get regular care and people who don't have insurance; the color divide inherent in all those differences.<br /><br />At the Newborn Center about 30 percent of the Med's newborn babies require intensive postpartum care. The infant mortality rate for white babies in Memphis is 5.8 per 100,000, a bit better than the national average. The rate for black infants is 18.7. Here too, the Med has a dedicated staff, run by 79-year-old Dr. Sheldon Korones who believes \\"health care is a right, not a privilege,\\" and that the worst faults of our system stem from making medicine \\"a product.\\" He raised the money himself to start the Newborn Center in 1968, his reaction to the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy.<br /><br />The nurses, many of them considerably more conservative than Korones, talk comfortably to Balfour, inviting him to watch them work. He meets FSAs (failed suicide attempts) MVAs (motor vehicle accidents), GSWs (gunshot wounds), watches an operation to reconstruct a girl's face after she was shot by her boyfriend, attends a three-hour church service with the head nurse.<br /><br />Frustrating, depressing stats and monetary issues punctuate Balfour's anecdotal, informative and inspiring narrative. The nurses are wonderful people, with a heartening sense of the importance of their work. As fascinating as this material is, though, it doesn't go deep enough. Why does Marye Bernard refuse to sign off on disability for even very sick patients with AIDs? Why a 24 hour shift for some nurses (enabling them to run other businesses, including a farm and a pet cemetery)? What about that patient at the outset who complained about the rudeness of the nurses at the Med? Are they? Why?<br /><br />However many questions you may have at the end, Balfour puts his heart into this celebration of a caring profession, while capturing the sad ironies of the system's inequities.ile capturing the sad ironies of the system's inequities.	2005-02-13
366695:US	52774618	R2D5DHX0BZHIGG	0618149147	798597356	The Empress of the Last Days: A Novel	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Historical trilogy ends in modern academia	While each of the books in Stevenson's trilogy can be read on its own, this last offers a richer experience if read in the context of the other two. The first volume, \\"The Winter Queen,\\" set in the 1600s, chronicles the relationship between the former Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia and Pelagius, an African prince kidnapped and sold into slavery, but free at the time he meets Elizabeth. They married secretly and had a son, Balthasar, whose life is the subject of the second book, \\"The Shadow King.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Empress of the Last Days\\" takes place in 2002. It involves a circle of European academics who come upon a trove of 17th century papers in Holland, including a theological journal by Pelagius and his catalog of West Indies plants and their uses. The rest of the papers include a never-before-seen play by the English writer Aphra Behn, and a miscellany of papers from a printer, Petrus Behn, who seemed to specialize in political satire and pornography for an English clientele.<br /><br />Corinne Hoyers, the Dutch Ph.D student who first reviews the papers, has no idea how these items came to be jumbled together, but readers of \\"The Shadow King\\" will know that Aphra Behn, wife of Petrus, stole Pelagius' books from Balthasar. Corinne turns over the Aphra Behn material to a young Oxford don, Michael Foxwist, who subsequently discovers Pelagius' marriage certificate and Balthasar's baptismal record hidden in the binding of one of Pelagius' books.<br /><br />Being English, he instantly sees the significance of this - Elizabeth Stuart's legitimate male heir should have inherited the throne of England - and the succession should never have been diverted to the Windsors, current holders of that chair. As Britain rather half-heartedly gears up to celebrate the present Elizabeth's Jubilee amidst the latest wave of scandals and tawdry gossip, Michael discovers a more legitimate heir - a young black female scientist in Barbados.<br /><br />Michael does not, incidentally, share any of this - from the discovery of the documents to his meeting with Melita Palaeologue, the rightful heir - with his Dutch colleagues on the project. When he does finally get around to telling them of his discovery, they are not in the least perturbed, which strikes one of the book's few wrong notes. Stevenson may be trying to make the point that the British royal dynasty is of interest only to Britons, but our own tabloids can attest the to the speciousness of that claim.<br /><br />Besides, Stevenson has been at pains to point out that academics are a cutthroat lot, in fierce competition for prestige, jobs, money and important finds. Documents challenging the succession of the major reigning European monarchs are good for all of the above. And a man who would keep such a secret from his colleagues would sound alarm bells of mistrust to an already paranoid confraternity.<br /><br />Melita, a plant biologist, also remains unimpressed with her claim to royalty. From her point of view, \\"this whole idea's almost like an insult. In terms of genetics you can't say one bloodline's important and none of the others count.\\" Though Michael agrees when she points out that 90 percent of her ancestors are African, he can't help but point out that Pelagius was an African prince and  on the Palaeologue side - 17 generations back - she's a descendant of the last Emperor of Byzantium.<br /><br />A subplot - the obsession of Michael's dotty uncle - makes Melita the \\"Empress of the Last Days,\\" a prophesied messiah-like regent, too confusing to recount here, but showcasing the mystical, almost fairy-tale trappings people confer on descent - ignoring the thousands of superfluous or undesirable ancestors.<br /><br />Melita and Michael fall in love. Stevenson handles this with passionate delicacy; they are cautious people of different backgrounds, interests, attitudes, and ambitions. But Michael is going back to England and they don't have a lot of time. And Melita must decide whether her right to the throne is the moral imperative Michael thinks it is.<br /><br />Like the previous two novels, this one is deliberately paced. Stevenson is not shy about diverting the unfolding plot with a discussion of Oxford's duty to tradition and the modern student, or the relevance of royalty to history and society's present concerns, or various issues of race, privilege, tradition and academia.<br /><br />A page-turner in its leisurely way, this is a fine conclusion to an absorbing, very different trilogy of ideas, romance and history.ecide whether her right to the throne is the moral imperative Michael thinks it is. <br /> <br />Like the previous two novels, this one is deliberately paced.

Whether it's a rented villa in Belgium, an archaeological dig in England or a fairy tale expanse of arctic isolation, Faber draws the reader deep into his imagined world.<br /><br />The most arresting novella is the last, and the briefest, \\"The Fahrenheit Twins.\\" A dark, humorous, and ultimately creepy Hansel and Gretel tale, it centers on twins identical in all but gender. \\"There was even the same amount of light inside their eyes, a difficult thing to reproduce exactly.\\"<br /><br />Born on an arctic island, their births unrecorded, they are a secret from the wider world. Their parents, anthropologists studying an indigenous tribe, are often absent and when home are usually otherwise occupied. The children have never met any other human beings, but they have developed a satisfying private culture centered on rituals and magic.<br /><br />Determined to remain identical and inseparable forever, their most important ceremony is one created to ward off the inevitability of adolescence, which their mother has warned them of. And their most important object is a \\"Book of Knowledge,\\" in which they \\"pieced together an impression of who their mother might be,\\" by recording the 100 sentences or so she addresses to them in the course of a year.<br /><br />When their mother dies, the children address this cataclysm by pondering a suitably grave and momentous ritual. It will involve a quest in which much is discovered, absorbed and acted upon. Faber uses the difference between the protagonists' and the reader's knowledge to enchant, startle, and dismay.<br /><br />The most involving novella is \\"The Hundred and Ninety-Nine Steps,\\" which are the number of steps archaeologist Sian climbs each morning to the Whitby Abbey where she participates in the exhumation and cataloguing of an old abbey cemetery. Sian, her sleep nightly haunted by a murderer who slits her throat in her dreams, wakes each morning to unspoken fears over a painful lump in her hip.<br /><br />Lonely and still recovering from a horrific Bosnian War experience, Sian's work is all consuming until the day she meets a handsome cynic and his delightful dog. The dog's open and unself-conscious affection captivates Sian immediately. Her attraction to the man is naturally more problematic, but his tantalizing possession of an old bundle of papers unites them in an effort to sate their curiosity. As Sian painstakingly deciphers the ancient, crumbly papers, a murder mystery begins to unfold, and exacerbates their differences.  Magnus never comes as alive as Sian - he seems more of a sparring partner and a physical presence, at least until the end, but the story is full of surprises and insights.<br /><br />In the title novella, \\"The Courage Consort,\\" Faber induces to the reader to identify with his characters without necessarily warming to any of them. The story concerns an a cappella singing group gathered in a Belgian villa to rehearse a complex, ultra-modern new composition for a festival.<br /><br />The narrative centers on Catherine Courage, the group's soprano and clinically depressed wife of the group's leader, Roger. Roger, always insists the consort's name comes from their willingness to take on new works rather than from his name. The other members of the rather dyspeptic group are the acutely obese bass, Ben, prickly Julian and young, forthright Dagmar, who arrives with her new baby.<br /><br />Tensions percolate in the heat and isolation of the villa as the piece soon shows itself to be as uninspired as it is difficult. The villa itself is surrounded by woods, from which strange cries emanate at night, heard only by Catherine. The woods are by turns a refuge, a menace and a mystery, depending on the human mood. The novella is atmospheric and moody - its physical aspects contrasting and complementing the more elusive human characters.<br /><br />Beautifully written and constructed, this story was the most quietly haunting, while the least compelling. Its petty, self-absorbed and not particularly likable characters manage nevertheless to stick in the mind long after the last page is turned.<br /><br />Each of these pieces offers a colorful, intense and vivid experience, infused with humor, the unexpected and a moral center.contrasting and complementing the more elusive human characters. <br /> <br />Beautifully written and constructed, this story was the most quietly haunting, while the least compelling.

It's 1975 and the new communist government doesn't have much in the way of equipment or supplies. But Siri's job is merely to follow orders and provide an appropriate cause of death.<br /><br />He is not expected to do any investigating when the wife of a powerful official suddenly dies, or three Vietnamese bodies turn up tortured and drowned, putting a delicate international relationship in jeopardy, and military commanders near a Hmong village begin meeting mysterious deaths. But Siri's rebellious streak flares up, as it always has, and, with a little help from new friends and old colleagues, he pursues each case to its end.<br /><br />The plot takes a spooky turn in the middle, which is at first disconcerting, but develops into an added dimension to the already haunted Dr. Siri. Siri is a complex, enjoyable character: an old man who'd like to retire, but won't be shunted aside or intimidated; a lonely man with a melancholy side, balanced by sympathy, humor and zest for life; a good communist with a spiritual gift and an irreverent independence.<br /><br />The setting and atmosphere draw you into Siri's world, where shortages and repression are challenges to circumvent and people are the focus. A wonderful debut.	2005-01-24

The real town, however, disappoints the tourists. Cars fill the streets, the inhabitants wear ordinary, if subdued, clothing, and enjoy the advantages of electricity and indoor plumbing.<br /><br />But Nomi is also confused. \\"There were so many bizarre categories of things we couldn't do and things we could do and none of it has ever made any sense to me at all.\\" They could watch \\"Batman,\\" but not \\"Swiss Family Robinson,\\" could play golf, but no pretend games. Life is meant to be a sober, austere preparation for eternal heaven after death.<br /><br />\\"There's not a lot of interest in the present tense here. And it's only slightly disconcerting that everyone's related. If a Mennonite couple divorces do they still get to be cousins? Oh yeah, hilarious. Tash once said to my mom: Oh, so it's wrong to move any part of one's body in time to music but it's perfectly okay to penetrate members of one's extended family? My mother told her not to be silly.\\"<br /><br />Nomi's mother was a high-spirited woman with a worldly yen, who took her religion seriously. Her inner turmoil remained mostly hidden until Tash began openly and angrily to turn her back on the church. Supporting her, protecting her and sometimes taking her part brought Trudie into open conflict with the church, personified by her brother. \\"It was like being the sister of Moammar Gaddafi or Joseph Stalin.\\" \\"The Mouth of Darkness,\\" as Tash and Nomi call him, rules with an iron hand, excommunicating any who disagree with him. Excommunication is akin to living death in this community. Everyone, including members of his or her own immediate family, shuns the excommunicated. They are called ghosts.<br /><br />Ray, Nomi's father, is a quiet, devout man. He always wears a jacket and tie and sits outside in the evenings in a lawn chair watching the night sky. He writes reminders to himself of things to do the next day and leaves them on his shoes before he goes to bed. He's a man who likes his routine and, says Nomi, frequently, he and Trudie loved each other madly.<br /><br />So why did she leave? Tash and Trudie, though they didn't leave together or at the same time, have been gone three years when the novel opens. Nomi and Ray are still waiting for them to return. Before they left Nomi was a pious, contented child in growing fear of her sister's salvation. Since then she has become as skeptical and irreverent as Tash; openly flouting \\"The Mouth's\\" dictates. She smokes, uses weed and alcohol, stays out till all hours, skips school and has a boyfriend. She hasn't yet tried sex, but is planning to.<br /><br />Bewildered and wounded, she takes refuge in sarcasm and cherishes tender moments and tenets of family life from her past. She and Ray maintain a loving connection, but they don't talk much. Ray has taken to selling off the furniture and going on long, late-night drives.<br /><br />The narrative has a realistic, stream-of-consciousness quality as Nomi reflects on her family, trying to trace the path that brought them to this pass. Early on, her high-school teacher, urging her to complete her assignments tells her \\"that essays and stories generally come, organically, to a preordained ending that is quite out ofthe writer's control.\\" But Nomi is not convinced. \\"I don't know about that. I feel that there are so many [endings] to choose from.\\"<br /><br />This sense of possibility, and the inherent fear of failure that choice carries with it, is a recurring theme. The church limits choice but confers belonging and security. Freedom is not merely a temptation, but an act of will. Under all the sassy humor, these are the issues Nomi grapples with, and those that will, in the end, define her.<br /><br />Toews, award-winning Canadian author of a memoir about her manic-depressive Mennonite father, \\"Swing Low: a Life,\\" has written two other wry, humorous and warm-hearted novels, \\"Summer of My Amazing Luck,\\" and \\"A Boy of Good Breeding.\\" Her writing is rhythmic and lyrical, her characters captivating, and the portrayal of a strict religious community is complex and absorbing.at is quite out of the writer's control.\\" But Nomi is not convinced. \\"I don't know about that.

Cultured, attractive, early 40s, and comfortably well off, Isabel has a nice life. True, she worries about her niece's cad of a boyfriend, but since she still carries a torch for a handsome cad of her own, she understands the chemistry. But, having met the eye of the dead boy as he fell, Isabel feels a certain responsibility to understand his death, be it accident, murder or suicide.<br /><br />The Sunday Philosophy Club never actually meets during the course of the book, but Isabel, editor of \\"The Review of Applied Ethics,\\" has a whimsically philosophical turn of mind, which she applies neatly to everyday life as well as questions of curiosity, obligation, and murder.<br /><br />As with Smith's popular series, \\"The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency,\\" the mystery provides a focal point for the narrative, but is secondary to the interplay of character, dialogue, and motivation. Secondary characters, from the niece's spurned ex-boyfriend, a too-nice guy who's a favorite of Isabel's, to Grace, Isabel's blunt and earthy housekeeper, are well-drawn. The philosophical/ethical bent, while not in the least taxing, is humorous and stimulating, and Isabel is a thoroughly delightful, self-possessed, and charmingly flawed heroine.	2005-01-24

Now that the reference is getting more blank looks than nods from the upcoming young people in Chambers, he has decided it's time to add it to his memoirs. \\"So much of history is being lost.\\"<br /><br />It was the 1950s and Rumpole's first case - a young man accused of killing his war-hero father and one of his father's soldier friends. No one had any doubt of the boy's guilt - except his young lawyer - but Rumpole was too green and was seconded to old Wystan, head of Chambers and father of Hilda, Rumpole's future wife, affectionately known as \\"She Who Must Be Obeyed.\\" Wystan is offended the boy would even dream of a \\"not-guilty\\" plea.<br /><br />Nevertheless, ignoring his elder's instructions, Rumpole continues to investigate. Dogged and scrappy even then, defying propriety and custom for the sake of justice, Rumpole embarks on his career of winning the hearts of criminals and affronting his stodgy colleagues, exposing hypocrisy and stupidity wherever he finds it.<br /><br />Fans will find the case well worthy of Rumpole and will enjoy his first meeting with the prolific Timson family as well as the steps which led the clueless barrister to the alter. New readers will find this a perfect introduction to Rumpole's dry, sly wit and Mortimer's crisp, graceful prose.	2005-01-24

Instead it invades the brain, zeroes in on aggression, and stomps the pedal to the floor. Lots of scientists study aggression; there are whole conferences on various aspects of the phenomenon. But no one studies rabies to see how the trick works.<br /><br />Even more beauteous is the diabolical specificity of the toxoplasma protozoan. The bug gets eaten by a rat where it creates cysts until the rat is eaten by a feline. The cat is the only animal taxoplasma can reproduce in; so it behooves the bug to make sure the right predator eats the rat. How does it do this? Simple. It deprives the rat of its congenital, hard-wired, instinctive fear of cats. Nothing else in the rat's behavior is affected.<br /><br />As Sapolsky puts it: \\"This is akin to someone getting infected with a brain parasite that has no effect whatsoever on the person's thoughts, emotions, SAT scores, or television preferences but, to complete its life cycle, generates an irresistible urge to go to the zoo, scale a fence and try to French-kiss the pissiest-looking polar bear.\\"<br /><br />Expanding infinitely outward, Max Tegmark's \\"Parallel Universes\\" (also \\"Scientific American) argues quite reasonably for infinite versions of you on infinite earths. \\"If anything the Level I multiverse sounds trivially obvious. How could space not be infinite?\\" From Level I this elegant theory moves through physics, with some progressive changes in initial conditions, constants and particles (Level II), quantum mechanics (Level III) and  different physical laws (Level IV). It's the kind of article that makes you aware of how limited our mental constructs and perceptions are.<br /><br />Atul Gawande's profile of maverick doctor Francis Daniels Moore, (\\"Desperate Measures,\\" \\"The New Yorker\\") inspired by the horror of Boston's Cocoanut Grove fire and an innovative treatment at his hospital, Mass General, to embark on a career of aggressive pioneering, is a dynamic, riveting view of a dedicated, driven, sometimes ruthless man.<br /><br />Austin Bunn's \\"The Bittersweet Science,\\" (\\"The New York Times Magazine\\") is an illuminating portrait of diabetes and early treatment, told through one patient's life story, and Ronald Bailey's \\"The Battle for Your Brain\\" (\\"The New York Times\\") discusses the pros and cons of neuropharmaceuticals. Other medical articles profile DNA's James Watson and discuss obesity in sympathetic terms of the biological imperative.<br /><br />Genes crop up in Horace Freeland Judson's \\"The Stuff of Genes,\\" (\\"Smithsonian), a celebration of its 50th anniversary and, more engagingly, in two \\"New York Times\\" articles from Nicholas Wade, \\"In Click Languages, an Echo of the Tongues of the Ancients,\\" and \\"A Prolific Genghis Khan, It Seems, Helped People the World.\\"<br /><br />There are whimsical psychological musings, like Peggy Orenstein's \\"Where Have All the Lisas Gone,\\" (\\"The New York Times Magazine\\") on changing fads in baby names, Virginia Postrell's \\"The Design of Your Life,\\" on the personalization of design and Jonathan Rauch's \\"Caring for Your Introvert,\\" (\\"Atlantic Monthly\\"), which is basically a justification for peace and quiet.<br /><br />\\"We're All Gonna Die!\\" (\\"Wired\\") by Gregg Easterbrook reviews the latest doomsday theories and<br /><br />Mike O'Connor's \\"Bird Watcher's General Store\\" (The Cape Codder\\") is a hilarious and informative selection of bird watcher columns, and other animal pieces include \\"Through the Eye of an Octopus\\" (\\"Discover\\"), a poignant portrait of a creature who doesn't live long enough to be as smart as it is, and anthropologist Meredith F. Small's contemplative \\"Captivated\\" (\\"Natural History\\") on visiting monkeys at the zoo.<br /><br />Editor Steven Pinker's bias for clear, informative and entertaining writing serves us well.

The story opens with a midnight call to Glitsky reporting the murder of a young assistant DA, Elaine Wager, the victim of an apparent mugging. A suspect, a homeless heroin-addict, was caught in the act of robbing the body, gun in hand. But for Gltizky it's no ordinary case.<br /><br />Wager was his daughter, though he only discovered the fact a couple years before and hadn't acknowledged himself to Elaine, for vague, unsatisfactory reasons which haunt him throughout the novel.<br /><br />Glitzky takes out his anger and grief on Cole Burgess, the pathetic murder suspect, extracting a confession, and the DA, New-Age liberal Sharon Pratt, decides to make Burgess the cornerstone of her re-election bid, going for the death penalty. Pratt trumpets her case to the press: Burgess, a homeless white man, kills a prominent, African-American community figure in the course of a robbery.<br /><br />But Glitzky is having second thoughts. And his friend Hardy has accepted the defense, albeit reluctantly.<br /><br />The story pits political maneuvering, within the police department and the DA's office, against the demands of justice as Glitzky is suspended for giving the interrogation tape to Hardy and Pratt strives to try the case in the newspapers before going to court.<br /><br />Lescroart spins a complex web of ambition, greed, posturing and venality around the suspense of investigation, courtroom drama, and conspiracy, while also involving the reader in large human emotions and issues of character.<br /><br />Pratt is a bit shrill and annoying but Glitzky's dogged honesty and his struggle to understand himself and his grief more than compensate. Lescroart has another well-written winner.	2004-12-27

Wives (Washington is still primarily a man's town, \\"a recovering man's town, but still a man's town\\"), children and particularly parents who knew him \\"when\\" have the ability to cut the big man down to human size. \\"When even he, in the gathering derangement that marks his ascent to public notice, has come to think of himself as synonymous with the title and image, they will not.\\" Many pols, she points out, had powerful parents, particularly mothers, and their good child personas keep them striving for approval. With a few hilarious and humanizing anecdotes she shows a general reduced to earnest pleading, a senator pushed into a public apology. Greenfield's depiction of wives, on the other hand, and the stultifying social rounds expected of them, makes the reader wonder how any Washington marriages survive.<br /><br />When Greenfield started out in 1961 the position of women was such that she was not permitted to set foot in the National Press Club, not even to check the wire service ticker. She was routinely excluded from \\"old boy\\" meetings and patronized in interviews, a penchant she learned to exploit. Greenfield candidly explores her own complex feelings and acquiescence in this system, even to comporting herself so as not to \\"threaten\\" her male subordinates' egos.<br /><br />Much of the old-boy network is changing, but not entirely for the better, says Greenfield. \\"This new culture is also redolent of high school, but high school at its most dangerously deranged.\\" The appearance of taking a stand has become more important than getting things done - for a politician it's a sound bite, for a journalist it's the headline. A freshman who would have voted as he was told in the old days in exchange for a good assignment or a morsel of pork now runs to any number of TV outlets to denounce the intimidation, possibly even propose hearings. Smear campaigns and self-righteous posturing have replaced much of the back-room dealing. Though Greenfield is far from waxing nostalgic about the old days, she does explain how private give-and-take worked to get landmark civil rights legislation passed, among others.<br /><br />Greenfield concludes the book with a discussion of journalism - the delicate line between cooperation and collusion, the hypocrisy of virtue, the formulation of an ethics code at the Post. Ironically, this is the least compelling section of the book, not because of any reticence on Greenfield's part, but because journalistic soul searching has become so fashionable there is little new here.<br /><br />A thoroughly enjoyable portrait of a peculiar and important place, written in secret before her death from cancer at age 69, Greenfield's account is enhanced by a warm personal foreword from Post publisher Katherine Graham and an equally affectionate afterword by historian Michael Beschloss, who aptly sums up Greenfield's central theme: \\"how to live at the center of political and journalistic influence in Washington without losing your principles, detachment or individual human qualities.\\" Engaging, witty, and humanizing, Greenfield's \\"Washington\\" can be appreciated even by those who feel alienated by and cynical about our nation's politicians.s the headline.

As a favor to the family of her best friend Mary DiNunzio (recovering from injuries sustained in the last Scottoline) Judy Carrier, of Rosato & Associates, takes the case.<br /><br />Her job is made difficult by her client's insistence on his guilt - though Pigeon Tony calls it justice, not murder. His act, he explains, was the culmination of a vendetta begun 60 years before in Italy when he married Coluzzi's sweetheart and Coluzzi relatiated by killing her, leaving their only son motherless.<br /><br />Coluzzi, says Tony, taunted him in the moments before his killing with confirmation of Tony's suspicions that Coluzzi was responsible for the car wreck that killed Tony's only son and his wife.<br /><br />Judy, swayed by the old man's pathos, wracks her brains to establish a defense of gray areas and sympathy, a tactic which goes against her strict legal principles. As Pigeon Tony's neighborhood friends help her investigate Tony's allegations against the Coluzzi clan, Judy finds herself falling for Tony's handsome grandson. Fireworks ensue as threats, mayhem and attempted murder derail her budding romance and play havoc with her case. Her boss, Bennie Rosato, steps in with some good advice about fighting fire with a legal blitz and the battle is more evenly joined.<br /><br />Scottoline's wit and deft plotting are well in evidence here but the Italian neighborhood schmaltz gets a little thick. Nevertheless Judy is funny, brave and caustic and \\"The Vendetta Defense\\" will please fans.	2004-12-27

Willy Patrick, a Newberry-award winning YA novelist, her husband and daughter killed two years before, fears she is losing her mind - again - as she is about to embark on a new marriage. She finds herself succumbing to a conviction that her dead daughter is being held in a local New Jersey warehouse, and inexplicably losing hours of time. To the reader, her character also seems peculiarly erratic, veering between dependence on a secretive, dark and domineering man, and willful, decisive independence.<br /><br />Chapters featuring continuing character and Straub alter-ego Tim Underhill alternate. Underhill, a writer at work on a new book, keeps catching meaningful glimpses of his dead 9-year-old sister while receiving demanding, but incomprehensible e-mail from dead people. He's also being stalked by a hostile book collector; one seeking the \\"real\\" book - not the book the author wrote, but the one he meant to write.<br /><br />So far, so good. Intriguing ideas, thoughtful characters, lots of questions, lurking evil and suspense. The story clips along in short accelerating chapters until - bang - the two meet and much is revealed. While some suspense remains - Underhill has a task to do and Patrick's survival is shaky - the interest mostly revolves around speculative musings on reality and some intriguing, rather creepy probing into the relationship of ego, love and sex.  Well written, but primarily for serious Straub fans.	2004-12-27

Neither makes an appearance in this taut, suspenseful thriller, featuring ambitious L.A. homicide detective Petra Conner (last seen helping Delaware in \\"A Cold Heart\\"), and brilliant, but socially immature young intern, Isaac Gomez, who nearly steals the limelight from Conner.<br /><br />While running down sketchy leads on a drive-by shooting in which four teens are killed and one girl remains unidentified, Petra humors Isaac on a theory he's developed linking six cold cases. Based on a statistical analysis, Isaac believes he's discovered a serial killer.<br /><br />A poster child for immigrant Hispanic slum kids, Isaac graduated college at 19 and was headed for medical school. But, needing a break, he sidestepped to a Ph.D., and now, at 21, he's doing his thesis on patterns in LA homicides. At first skeptical - the victims have nothing in common but the date and manner of their deaths (blunt force trauma on June 28) - Petra becomes more intrigued as she reviews the old cases.<br /><br />Meanwhile, she's developing a theory of her own about the drive-by, and letting Isaac trail along on some of the footwork in both cases. Isaac is nearly as smitten by the details of police work as he is by Petra, but she can't always be babysitting him. The prickliness between them works: Petra's got her own complicated life, and she's aware of Isaac's infatuation, while Isaac is painfully shy and conflicted between the lure of the wider world and the pull of his impoverished, close-knit family.<br /><br />The dynamics of the two cases contribute to the tension (June 28th is looming, but Petra develops a hot lead on the drive-by), as does Isaac's loose-cannon quality. Smart he undeniably is, but he's also impulsive, quick to succumb to temptation, and secretive. The story builds to a nail-biting climax with a satisfying last-minute twist.

A father and daughter were murdered on their yacht and the surviving son identified a local crime boss, only to be murdered in his hospital bed days later. Since he and a box of crucial evidence disappeared at the same time, Lefebvre has been blamed for the murder and the disgrace to the department.<br /><br />Soon convinced that his colleagues condemned the wrong man, Harriman is further isolated by his growing suspicion that a cop - but not Lefebvre - is guilty. The narrative, primarily from Harriman's point of view, is punctuated by the obsessive Looking Glass Man, the murderer with a mission, and also by Irene's view, though more as Harriman's wife than in her job as reporter.<br /><br />The story is absorbing, complex and well constructed, though the cops sometimes seem a little heavy handed. Harriman is not as lively and impulsive as likable Irene and the villain is diabolically clever but hardly unique in fiction.	2004-12-27

This one begins with retired Lt. Joe Leaphorn's retrospective musing on how the \\"complicated happening below the Salt woman Shrine illustrated his Navajo belief in universal connections.\\"<br /><br />The narrative then drops back to allow the story to converge from several viewpoints. A jewelry store robbery has been committed and the owner killed. A simple-minded Hopi man, Billy Tuve, is arrested for the crime after trying to pawn a $20 thousand diamond for $20. He sticks to the unlikely story that the diamond was given him by some anonymous old man at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. Tribal Sgt. Jim Chee enters the fray when his Hopi friend and colleague, Cowboy Dashee, asks him for help in proving Billy's innocence.<br /><br />The diamond's appearance creates excitement in worlds far from the desert. Embittered Joanna Craig believes it may lead her to vindication and revenge - proof that she is the daughter of John Clarke, a diamond dealer killed in a plane crash over the canyon; his arm still manacled to his diamond case, his body never recovered, and Craig's pregnant mother spurned by his wealthy family. The man in control of the Clarke estate shares Craig's belief, and is determined to beat her to the diamond's source. Both are looking for Clarke's body and its DNA, one to prove her lineage, one to make sure she never gets the chance.<br /><br />The digressing journey through the story also involves Chee's earnest and spunky fianc&eacute;e Bernie Manuelito, a secret Hopi ritual, a soulless psychopath, and a hermit's obsession with the Skelton Man, an irreverent name for the Hopi god of death. The canyon climax includes a spectacular storm and is exciting and satisfying enough to make its farfetched elements hardly noticeable. A fine, atmospheric yarn., atmospheric yarn.	2004-12-27

Russia, Smith tells us, has the world's largest number of billionaires, enough to make up their own class. As melancholy and stubborn as ever, Detective Renko's newest case begins when one of them, Pasha Ivanov, head of a prominent security firm, NoviRus, leaps to his death from the window of his luxurious, state-of-the-art impenetrable new Moscow penthouse, salt shaker in hand.<br /><br />Self-made Ivanov enjoyed a gregarious social life and possessed a vibrant young mistress. But he had been morose and solitary for the last weeks of his life, losing weight and allowing no one near him or inside the apartment. Suicide seems obvious and Renko's superiors have already allowed Ivanov's friends and colleagues to trample all over the scene. Renko, denied access to Ivanov's home office, \\"a futuristic cockpit of glass and stainless steel,\\" prowls the spacious exercise room, home theater and bathroom spa and finally finds his reward in the bedroom's vast walk-in closet - a 50-kilo mountain of salt on the floor, to go with the peculiar detail of the salt shaker on Ivanov's body.<br /><br />Warned off the case, but naturally intrigued by the mystery, Renko keeps asking questions. His only encouragement comes from Ivanov's shady assistant, Bobby Hoffman, an American financier, computer expert and fugitive from US justice. But Hoffman has his own agenda and Renko is heading for deeper trouble than even his superiors could imagine.<br /><br />The pile of salt and the financial sleight-of-hand is interesting enough, but over-the-top billionaire lifestyles are the same the world over. Smith doesn't get to the nitty-gritty of this story until he lands Renko in Chernobyl. There's only one Chernobyl.<br /><br />Another executive at NoviRus has died and his body was left at a cemetery gate within the post-meltdown \\"Zone of Exclusion\\" surrounding the four mothballed nuclear reactors. This time there's no doubt that it's murder and Renko's boss delights in sending him to investigate. Surprisingly, Renko's not the only person poking around the deserted cities of Pripyat and Chernobyl and the radioactive villages, streams and picturesque woods of the Zone.<br /><br />Scavengers poke through abandoned homes and buildings, looting metal and household items to sell on the black market, and lights dot the villages from homes of the old people who have returned to live out their days, growing vegetables in the hot dirt and drinking milk from cows that graze on hot grass. Scientists also reside in the Zone, studying the long-term effects of radiation on the local flora and fauna. And there's a detachment of soldiers whose loyalty is as unreliable as their hazard pay.<br /><br />Smith steeps his story in Russian (and Ukrainian) fatalism and black humor as Renko, accompanied by his crackling dosimeter, doggedly pursues his thankless investigation. \\"The next greenie I meet who tells me how he wants to save the animals, I'll tell him that if he's sincere, he should hope for nuclear accidents everywhere,\\" a scientist, Alex, tells Renko as he takes him on an eerie nature tour of teeming woods, fat deer and fearless, ubiquitous wolves, all thriving in the absence of human endeavor. Moody, radical doctor Eva Kazka rages against the callous parsimony of the Russian government as she conducts an outdoor clinic in the villages, checking blood pressure and handing out cigarettes. They take Renko along to a convivial local dinner party where all the food and copious drink is horrifyingly home grown.<br /><br />The story is shadowy and suspenseful, and Renko faces deadly danger from human foes as well as everything he eats, drinks and breathes, but the master of atmosphere has outdone himself with this one. Your hair will stand on end and your flesh will crawl as Smith unfolds the story of Chernobyl, from the fateful hours leading to the disaster to the government evasions and half measures, to the ongoing saga of death and destruction and irresponsibility, melding it seamlessly into Renko's contrastingly small investigation of individual death, greed and destruction.<br /><br />A master of character as well, Smith drives his story with real people, starting with relentless, cynical, big-hearted Renko, and including his practical partner Victor, the slippery, unreadable Hoffman, the gloomily seductive Dr. Eva, the friendly, volatile misanthrope Alex, and a host of others from a pair of dim, demented soldiers to the silent, brilliant child Renko has half adopted.

This is a project long planned.<br /><br />\\"I'm going to do it in English, a language I started learning at the age of fourteen, and I'm going to tell my story in a documentary manner so as to preserve historical accuracy. I hope that someday Candie and Bobby and their parents will read these pages so that they can feel the full weight of the tattoo on my belly. I regard this memoir as the only gift a poor man like me can bequeath his American grandchildren.\\"<br /><br />The tattoo, stretched under his navel, curses the U.S. Scarring shows the tattoo has been altered, but what it says on its face is all that matters. \\"Like a talisman, the tattoo has protected me in China for almost five decades.\\" This is the first of many ironies. Of course, coming to America, it became a liability. He might be refused entry if it was discovered on him. But if he had it removed the authorities would assume he was not returning and refuse permission for his trip.<br /><br />The tattoo dates to the years that set Yuan's fate: 1951 to 1953, the Korean War. An educated man, a college graduate from the military academy, Yuan's tone is formal. His prose is dispassionate, plain and understated. This careful voice serves to underscore the dignity of a man describing experiences of overwhelming indignity, privation and powerlessness.<br /><br />The Chinese army in Korea is isolated. Supposed volunteers without the official backing of their new Communist government, the men don't speak the language or know the landscape. There is no mail. Power is centralized and their orders, coming from afar, are often confused or contradictory. But the men know their government expects them to die rather than be captured; to do less is to show cowardice and shame their country. Yuan is unconscious at the time of his capture, wounded in the leg. But he knows the extenuating context will never be taken into account. He is a POW and that is a shameful fact.<br /><br />In the American prison camp the political factions jockey for power. With his education and his English, Yuan is a magnet for both the Nationalists and the Communists. Yuan is neither, though he feels the Communists are less corrupt than the Nationalists and have bettered the lot of the common man. But mostly he is loyal to something more personal: his mother and fianc&eacute;e are back home in China.<br /><br />The Nationalists bribe him with food and dreams of a prosperous life in Taiwan and threaten him with violence and the bleak prospect of life in China branded as a POW. \\"History has shown that the Communists always treat their significant enemies more leniently than their own people,\\" they remind him, a maxim that hits home, but does not change his mind.<br /><br />The Communists do much the same, though with less fervor. Everyone has family back in China and a reminder that those at hand will suffer for the perfidy of those not at hand serves to keep most people in line. They work at maintaining discipline and stoke the revolutionary fire with slogans and organized demonstrations.<br /><br />These can cause sometimes deadly clashes with the Americans, who are also outnumbered foreigners in an inhospitable land. The dynamics between captor and captive and between their very different cultures run as an undercurrent through the narrative, increasing the tension and uncertainty.<br /><br />Yuan gropes for survival, feeling his way behind the words of those more powerful than he, attempting always to strike a balance between duplicity and truth to keep himself safe. He feels himself an outsider by virtue of his education, and is less willing to abandon his individuality to the community than others. Proud of his intellect, he can sometimes out-think himself. But he holds paramount his loyalty to his loved ones and his determination to return to them, and lets himself by guided by that steadfastness. This is a source of many of the book's inevitable ironies.<br /><br />Like Ha Jin's previous novels this is a story of human nature's adaptation to the political repression society forces upon its members. Manipulation, intimidation and emotional blackmail are the tools the powerful use to advance their interests. People adapt and endure according to their individual personalities. Some are swept up in passionate political fervor, others are opportunists, some go along out of fear, others resist out of pride, some are sadists, others cowards. But most are a confused jumble of all these things; even those in power swagger only until the balance shifts.<br /><br />It's also a vivid portrait of life in the camps: the physical privations and miseries, the bad, inadequate food, and cold and crowded conditions; and the mental privations, the lack of communication with the world outside the camp, the total isolation from loved ones, the fear of the uncertain future. It's a novel as complex and layered as the human heart.imes out-think himself.

He examines the major incidents of our history - Columbus (no dogs on his first voyage; a mistake he never made again!), the ruthless Spanish Conquistadors, the Civil War, the Depression, WWII and more - from the point of view of the dog's mostly overlooked contribution.<br /><br />Although the fact-filled narrative does not conjure up a lot of personality, the loyal character of the dog quickly emerges as crucial. One man's best friend is that man's enemy's enemy. Again and again dogs are trained to attack and kill - the Conquistador stories and those of treeing runaway slaves are particularly gruesome.<br /><br />Dog loyalty has more benign uses, of course, and Derr explores most of them, from herder and hunter to celebrity companion and adventurer. Explorers, from Lewis and Clark to Ernest Shackleton, have depended on dogs for companionship as well as hunting, guidance or transportation. But in times of trouble doggie devotion has often led to the final sacrifice - sustenance. That best-friend thing has never been totally mutual.<br /><br />Derr's writing doesn't sparkle, but his breadth of research astounds, and there's a compelling feel to the narrative that comes from the canine slant on familiar history. Dog-loving history buffs will particularly enjoy it.	2004-12-06

Charlotte, the ambitious valedictorian of her backwoods high school and proud possessor of a perfect SAT score, has never fit in with her peers.<br /><br />They sneer at her aloof intellectualism while she disdains their small-world view of instant gratification through sex and drugs and alcohol and \\"drag races at night on Route 21.\\" And yet. A part of her yearns to belong, to be accepted and applauded by her classmates. \\"Why should she be an outcast for not doing stupid, aimless, self-destructive things?\\"<br /><br />Charlotte looks forward to vindication, however. Of them all only she will escape into the greater world, where people like herself enjoy \\"a life of the mind.\\" She has won a full scholarship to prestigious Dupont University, a fictional campus on a par with Harvard or Yale.<br /><br />Then reality mars her lofty expectations. Unloading their old truck at her new dorm, her proud parents mortify her. Meeting her Groton-educated roommate and Beverly's rich, worldly parents, she instantly sees her family through their eyes. And she with her high-waisted shorts and print dresses and country accent and $500 spending money per semester, feels awkwardly defensive.<br /><br />But. Charlotte doesn't recognize the name of Beverly's prep school, and when asked where she went to \\"secondary school,\\" she has to have the term explained. While a young freshman's disavowal of her country connections is regrettably natural, an ambitious teenage girl's total ignorance of prep schools is not. Shortly thereafter, \\"sexiled\\" from her dorm room in the wee hours of the morning, Charlotte is shocked by the \\"pornographic\\" contents of \\"Cosmopolitan,\\" a magazine she has never before perused.  There are other incidents: jarring moments when this brilliant girl doesn't get some sexual innuendo or boy's intent or a reference to popular culture my granny would recognize. None of these are essential to plot or character, so they just stand there straining Wolfe's credibility.<br /><br />Which is unfortunate as the reader quickly warms to Charlotte, her timeless story, and Wolfe's exuberant writing. Charlotte adheres to her personal principles while longing desperately for recognition, admiration and \\"Cool.\\" Many a former college kid will recognize a bit of themselves in Charlotte, a girl quite capable of holding several diametrically opposed passions at the same moment.<br /><br />She's surrounded by richer, better-educated versions of the crude kids she thought she'd left behind - and they're all cool! A material girl, Beverly (and her friends) regard Charlotte with perfunctory contempt. Classes help counter the misery of social misfitness, however. There she finds the heady life of the mind she longs for, and attracts the attention of \\"the millennial mutants,\\" a proudly intellectual crew who scorn the ruling ideal of cool.<br /><br />The mutants are pretty geeky though, and while she enjoys the spirited discussions, Charlotte doesn't really want to be identified with them. She has also attracted the attention of Hoyt Thorpe, the coolest frat boy on campus and Jojo (go go Jojo) Johansson, a major basketball star - though she doesn't at first recognize his status (wouldn't the prestige and fame of Dupont's basketball team have cropped up in her research!?). Trying to have it all ways, Charlotte succumbs to the lure of cool and social ambition and it all ends about as badly as it can.<br /><br />Wolfe portrays only the extremes of campus life - the dissolute frat boys and elevated sports stars whose status rises with their sexual \\"score,\\" the defiant radical intellectuals desperate for a cause, the most pompous or incandescent professors, and the crudest coaches. The vast middle embraces the life of the mind and the body, of course, depending on what day of the week it is, but Wolfe has never been interested in the middle.<br /><br />Point of view veers among characters, so even the odious, egotistical Hoyt acquires a measure of humanity and sympathy and even earnest Charlotte has flaws deeper than vanity. For all that each character is an archetype, each is also an individual and their stories are suspenseful and involving. Subplots involve cheating and campus politics, treated with Wolfe's manic blend of acid humor.<br /><br />This is the least of Wolfe's novels - indeed, it can't hold a candle to the unforgettable energy of \\"Bonfire of the Vanities.\\" There's a fair amount of excess verbiage; scenes that go on too long to sustain even Wolfe's manic spin and the crude sexual badinage becomes numbing.<br /><br />But it's a thoroughly entertaining page-turner, which examines an eternal dilemma. The young social animal suddenly freed from familial authority and oversight, to graze unconstrained on a smorgasbord of ideas and pleasures bears an unprecedented responsibility for herself. Peer pressure and temptation are never stronger than that first year away from home. And in the end the reader who's fallen under Charlotte's beguilingly self-centered sway will long to know what she does next.ending on what day of the week it is, but Wolfe has never been interested in the middle. <br /> <br />Point of view veers among characters, so even the odious, egotistical Hoyt acquires a measure of humanity and sympathy and even earnest Charlotte has flaws deeper than vanity.

Rick, chef/owner of the Mexican restaurant, Frontero, and his daughter, Lanie, 13 (younger when they began the project), eat and cook their way from Mexico to Thailand, by way of Oklahoma, France and Morocco, with side trips to Spain, Japan and Hong Kong. The occasions are family vacations or celebrations and the cooking is done in relaxed settings with friends. Each chapter begins with essays by each of them describing the travel and food experience, from shopping and cooking to bad roads and old memories. Rick's tend to be more rhapsodic and reminiscent; Lanie's are sassy, direct, and funny. Each chapter also includes \\"five cool CDs\\" to play while cooking, like Johnny Cash for barbeque and Kahled for Moroccan food.<br /><br />Each attractively designed, well-organized recipe starts with a brief intro from both authors. Rick's include cultural background and cooking tips; Lanie's are conversational and opinionated. For example, Rick describes choosing exactly the right peppers and accompaniments to a tapas of Spanish Ham Salad. And Lanie says: \\"This tastes exactly like an Italian sub without the bread.\\"<br /><br />It's a teaching book with \\"do this first\\" boxes included in each recipe and thorough step-by-step directions. Lanie (who likes steak tartare but isn't crazy about raw tomatoes) often describes the experience of cooking, the taste sensations, and her personal ratings. The dishes, from breakfast to dessert, are mostly simple classics: Huevos Rancheros; Bangkok-Style Chicken Satay; Moroccan Meatballs (cumin) in Tomato Sauce;  Tartiflette (French potato and cheese supper); Hickory House (his parents' barbecue restaurant) Deviled Eggs; Pad Thai; Potato-Leek Soup with Bacon; Profiteroles; Chocolate Truffles.

She came late to the cuisine of coastal Veracruz, thinking it too touristy and modern for her taste. But she has come to love the place and opens her book with a culinary driving tour of the region, discussing terrain, local ingredients and the best restaurants. The recipes make plentiful use of seafood, various chilies, corn, beans, tomatoes, citrus and avocado.<br /><br />From Almond Soup to Shrimp Salad to Totonac-Style Beans with Pumpkin Seeds to Shredded Chicken in Blackberry Liqueur Sauce, Zarela insists on fresh herbs, painstaking preparations and the finest ingredients (which she often laments of finding in the U.S.). Dishes range from simple to elaborate (more time-consuming than complicated); the photographs of the region and the food are beautiful, and Zarela's directions are clear. This is Mexican food at its finest.	2004-11-15

Hobbs, for instance, the clinic cat, an obese fellow who gorges on junk food, perhaps in memory of his feral days, and reverts to wild ferocity whenever the whim strikes him. But these animals afford mostly comic relief in Whynott's behind-the-scenes portrait: a serious tale of human drama; of passion, ethics and personalities.<br /><br />Chuck Shaw is a focused man who chose his work after serious deliberation and before going to Vietnam as a bomber pilot. He wanted a well-lived life in a profession that involved physical activity, outdoor work, and the prospect of working with people and helping others. He also wanted to be independent and own his own business. Veterinary medicine fit the bill and after two years in practices that didn't quite fit him, he bought a \\"mixed practice\\" in bucolic, beautiful Walpole.<br /><br />A mixed practice is unusual these days and growing more so, involving both large animals and small. Chuck might spend the morning checking a dairy herd for pregnancies, the afternoon treating cats and dogs at the clinic and be called out at midnight for an emergency lambing or an \\"HBC\\" (dog hit by car). Over the years Chuck had gone through eight associate vets who stayed from a few months to four years.<br /><br />Roger Osinchuk, the best fit, is beginning his fifth year in the practice as the book ends. Osinchuk, a Canadian from Alberta, grew up wanting to be a veterinarian. His experience with horses is extensive and he quickly builds an equine practice and embarks on a side business breeding and training horses of his own.<br /><br />Roger, exhausted by the long hours and the on-call weekends, convinces Chuck to hire a third associate - not an easy task for a mixed practice in a rural community. Erika Bruner, a new graduate from a suburban, academic background, wants to work with cows. She likes getting mud and manure on her boots, enjoys the placid, wise look of the cow, and doesn't flinch at being shoulder deep in the animal's anal tract. Enthusiastic and determined, she lifts everyone's spirits. At first.<br /><br />Whynott spends long days with each of these people, getting them to talk while they work. They talk about the work, and Whynott describes it in details that range from fascinating to gross, often at the same time. They save animals and lose them and Whynott shows us their jubilation and sadness - and sometimes their self-doubt. Inexperienced Erika has a lot of that, but no one is immune.<br /><br />The patients can't talk, and, not owning their own bodies, have no say in their treatment or even their death. From cows who don't produce enough milk to dogs that bite, death is sometimes the only treatment the owner wants and this is a critical issue in the practice, particularly with pets. Though Chuck early on makes it a rule not to kill healthy pets, it's a rule he sometimes has to break. During Erika's first months a healthy dog is brought in to be put down. The owner refuses to have it adopted by someone else and so Chuck orders it done. Erika is shocked and furious, but Chuck explains that the owner would only have abandoned the dog or had a neighbor kill it. At least he had the power to end the animal's life humanely.<br /><br />Ethical dilemmas are frequent in a practice where the doctors are surgeons, cancer specialists, emergency doctors, radiologists, dermatologists, obstetricians, etc., and the patients are property. Overwork and underpay (beginning associates with $100,000-plus in debts earn $45,000 a year) also fuel frustration.<br /><br />Whynott's (\\"Giant Bluefin,\\" \\"Following the Bloom) portrayals are moving and involving. He is a mostly invisible observer. Though it's clear people are talking to him, he makes no judgments and offers no personal comments. Traveling with the veterinarians through the beautiful Connecticut River countryside, he shows us the working farms, which each have their own owner-imposed personalities, and the hobby farms with their horses and pet pigs and sheep (which are generally cheerier places, even if the owners are sometimes clueless). He gives us the drama of daily life in the practice, and shows how the underlying dynamics change with the entry of a newcomer.<br /><br />This is an absorbing inside look at a changing profession and the interplay of personalities between a veteran owner, an experienced young man with ambitions of his own, and a neophyte struggling to find her place. A book to be enjoyed by anyone who likes animals and a must for aspiring veterinarians., which each have their own owner-imposed personalities, and the hobby farms with their horses and pet pigs and sheep (which are generally cheerier places, even if the owners are sometimes clueless).

From this legend Sherwood builds a magical, earthy tale of passion, the loneliness of difference and the timeless, fruitless search for earthly immortality.<br /><br />The novel opens with the wedding of the orphan seamstress Rochel to the older shoemaker Zev. Though grateful, she finds him physically repugnant. Then one day she meets the eyes of a handsome giant. Beyond the physical attraction, they recognize a kinship of otherness - the golem without a tongue and the daughter of a Cossack rape - and a passion for the details of life, like the play of light on a leaf, the song of a bird, a rainbow in a mud puddle.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the petulant Emperor Rudolph II, wallowing in luxury and self-importance, surrounded by scientists like Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler, botches a suicide attempt and decides he must live forever. To this end he summons alchemists and magicians and the rabbi who created life from mud. Knowing they will die when their impossible task is complete, the alchemists put on a splendid, desperate show. Rabbi Loew, facing the massacre of his community, approaches his task more somberly, but with equal ingenuity.<br /><br />As tensions build between Christians and Jews, Catholics and reformers, the emperor sinks deeper into madness, and Rochel and the golem struggle against their passion. With the plot driven by petty, grasping minds, ugly rages and great passions - as well as a few serious ideas, good souls and quick thinkers - the novel mingles comedy and pathos, set in a muddy, stinking, pestilential city brightened by the beauty of art, nature and human joy.<br /><br />Sherwood's (\\"Green,\\" \\"Vindication,\\" a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle award) irreverent, muscular  prose is up to the task; witness the emperor's birth:<br /><br />\\"His mother refused myrrh and valerian root, Turkish poppy, did not even take a drink of water, but bore her pain, which she thought her Christian obligation, although no woman was ever sainted for giving birth, save Mary.\\"> <br />\\"His mother refused myrrh and valerian root, Turkish poppy, did not even take a drink of water, but bore her pain, which she thought her Christian obligation, although no woman was ever sainted for giving birth, save Mary.\\"	2004-11-03

This experience peaked during a bizarre night when Liz was nailed into a park outhouse with 22 snakes (she was well known to be phobic) while a classmate was murdered nearby. Now made even more famous by her coupling with a heart-throb rock star, Liz has to go \\"home\\" after 30 years to attend to her ill mother, dogged by the tabloid press which has her pegged for the killing.<br /><br />Enter Haddam's Armenian-American veteran sleuth, Gregor Demarkian, retired chief of the FBI's behavioral science unit, hired by Liz's famous fianc&eacute; to look into the old, unsolved murder. The story shifts point of view among all these characters and only a writer of Haddam's wit and skill (\\"True Believers,\\" \\"Skeleton Key\\") could carry off a story with such relentless venal and despicable types at its core - the brainless prom queen turned balding grotesque, the vindictive Machiavellian ring leader mired in sour alcoholism, the likely-to-succeed girl turned principal from hell, the faithful battered wife, the fat lady and the girl who got everything she wanted.<br /><br />Demarkian, a confirmed city person whose ethnic experience leaves him baffled and bemused by the insidious small-town mindset, gives the story perspective and Liz, whose success has not relieved her myriad vulnerabilities and insecurities, gives it heart. Haddam's exploration of a cultural subset which finds its peak in high school triumphs is fiendishly believable and the resolution is aptly horrifying. A stylish and wicked success.	2004-11-03

Local police surround threatened executives with round-the-clock guards, to no avail. The terrorists elude all their precautions in a series of baffling, bizarre crimes with erudite, cryptic clues, including quotations from a 15th century poem, \\"Ship of Fools.\\"<br /><br />Though suspicion is at first thrown on the old 60s groups, Anders is never convinced and strikes out on his own. Two sad-souled women (an ex-terrorist and a librarian) prove sources of inspiration and romantic interest, while Anders' more outgoing partner, Matucci, does much of the leg work. Though the crimes are spectacular and horrific, the primary focus stays on the one-legged, thoughtful, intuitive Anders, not yet recovered from the trauma of his last case, and bothered by mental tics and occasional hallucinations.<br /><br />Browne explores the changes Union has brought to Europe, some of them painful, many of them creating uncertainties for the future.  The series is more absorbing and intriguing than suspenseful, with a thoughtful European point of view and a sad, appealing protagonist.	2004-11-03

The night before Silas' funeral, Peter's otherworldly mother, the beautiful and \\"touched\\" Rosemund, wakes him to demands he go on a search for an uncle he has never heard of, Obed Winslow. As the reader knows and Peter does not, Obed was Silas' best friend, who left after he lost the contest (literally) for Rosemund's hand.<br /><br />Peter has never been further than a few miles from the little settlement carved out of the forest and at his lyrical, easygoing pace, Reid explores young man's welter of feelings, embodied in his familiar forest surroundings.<br /><br />\\"Peter heard the breent of a nightjar nearby and thought he caught the glimpse of something wing past a fleeting pool of open sky. He had no idea what he was about, walking the woods in the middle of the night, but he did not find them unpleasant, at first, these immediate sensations.<br /><br />\\"It was not long, however, before another reality of life, as he understood it, imposed itself - and that was the fact of uncanny things in the forest, the knowledge of curious and perhaps malicious disembodied minds lurking in the darkness between the trees.\\"<br /><br />Fretting about the family left behind, curious about the unknown world ahead, Peter's agitation is reflected in his surroundings until he lays down to sleep at the foot of a tree. Awakened by a dead deer, he appears, to the hunters, to spring from the belly of the beast, and thus begins an odyssey which opens his eyes to a greater section of humanity than he ever expected to encounter.<br /><br />Taken up by an itinerant and well-read preacher, a wise man, Peter crosses paths with zealots using religion to further evil intentions, fair maidens in need of rescuing, angry farmers fomenting rebellion, rich landowners oozing contempt, liquored-up rabble rousers, coquettish girls with not enough to do and one fiery girl who does exactly as she pleases. He discovers class and the huge gulf between rich and poor - his perplexity at the notion of a picnic is particularly funny - and learns that good or evil resides with the individual and not his place in society. He discovers romance, and discovers it again. He has his eyes opened and retains his innocence.<br /><br />Although more archetype than individual, Peter is an endearing character, who learns to rely on the core of integrity within him - along with his handsome looks and quick, if naïve, mind.

This second Scott Weiss and Jim Bishop case bears out that assessment as the private eye firm takes on two separate cases. Romantic, lugubrious, ex-cop Weiss quickly punches holes in a feminist professor's furious search for an emailing sexual harasser. And adrenaline-junky, ex-criminal Jim Bishop meets his match in the rich-girl-turned-biker's moll he's been hired to seduce away from the aptly named Cobra.<br /><br />Bishop's action-evil-and-danger-driven case is the more exciting, naturally, being charged from minute to minute with sex and violence, daredevil riding, diabolical one-upmanship and sheer viciousness for the fun of it. But Weiss is such an endearing character with his towering intellect and his genteel illusions, that the harassment case becomes more than just comic relief between the searing biker scenes.<br /><br />Honey's wealthy, senate-aspiring father wants her home before she ruins his career along with her life. But it may already be too late. Honey was the driver in a robbery gone bad, and while she likes the thrill of danger, jail is not really on her agenda. Bishop, a hungry ladies' man himself, finds himself alarmingly obsessed with Honey. Cobra, however, a deliberately amoral intellect with a penchant for lectures, will reliably kill them both at any hint of defection.<br /><br />Even with father-figure Weiss reigning him in and working the system, Bishop takes us on a heart-stopping ride, with Klavan, in the guise of his younger self, interpolating himself along the way. Unusual, visceral and larger-than-life, this will keep you up all night and haunt your dreams.	2004-11-03

An irascible force of nature, Detective Superintendent Andy Dalziel seems uncharacteristically incurious about the peculiar suicide of antiques dealer Pal Maciver, ordering Detective Inspector Peter Pascoe to write it off without further investigation. Which Pascoe would have been inclined to do - room locked from the inside, toe through shotgun trigger guard - but for Dalziel's suspicious complacency.<br /><br />Now, the reader knows, as the police do not, that Maciver went to considerable trouble to stage his suicide as a murder, framing his hated stepmother, and that only careful investigation would turn up the clues he had planted. His suicide is a replica of his father's a decade before, right down to the volume of Emily Dickinson poems open on his desk.<br /><br />These were a favorite of the American stepmother, Kay, now Kafka, married to Tony Kafka, head of the munitions company that swallowed the Maciver family business all those years ago. It's Kay whom Dalziel seems to be protecting, an enigma who may be as calculating as she is beguiling, though she has the fat man's total confidence.<br /><br />Point of view switches among the various members of the police team (though never Dalziel; that would blunt his mystique), the family, and the spooks surrounding Kafka's business. The plot thickens as it goes, the by-play among the cops remains witty and shrewd (vaguely like a British version of McBain's 87th precinct), the characters' interactions are complex and satisfyingly underhanded and Hill delivers a sharp twist at the end that settles some questions while raising a host of new ones.

Five years earlier (than when, we're not sure - there are no cell phones in this story), he arrived in western York County, Maine, after 18 months in a hospital recovering from a lightning strike. Or so he's been told.<br /><br />Stoney remembers nothing of his former life and \\"the Man in the Suit\\" comes around periodically to make sure he doesn't, Stoney assumes. Stoney's present is deliberately quiet: a job in a Portland bait shop tying flies and guiding fishermen; a discreet affair with the boss; a good dog; and a house in the woods along Bitch Creek, a fine place to contemplate the mysteries of trout and life.<br /><br />Then he passes a repellent client off to friend and fellow guide, Lyle McMahan, a college student and avid naturalist, and Lyle disappears. Stoney himself finds the body, face down in a pond, murdered. And Stoney, who has flashes of memory he keeps to himself and discovers new abilities when the need for them arises, finds he has a knack for investigating. Which melds perfectly with his photographic memory and his hunter's instincts.<br /><br />This character-driven novel with its tantalizing, sinister hints about the past and Stoney's complex, nuanced reflections and discoveries, has a laconic, atmospheric prose style. Tapply fleshes out the absorbing plot with crucial bits of local history, like the 1947 forest fire that burned out so many hardscrabble farmers. Readers may deduce the murderer before Stoney does, but not the why, and the ending gives Stoney a chance to use all his talents.	2004-11-03

But few hosts have the wit and knowledge to explore the subject analytically - as universal power play, manipulation, social arbiter, and occasion of fear.<br /><br />Browner proceeds back in time through Hitler, the Renaissance courts of Europe, the Dark Ages, the Romans and Petronius' \\"Satyricon,\\" and the Greeks' kindness to strangers, and ends with a poignant, personal meditation on his family's Thanksgiving.<br /><br />Each chapter is a small feast of historical detail, anecdotally presented and peppery with humor, opinion and personal identification. Against the forbidding, sumptuous settings of despots and kings, we imbibe personal foibles, like Hitler's dyspeptic asceticism (\\"His tastes in food hovered somewhere between the mundane and the revolting\\"), and Louis XIV's adroit humiliations (the duchess who preferred to stand than accept a stool).<br /><br />He reveals the personalities behind the successes of Gertrude Stein and Audubon (\\"confidence and hubris\\") and their failed counterparts. His chapter on the Dark Ages - its incivility attributable completely to the Germans' uncouth disregard for any but drunken hospitality - is a savage delight.<br /><br />Two portraits of men behind the thrones - Olivier de la Marche who proudly arranged parties for the ambitious Duke of Burgundy, and Petronius, who orchestrated Nero's excesses, while secretly penning the \\"Satyricon\\" poking fun at it all - take us behind the scenes to muse on the motivations of those who stand and watch. And then there are the Greeks, whose generosity to strangers was compelled by fear of divine retribution.<br /><br />Browner's personal engagement and breadth of knowledge combines fortuitously with his natural storytelling ability and effortless prose style, like the consummate host who makes it all look easy. For those who want more, he appends a chapter-by-chapter bibliography.

Tiny but fearless, she drew huge crowds, particularly for the wrestling act with her 500 pound Bengal, Rajah, conducted in a leather jumpsuit which became her signature costume.<br /><br />Canadian author Hough's well-researched debut novel (which won Ontario's Trillium Award) is full of the rough and tumble of circus life. As involving as it is informative, as moving as it is riveting, the book takes the form of a memoir, or confession. It's the end of a career that spanned five husbands and rose from carny girlie shows to top billing at Ringling, followed by a long denouement as a trainer at JungleLand animal park. It's 1968 and Mabel is facing her 80th birthday.<br /><br />\\"Still, I'm not a complainer, never have been never will be, so I'll skip the drawbacks and jump to the thing I do like about aging. The mind gets supple. Believe it or not, it does. You start seeing around corners. You start picturing what's behind you without having to crane your neck (which you can't do anyway, seeing as it's getting stiffer by the day). It's the one recompense of being aged and wrinkly and sore: you learn the trick of being in two places at once.\\"<br /><br />Time, she says, changes with age. From a forward march it becomes an accumulation, then something different again: \\"like gumballs in a penny machine, all mixed together, jumbled up, rubbing the colour off one another.\\" Age has affected how she sees her \\"greatest sin,\\" the event that divided her life into \\"before\\" and \\"after.\\" \\"Then one day I woke up and my worst sin had come unhobbled in time. Started wandering, it had. Suddenly it was something I'd always done, something I'd always been capable of doing. Suddenly it was a part of me.\\"<br /><br />Mabel anchors the narrative in 1968, moving between past and present. But mostly she keeps the flow chronological. An author's note at the end describes Hough's major sources of research and his considered departures from known fact. It's known that Mabel was a nurse before she became a carnival dancer, but how she got there is vague, though at least one source says she had a nervous breakdown. Hough provides her with a boorish husband and has him commit her, mostly because she found sex with him abhorrent. The horror of marriage is only exceeded by the sadistic therapy, and Mabel uses her God-given wits to get as far from both as possible. Sensing what the one kindly doctor wants to hear from her, she eventually convinces him to help her escape and thanks to another man, finds herself a carny show job.<br /><br />Men are the pattern in Mabel's life. An orphan, she's spent her life looking for love. Though she never develops much interest in sex, men mark the high and low points in her life. Cats are the constant. When lion trainer Louis Roth falls for her, he gives her her heart's desire - a chance to work with the big cats. From there it's onwards and upwards, except when some man shoots her down. And all the while, she's building toward that day in 1927 when her life changed forever, when she did something so awful, it takes most of the book to get there.<br /><br />\\"The thing that scares me the most? The thing that makes me jittery, that makes me dart for one of Dr. Brisbane's pills, that makes me contemplate rash actions: What if neither God nor luck has anything to do with it? What if we make our own luck? What if everything that happens to us happens because we wanted it that way?\\"<br /><br />An awful thought for a woman who's had a lot of luck, good and bad, and it's a fear she develops throughout the narrative as impulse and timing combine to send her soaring and tumbling. Mabel's personality drives this unsparing, tumultuos story, full of love and loss, but weighted with her inability to sustain happiness.<br /><br />Hough steeps the story in circus atmosphere - the ego and competitiveness of the performers, the strict pecking order, the downtrodden workingmen, the animals, the day-to-day tribulations of life on the road in all weather. The tedious hard work of training and the sudden heart-stopping tiger maulings. It's an exotic and exciting picture of the circus' golden age and one talented and tormented (and well scarred) star.

Small things gather momentum. She begins fighting with her husband, resumes smoking, goes out drinking after work. The imaginary playmate from her childhood returns. It's quite some time before she realizes the seductive, insistent third voice inside her head (after the initial voice of temptation, and after the sober rejoinder of the voice of reason and resistance) isn`t her own. Or is it?<br /><br />Gran's (\\"Saturn's Return to New York\\") short novel is a fairly straightforward tale of demonic possession, made chillingly delicious by the spare, unadorned voice, quick pace, and subtleties of psychological desire. Amanda's fate is not inevitable; there are ways to counter the demon, but does she have the faith required, or the strength of mind? Does she perhaps prefer to give in? Thoughtful as well as scary, Gran's tale evokes the lonely fears of adulthood.	2004-11-03

Nicky Dillon, 12, and her father, Robert, live well off a back road in Shepherd, NH.  Still at an age where she values her dad's company, Nicky presents herself in his woodworking shop after school for their usual late afternoon walk. It's December. Snow lies thick on the ground and the low sun is already setting. They don snowshoes and head uphill into the woods behind their isolated old house.<br /><br />\\"I hear the first cry then, and I think it is a cat. I stop under a canopy of pine and listen, and there it is again. A rhythmic cry, a wail.\\"<br /><br />Her father dismisses it and they go on, following their usual route. They have lived in this rural isolation for two years and have developed new habits. \\"My father has lost the weight of a once-sedentary man. His jeans are threadbare in the thighs and tinged with the rusty fur of sawdust. At best, he shaves only every other day. His parka is beige, stained with spots of oil and grease and pine pitch. He cuts his hair himself, and his blue eyes are always a surprise.\\"<br /><br />The cry comes again and then once more as darkness falls. Nicky's father breaks into a run in his snowshoes. Finally his flashlight picks out  a sleeping bag in the snow, a just-born infant blue-lipped inside it. Racing to save the child, Dillon's closely guarded privacy and isolation is threatened, first by police, suspicious of an unkempt loner who happens upon an infant while hiking in the frozen woods at night, then by eager, curious townspeople giddy with excitement, horror, and admiration.<br /><br />But Dillon doesn't give in easily, resisting Detective Warren's intrusive questions and Nicky's desire to bask in the attention. But Nicky wants more than attention. She wants them to keep the rescued baby; to become a family again. As events unfold - discovery of the birth scene in a nearby motel, the hunt for people who would abandon their baby to die - Nicky reveals her own tragedy.<br /><br />Her mother and baby sister died in a car accident two years before. Life with her father is shrouded in a cocoon of grief and silence. Unable to cope with the familiar trappings of home, Robert Dillon left his job as an architect and dragged  his angry daughter from their Westchester, NY, home to make a new start apart from the world. Now he makes simple furniture while his daughter yearns for normalcy.<br /><br />Shreve captures Nicky's voice perfectly. Looking back from an adult's perspective, she recalls these seminal events in present tense, revealing a 12-year-old's frenzied desperation, helplessness and fortitude, while occasionally stepping back to show the longer view.<br /><br />Nicky, fascinated by the existence of this baby, reflects on luck, good for some, bad for others. If they hadn't found her in time, if they hadn't taken their walk, if they hadn't moved to Shepherd, if her mother and sister Clara hadn't died.... She knows they can't replace Clara with this new baby, but wants to try anyway, and she's full of wonder and horror at what sort of person could abandon a baby in the winter woods.<br /><br />Dillon tries to return to his version of normalcy, though Nicky is less willing to let him, and more willing to risk his moods with the questions and thoughts that crowd her mind. Still, his presence and will are larger than hers and he might have succeeded , but for the arrival of a young woman and a storm. Nicky realizes who she is before her father does, and then the storm is upon them and it's too late for the abandoned baby's mother to leave. The next few days will be spent very much in each other's company.<br /><br />This is an intimate, quietly charged novel; a close-up portrait of a loving father and daughter, thrown together in their grief and separated by a gulf of unspoken emotions.  Shreve focuses on their personal reactions in the drama that unfolds, andits fulcrum  effect on the life they've settled for. The simple, straightforward prose and the isolated snowbound setting increase the sense of forced intimacy. It's a story (however unlikely) that draws in the reader and fosters a strong sympathy for all involved.that unfolds, and its fulcrum  effect on the life they've settled for.

At its center is Yusuf, age 12, sold to a rich merchant in payment of his father's debt.<br /><br />Wrenched from his rural home to work in the urban shop of \\"Uncle\\" Aziz, Yusuf does not at first realize he has been sold. He finds himself in a place where Indians, Arabs and African Muslims coexist in a complex hierarchy of languages, religions and cultures, united by their common interest in trade.<br /><br />Their exploitation of each other is ruthless but based on traditions of power and debt. But the Europeans, still just a fabled presence, inspire stories of madness, insatiability and invulnerability. While many merchants believe they want to gobble the whole continent (for unfathomable reasons) Aziz calmly proclaims, \\"They're here for the same reason you and I are.\\"<br /><br />Yusuf, who asks many questions and receives few answers, adapts to town life, only to be abruptly drafted into Aziz' trading journeys to the interior. His first trip exposes him to the dusty hardship of life away from the coast and the comforting sympathy of kind people.<br /><br />His second is a spectacular trek through remote lands filled with warring, hostile peoples, poisonous snakes, treachery, strange diseases and sudden, devastating weather. Through it all Yusuf perseveres, watching and listening, especially fascinated by the nighttime tales of the alien Europeans, who come closer every day.<br /><br />While Yusuf is more a metaphor for Africa's exploitation than an individual, Gurnah's story is breathtaking for the tumultuos color of the life he describes, the vividness of Africa and the rich energy of his prose.	2004-10-22

Reluctant to leave her job and relinquish the independence she has come to treasure, Kehinde convinces herself she will respected at home as a \\"been there\\" woman.<br /><br />But, she discovers, in Nigeria she is only a woman, and a discarded wife at that. Her husband has taken a second wife, an educated professional who has given him a son and shows him the respect he feels is his due.<br /><br />This slim, deceptively simple novel is rich in complexity. Emecheta effectively portrays the smothering feel of the extended family for Kehinde while showing how the second wife, unspoiled by Western culture, borrows strength and power from it when she is weak. Kehinde's strength must come from inside herself and, in Nigeria, that will never be possible.<br /><br />Emecheta, a British immigrant with numerous novels to her credit, celebrates personal fulfillment, with a distinctly feminist cast.	2004-10-22

Lucas, an honor student, responds by skipping school, drinking and drugging, and risking his future by sharing the petty criminalities and violence baiting behavior of his friend, Roar.<br /><br />Lucas clings to childhood by disrespecting his saintly stepmother at every opportunity (refusing her meals but sneaking down for leftovers), mouthing off to the guidance counselor whose goodwill he needs for a scholarship, and breaking into the school with Roar.<br /><br />Meanwhile he carries on dialogues with God and Satan and worries over his sexuality. He falls in love with a girl whose father is a professor and who's not likely to mess up her life. She takes control of the relationship but, although she's the first woman he's slept with under 40, Lucas does his best to alienate her too.<br /><br />Newton's prose is sassy and comic and full of energy. He brings to life the mess of a young man's mind, the lure of the streets, the pull of self-destruction. Although the dialogues with God and Satan are sometimes tedious and the ending abrupt and inconclusive, Newton's is a singular voice with plenty more to say.	2004-10-22

Wrenched from all she knows and loves, Sophie is sent to New York, to the worn \\"scrawny\\" stranger who is her mother, Martine, a woman beset by nightmares.<br /><br />Baldly, Sophie learns she is the child of  rape. Resembling no one else in her family, Sophie realizes she looks like her anonymous father.<br /><br />The story skips six years, to Sophie's first real boyfriend, a Creole her mother distrusts. Martine institutes the old Haitian tradition, mother to daughter, of keeping the daughter pure by testing for virginity, a test that echoes rape. Sophie puts an end to it in an act that leaves her scarred, and runs off to marry.<br /><br />Part Three finds Sophie returning to Haiti, searching for the peace she hasn't found in marriage. Haiti's \\"cult of virginity\\" has left her sexually dysfunctional. But, her grandmother explains, \\"If a child dies, you do not die. But if a child is disgraced, you are disgraced.\\"<br /><br />There are no simple solutions. The rape of Martine colors her life and drives her to her death. The tradition of women's honor, a hated humiliation, is nonetheless, perpetuated by women. Danticat's novel is many layered, touching on tragedy, violence and fate, sometimes at the expense of character development and story. But hers is a powerful, lyrical voice.	2004-10-22

It's not nuclear war, invincible plague or environmental meltdown that destroys world civilization, but some inexplicable outside agent that destroys all electronic and internal combustion technology on March 17 1998. Airplanes crash, cars stop, guns won't fire.<br /><br />You might think the rendering of all weapons of mass destruction into useless junk might make humankind less violent, but no. Instead it's a scholar of medieval warfare who rises to become the villainous ruler of Portland, and fencing enthusiasts, archers, reenactors and crafters become worth their weight in gold - that is, wheat. There are a surprising number of these hobbyists - or maybe not, considering the setting, which is western Idaho and Oregon.<br /><br />Michael Havel is flying the wealthy Larssen family to their vacation home when his Piper Chieftain conks out over the wilderness. Juniper Mackenzie, Wiccan high priestess and single mother, is playing her guitar at a local pub when the power goes out and an airliner crashes in the center of town. Stirling rivets the reader with visual and tactile scenes of chaos and suspense, eventually coalescing into dawning comprehension.<br /><br />The perils of travel and lawlessness (cannibals, bandits, and plague, to name a few) speed the plot as the groups acquire new members and skills. Havel's band, \\"The Bearkillers,\\" become consummate warriors, hiring out their services as they go; Juniper's \\"Mackenzie Clan,\\" revives the old ways as they construct a solid communal farm with fortress-like defenses. Stirling's attention to the struggles and details of daily life (and his copious research) is as fascinating as the swordplay and rousing battle strategy.<br /><br />What gets old, unfortunately, is his theme of myth in history, which renders his main characters, who start off resourceful and human, stock heroes by the end. And the New Agey Wiccan stuff, at first incidental, becomes cloying. Nevertheless Stirling's writing has a cinematic immediacy that draws the reader fully into this vivid, rousing story and will leave most hoping for a sequel.stuff, at first incidental, becomes cloying.

The prime suspect in the destruction of Moscow is a trade rival, New Dresden, which vehemently denies the charge. Unfortunately, Moscow's response ships are already enroute to retaliate and only a handful of diplomats can countermand the order.<br /><br />Enter Old Earth Agent Rachel Mansour, first introduced in \\"Singularity Sky.\\" The Moscow diplomats are being murdered one by one and it's up to her to find out who and why and save New Dresden. There's also the Eschaton, the godlike artificial intelligence (from \\"Singularity Sky\\"), who keeps humanity within certain strict limits. Why didn't it save Moscow?<br /><br />The narrative moves from view to view, giving the reader a bigger picture than any of the characters. The ReMastered, a Nazi-type cult culture, are responsible for considerable murder and mayhem, for unknown motives; Frank the Nose, a cantankerous roving journalist, comes to Wednesday's aid; Rachel jumps from the frying pan into the fire and the Eschaton is maybe not the omniscient arbiter humanity thinks it is.<br /><br />Stross' writing is evocative and colorful; his sense of humor is dry and sly; and the plot lines converge actively for a satisfying, nail-biting conclusion.	2004-10-18

Jump to 1967 and he's an almost catatonic patient at a Delaware mental asylum. He has been transferred there from the state hospital for the criminally insane after charges of kidnapping a young woman were dropped for lack of evidence. Jamie's employer, Grenville Hawkes, a wealthy, powerful and somehow threatening scion of the town's founding family, is paying Jamie's bills, though he hasn't been to visit.<br /><br />Hinton reveals how Jamie got to this point through tantalizing glimpses into his tortured, fractured memories and through the tales of adventure on the high seas that he relates to Dr. Phillip McDevitt. Partnered with an older man, Kellen Quinn, Jamie has seen fortunes come and go. He has smuggled jewels and faced armed pirates; he has lost skin to sharks and outrun them too; survived foreign jails and countless fights; gun runners and vicious rich girls. So what brought him to this broken pass?<br /><br />We're almost halfway through the book before the real horror of Hawkes Harbor is revealed: the \\"It\\" Jamie is so terrified of, the \\"thing\\" that has engendered this swashbuckling young man's absolute terror of the dark. And it is a shock. Partly because the sharp turn into the supernatural is so unexpected. Hinton's best known YA novels, \\"The Outsiders,\\" and \\"Rumblefish,\\" are masters of street-level reality.<br /><br />But once the adjustment is made, this new aspect is intriguing, involving issues of addictive psychology (including coercive mind control), love and redemption. And terror, of course, plenty of visceral, graphic terror, and suspense too, though both taper off towards the end, in a resolution that defies the horror genre. Jamie is an engaging character and Hinton peppers the narrative with plenty of humor as well as dark suspense. Veering away from genre even as she incorporates its classic elements, Hinton has produced an unpredictable and compelling narrative.n as she incorporates its classic elements, Hinton has produced an unpredictable and compelling narrative.	2004-10-11

The last he remembers is meeting a friend in a hotel room in New York City. \\"Strangely, though, he couldn't remember the name of the hotel or that of the friend.\\"<br /><br />The story then switches to a coffee plantation where an older, sophisticated man and his beautiful young peasant wife greet a young, white visitor, Janice Hall. She is researching an ancestor, a sea captain who had helped the plantation's white owner and some others escape during the slave revolt that led to the island's independence.<br /><br />Cave alternates between Dan's nightmarish stumbling through island terrain, beset by hallucinations, evil desires and fragmented memories and Janice's halting probe into the past. In one hallucination he sees a young girl and attacks, rapes and murders her. The next morning, seeing a similar girl in the flesh, he is powerless to subdue his murderous urge. Chased, cursed, and reviled, he naturally finds his way to the plantation.<br /><br />Voodoo charms meant to curse the white interlopers and the plantation are found throughout the property. Workers refuse to work, accidents plague those who try to help, horrifying nightmares haunt Dan and Janice as they struggle to discover who is trying to destroy them and why.<br /><br />This is an old-fashioned sort of story from a veteran horror writer who has published nearly a thousand pulp-fiction stories and 49 novels in his 70 years of writing.

Suddenly \\"the world becomes not there and he has to stop in his tracks while he sees nothing but moving shapes of black. ...He'd like to think it's his mind playing up but this feels as if it's coming from somewhere else. The black shapes are as sharp as double-edged razor blades and Max fears that if he makes a wrong move blood will come out of his eyes and ears and nose and mouth. What would be a wrong move? A wrong thought?\\"<br /><br />When the world returns, a foul smelling, ebony-skinned dwarf is writhing on the ground toward him and demanding to be carried. He is heavy, and while no one else can see him, Max has to claim an injured back to explain his posture. With the help of his mind (a major, talkative and sensible character) he places the dwarf as Apasmara, the Hindu demon of forgetfulness and, with a little more help, remembers the CD, an Indian raga. \\"Lola!\\" The love of his life, his proudly proclaimed \\"destiny woman\\", the woman he loved and lost in less than a year; Lola has sent the raga and the dwarf to wipe his every memory of her.<br /><br />As his memories flood back, short chapters shift between 1997 and 2001. Then, too, there was a book that wouldn't get started.  Max recalls love at first sight, deepening as he and Lola discover a shared world of music and poetry and art. Lola Bessington, self-assured daughter of London aristocrats, half engaged to tall, handsome well-to-do Basil Meissen-Potts, is a bit resistant at first, but Max, convinced of his destiny, wins her.<br /><br />But there are things she doesn't know about Max. He has a history of falling in love - and out again. \\"In all fairness he ought to have been wearing a sign that said, IT AIN'T NECESSARILY SO when he appeared in the Coliseum Shop in 1996 and said that Lola was his destiny woman.\\" When he meets the brash and beautiful Lula Mae he succumbs, no, pursues temptation. His mind tries to warn him, Lola tries too, but Max wants what Max wants.<br /><br />Then, having lost Lola, he's bereft. It's 1997 and suddenly his novel takes off with an artist named Moe who loses the world and acquires a dwarf named Apasmara. Max and Moe dialogue; Moe demanding to know where this dwarf came from, Max confused but sure it has something to do with Moe's as yet unknown actions. Moe wants the dwarf deleted but Max refuses. Returning to his memories, he mourns, but revels in them too. The delicious Lula Mae, the elegant Lola. Both lost. And now his own created character is breaking out of the form he has cast him in.<br /><br />Once Max has lost Lola the narrative widens to include her separate life. Living in a fashionable London Buddhist retreat, she puts her well-honed mind to work, learning to compose a raga. It will take her years, but we have no doubt Lola will do it. Lola's formidable determination may yet be a match for Max's fecklessness.<br /><br />Time, memory and reality become increasingly unmoored. The tone is playful and melancholy, humorous and ardent. It's full of musical and literary allusions and metaphysical conundrums. We sympathize with Max and hope he will find and win Lola, but why? He's a cad who only wants what he can't have. Can he change?<br /><br />Hoban is a marvelous, imaginative and clever writer who makes a simple love story into a meditation on the nature of love, reality and memory, the creative process and spiritual wisdom. Or does he? While some readers will revel in the \\"emptiness is form, form is emptiness\\" mantra, others will begin to feel that form overwhelms substance. This reader did a bit of both.

Puzzle fans will get a kick out of the flurry of taunting, cryptic notes involving Shakespeare quotes, anagrams and palindromes that tease the cops toward his intentions. The rest of us will muddle our way through, a step ahead of Steve Carella and the gang - thanks to the extra clues McBain provides in his switches to the Deaf Man's point of view.<br /><br />Between hilarious guesses and flashes of ingenuity the detectives have personal issues.  Bert Kling's new love has a secret and it's winding him up dangerously; a sniper is stalking Cotton Hawes; Carella is going into debt over the dreaded double wedding of his mother and sister; Eileen Burke is embarking on a new romance, and Fat Ollie, still obsessed by his missing book, goes his own way, as usual.<br /><br />The plot is perfectly constructed, with plentiful measures of suspense and humor, and the dialogue is snappy and clever. After more than 50 books in almost 50 years, this series is as fresh as ever.	2004-09-27

Gow had been released after the killings resumed while he was in prison, casting doubt on his guilt.<br /><br />The diary begins the day of Susan's conviction. Lachlan, convinced of her innocence and determined to find something to exonerate her, smashes the heavy lock on her study door and helps himself to her computer. Almost immediately he happens on secrets that shake his confidence. He remembers how in love they were, her more than him even, and wonders how things got to this pass, where she tells him nothing, and won't even look at him in court where she's portrayed as Gow's scorned lover. \\"She was my sweet, soft-hearted Susie, and then, quite suddenly, she was someone else.\\"<br /><br />Lachlan, a doctor and would-be writer who gave up his career at the birth of their daughter 19 months earlier, may have been clueless where his wife was concerned, but he has full control of this narrative. Truth, objectivity, deception and self-deception are elusive from the beginning, and more so as he explores the darkest corners of his marriage and pieces together a new puzzle picture of the murder. He digresses at will, obsessing about his image in the papers, and enjoying the pitying flirtations of the mothers at his daughter's nursery school. He rants and whines, and gorges himself on sweets and self-pity. He flays himself open on the page, and then admits to agonizing over sentence structure as if crafting a story for posterity.<br /><br />We sympathize with his plight and his passion while we cringe at his venality and passive-aggressive self-absorption. Lachlan is utterly, nakedly human and his compelling voice drives the narrative to a stunning, fitting conclusion.

But: \\"Already I was wary about making friends with the kind of person who would want to be friends with a person like me.\\"<br /><br />This line says much about what is endearing and annoying about Candida - her sour depression and her intelligent self-mockery. She spends most of her time alone, reaching out tentatively to women from the Virgil class, having a grudging lunch with an inquisitive friend from her former life and defensively bracing for a  visit from her brash, brazen and successful old school chum. In the dirty, littered streets, she is a sharp, alien observer of everything from the \\"shocking\\" condition of the pavement to the impenetrable advertisements and graffiti posted along the way: \\"I couldn't decode any of the messages.\\"<br /><br />Candida reflects on her life and marriage, motherhood and age (\\"There was more to look forward to, but less to possess. It's the other way round now\\"). She's merciless, to herself as well as others and readers may well come to sympathize at least a little with the faithless husband. Then Candida comes into a small windfall of money - enough to lighten her tone and spur her to new heights of initiative - organizing an excursion from Tunis to Sicily and Naples to follow in Aeneas' footsteps. She recruits her friends from the Virgil class as well as her two older friends and the second part of the novel takes off in a completely different vein.<br /><br />The third person narration is upbeat, the wit still wry but less mordant, the characterizations sharp and perceptive. The plot also heats up in this section, and the two following sections, with revealing, unexpected, and sometimes unlikely, twists. The novel is perceptive, clever and surprising. Though Candida occasionally makes you want to give up on her, Drabble (\\"The Peppered Moth,\\" \\"The Witch of Exmoor\\") keeps you going with her acerbic, pitch-perfect prose and Candida's refusal to give up on herself.lass as well as her two older friends and the second part of the novel takes off in a completely different vein. <br /> <br />The third person narration is upbeat, the wit still wry but less mordant, the characterizations sharp and perceptive.

Books	4	8	8	N	N	An irreverent, entertaining resource	Readers of any political stripe should enjoy Holland's breezy, brief and irreverent takes on our presidents. From George Washington's preoccupation with mules to George W's fitness regime, she pokes fun at personal quirks while touching on the major historical moments in each administration and showing that however bad we think things are now, they've been worse. Campaigns, for instance, are models of honesty and restraint in comparison to the days when Adams was not only accused of listening to his wife but described in the newspapers as \\"old, querulous, blind, crippled, toothless.\\"<br /><br />These thumbnail sketches remind us not only of who all those middle one-term presidents were and when, but give us the firsts. New Hampshire's Franklin Pierce, for instance, was the first to have a Christmas tree in the White house and installed central heating too.  Benjamin Harrison was the first to watch a professional baseball game And Andrew Jackson was the first \\"to decide that a President can veto a perfectly constitutional bill just because he doesn't like it, and he was like a kid with a new toy.\\"<br /><br />Most of the presidents known for freeing their slaves never did, but Robert E. Lee did and \\"he didn't wait till he was dead to do it, either.\\" Some presidents were more interesting for their wives - Holland gives most of Madison's space to Dolley and not just his space either. Taft's wife wanted the presidency more than he did and nudged him at conferences to stay awake while Pierce's wife was so unhappy at his election, she refused to attend the inauguration.<br /><br />There are scandals and wars and statesmanlike deeds, sure, but there are also pets and bratty children and fashion statements and swelled heads. A useful, funny and caustic book.	2004-09-26

So I'm not exactly unbiased. But who is?<br /><br />The first part of McDougal's emotionally engaging narrative covers childhood, then marriage to real estate developer and founder of the ill-fated Madison Guaranty S&L, Jim McDougal. The Marriage and various businesses failed and she embarked on a romance with Madison Guaranty employee then lawyer, Pat Harris, and a claustrophobic employee/friend relationship with Nancy Mehta.<br /><br />Outgoing and shy, loud and retiring, depending on the company, McDougal does not come across as the sort of person to go to jail rather than answer questions. One minute her life is going along willy nilly, from one controlling, needy, demanding personality to another, when wham! Suddenly neurotic, vesuvial Mehta is charging her with grand larceny and the Office of the Independent Counsel is offering dire threats and deliverance from all - including the Mehta charges, which hardly seems within their purview. Friendly and likable, McDougal seems primarily characterized by her optimistic naivety. She even looks forward to her first session with the OIC: \\"I felt that there were a lot of false statements and ridiculous rumors, particularly about Madison, that I could help clear up.\\"<br /><br />But her get-out-of-jail-free card comes with a catch - testimony against the Clintons. McDougal does a fine job of describing her flabbergasted outrage and her dawning awareness of the trap closing around her. Aghast after the first Whitewater trial when she was convicted of things \\"I was not even aware had happened until ten years later,\\" McDougal begins to fear the OIC will stop at nothing to get Clinton. It was not bravery, she says again, that made her clam up, but the certainty that Starr would indict her for perjury if she insisted on the truth - she didn't know anything bad about the Clintons. She knew she might go to jail for contempt, but she never dreamed it would be for the full 18 months allowable by law.<br /><br />The second half - prison - is riveting, horrifying and inspiring. Her first jail was easy, comparatively. The food was lousy, but she made friends. The worst hardship was lack of reading material - the  only book inmates were allowed was the Bible. But no sooner does she say on the phone, \\" `I could do the whole eighteen months here,' \\" than she's whisked off to a mental ward in a federal facility and from there to lockdown (23 hours a day solitary confinement) on \\"Murderer's Row\\". There were seven prisons in all, but however bad things got (sadistic guards, overflowing toilets, body cavity searches, sensory deprivation) McDougal always found some interest to sustain her  - usually one or more of the inmates who, needless to say, all had lives immeasurably worse than hers.<br /><br />On her release, the OIC filed criminal contempt and obstruction of justice charges against her and she still had the Mehta charges to face. Triumphing against both, McDougal spares an ounce of sympathy for Nancy Mehta, but her flush of victory against Starr and the OIC is unadulterated glee and great fun to read. In the end, McDougal says jail was good for her. She still hates the people who put her there and believes they were behind many of the special humiliations and privations she endured, but \\"there's no doubt in my mind that I'm a far better person than I was before.\\"<br /><br />Spiked with emotional peaks and valleys, McDougal's memoir is compulsively readable - and believable.as not bravery, she says again, that made her clam up, but the certainty that Starr would indict her for perjury if she insisted on the truth - she didn't know anything bad about the Clintons.

In between spectacularly successful assignments, Charlie lives a healthy bachelor life with a happy assortment of girlfriends in Los Angeles. Sounds like a fantasy life? Maybe. Maybe not.<br /><br />Susan Flemyng is doing cutting-edge neurological research on replacing visual memory in brain-damaged patients when her husband is killed in a plane crash. In the midst of her grief, a stranger approaches, claiming to be a journalist. He says her husband was murdered upon learning about secret government uses of her work. The man is clearly a paranoid conspiracy nut, but when he, too, turns up dead, Susan decides to do a little checking up. Until the conspirators kidnap her young son.<br /><br />What Susan and Charlie have in common seems to supply a particularly monstrous answer to the question of Charlie. This revelation sets the story going in a new direction, full thriller mode. But wait a minute. Not so fast. Ambrose (\\"Coincidence\\") has another trick or two to play. Or three or four. Or more.<br /><br />Outlandish, witty and chilling, Ambrose's mind-bending story successfully juggles issues of perception, the nature of reality, medical ethics and research, and government power in a page turner that will keep you guessing all the way through.	2004-09-26

And then, without warning, her tranquility and security, even her self-respect, are shattered. Her husband, Nathan, announces he's leaving her for a younger woman - her own assistant, Minty. And when she marches into work demanding Minty be fired, or at least transferred, she's told it's she who will have to go, making way for a younger view. Minty's, of course.<br /><br />It's an old sad story, but Buchan's subtle, barbed prose and anecdotal style lift it above the ordinary. Rose is a strong, reflective character with a rare gift for being honest with herself. Reeling, she naturally embarks on a downward spiral, drinking Nathan's whiskey for evening solace, neglecting the garden, indulging in lethargy. \\"I breathed in traffic fumes, a whiff of rotting litter, and the knowledge that, for the moment, I was lost.\\" But she remains aware of the pitfalls of despair, looking wryly askance at herself as she  prowls the house, dwelling on her marriage, her mother's widowed perseverance, her own youthful ardor, the dramas of motherhood and family. \\"If I closed my eyes, I was confronted by pictures of myself hurling violent abuse at Minty. If I dismissed them, equally vivid ones of HURTING her took their place.\\"<br /><br />As we already know from the (too flip) title, Rose does not stay down. She touches bottom and begins to reconstruct her life; reassuring her children, picking up with friends, taking a few freelance jobs. She goes to Paris and buys some new clothes (naturally) and she runs into the old flame Nathan has always been jealous of, a famous travel writer and free spirit, (who is not much better developed than Nathan and about as much of a self-absorbed cad). But Rose's spirit and deliberation steer clear of clich&eacute;. Developments sidestep expectations. Rose's politic instincts stand her in good stead.<br /><br /> Buchan, who prefaces her novel with the Spanish proverb, \\"Living well is the best revenge,\\" informs her story with a subtle distinction between inner passion and outer civility. Rose, half demented with grief, humiliation and anger, keeps herself to herself. Bitterness and self-pity seldom surface in her exchanges with friends or her children or colleagues. Even with Nathan, except for the occasional barbed rejoinder, she is reasonable, too reasonable, some will say. But Rose's civility works to lift her from despair and, perhaps more important, make it easier for others not only to bear her company, but to admire and respect her.

These include his first, \\"The Defection of A.J. Lewinter\\" (1973), about a low-level American scientist who defects to the Russians - or does he? Then his 1990 novel, \\"The Once and Future Spy,\\" pits the CIA against the CIA in a twisted tale of dirty tricks and history.<br /><br />But \\"The Sisters,\\" a conspiracy of conspiracies, is the apex of Littell's diabolical wit. Plotting is the vocation of the title characters, Francis and Carroll, old CIA hands, known to their leery colleagues as \\"the sisters Death and Night\\" (Walt Whitman), and the story opens with their obscure and hilarious conception of \\"the perfect crime.\\" They are too careful - communicating in cryptic written notes which are shredded at day's end - to let anyone, including the reader, in on what this crime might entail, but its instrument is a Russian sleeper - an unactivated spy living secretly as an American.<br /><br />To find him, the Sisters must suborn the Potter, a disgraced and retired KGB officer, the former head of the Russian sleeper school. His last and best pupil, the one the Sisters seek, is also the son he never had. But, between threats and bribes, the Potter betrays him, as he knows he will.  The action picks up as the Potter flees Russia and then his CIA \\"protectors\\" in order to intervene and stop his prot&eacute;g&eacute; from committing the crime that will reverberate around the world.<br /><br />Narrative shifts among the various characters - the Sisters, the Potter, a Cuban assassin whose role remains a mystery until things are well advanced, a couple of Russian masterminds, a pair of Canadian assassins and the debonair, reluctant, but well-taught young Sleeper - all of them plotting and counterplotting.<br /><br />As a number of these chase each other across the country, Littell's black wit and deft storytelling keep the pages turning. The Potter, a hapless, likeable fellow, despite his cold-bloodedly ruthless side, acquires a civilian sidekick and the reader's sympathies. As the story comes together with a bang, first-time readers will gasp at Littell's masterfully inclusive cynicism and readers familiar with the twists will marvel again in sheer appreciation.

Acclaimed Canadian writer Vanderhaeghe uses this fairly ordinary plot device to tell a rousing, riveting tale of love, lawlessness and the vast cultural gaps that bind and divide.<br /><br />Simon Gaunt is the missing young man. Favorite son of a self-made British industrialist, Simon disappeared during an 1870 mission to bring Christ to the Indians. The reader knows Simon got lost in a blizzard and was discovered - and maybe rescued - by an Indian \\"holy being.\\" Simon's family knows only that the leader of the missionary expedition has been found dead, near Fort Benton, on the Montana frontier.<br /><br />Henry Gaunt sends his two remaining sons, Addington, the militaristic one, and Charles, the artist, to America to find Simon. The cultural gulf between the Brits and their former colonials is instantaneous, wide and deep.<br /><br />\\"Until Addington attempted to requisition this room for his own use, I was disgusted by the state of it, the very room which the proprietor boasts is the finest the Overland Hotel has to offer,\\" reflects Charles, Simon's fraternal twin.<br /><br />Haunted by memories of his gentle, otherworldly brother, Charles organizes the expedition, but waits impatiently on his older brother's leadership. Addington, loaded for bear (literally), has acquired a shady biographer in the tradition of all Western adventurers, and seems to look on the expedition as a rustic \\"Grand Tour,\\" complete with a wagonload of claret and expensive brandy. Charles, chafing to leave, finds them a guide - Jerry Potts, a half-Indian, half-white woodsman, torn by his heart's allegiance to the two warring cultures he embodies.<br /><br />But on the eve of their departure a young girl is murdered, and as an indirect consequence, the party grows by three. The girl's sister, Kate Stoveall, left in Fort Benton while her no-account husband sells whiskey to the Indians, joins the party as a cook, seeking the thugs who murdered her sister. Custis Shaw, Civil War veteran, loner and Bible-reading enigma, rides out after Kate, the woman he loves. And saloonkeeper Aloysius Dooley, loyal friend to Custis, goes along to keep an eye on his friend.<br /><br />Vanderhaeghe (\\"The Englishman's Boy\\") moves seamlessly between viewpoints, going deep into his characters' psyches and memories, exploring their self-doubts, joys and demons, without, however, stinting on the action, of which there is plenty, both past and present.<br /><br />Often the challenging terrain often seems adventure enough: \\"Powdery clay steams into the air, cloaks men and beasts in a choking, sallow cloud. Everyone is too dry-mouthed to speak, the only sounds accompanying the advance are the faint music of jangling trace chains, the plangent protest of axles, the dull plod of hooves.\\"<br /><br />And the ill-sorted companions begin to grate even more on each other. \\"Seeing Addington Gaunt prink and preen is a most grievous pain in the fundament,\\" thinks Custis, who also notes: \\"The baleful gaze Potts is turning on the Captain makes me a tad uneasy.\\" Custis has more serious matters on his mind, though. Kate and Charles Gaunt, an unsuitable pairing if ever there was one, are spending a lot of time sneaking off together. But Kate rejects his warnings and Charles is too much the gentleman to even acknowledge them.<br /><br />Vanderhaeghe's West is much like the best of Larry McMurtry's - full of deep souls and vicious creeps, cruelty and kindness, paradox and contradiction and miles of beautiful, dangerous country.

Why isn't exactly clear; he was fond of his father and close to his younger brother and sister, but for some reason he hasn't much spoken to them or seen them in years.<br /><br />Their mother ran off when Nemo was nine and nothing has been heard from her since. She was an exotic creature and never really accepted by the insular islanders. His sister, Brooke, still lives on the island; his brother, Bruno, hasn't found his path yet, but he's only 23. Not that Nemo's life is so great - he wrote a novel a few years previously, but has nothing in the works and no great career. No reason, really, why he shouldn't have visited his father before he was so horribly killed in the family's old smokehouse.<br /><br />Clegg builds his story incrementally and Nemo's narration has an eerie affect; an unevenness, almost a stutter. He adds details, then leaves great holes, or wanders off the subject, even contradicts himself, but in small ways. This is annoying at first, as if the author had lost his place and his editor had fallen down on the job, but persevering readers will be rewarded. The atmosphere builds as chunks of childhood come back - to haunt. And some kind of ghost stalks the rambling old Raglan house at night, unless it's just the increasingly unbalanced Brooke.<br /><br />Then there's the Brain Fart - a week in the children's lives that went missing somehow - they all had fevers, some kind of illness, and they've made something of an uneasy joke of it since. And there's the Dark Game, a weird imagination-meditation game taught to them by their war-hero father who used it to keep himself going as a POW.<br /><br />The details of the murder emerge gradually, painting an increasingly horrible picture, alongside the stranger and stranger details of the children's almost claustrophobic island lives. Clegg (\\"The Infinite\\") heightens the suspense as he sparely constructs a creepy New England atmosphere, composed of old families with old secrets, old buildings with forgotten corners and convincing, intense characters. Some elements are predictable (in a satisfying way) and the climax pulls out all the stops.

The house is the main character here and not one that's ever going to be well understood, not even by its successive chosen residents: an ambitious young couple;  an unhappy single mother and overweight son; an alcoholic writer.<br /><br />Newly widowed Glenn Darnley meets the house on her first day back at work. It has a faintly haunted look from outside, but inside it's full of surprises - a working fireplace, a real Murphy bed, an unusual antique bathtub with big claw feet and lovely new floors and paintwork. There is a faint antiseptic smell to the yellow bedroom, but that's hardly reason enough for so many prospective buyers to reject it.<br /><br />Suspense builds as the house begins to manifest - intruders in the night, faint music wafting up the stairs, doors that open and close by themselves. Moloney (\\"A Dry Spell\\") makes the heart pound as she picks up the pace with increasingly menacing, grim and eerie apparitions with strange seductive powers, closing each section with a climactic horror that puts the house on the market again.<br /><br />This is a well-imagined page turner with one problem - there's no protagonist. Likable Glenn holds things together but we only see her between owners. The house is hardly sympathetic and its successive residents are not people the reader identifies with kindly. But this pretty much unavoidable flaw  won't stop you from staying up well into the night, listening with one ear for sinister creaks and ghostly steps in the attic.	2004-09-22

He likes a peaceful life, well lubricated with good food and drink. But when arrogant foreigners treat him with undue disrespect, Alvarez becomes tenacious, even stubborn.<br /><br />In his 23rd Alvarez novel, Jeffries, who lives on the Spanish Island of Mallorca, gives us a couple of English villains. Keith Vickers, a womanizing playboy with a string of shady business deals to his name, one day disappears off his yacht. Alvarez, though assuming an accidental drowning, notes several anomalies in his dicussions with servants, ex-wives and girlfriends and is chagrined but unsurprised when the body turns up murdered. His chief suspect is the obnoxious British politician George Lovell, who refuses to admit to an angry argument with Vickers and complains to Alvarez' snobbish superior in an attempt to have him fired or at least taken off the case.<br /><br />Intuitive and thorough in his meandering way, Alvarez resists the browbeating as he eats and drinks his way through a list of suspects, unearthing numerous unsavory nuggets from Vickers' life. While the inspector comfortably navigates the gulf between ex-pats and natives on his beautiful island, few others do, preferring to remain mystified (Mallorcans) or ignorant (British). Good-natured irony, a clever mystery, and a gorgeous setting make this another enjoyable and witty outing for the much put-upon Inspector Alvarez.	2004-09-22
514542:US	52774618	RRUCFVF305ANJ	1590300483	704332981	The Changeling of Finnistuath: A Novel	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Vivid depiction of 14th century; character uneven	In 14th century Ireland a half-witted goatherd declares that if his eighth child is a girl he'll kill it himself and never mind the consequences. \\"I'd rather be hanged in the public green for a criminal than be pitied for an unblessed lout.\\" And so the mother and the midwife connive to hide the girl's sex. Brought up as a boy, she never guesses any different until the knowledge is forced on her by a man who would much rather she had been a boy.<br /><br />Given Horsley's (\\"Confessions of a Pagan Nun\\") realistic depiction of 14th century life, this self-deception is a little hard to swallow. Horsley's peasants are flea-bitten, ragged souls who live crowded in hovels with no privacy and Grey (named for her/his father, Gregory) is not supposed to be half-witted.<br /><br />But this is a novel with an allegorical feel despite the earthy realism of the setting. It deals with the nature of identity, and Grey's is influenced by gender expectations as well as sexual nature. In a society that believes in fairies and demon-possession as well as the virgin birth and original sin, Grey accepts the changes in her adolescent body as deformities visited upon her by an angry God. As others take advantage of the deception, her sexuality develops with the accepted male attributes of appetite and lack of inhibition along with a decidedly unmale acceptance of debasement.<br /><br />If the first section is an adventure in boyhood, the second is a turgid, repugnant (and ultimately boring) sexual awakening in whoredom as Grey is smuggled into a monastery to pleasure sinful appetites. Happily, this ends in an illegitimate child and a rousing escape from the righteous, the rich and the Black Death. Not that adversity is done with Grey yet.<br /><br />Except for the disturbingly pornographic humiliations of the middle section, this is a novel of adventure and re-invented identity. Grey becomes whom she must in any given circumstances. Along the way she herds goats, gains an unerring arm, learns to recognize hypocrisy and make it serve her own ends, navigates a monastery, a sumptuous estate and lands beyond the reach of both.<br /><br />The prose is poetic and vivid, immersing the reader in the nasty, brutish and short lives of the Dark Ages.arm, learns to recognize hypocrisy and make it serve her own ends, navigates a monastery, a sumptuous estate and lands beyond the reach of both. <br /> <br />The prose is poetic and vivid, immersing the reader in the nasty, brutish and short lives of the Dark Ages.	2004-09-21

Her choices, as she says in her introduction, \\"raise the boldest questions in some of the boldest ways. Who are we? What makes us human? Are we truly the authors of our own lives? What does it mean to be moral? What does it mean to be free?\\"  She also looks for the man (and one woman) behind the work; their intentions, aspirations, quirks.<br /><br />In each essay, Slater explains the experiment and its results, and then branches out, interviewing detractors, sympathizers and, sometimes, subjects. There's a lot of passionate, or at least, vehement argument. She talks to family members and colleagues and weighs her own thinking in the balance. Occasionally there is a touch of gonzo journalism, as when Slater attempts to test experiments by getting herself committed, or addicting herself to drugs.<br /><br />Most of these are familiar stories - Skinner's boxes, Milgram's lethal shocks, monkeys with wire mothers, planting \\"repressed\\" memories, the popular lobotomy - but Slater explodes a few myths along the way.<br /><br />B.F. Skinner, now often derided as an autocratic automaton who reduced the whole of human existence to behavioral reactions, did not confine his daughter, Deborah, to a box and drive her to suicide. The \\"box\\" was an environmentally benevolent playpen designed to turn her into a \\"confident swashbuckler,\\" and Deborah is alive and well. But not willing to be interviewed. Slater does, however, visit the second daughter who is passionately devoted to her father's memory and describes a warm and loving man. Slater muses on the disparity between myth and man, and how personality and cultural bias contribute, backing personal reflections (and a small experiment on her own baby) with interviews with behaviorists and their opposition.<br /><br />The 1961 Milgram experiments, in which 65 percent of normal, ordinary people from various walks of life were induced to deliver lethal electric shocks to poor spellers, are the most chilling. Slater, who is quite certain she would have complied, explores the aftermath, not just the furor (Milgram lost his tenure at Yale) and the follow-up personality tests (inconclusive), but the consequences for the subjects. She interviews two: one defiant, one compliant. It's the complier who is the most interesting. He's grateful to Milgram. The experiments changed his life. \\"I felt my own moral weakness and I was appalled, so I went to the ethical gym, if you see what I mean.\\" Letters from other subjects echoed this epiphany. One said the experiment caused him to become a conscientious objector.<br /><br />Another experiment in 1964, inspired by the Kitty Genovese case, in which a young woman was murdered over the course of half an hour while numerous witnesses did nothing, measured group responsibility with similarly disturbing results, especially, thinks Slater, as relates to terrorism. But then she dug up a heartening follow-up study which showed that people educated in the pitfalls of group-think were able to overcome it and were twice as likely to lend a helping hand or report a crime.<br /><br />In 1972 David Rosenham called up some friends and asked them to fake their way into a mental hospital. He thought psychiatrists probably didn't have the skills to match their power and he was right. He had his friends say they heard a voice saying \\"thud.\\" They were to fake no other symptoms and were to revert to total normality once admitted. All were admitted. Once on the ward, only the other mental patients detected their sanity. Slater decided to repeat the experiment. And once again it was successful though with a different wrinkle. Admission is not so easy to come by these days, so instead she was prescribed antidepressants and antipsychotics.<br /><br />All of the experiments she discusses still engender a lot of controversy, but none comes close tothe vitriol directed at Elizabeth Loftus who disputes the validity of \\"repressed memory\\" and has shown that false memories can easily be implanted. Loftus herself comes across as a bit strange, but no stranger than any of the others really. The difference is Slater spends a lot of time up close and personal with Loftus.<br /><br />Slater's writing is lively, humorous and colorful and she is uninhibited about involving herself and her family in the narrative. These are all experiments, as she points out, that examine free will, conformity, perception and ethics - philosophy as much as psychology. Yet psychology is moving more towards concrete biological explanations through chemicals and surgery. It's a book that raises thorny issues, examines the people behind the science and stirs the reader to reflection.comes close to the vitriol directed at Elizabeth Loftus who disputes the validity of \\"repressed memory\\" and has shown that false memories can easily be implanted.

It's 1848. A frightened fugitive as well as a refugee, she's disguised as a boy, her flame-red hair carefully blackened with soot.<br /><br />Grateful for food and shelter, she feels lucky to have found a place on this English country estate, but it's a precarious place. The estate manager, suspicious of Paddy, as they call the Irish, startles a horse into injuring the `boy' and turns him off as unfit for work. But the shorthanded cook, Mr. Serle, a dark foreigner, takes him into the kitchen.<br /><br />The back-stories of Serle and Mina unfold amid the daily life of the estate. Though the servants (except for Serle) aren't much more sympathetic than the gentry, Mina keeps her secrets and learns her work from sun-up to well after sundown. Ceely treats us to the aromas of baking bread and roasting meat, the skill of regulating the ovens and ranges, the plucking and peeling and beating and layering and timing of meals for a dozen, twenty or more.<br /><br />Mina's narration, full of grief and hope and determination, but frightened of bullies like the senior kitchen boy, sometimes seems too timid, too ready to cry. Who wouldn't be with the life she's had, but it's not the tone of a hero. And while the reader knows that Serle is a Jew, Mina seems impervious to his disappointment every time she makes a remark about Jewish child killers and devil worshipers. Nonetheless, when Serle falls delirious with a bout of malaria, Mina nurses him. He's her only ally, true, but she has also grown to care for him.<br /><br />Once he discovers her masquerade, her secrets begin to tumble out - her horrific experiences trying to emigrate, and after, losing everything and forced to run. This material might have worked better in flashback than in conversation (well, mostly monologue) as it is an exciting tale, which loses some of its immediacy in the telling. The same is true of Serle's story, when it comes.<br /><br />But the workings of the estate, the venality of people's behavior toward one another, and the social realities of the time ring true. Mina's ignorance and timidity, while sometimes trying, feels authentic and her story is a touching, rousing tale. An absorbing and well-researched debut.ack than in conversation (well, mostly monologue) as it is an exciting tale, which loses some of its immediacy in the telling.

It's colonists have grown artificial, enclosed cities which float, drifting with winds and currents.<br /><br />And Kainui has plenty of wind and current too. Along with unbreathable air, dangerous thunder levels, underwater earthquakes, tsunamis, waterspouts, escaped and mutated pseudo-life, and pirates. Earth anthropologist Mike Hoani, there to study how the colonists' language has evolved, gets his sea legs in a hurry.<br /><br />Hoani joins a metal harvesting (from floating islands of pseudo-life) boat. Battered routinely by storms and quake-generated waves, the boat is damaged and nearly sunk in an accident. Crippled and storm-driven, the boat drifts southward toward the frozen pole, and bumps up against a strange floating island, which yields an unidentifiable metal. Prize or poison?<br /><br />Clement, 1998 Grand Master, delivers lots of science. His alien watery world in its binary star system is fully realized, right down to the physics and chemical reactions. While the story line takes a while to get going, fans of sea adventure and hard sf won't mind. There's never a dull moment on Kainui and the planet - and its culture - is thoroughly detailed. This one is for those who like their alien worlds imaginatively, meticulously and scientifically constructed.	2004-09-21

Bernice Starling dies in that truck, stabbed to death early one morning in 1963 in her own driveway in Biloxi, Mississippi, while her daughter is inside putting on mascara and her father is urging her to hurry or she'll be late for school.<br /><br />Jubilee Starling, motherless at 13, has vehement loyalties. The police, of course, suspect her father. Even her older sister, Charlene, wonders if he did it. But Jubilee, who knows her father had reason to be jealous, never wavers.<br /><br />Bernice was a colorful, vibrant woman with a rich, soulful singing voice. Her love of music had taken her deeper into the black community than most Mississippians approved and, in those turbulent times, Bernice was quick to speak her mind. She'd been called an \\"agitator\\" and in Biloxi in 1963, you could hardly be called anything worse.<br /><br />Things do get worse, though, when another death is connected to Bernice's murder. Levi Litvak, the Jewish TV weatherman from Up North wrapped his sporty convertible around a tree shortly after Bernice was killed. It's only a coincidence until his secretary, Loretta Holliday (soprano at the Catholic church, singing student of Bernice's and abused wife) finds a letter in his desk, proclaiming his love for Bernice and swearing if he couldn't have her, nobody could.<br /><br />\\"Imagining ways to find the killer couldn't save me anymore,\\" mourns Jubilee, who knows the story of an affair is true. When the police release her mother's 1948 truck, she begs her father to let her have it. While other people, including her sister, find it morbid, even ghoulish to drive that truck, Jubilee makes it her own while keeping her mother with her. The truck is her freedom and her link to the past. Jubilee is always asking herself what Mama would say, what Mama would think.<br /><br />The sisters have very different ways of coping with grief and the fact of motherless ness. Jubilee has inherited her mother's musical talent and in addition to the standout voice she plays a mean, bluesy trumpet. Music keeps her company in her solitary rambles. Charlene dislikes the noisy trumpet, and as Jubilee turns off the narrow path of their segregationist church, Charlene clings to it, looking for love. The church provides the social structure and public face she needs and she grows increasingly impatient with Jubilee's anti-social tendencies. Jubilee works at keeping her mother's spirit alive, always asking herself what mama would think or say or do.<br /><br />Yet it's Charlene who flat-out resents Marilyn, the young stepmother who enters their lives four years later. \\" `Why don't you wait a couple of weeks, till the anniversary of Mama's death?'\\" she snaps at her father when he makes his announcement. But the girls are growing up, and their sad, sensitive father is lonely. Marilyn is timid, conventional, and not too bright. But she tries hard, and she needs him.<br /><br />The sisters are on the brink of adulthood as the turbulent 60s explode in anti-war protests and the killings of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy. Jubilee's killing remains a subject of gossip as well as family grief. There are rumors that Levi Litvak never died and Jubilee still keeps a woman's scarf she found in the garage.<br /><br />Charlene turns her back on all that `60s upheaval, preferring her personal brand of anger and hope. Jubilee gets a scholarship to Berkeley, much to everyone's dismay. From her father to her boyfriend, everyone is sure she'll be ruined for Biloxi. And Jubilee hopes they're right. But, certain she will find the acceptance she longs for in the urban expansiveness of Berkeley, she is dismayed to discover a different version of the same mean-spirited small-mindedness she left behind. Along with just the sort of education her friends and family feared. Anda new story to go with her mother's death.<br /><br />Sloan captures the unattractive smugness of 60s radicals as precisely as she does the acid in the sugar of the Deep South, a place where the announcement of President Kennedy's assassination brings cheers in school. Jubilee's beguiling voice is yearning, and a little lost. She has flashes of anger and sass, but mostly she takes everything in, weighing it all against her mother's voice.<br /><br />Sloan's prose is deceptively simple, drawing subtleties and complex emotions from Jubilee's straightforward accounts of events in her life - inadvertently attending the fair on Colored night, playing a dangerous prank on Halloween, overheard gossip in the Piggly Wiggly, first love, second love. Sloan's portrayal of the South seethes. Like many Southern writers she has a love-hate relationship with the place and there's a mournful feel to the racial hatred that pervades the story, and a melancholy to the soft nights and whispered confidences.<br /><br />This is a debut with the emotional charge and atmospheric richness particular to Southern writers.

The young tortoiseshell cat lost her family, and with them, her fudoki - her spiritual lineage - in a terrible fire. She sets out on an aimless journey, bereft of name, family and purpose, and encounters gods and people, none of whom hold any interest for her. But ignoring the gods can have a price and the little cat is transformed into a woman - with enough cat qualities and spirit-aid to help her on her adventures.<br /><br />Free and alone, she is unlike Harueme who has never been either. But Harueme has her own power, not least of which is her imagination. Harueme absorbs the world as people bring it to her in tales, and the cat-woman keeps the world at bay as she moves through it, defending her life, making friends, acquiring a reputation and a name: Kagaya-hime, woman warrior.<br /><br />Johnson's writing is fluid and musical, her characters archetypes and real at the same time, and the historical detail is imaginatively, visually realized. But Harueme, though pampered, selfish and captive, is more involving than the cat-woman, whose humorless detachment is, well, too feline, for real identification. But Johnson makes us believe that Kagaya-hime is what a cat-turned-woman would be like, and this tale of love, belonging, freedom and redemption is as rewarding as it is different.	2004-09-21

Until an Omega veers toward an unexplored system, and a planet that happens to have a very appealing, pre-technological civilization on it.<br /><br />In the conclusion to McDevitt's trilogy (\\"The Engines of God,\\" \\"Chindi\\"), former astronaut Priscilla \\"Hutch\\" Hutchins, is now married, a mother and a Space Academy administrator. It's her job to figure out how to save the cute aliens, staying within Protocol if possible. Which means no contact that might disrupt or influence their development.<br /><br />Jack Markover has spent his working life seeking alien civilizations and the Goompahs - named after similarly appealing TV characters - are the first he's found. In nine months the Omega is going to obliterate them. He can't let it happen.<br /><br />David Collingdale saw the Omega's destruction first hand, and it left him obsessed with stopping them. When Hutch hastily throws together a rescue mission from Earth, he insists on leading it. But the mission won't arrive for almost nine months, so Markover and his crew have to try and convince the Goompahs to flee their cities, while feeding data back to Collingdale's scientists and linguists. Meanwhile the scientists back on Earth are working on the problem and the newspapers are clamoring for rescue.<br /><br />There are a lot of characters involved - in various spaceships and on Earth - and a number of subplots including a romance and mysterious exploding stars that were never stars. McDevitt spices his suspenseful story with plenty of humor and irony (only occasionally heavy-handed) and his characters are credible and sympathetic. The rescue attempt goes down to the wire, naturally, and McDevitt's characters pull out all the stops for an exciting, satisfying finish.	2004-09-21

A formidable intellectual and brilliant writer whose essays and novels have received numerous international awards, Ozick tells her story in the voice of Rose, a naïve, lonely 18-year-old of haphazard education in upstate New York. The novel has the dramatic structure of Dickens and the Brontes, the Victorian writers Rose loves, but its thematic milieu is wholly modern, exploring the clash of European intellectualism and American materialism, and the incomprehensible evil and upheaval of Nazism.<br /><br />\\"Frau Mitwisser led me into a tiny parlor so dark that it took some time before her face, small and timid as a vole's, glimmered into focus.\\"<br /><br />Rose, from a future, matured vantage point, opens her narrative with this day. On her own at 18, she has answered an ad in the Albany paper for some amorphous position with this German-Jewish refugee family. Her parents are dead, her mother long ago, her father recently, and her cousin Bertram (her first, and unrequited, love) is about to abandon her for a radical communist, Ninel.<br /><br />Taking refuge among the family of refugees, Rose remains isolated. Professor Mitwisser is a scholar and a larger-than-life figure, at least at first: \\"I was conscious of a force, of a man accustomed to dictating his conditions.\\" Mrs. Mitwisser, too, was once a woman of standing; a scientist who worked with Schr&ouml;dinger, though she got no credit for his Nobel Prize, despite her contribution. Now, unhinged by events, she keeps to her bed, neglecting her children. The three boys are interchangeable hellions, the baby, Waltraut, is largely ignored, and the eldest daughter, Anneliese, is bossy and aloof.<br /><br />The Mitwissers were rescued by Quakers who found the professor a position teaching about an obscure Christian sect, the Charismites. But the professor's field is not the Charismites but the Karaites, an obscure, heretic Jewish sect that held to a literal interpretation of the Bible. It is some time before Rose understands that in Europe \\"they had esteemed him because no one knew what he knew. And here - now - he was scorned for the same reason: no one knew what he knew.\\"<br /><br />In an irony that will be missed by many readers since Ozick does not allude to it even though her narrator is recalling these events years later, the Karaites were spared by Hitler who decided that their heresy made them non-Jews. Some even participated in the Holocaust.<br /><br />Rose, of course, has never heard of the Karaites (or the Charismites). Her first task is to box up the professor's library because a mysterious benefactor has rescued them from Albany and arranged for a move to New York so the professor can continue his scholarship at the city's library.<br /><br />The books are in German and Hebrew, so Rose, ignorant of both languages, boxes them in the most efficient way - by size. The professor, outraged (\\" `This is how an intelligent creature organizes scholarship? By how tall and how short?'\\"), assigns (or, rather, orders Anneliese to assign) a simpler task - caring for the baby.<br /><br />By the time the family has moved to New York - only it's not New York; it's the Bronx and the weedy outskirts at that - Rose is also caring for Mrs. Mitwisser and typing for the professor in the evening. She suspects Mrs. Mitwisser might not be \\"truly mad,\\" but instead answering \\"disorder with disorder, fracture with fracture,\\" and prides herself on finding a palliative - Jane Austen's \\"Sense and Sensibility.\\" \\"Mrs. Mitwisser understood all of this very well; it glimmered with unfamiliar familiarity; none of it was beyond her comprehension.\\" And when the Dashwoods' fortunes fell, \\"she warmed to the affinities she instantly felt: the loss of money, the necessity of money, the hope of money; standing expectation, repute.\\"<br /><br />But in the next chapter Mrs. Mitwisser has ripped the book to shreds. The mysterious benefactor, James, has arrived, showering the family with presents, filling the house with laughter. Only Mrs. Mitwisser hates him and fears his corrupting influence. Even little, bewildered Waltraut blossoms in his presence, basking in unaccustomed attention.<br /><br />But Rose, too, has doubts. James tipples whiskey in his teacup and usurps her place in the study. The gleaming new typewriter he bought sits in a closet. Yes, he has paid her salary, but she has little use for money.<br /><br />She misses those steamy summer nights in the professor's study, where \\"little by little his cause was revealed to me. Boiling rebellion was Mitwisser's subject. He was drawn to schismatics, fiery heretics, apostates - the lunatics of history.\\" But after James' arrival, Rose begins to see something of George Eliot's Casaubon in the professor. Is he striving mightily and achieving little? Only pretending to strive? Does his life's work amount to anything?<br /><br />James A'Bair is himself a puzzle. He is the Bear Boy, subject of picture books his father so famously and lucratively created. He hates the books that usurped his childhood, hates the money he so lavishly bestows on others. But why has he chosen the Mitwissers? Does he admire the Professor's scholarship or the family's cohesion?

The mysterious benefactor, James, has arrived, showering the family with presents, filling the house with laughter. Only Mrs. Mitwisser hates him and fears his corrupting influence. Even little, bewildered Waltraut blossoms in his presence, basking in unaccustomed attention. <br /> <br />But Rose, too, has doubts. James tipples whiskey in his teacup and usurps her place in the study. The gleaming new typewriter he bought sits in a closet. Yes, he has paid her salary, but she has little use for money.  <br /> <br />She misses those steamy summer nights in the professor's study, where \\"little by little his cause was revealed to me. Boiling rebellion was Mitwisser's subject. He was drawn to schismatics, fiery heretics, apostates - the lunatics of history.\\" But after James' arrival, Rose begins to see something of George Eliot's Casaubon in the professor. Is he striving mightily and achieving little? Only pretending to strive? Does his life's work amount to anything? <br /> <br />James A'Bair is himself a puzzle. He is the Bear Boy, subject of picture books his father so famously and lucratively created. He hates the books that usurped his childhood, hates the money he so lavishly bestows on others. But why has he chosen the Mitwissers? Does he admire the Professor's scholarship or the family's cohesion?

But the quality of the writing is exceptional - intelligent and engaging throughout.<br /><br />Thirteen former volunteers and professional writers were asked to return to countries of service and evaluate changes. They accepted the challenge with varying interpretations.<br /><br />Mike Tidwell opens the collection in the back of an airplane, lost over the Ecuadorian jungle, preparing family messages for the Black Box. He's on the trail of a real-life version of Conrad's Kurtz, a white-American chief of an Indian forest tribe menaced by big oil. And he finds him. Funny, biting and bleak, this is one of the book's best pieces though it has little to do with his service in Peru.<br /><br />Bob Shacochis revisits his youthful bravado on the beaches of the Caribbean, bringing his ironic, irreverent eye to bear on the attractions of nude sunburning and the juxtaposition of tourists and fishermen.<br /><br />Susan Lowerre, deeply reflective, returns to Senegal after five years bearing gifts for the village, and fending off pleas for help in emigrating to the U.S.<br /><br />Richard Wiley, a '60s Korea volunteer, goes to research a novel in Kenya.

Matsen traces evolution from the primordial soup to the first colonies of multicellular organisms to the ubiquitous trilobytes  - \\"the most diverse and successful animals on Planet Ocean until the Permian extinction claimed the last of them.\\"<br /><br />He discusses the engineering that went into chambers (the nautilus) and hard shells and the arrival of backbones and speculates (with the experts) on the role of extinctions in evolution, including our own.<br /><br />Although he sometimes demolishes or supports theories without sufficient scientific explanation, Matsen's watery perspective is well-organized and refreshing and Troll's drawings and paintings are as likely to be detailed and informative as they are fanciful and quirky.	2004-09-09

Five men reached the pole and Bainbridge chooses these five to narrate, in turn, a section of their journey - during which each has a birthday, his last.<br /><br />Taff Evans, the only non-officer, opens the book with his account of drunken parties and celebrity treatment. His hero-worship of Scott and glory tales of previous adventures contrasts with the bitter fears of a wife chary of being left destitute with children in a grimy slum. Taff is gritty and honest, roaring with life and humor.<br /><br />Too bad Bainbridge's officers didn't have a little more of that rough and ready ebullience. Subsequent narratives - of the ocean crossing, setting up advance camps, scientific side trips, the numerous setbacks, disasters, equipment failures and human endurance - are all told by men with stiff upper lips.<br /><br />Their idea of rousing good fun is a drunken scrimmage which ends with them all half naked. They avoid coming to terms with poor preparation and the disastrous equipment choices by blaming bad luck and admiring each other's bravery and fortitude in the face of each new disaster.<br /><br />Bainbridge is a marvelous writer who brings the horrifics of cold and inadequate preparation vividly to life. Her point is to show the human waste engendered by the British code of honor and this she does. Yet, because of Capt. Scott's voluminous notes, recovered after his death, this is a story that's been often told. Nothing beats the nonfiction version for sheer excitement and heart break.	2004-09-09

Always looking for life, Sagan explains the criteria that might indicate life on earth to a prospecting alien and applies the principles to data from other planetary bodies.<br /><br />Beautiful color-enhanced space photography and scientific paintings illustrate Sagan's journey through the solar system as he visits each world and describes how speculation and expectation changed with new information from various space probes. Each planet remains shrouded in mystery, however, as Sagan explores the questions that remain as well as those that have been answered.<br /><br />Along with a thorough look at the planets, moons and asteroids of our system, Sagan fits them into their solar environment, explaining the interactions of sun, gravity, temperatures and atmospheres.<br /><br /> Sagan's conversational style and willingness to speculate makes this thorough, cogent discussion of  space program accomplishments and failures, the politics and philosophy of space exploration, and where we might go in the future, an informative treat.	2004-09-09

The wealthy narrator, screenwriter Jack Broderick, is running from himself after the death of his wife, killed in a car accident while they were discussing divorce and he was driving.<br /><br />By pure serendipity, Broderick runs into a child star who disappeared from Hollywood 45 years before at the pinnacle of her career. Blue Tyler now lives a rather hand-to-mouth existence in a trailer park and Broderick siezes the opportunity to immerse himself in her life - a possible movie or book.<br /><br />Tyler, born Melba Mae Toolate to a woman who sold her for a bus ticket, became a star at age 4, grew up in the movies and was abandoned by Hollywood during the Red Scare of the '50s.<br /><br />A product of adulation and attention but little love, she became both predator and prey. Broderick focuses on the circumstances that led to her disappearance - particularly her dangerous liason with Chicago gangster Jacob King and her relationships with studio head J.F. French who controlled her life and his son, Arthur, who she was intended to marry.<br /><br />Piecing events together through interviews with Melba Mae (she reverted to the birth name she hated), Arthur French and Chuckie O'Hara, gay war hero and Blue Tyler's director, Dunne skillfully creates the schizo feel of life lived on two planes - the  small percentage that is truly private and the greater part played for effect, exaggerated and glossed over. Blue, a used and protected child of the movies, never learned any other way to live. Broderick delves beneath the layers of self-deceit and polished scenes to find \\"truth.\\"<br /><br />Dunne's explorations of the magic of serendipity (and how lucky is it?), the effects of ego and the requirements of a \\"good story\\" on truth give the novel layers of wit and irony, but it's robbed of real depth by the focus on gangsterism and the rehashing of the Bugsy Seigel story.

Lipsha Morrisey is adrift, one foot in America, one on the North Dakota reservation. Son of a crazy woman and a convict, the tribe has given up on the young man who once showed promise - a product of families recalled from Erdrich's previous books \\"(Love Medicine,\\" \\"The Beet Queen,\\" \\"Tracks\\").<br /><br />Summoned back to the reservation by his grandmother for reasons that never come clear - a last chance to make something of himself as an Indian? Lipsha falls in love with the beautiful Shawnee Ray, who's slated to marry the tribal entrepreneur, her son's father, Lyman Lamartine. Lyman is handsome, muscled, skilled in tribal traditions, worldly wealthy and ambitious for tribal power and American success. He is all that Lipsha is not.<br /><br />But Lipsha believes the strength of his love is a match for all of Lyman's assets. Endowed with his mother's luck, granted him in a vision devoid of love, Lipsha begins to win at Bingo. For Shawnee Ray he amasses unearned wealth, squanders his spiritual power, dreams of greatness in his future, and wastes his present in floundering and backsliding.<br /><br />Although Lipsha's present is the primary focus, the novel dips into the past with chapters centered around other tribal members including both his grandmothers, his mother, Lyman, Shawnee Ray, and Zelda Kashpaw,Lipsha's aunt and Shawnee's self-appointed guardian. There's also a Greek Chorus sort of voice that speaks with the whole tribe's sorrowful wisdom.<br /><br />This organization keeps a certain distance between the novel and the reader. Lipsha's obsession widens the gulf. His hunger for Shawnee Ray so overwhelms that it bores. Shawnee becomes the focus of Lipsha's every act but there's so little contact between them that passion never develops into love. Lipsha never develops at all.<br /><br />Erdrich's prose is vivid and spare, always flowing, moving. Every sentence seems infused with the long history, hardship and spiritual mystery of Indian life. Her characters are enigmatic and firmly anchored in the Dakota setting. But for all this richness, the story never connects, remaining more mysterious than moving. Readers of her earlier novels, who can place this one in a wider context, should enjoy the book more than new readers who may be left cold by too-brief glimpses into too many hearts.sentence seems infused with the long history, hardship and spiritual mystery of Indian life.

He has renounced claims of kinship with his father and enemy, Simon de St. Pol, and is now calling himself de Fleury, after his mother's family.<br /><br />His presence in Scotland is puzzling to his partners in his Venetian bank as affairs elsewhere need tending and Nicholas seems to be diverting vast resources to building a new trading empire in Scotland. But Nicholas is plotting.<br /><br />Having learned on his wedding night that his bride, Gelis van Borselen, is pregnant with Simon de St. Pols' child - probably in revenge for Nicholas' secret siring of Simon's son with Gelis' sister - Nicholas has designed an elaborate scheme for his own revenge.<br /><br />Amid scenes of royal pageantry, jousting and sumptuous feasting, Nicholas appears a mysterious figure, taking water while others drink wine, remaining on the sidelines while others display their skills, dressing always in black - the world's most expensive dye.<br /><br />But one winter night he takes advantage of the of the confusion of a royal hunt to have Simon abducted, terrified, humiliated and delivered to him at the salt works - a dark, hot factory of bubbling cauldrons and immense furnaces where an exhausting battle of wills, wit and strength ensues. This deadly and vividly visceral struggle is interrupted before its conclusion and Nicholas is forced to leave Scotland to attend the death of a friend.<br /><br />All this less than a quarter way into the book.

It's a quiet, compeling book but the American reader is aware of details missed, subtleties unseen, simply by virtue of the close relationship between author and subject.	2004-09-08

Each is characterized by lots of colorful, streetwise dialogue, fearlessly resourceful characters and loads of ironic wit.<br /><br />This novel, winner of London's prestigious 1993 Booker Prize, is different.<br /><br />Paddy Clarke is ten in 1968 and the narrative explores what that means in an almost stream-of-consciousness fashion. Paddy and his friends stage a Viking funeral for a dead rat, run the Grand National over the neighbors' hedged gardens, set fires at building sites, rob ladies' magazines (because they were the easiest) from shops, and torment each other, forming fluid alliances and watching for weaknesses. They are funny and frightening and unaware of both.<br /><br />The early part of the book roams from hair-raising adventure to adventure, incorporating casual cruelties and unheeded dangers with equal aplomb. Family intrudes only as a framework, a background of sustenance and tiresome restraints. Sinbad, Paddy's younger brother, is a tag-along nuisance, tolerated primarily as a victim for experimentation, such as forcing a capsule of lighter fluid between his teeth and lighting it.<br /><br />Paddy is full of life and contradictions; his mind is never still and, while full of wonder, not introspective. His rich fantasy life is more likely to be cruel than kind. He's as typical as any individual can be.<br /><br />Then the ever-simmering tensions between his parents intensify. The mysterious fights, his mother's tears, his father's black moods, move into Paddy's life and begin to take it over. Not that Paddy abandons pick-up soccor games or schemes against the boys in the corporation houses. But he begins to see his little brother with new eyes - a person who can share the burden of fear and maybe help stop it from happening.<br /><br />But Sinbad is uncooperative. Too young or too-long tormented by his older brother, he refuses to even listen. Paddy is left to turn the tide by himself. He stays awake all night because if he does it will stop them fighting; he watches them and interposes himself between them, learning how to turn their anger.<br /><br />The last third of the book is filled with gut-wrenching uncertainty. The sense that anything can happen at any time keeps the reader on tenterhooks, no longer able to laugh but hopeful, like Paddy, that normality will return.<br /><br />Doyle has created a masterful portrait of a boy - a child who observes so much more than adults expect but whose understanding is skewed by being a child.

Billy Parham, 16, is being admitted to adulthood by degrees of trust and responsibility.<br /><br />When a she-wolf crosses from the mountains of Mexico and begins preying on the Parham calves, Billy and his younger brother, Boyd, learn the intricacies of trapping - as does the reader. The laborious boiling, cleaning and waxing of the traps to remove all human scent from them; their placement and disguise and the baiting with wolf scent, all meticulously described.<br /><br />McCarthy's pace and language is Faulkneresque; mannered and measured and consciously rhythmic. At first this seems stiff and artificial. But the details of particular moments and actions and the careful attention to pacing create an atmosphere that separates the reader from the common world outside its western landscape and establishes a mood of dogged, admirable determination that is central to the book.<br /><br />Billy and his father sacrifice a full two days to the preparation and setting of the traps. Point of view then switches to the wolf. Driven from her mountain home, her mate caught in a leg-hold trap, she is pregnant and dismayed by the lack of wolves in the area. When she catches the scent of wolf she heads for it directly. And as quickly sniffs out the trap. And all the rest of the traps. Each is neatly, almost contemptuously sprung when the Parhams return.<br /><br />Says a neighbor, quoting the area's master trapper, \\"Echols one time told me that tryin to get the best of a wolf is like tryin to get the best of a kid. It aint that they're smarter. It's just that they aint got all that much else to think about.\\"<br /><br />As the likelihood of trapping the wolf recedes, Billy grows more determined. His father lets him take over and Billy spends his days tracking and studying the wolf without ever catching sight of her. And finally, inevitably, his observations pay off. Billy traps the wolf. And discovers he can't bear to kill her or turn her in for the bounty.<br /><br />In a moment of heroic, foolish decision, Billy turns his back on everything his father has tried to instill in him. At the same time he adheres strictly to an upbringing that fosters faithfulness to principle.<br /><br />So begins his first crossing into Mexico, to return the wolf to her mountain home. The journey is so wonderfully outlandish, so romantic, the reader is drawn into Billy's passionate, stubborn persistence. His difficulties with the wild dangerous animal seem insurmountable, but Billy contrives with ingenuity and painstaking contrivance to keep the wolf alive and himself unscathed. His meetings with people are more problematic. But Billy is not one to give up. Or to reflect on the consequences of his actions.<br /><br />Billy emerges from the adventure a sobered but no less romantic figure. He has two more crossings to make, two more quests into Mexico.<br /><br />The second is with his brother, Boyd, who chafes under the yoke of \\"younger brother,\\" following Billy's lead, his own more reflective nature silenced under the older's authority. Theirs is a more complex adventure, its passions vivid, its goals obscure. But Billy's last quest is the most vague of all. Even its romanticism is muddied and uncertain.<br /><br />It's important not to give away too much of the plot. Suspense and inevitability reveal the depths of human nature, hope and cruelty. McCarthy creates a certain mystical feel with digressions along the way - the tale of a religious hermit, a blind revolutionary, a band of Gypsies towing an old airplane. Billy and his brother meet characters of endless generosity and hard-shelled savagery and are touched by both in ways that deflect and nurture the course of their lives.<br /><br />McCarthy has created a sweeping panorama of a vanished west: dusty, dangerous, lawless and indifferent. And he's forged an intimate link with an inarticulate ardent soul. Billy's life is nothing like ours, his character entirely his own, yet we identify with his flaws, his short-sightedness, his aspirations and nobility. \\"The Crossing\\" captures the heart and mind with the beauty of its prose and the breadth of its story.y and are touched by both in ways that deflect and nurture the course of their lives. <br /> <br />McCarthy has created a sweeping panorama of a vanished west: dusty, dangerous, lawless and indifferent.

She opens each chapter with a titillating bit of tattle from a (fictional) tabloid focused on the \\"beau monde\\" of London high society, or, as they like to dub themselves, \\"the World.\\" Set during the decade from 1787 to 1797, Donoghue's (\\"Slammerkin\\") story revolves around a real-life scandal concerning an actress, an earl and an aristocratic female sculptor.<br /><br />From this vantage point, Donoghue's view encompasses the turbulent politics of the time, from the madness of King George III to the French Revolution. She explores the stratifications of class and the restricted lives of women as she ventures from Parliament to the stage, from the sculptor's studio to the drawing room.  While clearly copious, her research never gets in the way as she dresses her characters for intimate dinners of ten, and sets them to talking gossip and politics over lobster au gratin and mutton with gherkins.<br /><br />Eliza Farren is the actress, the Queen of Comedy at Drury Lane who has caught the eye of the Earl of Derby, a man of small stature and huge fortune. He is also, unfortunately, a man in possession of a wife, albeit a disgraced and estranged invalid of a wife.<br /><br />Derby is eager to introduce Eliza to Anne Damer, \\"an original; she reads Latin better than most of us Etonians.\\" Widowed, Anne enjoys her independence, in every sense of the word. She is a serious sculptor who has always followed her muse and never taken a commission.<br /><br />To their mutual surprise, the women become fast friends. Anne is a well-connected, well-educated aristocrat and Eliza has clawed her way up from the gutter on talent and determination. But in Donoghue's capable hands, neither is a stereotype; both open new worlds for the other. Their friendship is warm, fresh and energized.<br /><br />And then it all comes to a crashing end with one nasty little verse hinting at a lesbian relationship between the two. It's the sort of tabloid innuendo Eliza, who maintains her elegant Mayfair home on her earnings, cannot afford.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Eliza's relationship with Derby is famously platonic. Unlike other actresses of her time, Eliza guards herself from any whiff of scandal. She is never alone with the Earl and accepts no presents other than the use of his carriage. And as the years pass, Derby remains doggedly faithful, waiting for his wife to die so he can marry Eliza.<br /><br />Derby and Anne introduce Eliza to politics, another arena, like friendship, she has never had any time for. Whigs who oppose the autocratic rule of King George III and his Prime Minister William Pitt, they favor expanded suffrage (though not quite to women), more equitable taxes and more freedom in general.<br /><br />The storming of the Bastille is a seminal event for British Whigs - they cheer the new liberality and women wear stone fragments of the smashed prison as pendants. Fashions change to reflect the simplicity of the more egalitarian French society. Donoghue manages to catch the heady fervor of these early days, which coexists, paradoxically, with aristocratic complacency toward their own privileged status quo. English peasants are far better off than their repressed French counterparts, after all.<br /><br />But as the French Revolution grows more bloody and the English economy falters while the wheat harvest fails, threatening famine, it becomes clear the English mob do not see egalitarian principles as compatible with aristocratic privilege. Some Whigs, like Anne, retreat from liberality, others, like Derby, while wavering, remain steadfast as the party splinters.<br /><br />Donoghue draws the reader into the heady politics of the time in large part by keeping the perspective firmly contemporary. Derby, Anne and Eliza are products of their era, not ours. And Donoghue keeps the characters true to themselves as individuals as well. Eliza, reflecting on the chaotic news from France, reflects: \\"It was like trying to put together the plot of a five-act tragedy by eavesdropping on the crowd as it surged out of a theatre.\\"<br /><br />That said, there are a couple of glaring exceptions. Would King George really have termed the new Draconian security measures \\"homeland security\\"? Would anyone have used the phrase \\"weapons of mass destruction\\"? Other than these eye-poppers, Donoghue's perspective is impressively anchored in the 18th century and her story engages the reader with her characters, the details of daily life and the broad sweep of history.s as well.

Scudder's new client, Lewis Hildebrand, belongs to an unusual club - 31 men who meet annually to reflect on the year's changes in their lives and to take reverent note of those members who have died. Members speak of the club to no one, not even wives.<br /><br />The last living member chooses 30 new members and the club goes on. That day is quickly approaching.<br /><br />Hildebrand hires Scudder to investigate the alarming death rate among members. As Scudder looks for a thread linking the disparate accidents, suicides and murders, the questions multiply and the angles proliferate. Motive is baffling and the only suspects are the surviving club members.<br /><br />As always, Block's writing is excellent with a tight plot, unusual characters and intelligent dialogue. One of Scudder's better outings.	2004-09-06

At the same time his editor wants a feature on the Moscow Jewish community.<br /><br />The latter assignment leads to a beautiful Israeli woman Burke immediately suspects is an Israeli agent. But Burke suspects everyone - overfriendly Russian journalists, his sources, his neighbors.<br /><br />The former assignment leads to a shadowy Arab, a massage and sex club and one of Russia's \\"secret\\" industrial cities, where he browbeats a Russian scientist into admitting he's sold out to Syria. But when Burke goes back for photos, the scientist has disappeared and a source is murdered.<br /><br />There's plenty of drab Moscow color and gritty hardship amid the swirling puzzle of truths, deceptions and cynicism. Burke is sharp and the occasional hole in the plot appears with the reader's unwillingness to believe this veteran could be so easily led. But Cullen puts his feel for Moscow and the workaday news biz together with a jaded but conscientious journalist to produce a well-written and absorbing novel of suspense.	2004-09-01

With rich, spicy, earthy prose she brings to life her rural Maine setting and a whole town full of characters in this third novel.<br /><br />The setting is the same as for her first two books:  Egypt, a small town on the edge of the woods in western Maine, a place where impoverished natives and rich folks \\"from away\\" live side by side, but seperate existences.<br /><br />The characters in this 695-page novel include most of the population, with emphasis on LLoyd Barington, of working-class/farming stock, Forest Johnson, Jr., whose backhoe and 'dozing business employs many of the town's poorest, and Gwen Curry, whose horrid mother proves that money and Connecticut gentility are no proof against cruelty.<br /><br />The plot, well, here the novel runs into trouble. There is no plot, so to speak. While her characters do cross paths with one another, there is no unifying progression of events- except the slow generalized denigration of a rural way of life. That, it turns out, is Chute's point. \\"Merry Men\\" is a documentation of hard times getting harder, of the corporate mindset grinding down the individual.<br /><br />Not that all her Maine folk are saints, although Lloyd Barrington comes close. Forest Johnson, Jr., for instance, takes advantage of his employees' desperation at every opportunity.<br /><br />As the book opens, Forest has called out the constable on a bitter winter night. A prank -the fifth in as few days. \\"Forest, Jr.'s frozen breath bunches and bounces around his face so now there's no face. When his face reappears, it's just this dark sovereignty of eyes behind steel-rimmed glasses and a fierce close shave.\\" Faced with the constable's impotence, Forest vows to lie in wait and kill the merry prankster.<br /><br />The book then jumps back 30 years, although this is not apparent unless you glance at the top margin of the page. We meet Lloyd Barrington, age 8 3/4, fat, earnest, sensitive, a writer of poetry, a lover of shade trees. This lengthy section is breezy, humorous, affectionate and deeply touching.<br /><br />Lloyd's mother has died. He lives with his taciturn, incomprehensible father, Edmund, and a houseful of uncles, including Unk Walty, who cooks fabulous meals for them all, unless he's absorbed in one of his papier mache projects, like his masterpiece - lifesized reproductions of all the local women Edmund has slept with, seated around a table dressed in beautiful last-century costumes.<br /><br />At night Lloyd sneaks out of bed and flits around town in his Super Tree Man costume. \\"A fat boy by day, maybe so. But tonight and many nights to come, he's a thing of glory.\\" Lloyd plants baby maples. \\"If they make it, in thirty years, the fat lady's yard will be in deep cool splendorous shade.\\"<br /><br />Next we meet Gwen Curry on the day her father, Dr. Curry, has died. Gwen is a fearful, lonely child, her mind flickering between the awful events following her father's death and jagged memories of her short life with Phoebe, her mother. Every night Phoebe sings under the grate to Gwen's bedroom. A few times her father had remonstrated. \\"So Phoebe sang louder. Show tunes. Pop tunes. Rock and Roll. Television jingles. And once a shattery tinkling splat! A glass thrown into the sink.\\"<br /><br />Chute's portrait of manic cruelty and bewildered child is heart rending. Yet when Grandma packs them off to Connecticutt that's the last we see of Gwen for hundreds of pages.<br /><br />In between there are numerous vignettes - Forest Johnson, Jr., fires an illiterate man and Forest's dissolute son returns from California bringing a grandson who's soon embroiled in family strife. The Soules, Lloyd's wife's people, lose their family farm to the bank. A young Soule falls in love with a middle-aged cousin of Lloyd's, a man on parole, suffering from clinical depression. They marry and as the husband loses his job, she becomes pregnant. Many of these stories end badly; some Chutesimply abandons. Each absorbs the reader; none are fully resolved.<br /><br />Finally Gwen Curry comes back, a rich, very rich, widow of an industrialist, a symbol of all the things gone wrong in Egypt. Her attaction to Lloyd, educated former hippie, man of all work, crusader, prankster, is instant. He is more ambivalent.<br /><br />How Chute resolves this final conflict adds to the reader's frustration. Such magnificent writing, so often leading nowhere. And towards the end, Chute cannot resist long preachy passages explaining what's wrong with America even though she just spent 500 pages showing us.

His publisher, a producer of farm equipment catalogues, is bought out by a conglomerate and Jonas is given a huge advance to write his autobiography.<br /><br />He throws the $75,000 check in a drawer and the sound of typing in the root cellar ceases while books on the era, from Farley Mowat's \\"And No Birds Sang\\" to Alistair MacLean's \\"Partisans\\" accumulate in piles on the floor.<br /><br />Into this cluttered picture comes a smooth, articulate stranger bearing gifts and adulation. But not until Jonas' beautiful sister-in-law requires extrication from bankruptcy does Jonas' muse respond.<br /><br />Cheever's feel for character and detail is unerring, from Jonas' ambiguously barbed Christmas presents to the classics he presses on reporters as unassailable bribes; from the former cop who spies on Nelson for the shopper's absentee owners to the childhood friend who seems determined to become a battered wife.<br /><br />Nelson's wayward sister Narcissus and his \\"Aunt\\" Elspeth retain a hint of mystery in their own well-defined eccentricities and play incisive parts in a resolution which raises courage from a maudlin welter of family secrets.<br /><br />Cheever's humor - one-liners and exaggerations tempered by empathy and sadness - serves him well in his exploration of the complex mess of life.him well in his exploration of the complex mess of life.	2004-08-31

Fine, said the editor, write about anything you want, only tag a recipe onto the end of it.<br /><br />This 1994 collection is culled from 5 years of that marvelous \\"prose stew\\" of love and good eating, laughter and tears, food and its emotional connections.<br /><br />Shacochis is funny, savage, opinionated, volatile. He has no patience for whining or pomposity. If you don't like dogs or meat, you don't want to know him.<br /><br />Miss. F., his common-law wife since the early 70s, is the center of the book, the one for whom all the great food is created. We get glimpses of the early, tentative days, when housekeeping routines jostled and clashed and Miss F. actually had the temerity to interfere with the cooking.<br /><br />But most of the book is as current as a diary with nostalgic excursions to their beloved Outer Banks (Miss F.'s Champagne Scallops, Grilled Tuna Hatteras Style), tension-filled days in Sardinia leavened by Grilled Oysters, and dinner parties great and awful. Shacochis relives the time Miss F. forced a pate-laden cracker into his mouth. \\"I didn't feel titillated, nor nauseated, nor vulgar. Instead I felt the strangest desire for the best wine I could get my hands on, something elegant in taste to compliment the unique pungency of the pate.\\" And he appends his recipe for Herb Pate which includes bacon, pork and veal.<br /><br />We follow Miss F.'s teeth-gritting progress in law school. He works in the house, she works out of it and he is very earnest about this. After all, this is a man who travels with his garlic press. \\"Suppose I were to tell you that last month I slapped Miss F. because she wouldn't come to dinner when she was called.\\" Miss F., miserable, was entrenched in law books. He didn't, of course, lay a hand on her but instead embarked on a campaign of grilled lamb chops and steamed asparagus, pork tenderloin and black beans. What finally worked (after the exam) was Earth, Fin and Fire Chowder, a mouth watering concoction of clams, scallops, shrimp, black beans and cream.<br /><br /> The first section of the book brims with good cheer and affection. The second is a different kettle of fish. He and Miss F. spent a miserable year in Italy and he documents her depression with dark ferocity. The humor has a bitter bite. From this section comes Miss F's Prisoner of Woe Soup with chicken and sausage, several rich, rich pasta recipes and a sinful Tivoli Torte which takes forever to make.<br /><br />They come through the crisis in Section Three. They get a new dog and Miss F. graduates law school (Steamed Blue Crabs) and turns 40 (Apalachee Bouillabaisse with oysters, clams, shrimp, snapper, lobster, and stone-crab). These essays display an exuberance tempered with recent pain.<br /><br />\\"Domesticity\\" is a window into the soul of a marriage and a terrific cookbook for the serious meat eater.rk tenderloin and black beans.

Brillat-Savarin, best known for the book written in the last years of his life, \\"The Physiology of Taste,\\" swam in the thick of French politics and upheaval.<br /><br />A provincial member of the revolutionary French Assembly, Brillat-Savarin was forced to flee to America during the worst of guillotine fever. In the midst of flight he met a sailor whose tongue had been cut out by pirates and was curious to know if he retained the ability to taste.<br /><br />McDonogh seasons Brillat-Savarin with such anecdotes - lavish feasts at pre-revolutionary abbeys where the young lawyer played violin with an ensemble of friends, turkey shoots in America, contests of gluttony in inns and restaurants, specialties discovered in cafes and homes during his extensive travels throughout Europe.<br /><br />After years of rocky fortunes, Brillat-Savarin found favor with Napolean and landed tenure as a judge. He recalls Napolean's abstemious habits and the groaning tables of some of his aides. In retirement, upon Napolean's defeat, he grew grapes and wrote about law, medicine and food.<br /><br />McDonogh's gastronomic anecdotes make better reading than the volatile politics. Not much is really know of Brillat-Savarin's days (his relatives destroyed many of his letters and stories) and the biography is filled with \\"probably's\\" and \\"may have done's.\\"  Sometimes humorous, sometimes dry, this is an interesting volume for the setting and the food.	2004-08-31

Into his line of sight walks Marta Brooks, who fulfills her promise of mystery with a nosebleed in his sportscar which she cleanses away with an ocean swim.<br /><br />The scene should be absurd, particularly coming, as it does, after the overweening description of Hodges' party, where, wending his star-struck way towards Marta, Hodges shares a stock tip with a hard-edged actress and averts a drunken suicide with a promise. But his meeting with Marta imparts a hint of redemption, a possibility of tragedy, a touch of the sinister. And it draws the reader on.<br /><br />Nova leaves Hodges behind as he delves into Marta's world. Like the movie magnate, she is a Hollywood native. But she takes ads for the Romance Advertiser and, needing the job, she has agreed to pick up a package for her shady boss. Instead, she finds an empty house, bloodstained walls and clouds of flies.<br /><br />Nova delves deeper, introducing Marta's sad-sack mother, the fantasy Dad she created for Marta, Marta's deep sadness and escape. Escape into the present where, against her better judgment, she pursues the package to a new destination.<br /><br />Where she is followed by another Hollywood native, a recent release from Soledad State Prison, who's hit blackmail paydirt in his cleaning job at a psychiatrist's office. But he needs someone to pick up the money for him, a patsy, and Marta falls into his lap like a ripe plum.<br /><br />Nova weaves his way through the lives of these people, their convoluted route to the moments they share, what they took from a common background to become the creatures they are. Their intersection is outlandish but somehow inevitable. Comic, dark and suspenseful, his story owes its strength to the gritty feel of the place as much as the nuances of character.uances of character.	2004-08-31

Yu, Chen's subordinate, has just had his promised apartment snatched away - perhaps as a slap to Chen whose rapid rise has sidestepped his own boss. Yu, with his wife and son, will continue to occupy one small room.<br /><br />The murder plot also carries political complications. The victim, Yin Lige, was known as a dissident writer for a novel she wrote about her politically doomed love for a \\"Black,\\" or intellectual, poet Yang. A Red Guard in her youth, Yin was then denounced and sent to a reeducation farm during the Cultural Revolution, where she met Yang. Her book sank without notice until American interest in publishing it labeled her a dissident.<br /><br />She died in a tiny room partitioned off a landing in an old dilapidated Western style house - the type of house that, ironically, is making a comeback in an expensive real estate project evoking the heyday of pre-revolution Shanghai. In fact, Chen has been recruited to translate a 50-page prospectus for the Triad-connected developer, who is paying him an amount equivalent to 30 years of his police salary, bonuses included. This leaves Yu in charge of the investigation.<br /><br />The background, which incorporates Chinese love poetry and the subtle gradations of noodles and eels, as well as political fencing, class striations, economic upheavals and the uncertainty of change, provides plenty of murder suspects from the past and present. And if Xiaolong stints a bit on the mystery, she more than compensates with her fascinating portrait of a society in flux.	2004-08-30

In the prologue to Gerritsen's latest Maura Isles/Jane Rizzoli thriller, a bullied, unhappy schoolgirl is lured into the woods by a handsome classmate and then cast into a pit to die. Gerritsen then switches to Isles, a Boston medical examiner, returning from a Paris conference (where she takes us on an eerie tour of the catacombs) to find Homicide Detective Rizzoli among the cops on her front lawn, blue lights flashing, shocked to see her. They've just been examining her murdered corpse.<br /><br />Having got your attention some writers might have trouble maintaining this front-loaded pace, but Gerritsen deepens the mystery then ratchets up the suspense and horror right to the final nail-biting page.<br /><br />Isles' character emerges through her actions. She is wary of introspection and her shock at her double's murder shows in her altered view of daily details and her dogged pursuit of the mystery wherever it leads, be it an isolated Maine cabin with human bones in the ground outside, or a maximum security prison.<br /><br />Isles, adopted, has found her twin too late. As she begins to peel away the layers of family identity, similarities strike her - a failed marriage, a career in science. But these poignant revelations are soon disrupted by far more sinister implications. Rizzoli, eight months pregnant and working on the murder, has found Isles' mother, maybe. And she's not a mother to love.<br /><br />Meanwhile there's a serial killer at work, one the reader is aware of before the cops. His latest victim is the very pregnant wife of a slimy BMW car dealer. Snatched from her home, she wakes up in a coffin-like box where we revisit her from time to time until she goes into labor - the moment the killer has been waiting for.<br /><br />Point of view shifts between Isles and Rizzoli, with briefer digressions to the terrified woman in the box. Rizzoli is a cop who can hold her own - with a frightened angry friend or a belligerent suspect. Isles, competent and strong, has an appealing vulnerability that is expertly handled in this intense, personal story.<br /><br />Gerritsen has had a busy career.

A loner restoring a vintage \\"Dragon\\" airplane in his spare time, Challis endures almost daily phone calls from his disturbed wife, imprisoned after conspiring with her lover to murder him. A police officer doesn't have the luxury of screening his calls.<br /><br />Point of view, while centered on Challis, shifts quickly among members of his team, as well as a local boy caught up in a crime spree, his pyromaniac bruiser of a mate, a New Zealand woman hiding from her past, and the killer.<br /><br />The serial killer taunts the police in messages to the local newspaper. Challis' team, running down their few slim leads as well as handling the usual - from vandalized mailboxes to burglary, assault and arson - is a varied bunch. A brute-force constable is paired with a young woman whose ambitions he disparages; Sergeant van Alphen steals drugs to buy sex from the New Zealand woman, Sergeant Destry fends off her husband's bitterness and eyes the air-conditioning man, earnest Scobie Sutton worries about his daughter, and the boss, McQuarrie, sticks his nose in where it's least welcome. Challis, a newcomer to the Peninsula, a beautiful, insular place with the usual tensions between newcomer and native, has embarked on a touchy romance with the newspaper reporter.<br /><br />The novel's character-driven pace moves along at a good clip as the cops become mired in red herrings, stumble over new information in unlikely places and keep on top of the normal mayhem. Award-winning author Disher makes his characters as interesting as his plot and the Australian setting is well realized.	2004-08-30

The Maine author's steamy, riveting page-turner takes place in Kittery, ME, and Portsmouth, NH, and the primary action takes place on, or in the shadow of, that dominating bridge.<br /><br />The book opens with a brief prologue: the protagonist, Jacob Winter, plummets from the top of the bridge, experiencing an untimely burst of insight, \\"seeing how things came to be.\\" Part One drops back to find Jacob in jail for assaulting his former psychiatrist, Price Ashworth, after returning home early with his young son from a Red Sox game, to find his wife and the good doctor enjoying the aftermath of a romantic dinner. Though Jacob has only a blurred memory of the assault, there's no doubt he not only delivered the concussing blow, but destroyed much of the beautiful furniture he had made for the house over his 12-year marriage.<br /><br />His wife has sent some significant belongings to the jail - a sleeping bag and his laptop computer among them - but has not bailed him out. That favor has fallen mysteriously to Alix Callahan, a woman Jacob has never spoken to, though he remembers her as a committed lesbian and powerful personality from his undergraduate days at the University of New Hampshire.<br /><br />A struggling non-fiction writer with an \\"overactive\\" imagination, Jacob habitually organizes his life with scheduled lists and makes precision straight-lined, square-cornered furniture to keep himself anchored. His wife's infidelity - totally unexpected - (it's actually somewhat difficult to square Jacob's idyllic memories with the calculating harpy the reader sees)leaves him shaky and bewildered and terrified of losing 9-year-old Max. Despite the restraining order barring him from his home, he touches base with Max, downplaying the upheaval in their lives and delivering the advice Jacob himself struggles to live by, \\"Your head, not your heart.\\"<br /><br />Then he takes out the card Alix has left him: \\"GREEN GIRLS, the business card read. EXOTIC GROWERS.\\" The address is on the Portsmouth side of the Piscataqua, on the banks of the river, under the span of the bridge. A huge greenhouse is attached to the back of the house. The greenhouse nurtures a pungent, humid jungle of South American rainforest plants and small poisonous frogs. As Alix leads Jacob in, a dark, beautiful woman, radiating intense sexuality, appears from the greenhouse. Alix introduces July and explains that she helped Jacob because she admires his writing.<br /><br />\\" `I do have to admit,' Alix went on, `even though there are never any people in his books, something about his writing is extremely sensual. The fire in Baltimore? The commotion in the next berth? I'm not sure if he treats violence sexually or sex violently.' She gave July a pointed look. `Either way, I know you'd appreciate it.' \\" Jacob's books, we learn, are about things, like the train berth he occupied on the way home from his mother's funeral. Or the I-95 bridge he now chooses as the center of his first novel.<br /><br />The friction between Alix and July (hiding from an abusive, murderous husband) is palpable, and Jacob wants nothing to do with them. But after another visit with his son, he finds July waiting for him, agitated over a fight with Alix. Moments later his cell phone summons him to the big bridge from which Alix, after a short, cryptic exchange, jumps. Jake keeps saying he can't get involved, but it's too late. Alix's body is not recovered and July's Columbian shaman husband - the one who tried to kill her - has broken out of prison and is on his way.<br /><br />The erotic tension runs high as the action heats up from all sides, entangling Jacob deeper in a web of deceit, suspicion, mysticism and murder. There's a strong James M. Cain feel to the edgy mix of steamy eroticism and dark double dealing in which Jacob's judgment is fatefully faulty and erratic and absolutely no one can be trusted - except Max.<br /><br />Kimball (\\"Undone,\\" \\"Mouth to Mouth\\") puts the bridge at the center of the story as an object of grace and beauty, magnificence and deadly danger, and invests it with a powerful character that is not in the least anthropomorphic.

That Moreen is following in Ellen's footsteps is an added bitter irony, since she has made it clear that escaping mother is a major goal.<br /><br />Into this bucolic scene (the wedding reception is taking place at the Chambers' sheep farm) steps a handsome, virile young man with an attractive, smoldering, possibly sinister demeanor. The young man stands up to the thuggish new groom, Randy, and suggestively soothes Ellen's murderous thoughts by assuring her \\"anything is possible.\\" Their sexual attraction strikes immediate sparks even when Neal reveals he is her husband's nephew, last seen 12 years before, after his father's funeral.<br /><br />Within a few days Neal has moved in, invited by his uncle, Ellen's husband, Scott, whose easygoing nature irritates Ellen. But there are a lot of things about Scott that have come to annoy Ellen. Currently Scott is drinking a lot. His hardware store is losing out to a chain and, unbeknownst to Ellen, he has mortgaged her sheep farm.<br /><br />Neal, on the other hand, is a paragon. He is rebuilding Ellen's dilapidated barn and promises to have it finished in 12 days. He defends Ellen's sheep from coyotes, wakes her with his night roaming and swims with her at the farm pond, maintaining the unspoken erotic tension, charged with dark hints concerning Randy and even Ellen's stale marriage.<br /><br />Randy, meanwhile, has no redeeming qualities and after a while it becomes hard to see how even a mother could love sullen, self-destructive Moreen. Kimball depicts a side of southern coastal Maine the tourists never see - a ruthless loan shark and his drug-crazed, drunken thug assistants and the hapless down-and-outs they feed on. Some of the ordinary residents are nearly as twisted as the loan shark while one of the enforcers turns out to be an eccentric with a strict moral code of his own devising.<br /><br />The suspense builds slowly at first, introducing the characters and letting them hang themselves with their own discontent, gradually revealing a dark core of venality and self-loathing. Then events escalate, pulling Ellen and her loved ones into a vortex of violence fed by family secrets, driven by revenge and quickly spiraling out of control. Kimball's well-paced plot becomes an edge-of-the-seat page-turner.<br /><br />Although a few of the characters cultivate unconvincing eccentricities (uncouth Randy, for instance, is a painter - of bestial misogyny, admittedly, but still there isn't a painterly bone in his body), the novel's dark mood is enhanced by the complex humanity of Kimball's characterizations. His people have genuine principles, undermined by selfishness and temptation. And his arch-villain is a pure sociopath, a man whose brilliance, dedication and understanding of human weakness make him almost invincible.<br /><br />A novel that will keep you reading till it's done and give you nightmares afterwards.shark and his drug-crazed, drunken thug assistants and the hapless down-and-outs they feed on.

His father is a drunk and his mother is a crazy drunk who's just turned up in a hospital 1,500 miles away. The narrator's first decision - will he tell his father about the call or cut his ties with his mother right then? Each step of the way the boy, impelled by conscience, chooses misery until the reader, relieved by the boy's sense of responsibility, wonders if he will ever be strong enough or selfish enough to preserve himself.<br /><br />Where \\"king of the elephants\\" is poignant, \\"pretty judy\\" is shocking, repellant. Paul, 15, \\"wanted this to be happening in his imagination.\\" \\"This\\" is his shame-ridden sexual obsession with a retarded neighbor. Canty's language brings all of Paul's confused, hot-wired, charged feelings to the surface, boiling with the desire to do the right thing without giving up the wrong thing. Where the ending to \\"king of the elephants\\" offers a certain release of tension in inevitability, the end of \\"pretty judy\\" cranks up the tension with consequences unfolding into the story's unseen future.<br /><br />Canty's unhappy characters watch themselves with helpless detachment. In \\"Safety\\" Marian is a bored, frazzled wife and mother of a two-year-old whose marriage is falling apart. Marian observes her resentments, bitter words and coldness with a vicious self-hatred and satisfaction known to us all.<br /><br />In \\"Junk,\\" Parker is more deeply mired in self-loathing - the habit of years of drug and alcohol abuse and a fascinating dissolute wife. Although he has made a new start the reappearance of his wife undoes him in a moment: \\"There is no other life...the person that you are is the person you're going to be.\\" Even from such fatalism, he views his irrevocable decisions with a sour detachment that leaves all the \\"if-onlys\\" pitiably attached.<br /><br />Self-deception is a favorite theme, along with the self-knowledge we bury; the family ties that bind, the unhappiness we choose. \\"It was like I had two parts of my brain,\\" says one character and it's this duality of nature Canty most successfully explores.<br /><br />A few stories, like \\"great falls, 1966,\\" in which a man who may or may not be dying is caught in the wrangling of his son and grandson are wholly enigmatic; a few, like \\"dogs, \\" are wholly fatalistic, or, like \\"the victim\\" describe a series of events mostly beyond the central character's control.

His mind works in movie scenes, complete with director. In the hospital he makes up vivid tales for the doctors and newspaper reporters - he was a boy in a germ-free bubble who escaped, he was kidnapped by aliens, his parents are dead.<br /><br />With all the media attention, his father turns up, a burnt-out hippie alcoholic who lives in a bus, logs wood intermittently and beats his son for fun. The boy, Langdon Webster, or Web, sees visions of a separate self, dead, a free spirit who may be a guardian angel, may be a demon. He's visited by another boy, his cousin Royal, who lives in a flashy car and has the world by the tail. Web longs for his wonderful light-filled mother, and uncovers his father's craven betrayal.<br /><br />Eventually Web's on his own again, following Royal to New York. There, he's caught up in gang fights and drug deals. Royal, accumulating wealth, plays both sides against the middle.<br /><br />After this, the novel grows increasingly surrealistic. Web, on the road, is caught up in other's lives and motives. He's a dupe, a pawn, a player in a virtual reality game which may be deadly. Everything he yearns for is snatched from him and his world is increasingly confused with fantasy and movie plots.<br /><br />Hebert's writing is electric and his character aims right for the heart even if the plot sometimes careens too wildly for the reader to hold on. A very different novel for Hebert (\\"The Passion of Estelle Jordan\\") in which bleakness takes a roller coaster ride into the future.	2004-08-25

To avoid a forced marriage, she disguises herself as a eunuch and leaves Ephesus for Alexandria, where she pursues the passion denied to her as a woman - medicine.<br /><br />Charis' hard-won apprenticeship to a dedicated Jewish doctor who practices among the poor provides ample opportunity to describe the squalor and wealth of the city, its prejudices and divisions and its ambitious medicine.<br /><br />Drawn through no fault of her own into the wrangling of early Christians, Charis is forced once again to flee and accepts a position heading up the hospital in a remote army outpost in Thrace where she triumphs over superstition and charges of witchcraft only to be captured by Goths and kept prisoner - her gender revealed.<br /><br />Bradshaw, a classics scholar, is also a compelling storyteller. Historical detail wells up organically through the action without ever seeming forced or artificial. Thoroughly enjoyable.	2004-08-25

Interior development becomes a matter of acquiring the necessary skills and attitudes.<br /><br />The setting is  2025 California. The breakdowns we bewail in modern society have led to disintegration. Lauren Olamina, a 15-year-old black girl, lives in a walled community. Outside are the homeless, predators or prey, the roving gangs, and \\"Paints,\\" addicted to a drug that finds ecstasy in fire and murder. Lauren was born with what is regarded as a crippling disability - the ability to share the physical pain (or pleasure) of others.<br /><br />She sees no future for herself within the walls - even if they hold - and develops a personal religion. God is Change which must be shaped and humanity's future is the stars, not earth.<br /><br />Lauren's father, a minister and community patriarch, insists the community be able to defend itself. He organizes gun practice in the lawless hills where bodies, wild dogs and signs of cannibalism are common. But, for all his precautions, one day her father disappears. The community is overrun, massacred and burned by Paints. Lauren, now 18, her family dead, is on the road, with two other survivors.<br /><br />Trust is a luxury humans can no longer afford but Lauren's journey is marked by kindnesses to keenly observed strangers. She knows that strength is in numbers as well as firepower. She gathers a couple with a baby, two girls, a motherless child, three runaway slaves with sharing abilities like hers, and an older black man with a cart, a doctor with land in the north.<br /><br />The journey is tense with vigilance and danger. Firefights, ambushes, an earthquake, all contribute to a harrowing pace. The novel, in spare, lively prose, is written in diary form which gives it an intimate immediacy and carries a warning that even Lauren's survival is not assured. An absorbing, disturbing book in which survival goes to the luckiest, with the best prepared having an edge.g, disturbing book in which survival goes to the luckiest, with the best prepared having an edge.	2004-08-25

A bachelor, he sacrificed marriage and all his other potentials to care for, first, his mother, then his sister, crippled with rheumatism.<br /><br />The narrative moves between Corker's plans and reminiscences and his young assistant's observation of the change in his boss and the momentous change in his own life - he has just lost his virginity. Interspersed are paragraphs from the various people who come in seeking employment - a vigorous, middle aged housekeeper Corker fantasizes employing for himself; a young, snooty woman who demonstrates Corker's naivety and optimism while casing the joint for her boyfriend; and an elderly impoverished housekeeper terrified of being put in a home to die.<br /><br />Corker is ebullient, proud of himself and feeling daring. Alec, his assistant, is by turns suspicious and excited. Unable to quite overturn the habits of a lifetime, Corker sacrifices his visions of the blowsy housekeeper and tentatively decides on the elderly one - who's asking less than half normal wages. But he vacillates while Alec fumes with the impatience of youth, helping Corker shove furniture around upstairs and dreaming of his girl while he listens to the old man go on about art and travel.<br /><br />The tone is wistful and ironic with a hint of acid. The story builds to a climax which seems certain to end in disaster, what with an ongoing robbery, the entrance of the querulous sister and the addition of some unaccustomed alcohol. A trifle wordy but a poignant and humorous look at the contrast between sacrificed hopes and youthful incomprehension.	2004-08-24

Marine biologist Simon Chase and his young son, Max, visiting for the summer, may not know what's killing seabirds, dolphins and divers but we do.<br /><br />Chase's island marine institute is on the verge of bankruptcy. An infusion of cash from Dr. Amanda Macy and her sea lion experiment will buoy it but for how long? Preoccupied by worries about money and parenting, Chase feels a moment of dread at his first sight of Amanda Macy. \\"Chase had always been a sucker for a pretty face.\\" Then she turned around. \\"Chase blew out a breath of relief. Her face was nice, and well proportioned, handsome, even, but not a heart stopper.\\" Macy does have another attractive asset, however - scads of money.<br /><br />Meanwhile the Blessing of the Fleet is imminent and the town fathers are adamant that shark scares be quashed. Chase, who does not believe the attacks are caused by \\"his\\" white shark, a female about to give birth and tagged with a locator sensor, goes along. But the creature with the steel teeth and five-fingered claws is changing and soon no one will be safe - even if they stay out of the water.<br /><br />There are some great scenes. In one cinematic act of heroism Chase jumps into the water and saves his white shark from goonish fishermen by sticking his arm down its throat to cut the line. In another a great white attacks the shark cage with Chase and his son inside.<br /><br />And finally it's the book's cinematic quality that saves it from its predictability. Benchley's prose is clear, visual and unpretentious (if sometimes clich&eacute;d), his characters simple but not wooden. A good read for the beach.	2004-08-24

Witless Bay is a stark, isolated place with a desolate beauty; its people are taciturn and sharp-edged but surprisingly tolerant.<br /><br />Fabian is twenty, sleeping with his childhood friend Margaret Handle, completing a correspondence course in bird art and determined to leave Witless Bay. His parents, Orkney and Alaric, plot to marry their son to a distant relative from Halifax. It's their way of ensuring his escape from their own claustrophopic and threadbare existence.<br /><br />Despite his love for troubled, independent Margaret, an alchoholic four years older than he, Fabian agrees to his parents' plan. But when his father goes off to finance the wedding with a long bird hunting expedition, his mother plunges into a flagrant affair with the lighthouse keeper.<br /><br />Helpless, Fabian flounders in angry despair like a rudderless boat in the rocky bay. He turns inward, devoting endless hours to the study and painting of birds. Enigmatic Margaret gives him her pistol, a peculiar act from a girl who is no stranger to the responsibility of death, having knocked an old man over a cliff in a bicycle accident. But Margaret is passionate, mercurial and frustrated, unable to articulate her own pain over Fabian's impending marriage.<br /><br />The story's tension is heightened by quirky flashes of comedy and interludes of calm when it seems everyone might return to their senses. Instead, Fabian's father comes home and confronts Alaric. \\"Such a violent argument can turn a house inside out, let alone a mind, and there seemed to be no way to intervene, and no way to slow my heart down.\\"<br /><br />Imbibing some of their anguish Fabian retrieves Margaret's gun \\"and from that moment forward the revolver was part of my fate.\\" The murder itself is almost anticlimactic, so inevitable is it.<br /><br />With flight, a mock of a marriage and the family's arrest, an antic hilarity builds, yoked heavily to fate. Fabian is returned to Witless Bay, to Margaret, to the village's sense of justice, informed by long knowledge, harsh weather, and native reserve.<br /><br />Norman's prose is spare and elegant, as if shaped by the landscape he evokes so beautifully.

Montero, a Cuban-American, makes her second appearance in this 1994 novel, which juggles three different crime plots in the steamy atmosphere of mid-summer Miami.<br /><br />Montero, whose lonely personal life is never going to get better as long as the job comes first, investigates a series of apt accidents, a serial rapist, and the 20-year old unsolved sex murder of a little girl. Plot lines come to the fore and recede into the background in a natural flow depending on Montero's attention.<br /><br />The child's murder haunts an old cop friend, now dying of heart disease, who believes the hot new candidate for governor is the perp. Montero needles the candidate and interviews the child's family in her spare time.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the rapist grows more violent and spooky with every success. Montero follows his trail from the police lab to her aunt's Santeria rituals, prying information from the police and piecing together articles which infuriate the rapist and make her a target.<br /><br />And accidents keep happening to people who couldn't deserve them more.<br /><br />Montero stays on top of the action, although she doesn't scoop the police completely, which is a nice touch.

The mugging-murder victim on this frigid January Chicago morning is police sergeant Lieberman's nephew, David, son of his brother.<br /><br />The novel opens with the muggers and the crime itself - the shots that killed David and wounded his very pregnant wife. It then moves to Lieberman, his insomnia, family worries, encroaching age, all shoved into the background with the telephone call from his partner, Hanrahan.<br /><br />Hanrahan himself is quite a character - a former alcoholic sheltering the battered wife of a previous case, who contemplates remarriage to a Chinese woman while still awaiting his former wife's return.<br /><br />Kaminsky seamlessly weaves all this and more into a coherent plot, with plenty of suspense, much of it generated by activities Lieberman and Hanrahan are unaware of - danger to David's wife, and the crazed fanatic who stalks the partners with a shotgun. And the ending is a shocker.<br /><br />Kaminsky, Edgar-award-winning veteran writer, writes with warmth and melancholy humor; a layered book which works on all levels.	2004-08-23

The novel opens with Regina Riant's marriage to Charles Morrow in 1919, after her beloved father's death, and the couple's temporary removal from Mobile, Alabama, to rural Choctaw Bluff, 80 miles away, so that Charles can liquidate some of his lumber business to build them a house in Mobile.<br /><br />The isolation and boredom soon take their toll on Regina. She craves attention from Charles, but he's increasingly preoccupied, though he tells her nothing, saying only, \\" `Things might take longer than I originally thought.' ...She had heard him say this so many mornings, her worry evolved into a silent panic she tried to ignore, though not always with success.\\"<br /><br />Then pregnancy gives her an excuse to send for Camilla, her black maid, who has been with the family for years. With Camilla, as with no one else, she can share her discontent, as well as the long, empty hours.<br /><br />These first chapters establish Regina as a woman of her time and place. Very much aware of what is expected of her, she presents a confident, cheerful demeanor to her new husband, repressing any doubts. And as the years pass, Regina remains faithful to this ideal and convention of womanhood, a pose that both sustains and hinders her.  It gives her a face to present to the world in times of tragedy or embarrassment or consternation, and it leaves her utterly unprepared for her family's financial reversals or her husband's desperation.<br /><br />As Regina finally escapes back to Mobile (leaving Camilla behind to close up the cabin), the novel drops back in time, to the recent past; her father's long decline, and her own first crucial choice as an adult.<br /><br />Her father, though he had served as a lieutenant in the Civil War, is known as the Colonel, a mark of respect in a place where the glory of the Confederacy is revered without question. Grown wealthy as owner of the city's daily newspaper, he dotes on his only daughter, his gracious paternalism extending like an umbrella over the family and even the servants.<br /><br />As Camilla reflects: \\"There were good whites and there were bad whites.\\" She recalls how the Colonel sent flowers to her daughters' weddings and paid for her doctor visits and her eyeglasses. And: \\"Regina and her brothers stood in the sun all dressed in black outside the funeral of her mother, Amelia, to hug and kiss her cheek as she left the church.\\"<br /><br />Regina's mother upholds the family standards. \\"According to Mother Riant, there was to be no returning to the house at unseemly hours, no throat clearing, no voice raising, no sitting while a woman stood. There was to be no lending or borrowing, no bad breath, betting or blaspheming, no smoking in the dining room or front porch, no adjusting clothes in public, no eating while in motion. No detail of graciousness went overlooked, no chance at attentiveness went unseized, no than-you notes unwritten, no funeral flowers unsent.\\"<br /><br />From the first page you can feel the sweat beading on your brow, smell the Sunday ham, and embrace the safety of bedrock conventions. So while it may not be surprising that Regina's first love is a Chinese boy who blithely breaks all of Mother Riant's rules (perhaps is not even aware of them), it's completely unexpected when their whirlwind courtship and betrothal is enthusiastically embraced by all her family. And all are dismayed when she breaks off her marriage plans to stay home and nurse her father after a fall, thereby changing the course of her life.<br /><br />Women's dependency upon men is a major theme. Because Ahlong won't wait, Regina marries a man of her own kind who finds the burden of patriarchy too great. Her four brothers may be feckless wastrels, but they don't have to account to her - or even their declining and terrified mother - for what they do with theRiant money.<br /><br />This is a novel about loss - the decline of a long-established way of life as the 20th century advances into speeding automobiles and electric washing machines and devastating Depression. For Regina, starting out so full of exuberance and love and serenity, life is a whittling away of possibilities. Each loss forces her to rely a little more heavily on herself, a habit Camilla learned long ago, out of necessity, and a habit her brothers, inheritors of a proud tradition gone dissipated, never learn.<br /><br />But this is not the sort of novel where the heroine rises to the occasion, which is a bit surprising since Scully, only 26, was inspired by the life of her own great-grandmother. Regina is often infuriatingly immobile, moping on the front porch over her darning or spending weeks lost in books while tasks and calamities mount. But this makes her as real as a recalcitrant friend, and when she rouses herself to an effort, the disappointment of failure is all the more acute.<br /><br />Scully's complex narrative explores nuances of race, family, culture, religion, and history that seem all the more stirring coming from such a young author. The structure, often moving up to an event, then dropping back to explore what came before, and shifting among points of view throughout, allows a multi-faceted exploration. The prose is graceful and evocative without being flashy, and while there are a few off notes (the interchangeable brothers, both appalling and comic, are sometimes overdone; Camilla, in her wisdom, occasionally steps into stereotype), this is an absorbing and moving novel.at they do with the Riant money. <br /> <br />This is a novel about loss - the decline of a long-established way of life as the 20th century advances into speeding automobiles and electric washing machines and devastating Depression.

Their major success was an expedition both inwardly expected to fail - the unsupported (carry everything) crossing of Antarctica.<br /><br />There had already been an unsupported trip to the South Pole. Indeed, as they were making their crossing, the Scandinavian explorer Erling Kagge - who claimed the first unsupported trip to the North Pole, disputed by his rivals Stroud and Fiennes - was making the first solo unsupported trip to the South Pole.<br /><br />The crossing of the Antarctic continent, however impractical, was the next logical goal. This account, and another by Fiennes entitled \\"Mind Over Matter,\\" stress the grinding wear and tear on the human body, the bleak, black thoughts that accompany every labored step, and the life-threatening hazards of weather, crevassed terrain and starvation.<br /><br />The difference in their stories is entirely point-of-view and personality.<br /><br />Fiennes, the leader, sounds a practical, matter-of-fact note - his appendices on leadership, equipment, history and topography are nearly as long as his personal account. Stroud, the younger and smaller man, is more volatile and impassioned, resentful of the very notion of leadership in a two-man expedition.<br /><br />They began the trip unsure that they would even be able to budge their sledges - loaded with 485 pounds of food, fuel and equipment. \\"It would be so embarrassing if, once in our harnesses, our efforts came to nought and the sledges refused to budge,\\" says Stroud.<br /><br />After four hours they had moved only a couple of miles on their 1,700 hundred mile journey. And the next day they had their first equipment failure - a thermos that left one of the major respites of their day, hot soup, cold and full of gelatinous fat globs.<br /><br />On they went. Sails, parachutes inflated by the wind, had been an early bone of contention between them. Stroud was insistent, Fiennes, dubious about their usefulness and the added weight, agreed reluctantly. On their first try both found them terrifying and exhilarating.<br /><br />Says Stroud, \\"Compared with the toil of manhauling, to be pulled forward at high speed was a delight so intense that to ignore it, merely because it was difficult and dangerous, was near impossible.\\"<br /><br />And Fiennes, \\"After a hectic ten minutes of being dragged over ice ridges, crossing ski tips and being struck in the back by the sledge....I suddenly spotted a blueish shadow some forty feet ahead.\\"<br /><br />Fiennes threw himself to one side. Stroud, used to seeing his companion fall, started to go around. Going too fast to stop, he plunged into the crevasse. Says Fiennes, \\"Appalling thoughts crowded my mind: chiefly how I would explain Mike's death to his wife and mother.\\"<br /><br />But Stroud had landed on a precarious snow bridge. The description of extricating him and his sledge is harrowing. The sledge was permanently but not crucially damaged. On they went.<br /><br />Black thoughts, with no other outlet, turned on one another. Their chief friction was pacing. Stroud believed Fiennes was going slower than necessary because of brooding over his age (47); Fiennes believed Stroud was wasting energy by going too fast and later attributed hypothermic episodes to this depletion. Both experienced intense anger toward the other, most of which they avoided expressing except in their diaries.<br /><br />Consuming 5,200 calories a day, they were using 6,000 to 8,000, even 10,000. Slow starvation far outpaced the lessening of weight on the sledges. Because of Stroud's medical record keeping, (ironically described in greater daily detail by Fiennes) chemical changes and physical debilitation were documented with appalling exactitude.<br /><br />Both were subject to digestion problems, chronic frostbite infections, sores from chafing clothing and harnesses, skin damage from the depleted ozone layer, blindness from white-outs and from the absence of anything to focus on. But starvation was chief among their troubles, leading to muscle loss (even of the heart muscle) as well as every bit of insulating fat.<br /><br />When Fiennes finally called a halt after Stroud experienced several life-threatening bouts of hypothermia and hypoglycemia they had crossed the continent, although not the ice shelf which intervened between continent and ocean. They had succeeded, raising millions (at a penny per mile) for the Multiple Sclerosis Society, accomplishing major physiological research and being first to cross the continent unsupported. This, despite all the practical, idealistic reasons given, was their reason for going, a reason incomprehensible to most of us.<br /><br />Both books are well-written, expressive of separate personalities undergoing the same grueling physical and mental hardships. Both acknowledge they could not have made it without the other, for mental reasons as well as physical.

But a longer perusal calls attention to the incomprehensible otherness of animals while zeroing in on the common nature of all animal life.<br /><br />Bruant returned to Africa over a period of 20 years. \\"Little by little, I understood certain things: that the most interesting way to photograph a wild cat is to emphasize its gaze rather than its body; whereas, in the case of hippopotamuses and impalas, the reverse is true.\\"<br /><br />He captures animals in the acts of doing what they do - drinking at water holes, eating, capturing prey, threatening one another and proclaiming their power. Often he gets very close - photographing a crocodile so only a portion of its toothed snout and one eye are visible - or falls back to show the immensity of herd on plain.<br /><br />The page is dedicated entirely to the photograph. Captions are in the back of the book, accompanied by small reprints of the photos referred to. The captions offer a general description of the animal and its habits and habitat and a specific description of the circumstances in which it was taken.<br /><br />This is a beautiful book that both animal and photography lovers will turn to time and again.	2004-08-20

Their major success was an expedition both inwardly expected to fail - the unsupported (carry everything) crossing of Antarctica.<br /><br />There had already been an unsupported trip to the South Pole. Indeed, as they were making their crossing, the Scandinavian explorer Erling Kagge - who claimed the first unsupported trip to the North Pole, disputed by his rivals Stroud and Fiennes - was making the first solo unsupported trip to the South Pole.<br /><br />The crossing of the Antarctic continent, however impractical, was the next logical goal. This account, and another by Stroud entitled \\"Shadows on the Wasteland,\\" stress the grinding wear and tear on the human body, the bleak, black thoughts that accompany every labored step, and the life-threatening hazards of weather, crevassed terrain and starvation.<br /><br />The difference in their stories is entirely point-of-view and personality.<br /><br />Fiennes, the leader, sounds a practical, matter-of-fact note - his appendices on leadership, equipment, history and topography are nearly as long as his personal account. Stroud, the younger and smaller man, is more volatile and impassioned, resentful of the very notion of leadership in a two-man expedition.<br /><br />They began the trip unsure that they would even be able to budge their sledges - loaded with 485 pounds of food, fuel and equipment. \\"It would be so embarrassing if, once in our harnesses, our efforts came to nought and the sledges refused to budge,\\" says Stroud.<br /><br />After four hours they had moved only a couple of miles on their 1,700 hundred mile journey. And the next day they had their first equipment failure - a thermos that left one of the major respites of their day, hot soup, cold and full of gelatinous fat globs.<br /><br />On they went. Sails, parachutes inflated by the wind, had been an early bone of contention between them. Stroud was insistent, Fiennes, dubious about their usefulness and the added weight, agreed reluctantly. On their first try both found them terrifying and exhilarating.<br /><br />Says Stroud, \\"Compared with the toil of manhauling, to be pulled forward at high speed was a delight so intense that to ignore it, merely because it was difficult and dangerous, was near impossible.\\"<br /><br />And Fiennes, \\"After a hectic ten minutes of being dragged over ice ridges, crossing ski tips and being struck in the back by the sledge....I suddenly spotted a blueish shadow some forty feet ahead.\\"<br /><br />Fiennes threw himself to one side. Stroud, used to seeing his companion fall, started to go around. Going too fast to stop, he plunged into the crevasse. Says Fiennes, \\"Appalling thoughts crowded my mind: chiefly how I would explain Mike's death to his wife and mother.\\"<br /><br />But Stroud had landed on a precarious snow bridge. The description of extricating him and his sledge is harrowing. The sledge was permanently but not crucially damaged. On they went.<br /><br />Black thoughts, with no other outlet, turned on one another. Their chief friction was pacing. Stroud believed Fiennes was going slower than necessary because of brooding over his age (47); Fiennes believed Stroud was wasting energy by going too fast and later attributed hypothermic episodes to this depletion. Both experienced intense anger toward the other, most of which they avoided expressing except in their diaries.<br /><br />Consuming 5,200 calories a day, they were using 6,000 to 8,000, even 10,000. Slow starvation far outpaced the lessening of weight on the sledges. Because of Stroud's medical record keeping, (ironically described in greater daily detail by Fiennes) chemical changes and physical debilitation were documented with appalling exactitude.<br /><br />Both were subject to digestion problems, chronic frostbite infections, sores from chafing clothing and harnesses, skin damage from the depleted ozone layer, blindness from white-outs and from the absence of anything to focus on. But starvation was chief among their troubles, leading to muscle loss (even of the heart muscle) as well as every bit of insulating fat.<br /><br />When Fiennes finally called a halt after Stroud experienced several life-threatening bouts of hypothermia and hypoglycemia they had crossed the continent, although not the ice shelf which intervened between continent and ocean. They had succeeded, raising millions (at a penny per mile) for the Multiple Sclerosis Society, accomplishing major physiological research and being first to cross the continent unsupported. This, despite all the practical, idealistic reasons given, was their reason for going, a reason incomprehensible to most of us.<br /><br />Both books are well-written, expressive of separate personalities undergoing the same grueling physical and mental hardships. Both acknowledge they could not have made it without the other, for mental reasons as well as physical. Both are riveting accounts of exploration in a place few of us ever wish to go.depleted ozone layer, blindness from white-outs and from the absence of anything to focus on.

Although the problem of antibiotic resistance has been known since the earliest fanfare surrounding penicillin, only in recent years, with media attention, is the public catching a glimmer of the problem's magnitude.<br /><br />Fisher's simple, well-organized explanations document the rise of resistant bacterial strains - many of them untreatable and often fatal, including strains of pneumonia and tuberculosis.<br /><br />Given appropriately for, say, TB infection, antibiotics kill off marauding bacteria, allowing the body's defenses and bacterial equilibrium to return to normal. Given inappropriately for, as often happens, a viral disease such as a cold, the antibiotic destroys susceptible bacteria, leaving the field to resistant bacteria, which gorge on nutrients, thrive and reproduce. Or, given over too short a period, the antibiotic allows resistant bacteria to thrive and pass on their resistance to other infection causing bacteria, such as TB.<br /><br />A particularly interesting and chilling chapter explores the possibility that antibiotic resistence is a co-factor in AIDS. Fisher claims that the HIV virus alone, which existed relatively harmlessly in Africa for decades, is insufficient to cause AIDS. He posits that resistent bacteria strains join forces with HIV to undermine the immune system and cause AIDS. To bolster his argument he offers supporting quotes from such luminaries as Luc Montagnier, the French discoverer of HIV and documents practices of indiscriminate antibiotic use among gay men and Africans.<br /><br />Strongly persuasive, concluding with suggestions for reversing the trend, this is a valuable, easily accesssible, and still timely work.	2004-08-20

Since the commissaris is going to New York for a police convention he reluctantly agrees.<br /><br />Feverish and haunted by a recurring dream of a leggy streetcar driver with hollow eye sockets, he turns up various oddities - the dead man, who was a prosperous, well-dressed bookseller, was seen cavorting in the park by Dutch tourists. They also witnessed him being kicked by a police horse. When found dead the next morning he was dressed in derelict rags and covered with a filthy blanket.<br /><br />With drum-playing Inspector Grijpstra and Jazz-loving bachelor Sergeant DeGier exploring the commissaris' theories and questioning the tourists and other background witnesses back in Amsterdam, the story proceeds in layers and parallels. Each encounter supplies something unexpected - a tangential approach, a stereotype revised, a small fact with large implications.<br /><br />De Wetering's blend of wry humor and Zen philosophy permeate the world inhabited by his tolerant, grumpy and engaging characters. His well-honed writing style transports the reader to that world.	2004-08-19

But the two novels (almost 1200 pages of late nights and disturbing dreams) are each complete in themselves.<br /><br />\\"Desperation\\" is set in a tiny Nevada mining town of the same name and \\"The Regulators\\" takes place on one block of an Ohio suburb. What the two novels share is their characters and the same elemental evil force, Tak, which has escaped from a deep mine shaft.<br /><br />Although King has saved himself some work here - the characters have essentially the same personalities and backgrounds in both books - neither book provides a clue to anyone's fate in the other. The books are not sequential but alternate versions, alternate lives.<br /><br />In \\"Desperation\\" the characters are assembled by Collie Entragian, an outsize cop whose initially strange mix of friendliness and menace is eerily chilling. Apparently at random, he stops passing motorists and carries them off to jail. Some, however, don't make it all the way to jail, and it gradually becomes clear that Entragian has murdered everyone in town. But something weird is happening to the cop, too. He is literally and gorily falling apart.<br /><br />In \\"The Regulators\\" the characters are already assembled as neighbors on Poplar Street. Their glorious summer day is shattered by the arrival of a crayon red van and its armed driver.<br /><br />Collie Entragian, a former cop drummed off the force on trumped-up charges, attempts to protect his neighbors and preserve the crime scene but the violence quickly escalates out of control. As the street begins a nightmarish metamorphosis into something out of the worst of children's television and old westerns, the strengths and weaknesses of the inhabitants begin to work on all of them - Johnny Marinville, the successful author of children's books, haunted by a dissipated past and a too-vivid vision; Cynthia, the new clerk at the convenience store, whose two-toned hair and irreverent wit obscure a core of decency; Tom Billingsley, the retired veterinarian; Steve Ames, a young man drifting through life, picking up skills.<br /><br />And then there's Audrey Wyler, the young widow with the autistic nephew, Seth. No one's seen her in a while and at first they scarcely notice her continuing absence amidst all the mayhem. But Audrey's particular hell has been a long time coming. There's a thing in Seth that can bend people to its will and the world to its malevolent vision and it's growing stronger.<br /><br />In \\"Desperation,\\" aging Johnny Marinville is only inches away from his former dissipation and still trying to reform his life without giving up his roue image; Steve Ames is the general dogsbody following Marinville on his cross-country tour; Cynthia is the plucky hitchhiker Steve picks up; Tom Billingsley is an old alcoholic veterinarian from Desperation (and why didn't Collie kill him? we wonder) and Audrey is a mining engineer who has managed to hide out from Collie.<br /><br />The Carvers, also present in \\"The Regulators\\" are reversed in \\"Desperation\\" - the parents are the children and vice versa. Thus, David, the child touched by God whose role is pivotal in \\"Desperation,\\" is just an early adult corpse in \\"The Regulators.\\"<br /><br />The child - his individual strength as well as innocence and purity of  vision - are key in both books. And in \\"The Regulators,\\" King adds a twist - good and evil battling it out within the same small body.<br /><br />As always, King's writing zips along and no one can beat him for sheer terror - the opening chapters of \\"Desperation\\" are scarier than any of the gore which follows. But the sheer volume of horrorsnumbs the reader's imagination eventually. In a lesser writer's hands both books could fizzle but King's characters are human beings and we care what happens to them.

Having served three years for the drunk-driving death of a small boy, Davis returns to his Mississippi home town with scores to settle.<br /><br />Brown's Deep South, working class voice drips with heat and smolders with trouble. Davis is a sullen, vicious young thug convinced that all his troubles are anyone's fault but his and determined to exact revenge. Not exactly an original character but Brown's gritty, laconic style imbues him with a foreboding sense of menace that seems to surround the whole town while people go about their business, knowing the danger but unwilling to quite believe it.<br /><br />Within 50 pages, Glen has killed - casually, with intent but almost without thought. The next morning he begins to harangue Virgil, his father, about the lack of a headstone on his mother's grave.<br /><br />\\"Virgil didn't look up. He couldn't reason with him. Not when he got things in his head and kept them that way. It wasn't any use to try. He was worn down and he'd had a long rest but now this rest was over and he didn't know if he could take this all over again.\\"<br /><br />As Glen creeps and careens around his town, drinking and wreaking brutal havoc as the whim grabs him, secrets begin to crawl up out of the worn linoleum floors and the fly-blown windows - cracks in the veneer of sainthood Glen has constructed around his dead mother, an unspeakable childhood incident that fuels Glen's hatred and weighs heavily on his father, a tangled history with the sheriff and his mother.<br /><br />Sheriff Bobby Blanchard's stand-up confrontation with Glen goes deeper than Bobby's love for Jewel, Glen's girlfriend and the mother of his child. Bobby himself grew up without a father. \\"He still didn't know anything about working on a car. Still didn't know how to slip up on a squirrel.\\" He's always wanted his mother to marry again. \\"To somebody. Anybody. So I could have had somebody to show me the stuff I needed to know. So you could have had somebody too.\\"<br /><br />The thought of Glen with Jewel \\"was too awful and the image was something he'd managed to keep out of his head so far.\\" Bobby is restrained, thoughtful, caring - a little envious of Glen and a little pitying too. Glen is simpler. He hates Bobby, always has.<br /><br />But why is Jewel wavering? What does she or did she ever see in Glen? Jewel is a normal, responsible parent, not given to heavy drinking or hankerings for excitement or abuse. While the motives of Brown's male characters are real and freighted with a lifetime of history, Jewel remains a cipher.<br /><br />But it's a small quibble.

550453:US	52774618	R75PQHGG5ITDO	0684826720	981203031	Rewrites: A Memoir	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A life, from comedy to tragedy	Born in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, growing up poor, without a book in the house, and beset by the insecurities of his father's frequent unpredictable abandonments, Neil Simon went on to be America's most popular and prolific playwright, winner of numerous Tony Awards and other honors for his touching and hilarious comedies.<br /><br />The first three quarters of his memoir \\"Rewrites,\\" leaves readers with much the same warm feeling as his plays. While he never deprecates his own talent, Simon is generous in giving credit to others - producers, directors, actors, even critics.<br /><br />He never lost his wide-eyed joy and amazement at success and shares with readers the often arduous paths of plays that evolved in rewrite after rewrite, some requiring frantic writing stints after opening night.<br /><br />It was his older brother Danny (himself a successful Hollywood writer) who started him writing routines for comics as a teenager and who prophesied, \\" 'You're going to be the best comedy writer in America.' \\"<br /><br />This support was complicated by sibling rivalry and the younger brother's struggle for autonomy, which Simon does not dwell on although it was clearly painful. But Danny was also an inspiration for some of his brother's most famous characters - from his first play (and first success) to Felix in \\"The Odd Couple,\\" a play based on his newly divorced brother's roomate relationship with another newly divorced friend.<br /><br />Many, if not all, of Simon's plays found their inspiration in family situations or incidents among friends. \\"The Star Spangled Girl\\" grew out of an argument at a party between Paddy Chayefsky and an astronaut's wife. Simon, a liberal himself, had difficulty doing justice to the conservative woman. \\"I found I disliked her politics so much, I made her disagreeable.\\"<br /><br />Unhappy with the play, he persisted, encouraged by his longtime producer \\"Saint\\" Subber. \\"When you write something you like, the pages fly by. When you know it's not good, each key on the typewriter weighs about ten pounds and you need to see a chiropractor every morning.\\"<br /><br />But the play was a hit. Afterwards, Simon got drunk at the cast party and later, \\"I threw up everything I had eaten since the first day I started writing \\"The Star Spangled Girl.\\"  Nothing connected to that play stayed in my mind or my body.\\" He vowed to his wife Joan that he would never again stage a play he didn't like.<br /><br />Simon's memoir revolves around his marriage as much as his work. Joan was a quirky, stalwart presence unimpressed by money or fame but wholly supportive. Her dislike of Los Angeles and glitz kept Simon grounded in reality and she fiercely guarded the integrity of family life.<br /><br />Simon's description of their first apartment and Joan's efforts with it are funny, heartwarming and illuminating. No wonder it lead to his smash hit \\"Barefoot In the Park.\\" Joan was also an inspiration for \\"Jake's Women,\\" and her amazing reaction to Simon's momentary bout with mid-life crisis became the impetus for \\"The Last of the Red Hot Lovers.\\"<br /><br />The book is colorfully studded with anecdotes of the eccentric, even bizarre behavior of show business people - Mike Nichols, who directed several of Simon's plays but never stopped requiring ego massages, George C. Scott, who briefly walked out on \\"Plaza Suite\\" because he was afraid of jinxing its success, Maureen Stapleton, Simon's favorite actress.<br /><br />Simon is an affectionate writer with scarcely a bad word to say about anyone. The worst behavior is transformed into amusing foibles or at least balanced by praise for more attractive traits. Yet Simon seems honest, about himself as well as others.<br /><br />Along with Simon's talent for humourous story-telling and the fascinating behind-the-scenes exploration of play evolution, part of this book's charm is Simon's awareness of his luck, his joy in his family and his career. But all this comes to acrashing halt with his wife's illness and death at age 40 which ends the book.<br /><br />The last 50 or so pages are dark, confused and desperate, such a drastic change in tone, it leaves the reader floundering. Simon obviously felt this was a natural place to conclude but many readers will wish he had gone on to show how he emerged from that bleak time, how he healed and went on to forge a renewed life for himself and his young daughters..

Books	5	4	6	N	N	A 1947 larger than life	Fowler's delightful second novel is the story of the magical, postwar summer of 1947 when the hometown soldiers never returned to the small town of Magrit and the young women formed a baseball team to find husbands - and prove the efficacy of breakfast cereal. Or is it?<br /><br />The story is narrated by the now-middle-aged daughter of Irini Doyle, the Sweetwheat Sweetheart's home-run hitter and strong right arm. The narrator tells us right off that she prefers drama to fact and that her mother filtered truth through a generous spirit: \\" 'I'm just fine. You go and have a nice dinner,' were the last words she ever said to me.\\"<br /><br />So it's the daughter's story of her mother's youth, written from the vantage point of experience, disillusion, affection and love. \\"When my mother told it to me, it was a very short story. I have been forced to compensate not only for her gentle outlook, but also for her spare narration.\\"<br /><br />Magrit is a mill town, dominated since 1898 by Henry Collins, who drowned Upper Magrit (with the connivance of Lower Magrit, forever unforgiven) to build Margaret Mill, home of Sweetwheats breakfast cereal. An earnest, zany Kellogg-type, adhering steadfastly to scientific modernism, but just a beat behind, Henry is devastated when someone invents fishsticks before he thinks of it. \\"Fish so transformed that even children would eat it.\\"<br /><br />The idea for the baseball team comes after a Collins dinner party when Henry and his artistic, political wife Ada are waiting with Irini (present as server) for her drunken father to pick her up. The baseball idea is a diversion. Ada is diverting Henry from his enthusiasm for obtaining an ape on which to conduct nutrition studies; Henry is diverting Ada from her enthusiasm for unionizing the mill girls; both are diverting Irini from brooding about her father's undependability.<br /><br />Not that Irini's father is mean or pathetic. A lonely widower since Irini's birth, he's the voice of caustic reason (very un-1947ish) and Irini is the apple of his eye.<br /><br />While Irini's father taught her baseball, her spectacular arm was developed in the mill's Scientific Kitchen, kneading bread. Most of the Magrit girls work in the Kitchen where foods are tested to the strict standard of fictional Maggie Collins, the housewife-heroine whose advice goes out to women world-wide in the company magazine \\"Women At Home.\\"<br /><br />Fowler peppers her narrative with Maggie's tips. \\"To prevent snow from sticking, cut an onion in half and run it over the windshield of your car.\\" Women write to her poignantly of war losses and family triumphs. Maggie responds with cheer and practical advice for women heading back into kitchens everywhere.<br /><br />But something is happening to Maggie. Sabotage in the form of phallic fruit salads, and rebellious encouragement of women who love women, who gain weight with abandon, who lift their eyes beyond the kitchen.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Sweethearts are playing baseball, coached by Walter Collins, the patriarch's grandson and Irini's unappreciated beau. They're playing 11-year-olds and drunken louts - and losing. Of course, women should lose at baseball if they want husbands but none of them are pleased.<br /><br />Their bus passes an old farm truck and the driver yells something. \\"It was 1947, so it never entered their heads it might be something rude.\\" Along with Maggie's tips this is another Fowler refrain. \\"It was 1947 so if you caught a fish you could eat it.\\" \\"It was 1947 so who knew alcoholism was genetic?\\"<br /><br />Fowler's characters - her narrator's characters - are small town girls but larger than life. There's Tracey, doggedly average but supremely self-confident; Sissy, sweetly dimwitted but with surprising strength of character; Fanny, the leader and the vamp.<br /><br />Fowler (\\"Sarah Canary\\") has fun with comic stereotypes, creating a starry-eyed nostalgia, gently undercut with loneliness and the turning worm. Thenarrator's voice is perfect - ironic but affectionate, looking back on a mother's story she can only imagine:<br /><br />\\"You would do well therefore to keep always in mind that this is a story told by two liars. It is possible, our fictional impulses being so opposite, that we may arrive together at something clear-eyed and straightforward....If this happens it will be by accident. It is not my intention. I will go so far as to say I would consider it a disappointment.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Sweetheart Season\\" is a grand slam of a novel.nd the turning worm.

Earth still accommodates the Aleutians, hermaphroditic aliens who have been lost in space aboard a huge ship-world for countless generations and have now made earth their home.<br /><br />The Aleutians, whose absolute belief in reincarnation makes them immortal, at least in their own eyes, do not understand earthlings' concern with individual death, which gives them an amusingly skewed vision of war, pollution and disease.<br /><br />Aleutians communicate almost telepathically through wanderers, bits of themselves which wander from one to another like lice, carrying information. Their technology is also life-based - tools created from their own cells - and they have no interest in earth technology or \\"dead\\" matter. They cannot comprehend, for instance, the earthlings attachment to the Himalayas, which the Aleutians would like to level in the interests of climate control.<br /><br />The protagonists are Sidney Carton, a consciously literary fellow, who may or may not be the Aleutian ally he pretends to be, and Bella, the \\"isolate\\" Aleutian crippled among her/his own kind by a lack of wanderers and sought by all sides for reasons she does not understand. Rescued from human attack by Sidney, Bella discovers health and strength in adversity and a surprising talent for human virtual reality games.<br /><br />The book's adventures through war-torn cities and cultural factions are at times confusing - Jones makes it purposely difficult to determine the sides, and their search for the secret human discovery of faster-than-light travel seems an afterthought - but Jones' vision of alien culture keeps its quirky allure, being both thought-provoking and humorous.	2004-08-19

The protagonist, Inspector Morris Black, is a melancholy Jewish widower. The killer's first victims are young, homosexual military pilots but it's the killer's choice of locale that make the case sensitive.<br /><br />The murderer kills at the site of Luftwaffe raids - hours before the raids happen. When it becomes clear that this is no accident, Black finds himself in the midst of frantic Intelligence services and privy to secrets that endanger his career.<br /><br />Meanwhile, \\"The Doctor,\\" a highly placed English Nazi spy, is also on the track of the killer, intrigued as to how advance notice of the raids is being obtained.<br /><br />Hyde's detailed and atmospheric prose gives the reader a true sense of London at war. When Black, along with an attractive American spy trying to infiltrate his case, is caught in several devastating raids, Hyde vividly conveys the sense of panic, the devastating destruction and waste, the feel and smell and sound of exploding bombs, falling brick and timber, implacable fire - and the serendipity of who dies and who lives.<br /><br />He also gives us portraits of London's powerful intelligence people - chosen for their schools and connections rather than their skills - and a sense of British ambivalence which emerged in open slights of Jews and covert plots for a separate peace with Hitler.<br /><br />Hyde is a careful and powerful writer with an intriguing and shocking story.	2004-08-19

The action begins when 11-year-old Koot Hoomie Parganas (Kootie for short) rebels against his Mahatma-worshiping, vegetarian weirdo parents, breaks open their plaster bust of Dante, steals the glass vial inside and runs away.<br /><br />Robbed and beaten up, he tries to go home but it's too late. He has set events in motion that have caused the murder of his parents and the convergence of forces drawn by the powerful ghost trapped in the vial - Thomas Edison.<br /><br />Edison's ghost is a beacon, drawing rapacious \\"ghost-eaters\\" to hunt down Kootie, a bewildered boy who can't always tell his friends from his enemies. It also draws two other ghost-ridden people - Pete Sullivan, a man haunted by the drowning death of his father and hunted by an obsessed ghost eater, the film maker DeLarava, and Dr. Angelica Elizalde, a psychiatrist whose unconventional methods backfired on Halloween two years ago, killing several patients.<br /><br />Powers sets these people on a collision course through a Lost Angeles so grittily, glitzily realized, you'll feel like you're walking its haunted streets in person. His eye for detail and the slight skewing of ordinary expectations heightens the atmospheric tension and creates an especially frightening world for the appealing and bewildered Kootie<br /><br />.<br /><br />Well-written, weirdly imaginative and fast-paced, the book's only fault is length. Long after most of the mysteries are solved, the protagonists are still running around barely escaping annihilation and it grows, unfortunately, repetitious. Powers redeems this minor fault, however, with a spectacular finale on the luxurious and history-loaded ship, the Queen Mary.	2004-08-19

In between is a free-association of flashbacks - a rollicking ride through his life, his city and his work - punctuated by contemplative reflections on the nature of God and the human mind.<br /><br />\\"I lived in the everyday excitement of meeting strangers who unfold in front of you and become people you cannot wait to tell others about. How can you be expected to notice what is happening to your own life? ...and suddenly I look down and see that my feet are pawing strange dirt at the lip of a grave that maybe could be mine. And that is blinding speed.\\"<br /><br />At age 65 Breslin made a rare doctor's visit due to eye trouble. The eye is nothing, but the attendant MRI shows an entirely unrelated \\"bulge,\\" which could be a life-threatening aneurysm.<br /><br />Instantly Breslin recalls the Crown Heights riot after a black child was killed by a car driven by a Jew and a Jewish student was subsequently stabbed. Entering the area in a cab, Breslin was beaten and finally rescued. \\"The guy with the knife took me by the arm and led me through the crowd. The rest of me was reeling, a flag blowing in a stiff wind.\\"<br /><br />Breslin's eye was injured in the melee and he seizes on this as an explanation. His memory of the riot is pungent, urgent, but the doctor brushes it off.<br /><br />The aneurysm confirmed, Breslin makes a joke. The doctor is amazed at his lack of understanding. But: \\"I also was treating it just as I do any horrible thing that occurs in a day. I report on a tragedy by remaining cold and callous and concentrate on making notes of the smallest details. In the hotel kitchen in Los Angeles, I counted Sirhan Sirhan kicking his legs five times before somebody sat on them after he shot Robert Kennedy.\\"<br /><br />As he educates himself about the aneurysm and his options, he recalls the deaths of others - Nelson Rockefeller, his beloved wife Rosemary, the New York stabbing of Martin Luther King and his assassination a decade later - and endures the kindness and shocking insensitivity of various friends and colleagues.<br /><br />He recalls colorful characters from mob bosses to shady polls, rollicking nights in bars where he learned more than any journalism graduate sitting at a computer (he has the older generation's contempt for new ways).<br /><br />He remembers the cold dread of being broke, the bitterness of his childhood, his own floundering lack of identity - always pretending to be someone else.

She holds the key to the mysteries in their lives and explores these secrets aloud in story-telling tours of her gallery of photos - pictures of strangers who have captured her imagination and inspire her to heights of fancy and fact. Her audience, however, seldom gets the point of her veiled parables.<br /><br />Tom Lowe is a favorite of Quee's. A handsome handyman, Tom's life is stalled in brooding over the suicide of a father he scarcely knew, the underwater lot that was his father's only legacy, and the lover he lost to the wider world outside Fulton.<br /><br />Denny Parks, sexy, insecure and adventurous, is the daughter of Quee's oldest friend, who has been invited to the clinic as a therapist, a profession in which she has absolutely no experience. She has, however, had a nervous breakdown and loves to talk, eminent qualifications.<br /><br />Alicia Jameson, another of Quee's assistants, is the abused wife of a loathsome-Lothario local talk show host, Jones Jameson, who has disappeared.<br /><br />The next circle out includes Sarah McAllister, Tom's high-school sweetheart, who returned to Fulton with her husband in tow and fading hopes of a baby, only to end in a coma from an aneurysm. And Wallace Johnson, the old postmaster, who's been reading letters addressed to the Wayward One, a suicide, for 20 years. And Myra Carter, an elderly admirer of Jones Jameson, who hates Quee for suspected adultery with her husband, the late doctor.<br /><br />The lives of all these people are intertwined with Quee's in ways only Quee is cognizant of, a Godlike omniscience that is a driving force in her own life. But one of the book's chief ironies is that the reader comes into possession of a puzzle piece illuminating a misunderstanding that has haunted, romanticized, even directed Quee's life.<br /><br />McCorkle, also an accomplished short story writer, reveals her characters' lives in vignettes that rove among various points of view, exploring interlocking histories that share a peripheral fascination with the missing Jones Jameson and an unknown but crucial connection with Quee.<br /><br />The author forges an intimacy with her readers through lives full of vivid details, memories and actions that make her characters' anxieties, fears and ambitions visceral.

One, his mentor convinced him it was the only specialty where cure was common. Two, as it was not a glamor field, a foreign ID doctor had a better shot at training at a top university hospital.<br /><br />Simple, sensitive and scrupulously honest, Verghese's book is alive to the ironies, tragedies and heroism of the first days of the AIDS epidemic.<br /><br />After training in Boston, where he saw his first AIDS patient, Verghese and his wife returned to idyllic Appalachia in 1985, expecting their first child. Aware of his outsider status, Verghese sets about finding, and making, his place. His rounds encompass two hospitals, the Mountain Home VA, a residence where he sees elderly vets and a lot of lung cancer, and the modern Johnson City Medical Center, the \\"Miracle Center.\\" The contrast is vivid.<br /><br />Although Johnson City has no AIDS patients and its single experience with a New Yorker who didn't quite make it home to die is \\"suppressed like a shameful memory,\\" Verghese sets out to educate the population, to prevent AIDS here if he can.<br /><br />His first visit to a gay bar to show an educational video is fraught with discomfort on numerous levels. The stiff self-consciousness of his early encounters with gay men in Boston is being consciously replaced with curiosity. \\"There was an obvious parallel: society considered them alien and much of their life was spent faking conformity.\\" Still, it's a small town and Verghese is a foreigner with a reputation to build.<br /><br />But his educational efforts bring in his first cases. He is excited, on the cutting edge of medicine. The HIV virus has been identified and a cure is surely just around the bend. He makes house calls, gives patients as much of his time as they need, and in a zealous spirit of medical documentation, friendship and plain human curiosity, elicits histories so personal it's difficult to imagine them spoken aloud.<br /><br />As his AIDS practice grows, Verghese encounters bigotry and anger among his colleagues and community. But more profound is the bravery and generosity of spirit the disease arouses among the most unlikely people - the poor, the uneducated, the sick. He is touched, humbled, uplifted by the friends and relatives of his patients and often by the patients themselves.<br /><br />But the hideousness of AIDS cuts a nasty swath. The bravest face a horrible, lingering and disfiguring death, usually in the prime of life. Verghese's descriptions of disease are unflinching.<br /><br />As his case load grows to 80 and death becomes a commonplace, Verghese is beset by nightmares of infection and feelings of helplessness. His wife, frightened and resentful, withdraws from him. Similar attitudes in the medical community arouse furious bitterness. All around him, his new friends, his self-made family, are dying. After five years his endurance snaps. Plagued by guilt and relief, Verghese leaves Johnson City.<br /><br />\\"My Own Country\\" is an important, passionate book which cannot be recommended highly enough.

Disliking the sleazy politician doing the asking, Barnett refuses. But the six bodies were found over his uncle's strip club, and one of them was a Japanese diplomat, so when his uncle, aka the Sultan, asks, Barnett agrees.<br /><br />The Sultan is \\"king of the shadow politicians in Harlem,\\" people who \\"pull the strings\\" of elected politicians, and with Republicans in power all over the city, he can't afford a scandal involving a diplomat. The dead, who were dusted in cocaine, also include two assassins who had targetted the diplomat, so Barnett begins looking into the man's Harlem business. He also begins hunting for the one who got away - a young prostitute now in hiding. Is it drugs, politics, business, all three, or something else altogether?<br /><br />The novel's pace is procedural as Barnett tracks down the various connections and digressions, trying to make time for the bodyrest essential to sickle-cell anemia sufferers like himself. He broods over the changes Harlem has seen since its heyday and even since his own youth as he passes through neighborhoods, renews old connections and makes new ones.<br /><br />Barnett's voice is hard-boiled. He's a bit bitter over his CIA stint, feeling he'd run into the \\"glass ceiling\\" when he tired of \\"wet work\\" and looked for a promotion. But he can croon too, waxing warm over family and enduring Harlem traditions. Steeped in jazz rythmns, blues riffs and hard-edged rap, Hayes' debut explores many facets of Harlem, including drugs, prostitution, gangs and Korean inroads, withough speading itself too thin. Hayes' decidedly noir debut, despite a few off notes (the white police captain is a cartoon) offers a complex protagonist, a fast-paced plot and rich atmosphere. A promising series opener.	2004-08-17

But the British duo who write as Nicci French (\\"The Red Room\\" \\"Killing Me Softly\\") bring the dark, intimate thrill of the head-game to this timeworn scary story and from the first page, you're hooked.<br /><br />Narrator Miranda Cotton, 26, the middle child, is the one with all the confidence and independence. She works as a builder-decorator, lives in a small London flat and likes her single life. The day Brendan Block lets himself into her flat and she catches him reading her diary is the day their brief relationship is over.<br /><br />But the next thing she knows he's enraptured her shy, insecure sister, Kerry. He's insinuated himself into her family, told everyone, in the most sympathetic terms, that Miranda's reaction is just her broken heart talking. French winds the tension up, beat by beat. There are whispered obscenities, malevolent promises, unprovable invasions of her privacy. No one sees any of it but Miranda and as the scale of invasion escalates, her own family begins to turn aganst her. New boyfriends vanish in the face of her obsession. Even the reader begins to wonder - is Miranda an unreliable narrator?<br /><br />As always French's characters come alive on the page. Even Miranda's new boyfriends have the same freshness of possibility for us as they do for her. Her pleasure in her life, her growing revulsion and helplessness, her increasing desperation, all ring true in this gripping psychological thriller. Not French's best but still head and shoulders above the rest.	2004-08-17

Instead, LaPlante, creator of TV's \\"Prime Suspect,\\" delivers ruthlessness and daring. And a seemingly endless supply of obstacles. All of which Edward de Jersey is single-mindedly determined to overcome in his do-or-die quest to keep his life in the style to which he has become accustomed.<br /><br />De Jersey, son of a bookie, has risen to the top of British society on the proceeds of previous criminal success. Now he breeds racehorses, looking for his crowning jewel, a derby winner. With Royal Flush that glory is almost within grasp when it all comes tumbling down. Suddenly, in a dot.com tumble, he's bankrupt. His trusted accountant has lost it all and killed himself.<br /><br />Having previously carried out Britain's most daring robberies (a fact unknown to all but his accomplices), de Jersey dreams up a scheme to gather his old gang together and recoup  his losses. By stealing the Crown Jewels. There are lots of problems with this plan, of course. Security seems impregnable. The old gang isn't getting any younger and none of them have stolen so much as a stick of gum in years. De Jersey's wife is angry and suspicious about his secrecy. His accountant's sister-in-law has gotten curious. And the team of robbers keeps getting bigger.<br /><br />To pull this one off de Jersey needs a lot of accomplices, including a computer hacker, a queen, a lady-in-waiting, and a footman. De Jersey himself becomes a less sympathetic character as the plans grow more complicated, but the secondary characters are appealing. There's an odd distance to this novel, which is a mite off-putting, but the daring plot keeps the pages turning.	2004-08-17

Poverty there has been intensified by US aid, in the form of a dam, which deprived subsistence farmers of their land to benefit US-owned agribusiness downstream.<br /><br />The product of an unconventional childhood, spent in a camper bus and a houseboat, Farmer is brilliant and tireless. He passed his medical school years mostly in Haiti and still graduated near the top of his class. During home intervals he was, and is, relentless about raising money. He shows little patience for \\"WLs,\\" white liberals, who shy from personal sacrifice. He doesn't hesitate to impose his views. Wealth amid so much world poverty is absolute anathema to him. He inspires and intimidates. Close friends often feel inadequate, sometimes resentful and guilty. He's also sunny-natured, highly emotional and charismatic. The combination often seems to overwhelm people, including Kidder.<br /><br />Kidder chronicles the building of Haiti's Zanmi Lasante (Partners in Health) from its inception to its position as Farmer's home base, the place where he still practices hands-on medicine between worldwide jaunts promoting TB and AIDs policies and raising money. Kidder travels with him, to Cuba, Russia, Venezuela, and the reader can only marvel at the man's capacity for work and personal engagement and be glad there are such people in the world.to Cuba, Russia, Venezuela, and the reader can only marvel at the man's capacity for work and personal engagement and be glad there are such people in the world.	2004-08-16

Drifting aimlessly at age 26, he jumps at the chance to join his girlfriend, Sylvia, on her aid-worker posting to Tarawa, in the island nation of Kiribati.<br /><br />Of decidedly northern sensibilities, he packs jeans and a sweater along with his shorts and flip-flops and imagines an island paradise where he will write a literary masterpiece of a novel. The disillusionment process begins immediately.<br /><br />His chapter heading (Troost employs witty 19th century-style chapter headings) for arrival: \\"In which the Author finally sets foot on Distant Tarawa, ... and, Conceding that it is indeed Very Hot on the Equator, he Bravely overcomes his Fear of Sharks and encounters something Much, Much Worse.\\"<br /><br />By which he means the casual parade of people defecating into the water where he is swimming. Along with no sanitary facilities and bad water, Tarawa has a slum where the population density is the highest on earth  - he never explains why they don't spread out to the relatively idyllic northern end - presumably they are not wanted - and of course no one has fuel to boil the water.<br /><br />Almost nothing grows on the island, which is, in addition, suffering from drought, and because of the pollution, the inshore fish are \\"guaranteed to induce gastric explosions.\\" Ciguatera toxicity, caused by untreated sewage, and sometimes fatal, is common in larger fish (who concentrate it by eating smaller ones) and everyone everyday consumes fish. And then there's the trash, the most ubiquitous import, which, having no other place to go, litters the beaches.<br /><br />After a while all this becomes normal and Troost begins to make friends and enemies, adopts a few feral dogs (the major form of wildlife), and goes native enough to discourage the prowling peeping toms who would never dare intrude on their own kind. He learns Kiribati mythology and absorbs some history and gradually begins to understand their customs as something more than inexplicable eccentricities.<br /><br />Having arrived with rather American notions of safety in terms of food, means of travel, and daily preservation, he discards many of these prejudices, thereby inviting new experiences: he body surfs in shark infested waters, narrowly misses fishing on the high seas in a leaky open canoe, crosses 20-foot storm-tossed seas without getting seasick, and becomes marooned on an island with lobster. \\"The I-Kiribati do not have a taste for lobster. I believed this was because their taste buds died when the English arrived.\\" Not so, he is told. They avoid lobster because it is a \\"disgusting reef cleaner.\\" And we know by then, as well as Troost does, what that means on Tarawa.<br /><br />The isolation of the place is captured perfectly in a chapter on the Clinton-Lewinsky mess: \\"In which the Author begins to hear rumors of Lurid Happenings in Washington and suddenly he Regrets his Situation, his Location, and Wishes only to have access to a tabloid newspaper, a television, an Internet connection, but he is Denied.\\"<br /><br />He is scathingly hilarious about the corrupt, inefficient government, the implausible schemes of the World Bank and other international organizations, and US nuclear history in the South Pacific.<br /><br />But when the two years are up, he and Sylvia are ambivalent about leaving. Indeed, after a short stint back home, Sylvia accepts a position in Fiji, where their son is born. After this wildly funny, witty and informative debut, readers will hope he is planning a Fiji chronicle to follow soon.r dare intrude on their own kind.

(Dortmunder Novels)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Dortmunder's famous luck	Hilariously clever, Westlake's 1996 John Dortmunder thriller turns on luck as the ingenious but luckless burglar's soulmate, May, receives a bequest, \\"a small box, such as earrings might come in, or a kidnap victim's finger.\\"<br /><br />In it is her dead uncle's \\"lucky\\" ring which fits Dortmunder perfectly. Wearing it, he embarks on a burgling job. But the corporate beach house is not empty. The owner, Max Fairbanks, one of the world's richest men, greets Dortmunder with a gun. Whimsically topping off his coup, Fairbanks announces to the police that Dortmunder has stolen his ring and gleefully appropriates Dortmunder's lucky piece.<br /><br />A mistake. Dormunder, personally affronted, begins a single-minded quest to retrieve the ring by escaping the police and returning to the house, now disappointingly empty - of people, that is. Consoling himself with a rich haul, Dortmunder plots his next move, undeterred even by the prospect of pursuing Fairbanks beyond the bounds of his New York world. Meanwhile the burglary is the start of a spectacular downhill slide for Fairbanks.<br /><br />Westlake's prose hurtles along with the twists of the plot as loot fairly jumps into the hands of Dortmunder's gang (growing larger at every turn) while the ring continues to elude him. The final caper unleashes a veritable army of New York's thieves on an extremely suspicious and watchful Las Vegas. This is Westlake at his funniest.	2004-08-14

But his solitude is disrupted first by news of his stepfather's heart attack and then by four thugs who attack him and ransack his hut.<br /><br />Kinloch has never been close to his stepfather, Ivan, but quickly finds himself embroiled in his plight, up to his neck in bank officers and lawyers and entrusted with hiding a race horse and a jewel-encrusted trophy. All of which he accepts with stoic aplomb, despite the increasing risk to his own neck and the disruption of his life.<br /><br />There's not much racing in this one, but Francis' hero does plenty of quick thinking and maneuvering and takes plenty of knocks as he defends the family's honor \\"to the hilt,\\" ferreting out a murderer in the process.<br /><br />Francis keeps things moving and invests his characters with complex and very British codes of honor.

The chief suspect is a war hero and friend of the Prince of Wales. Worse, the chief witness is a deranged shell-shock victim.<br /><br />As Rutledge tramps over the countryside, making his dogged way among the resentful relatives and friends of the victim (who have already chosen a convenient scapegoat), feretting out their painful secrets, his own precarious state threatens to expose him with every brush of a raw nerve.<br /><br />Todd populates his novel with complex characters, each with the characteristic closeness of country villagers, and constructs an absorbing mystery (with perhaps a too surprising solution) in an atmospheric setting, but the real star of this novel is the protagonist. Without being overdone, Rutledge's edgy reality is gripping, the gibbering gnome on his shoulder a constant goad<br /><br />.<br /><br />This is still the best of the series.	2004-08-14

He's also colossally vain, sublimely venal and stunningly self-absorbed. In short, he's absurdly, hilariously frightening: a quintessential Hiaasen villain.<br /><br />His baffled and furious wife, Joey, survives by clinging to a bail of pot and is rescued by former cop Mick Stranahan. After six marriages, Mick leads a safer hermit's life on a quiet island. Then, against his better judgment, he agrees to help Joey figure things before reporting her rescue.

Park Ranger Pigeon, acting as medic and security officer on a wildfire detail in California's Lassen Volcanic National Park, is evacuating an injured firefighter when suddenly a violent thunderstorm sparks a firestorm.<br /><br /> Barr's description of the exploding flames, forcing the squad to abandon their patient and seek cover under their silver fire protectors or &quot;shake 'n' bakes,&quot; is breathtaking. As the battered firefighters slowly emerge, they discover one of their number has been murdered. Impossibly, the murder had to take place during the firestorm itself.<br /><br /> Complicating matters further is the weather - snow, high winds and downed trees close the only road to rescue and the group is isolated with only their emergency packs. Pigeon, knowing one among them is a murderer, carefully sifts through clues and motives, her investigation supplemented by radio reports from her old friend FBI agent Frederick Stanton.<br /><br /> The snail-paced romance between the two loners, Pigeon and Stanton, heats up over the neutral distance of the radio, and Stanton's background checks supply valuable clues and red herrings.<br /><br /> Barr's well-plotted story sizzles with danger - human and elemental. The firefighting and wilderness details are fascinating, atmospheric and integral to plot and character. A thoroughly enjoyable tale.	2004-07-25

Paris himself is obsessed with his belief that a madman is creating bouts of disease through food contamination in restaurants.<br /><br />Ouellette keeps a lot of balls in the air here, some more successfully than others.

Miss Bunting is the quintessential elderly, unflappable governess hired to tutor delicate, naive Anne Fielding who soon makes the somewhat unsuitable acquaintance of Heather Adams, daughter of the wealthy but hardly genteel ironworks owner.<br /><br />Anne's circle includes Jane Gresham, whose husband is missing in action in the East, and who has come with her young son to live with her father, Admiral Palliser. Robin Dale, son of the Church rector, has also come home, minus a foot lost in the fighting. He fills his time teaching small boys and caring for his scholarly, absent-minded father.<br /><br />Despite the upheavels of war, Old Town and New Town have maintained their social separation - until crass but efficient Mr. Adams bowls over the barriers, conferring favors wherever he goes, wanted or not.<br /><br />While the elder denizens are nonplussed by the man, they are unable to articulate their prejudice and Anne's acquaintance proceeds. Meanwhile, Jane finds herself intrigued by the man's energy.<br /><br />Although largely plotless, Thirkell's novel draws the reader in with crisp, wry characterizations and turns of phrase. Miss Bunting is delighfully reactionary; the arbiter of British taste for generations of upperclass girls, the observer, who, when required, can set things in their proper place with a look or a word.<br /><br />Thirkell's social comedies, with their gentle bite, should gain a new generation of anglophile readers.	2004-07-25

Big mistake. Or is it? In British author Mead's witty novel of marriage gone awry, people have a refreshing resilience.<br /><br />Christy Callahan, former stockbroker and Southern belle, turned quintessential housewife and mother, is bored with her role and her husband, Gabe, a hapless, talented lawyer whose consuming goal is her happiness.<br /><br />And Maggie Callahan is full of resentment toward her successful and philandering journalist husband, Oliver, and fears that she may be doomed to tawdry domestication forever. Oliver, a compulsive liar, rather likes his life the way it is.<br /><br />Christy is the catalyst for change. A fount of energy, Christy takes on the Wiltshire neighborhood and her borrowed house with crusader's zeal. Enchanted by Oliver's eclectic library (entirely inherited unbeknownst to her), she comes across an unpublished novel about his great doomed love affair and becomes obsessed with his passion.<br /><br />Mead's character depictions, particularly the women, are unsparing without being unsympathetic. While most novels of dysfunctional marriage, no matter how clever, tend to be arid and bleak, this one is absorbing and deliciously ironic, full of unexpected twists and turns.<br /><br />A delightful and thoughtful book, Mead's American debut, should win her plenty of new fans.	2004-07-25

A few days later the woman's son, Nile Eddgar, the gang leader's probation officer, is arrested for conspiracy to murder.<br /><br />Sonny Klonsky (from 'Burden of Proof'), the judge in Niles' trial, knew the victim 25 years earlier when she and Loyell Eddgar (now a state senator) were college radicals and their son was a confused little boy. Sonny's misgivings deepen when she realizes the defense lawyer, Hobie Tuttle, is another denizen from that turbulent past - a Black Panthers disciple and friend of her then boyfriend, Seth Weissman. Weissman, now a successful syndicated columnist, is also in town and quickly renews his acquaintance with Sonny.<br /><br />The narrative alternates between Sonny and the trial and Seth's recollections of 60's turmoil. Turow skillfully weaves old secrets into present intrigue, contrasting heady emotionalism with more cynical maneuvering. For the first half of the book he spins out the suspense while brilliantly recreating the agonies of the '60s. But then the book sags.<br /><br />The best scenes are the sparest, involving the trial's subtle legal footwork and snappy gang dialogue. But as secrets emerge their importance hardly seems worth the wait and no matter how finely drawn, it's difficult to warm up to Turow's angst-ridden characters. The ending seems tacked on, at best.	2004-07-25

Because her husband spends all his money on his mistress, Susanna accepts a commission, in his name, to copy in miniature a portrait of the King's beautiful and willful sister, Mary.<br /><br /> Well taught by her father, she completes the painting herself and delivers it the next evening. But her husband has meanwhile been murdered by a jealous husband, so the painting acquires the cachet of having been completed by a ghost - women and non-guild members being forbidden to paint.<br /><br /> Such court powers as Bishop Thomas Wolsey are not so gullible however and Susanna's talents soon bring her to his notice (after an interlude supporting herself and an extended household through &quot;naughty&quot; religious paintings).

Part of a group of Satan worshipers, her husband acquired an ancient manuscript much covetted by his co-conspirators and a faction of the Knights Templar.

Her memoir begins with an account of the immediate aftermath of her mother's death - the shrouded atmosphere of shock and grief, her maternal grandparents gentle consideration, her father's jarring insensitivity.<br /><br />It then jumps to 1990, as Mori, now an American, readies for departure from Green Bay, Wisconsin, where she teaches creative writing at the university. She has always been ambivalent about the country of her birth. When people ask her if she 'goes back,' she winces at their terminology and replies, ' 'I'd like to visit sometime, but there are other places I'd rather travel to if I had the money.' '<br /><br />The trip is a sabbatical, justified as research for her stories and poems. She will spend four weeks sightseeing. Letters to her family are only sent from the airport: 'I could never get on the plane this morning if I had to see my family first thing upon arrival.' The people she has arranged to meet on arrival are, instead, Americans living in Japan and it is an American family she stays with.<br /><br />Mori skims over her four weeks traveling. She remains an outsider, treated as a foreigner. The Japanese she meets don't even expect her to speak Japanese. The reader pictures her in her American running shoes and sports clothes, a contrast to the Japanese women in dresses and lipstick, aloof in her tourist personna. But Mori begins to think she would feel alien anyway, even if she had not become so determinedly American. Kobe, where she grew up, is a modern, westernized city with little of Japanese tradition about it. The private school she went to, run by westerners, encouraged her non-conformist creativity. Even Japanese art does not move her.<br /><br />Upon her return to Kobe she agonizes over calling her father. She longs to see her other relatives - the maternal grandmother, aunts and cousins her father had forbidden contact with at the age of 13. Her paternal aunt and cousin who gave her so much sympathy and love in the difficult years after her father remarried. But she is Japanese enough to know that she must call her father first otherwise the others will feel awkward.<br /><br />The narrative is haunted by the guilt and grief she still feels over her mother's suicide, the bitterness she carries for her father. Until we meet him, it's easy to feel impatient with Mori as well as sympathetic. Sure, he was a cold, even viscious parent - depriving her of family, threatening to take her out of the school she loved, beating her for speaking her mind, full of psychological cruelties - but she also provoked him with her rash impetuosity. Perhaps Mori should be an adult about it and reconcile. How can he hurt her now?<br /><br />Then we meet her father and his callous behavior is as breathtaking as it is sad. The stepmother really is like something out of Grimm's fairytales. In their presence Mori becomes like a child again but the years have taught her restraint. Reuniting with her other relatives, she finds it frustrating that Japanese language and custom makes emotional expression difficult. But in the end she also finds a delicacy, even a liberation, in this. Breathing room.<br /><br />Mori's language is simple, unadorned, affectingly graceful. Her narrative engages the emotions as it struggles with big questions of coming of age and coming to terms with anguish that will never be resolved. In the end she remains an alien in her birthplace and the reader understands a little more about what that means.nese art does not move her. <br /> <br />Upon her return to Kobe she agonizes over calling her father.

He succeeds in capturing the ants' eye view so vividly that readers may never consider these creatures beneath their notice again.<br /><br />Focusing primarily on colonies in the rain forest preserve of La Selva, Costa Rica, Hoyt reveals the daily habits and life cycles of leafcutters, swarm raiders, fire ants, aztecs, bullets, weavers and more, and relates these habits to ant species worldwide.<br /><br />Chemicals rule the ant world. Hoyt demonstrates this through specifics - the leaf cutter scout laying a pheromone trail to a new type of leaf, the foreign male swarm raider gaining access to a virgin queen by acquiring the scent of her colony, threatened workers releasing clouds of soldier-recruitment chemicals, ant slaves adoring their conquerors by aid of propaganda gas. He details the laboratory experiments of scientists confirming ant recognition and communication by scent.<br /><br />Taking us inside the leaf cutter colony, Hoyt explores its architecture and gardens. The leafcutters feed their fungus gardens with the leaf bits they harvest - the fungus cannot survive without ant propogation. He provides many fascinating examples of symbiosis, from the aphid cattle protected and milked, to beetles which acquire a colony's scent and live within it, to the cecropia tree which provides food and habitat in return for ant patrols which keep the fast growing tree free of other insects and encroaching greenery like strangler figs.<br /><br />One chapter explores several varieties of ant reproduction from the laying of the royal brood eggs to their care and feeding and finally the nuptial flights or, in the case of swarm raiders, colony division with workers adhering to a favored queen until only two factions are left.<br /><br />Hoyt returns to specific colonies again and again. He follows a virgin leafcutter queen from her first nearly disastrous flight in heavy rains to her long wait for a clear day (during which time other colonies are washed away and the leafcutters themselves forced to higher ground) to a second successful flight and the arduous task of beginning a new colony - each step tense with danger few of the royals survive.<br /><br />From these anecdotal foundations, Hoyt branches out to discuss theories of evolution, behavior and communication, the scientists who work at developing the theories, and examples from other ant colonies world wide.<br /><br />He devotes another chapter to war and slave making. As a cecropia tree grows to maturity (at eight inches a month) the aztec colonies war to the death until only one is left to reign supreme. Amazon ants do nothing well but fight. They fight to get slaves who do all the work of the colony, from feeding the individual amazons to caring for the brood. When a scientist removed the slaves from a colony the amazons deteriorated rapidly although they did begin, ineptly, to work for themselves.<br /><br />Hoyt's book is filled with these kinds of fascinating illustrations of behavior and biology. His ants'-eye-view or day-in-the-life approach takes years of ant research and personalizes it, making reader identification more complete. Less fascinating, ironically, is his up-close and personal view of the scientists themselves.<br /><br />Finally, most readers will close the book wishing that Hoyt would do for our northeast backyard ants what he's done for the rain forest species of Costa Rica.from her first nearly disastrous flight in heavy rains to her long wait for a clear day (during which time other colonies are washed away and the leafcutters themselves forced to higher ground) to a second successful flight and the arduous task of beginning a new colony - each step tense with danger few of the royals survive. <br /> <br />From these anecdotal foundations, Hoyt branches out to discuss theories of evolution, behavior and communication, the scientists who work at developing the theories, and examples from other ant colonies world wide. <br /> <br />He devotes another chapter to war and slave making.

Since she killed him in a public place in front of witnesses, there was no disputing the facts and the judge at her trial all but instructed the jury to find her guilty of first degree murder. Maria became the first woman to be sentenced to death in the new electric chair<br /><br /> .<br /><br /> Across the sea, Cora Slocumb, an American married to an Italian count, became swept up in Maria's plight, convinced the girl was a victim of discrimination. Almost 100 years later Idanna Pucci, Cora's great-grandaughter, was also captivated by the story and her antecedent's crusading role. Pucci's passion and thorough research meld in this colorful, vivid social history.<br /><br /> Leaving her hotel suite (a reproduction of Marie Antoinette's Versaille boudoir) for her first visit to the condemned Maria in the Tombs, Cora finds a bewildered girl with the demeanor of 'a young widow in mourning.' As Maria is shipped off to isolation in Sing Sing, Cora marshalls her considerable social forces for a publicity campaign and hires top notch lawyers to mount an appeal, winning Maria a new trial.<br /><br /> Even before Cora's arrival, media attention from New York's many newspapers was intense, embroiled in the controversy over the electric chair (a barber's invention, first used five years earlier), and the issue of executing a woman.<br /><br /> Pucci reviews the arguments leading to replacement of the gallows with the chair and describes in grisly detail the first electric execution, including dialogue and autopsy report.<br /><br /> She quotes liberally from newspapers concerning Maria's case. Heated exchanges all, these range from treacly to rabid and Pucci does not shrink from reprinting the letters from women calling for the death - preferably by murder - of all faithless seducers.<br /><br /> Maria's case becomes a cause for feminists who rail against all-male justice and condemn the patriarchal values which brand a woman &quot;ruined&quot; and drive her to desperate acts.<br /><br /> Meanwhile Maria's home on Sing Sing's death row is more spacious than any she's ever had. Her friends are gracious women who teach her English, reading and writing. Much of her food comes from the warden's own kitchen. A new trial is a mixed blessing.<br /><br /> Maria's second trial brings in phrenologists, psychologists, witnesses kept out of the first trial, and an exhaustive look at Maria's murky family history. It's chiefly interesting for illustrating the timelessness of lawyers' methods and the inexactitude of truth. For the outcome, there is little doubt.<br /><br /> Pucci's indefatigable search for detail brings the story to life - the record-breaking heat wave in the Italian neighborhood, the ubiquitous wax figures of Maria for sale in curio shops, the Mafia's shadowy precursor known as the Black Hand. She writes with an eye for visuals, filling in the whole picture. Pucci succeeds in turning what is a fairly ordinary crime into a portrait of an era and some of its most passionate controversies - crime and execution, prison conditions, women's rights, immigration, media coverage.<br /><br /> A particularly choice irony - one of Maria's hottest opponents, a newspaper editor, ended his days in prison for the murder of his wife.who rail against all-male justice and condemn the patriarchal values which brand a woman &quot;ruined&quot; and drive her to desperate acts. <br />  <br /> Meanwhile Maria's home on Sing Sing's death row is more spacious than any she's ever had.

Yet her story of a woman's flight from an abusive husband and a culture which sanctions brutality in the name of Islam, contains almost no evidence of female support for female victims.<br /><br /> The story opens with a prologue introducing psychologist and successful author of a book on battered women, Jenna Sorrel, a woman living a lie and in mortal fear of exposure. The prologue concludes with the realization of her terror as she is confronted with her real name - Amira Badir -abducted from her apartment, drugged and loaded onto a private jet.<br /><br /> The first chapter jumps back in time to the late 1960s. Amira, a child of privilege and wealth in the desert kingdom of Al-Remal, conspires with a peasant midwife to spirit the child of Amira's best friend, an adulteress, and Amira's brother (who is not exposed) out of the condemned woman's prison cell. This act is perhaps the only instance of women risking themselves for another woman. It does not, of course, save the mother, who is stoned to death the following day. 'To Amira's horror, the women were the fiercest executioners, screaming curses as they threw, then scurrying to grab another stone.'<br /><br /> With subterfuge and money, Amira's brother, Malik, is able to set himself and his child up abroad but Amira understands that, though she may be clothed in the finest fabrics, she will never have the option of choice. Not permitted to go to school, she is educated by a governess, a privilege since most girls receive no education at all.<br /><br /> And when she is caught dancing alone to her father's radio, he orders her into the veil, the abeyya, that all women must wear, even though she is still a child. Her mother pleads for her but when her husband insists she silences her daughter's tears, saying, 'Do you dare dispute your father?' Later her father takes a second, younger, wife. The other women in the house console Amira's mother, then scold her for her continuing depression, then condemn her to isolation.<br /><br /> The lives of the women revolve entirely around their men - even in their homes they are restricted to the 'women's country.' Not that life is without pleasure. Lavish sex-segregated entertainments are occasions for gossip and food and shedding the veil to show off foreign fashions to one another.<br /><br /> Amira's wedding to Ali, a royal prince, occasions lavish entertaining and from the beginning handsome Ali showers her with sumptuous presents of jewels and clothes. But much more wonderful to Amira are their foreign travels and Ali'sencouragement of her intellectual life. Abroad she does not wear the veil and is invited to social occasions which include men. And once she has a son she has more than almost any other woman in Al-Remal. Except for her husband's gambling and drinking, life is good.<br /><br /> But after the birth of her son, her husband seems to avoid her. His occasional sexual interest can only be satisfied by pain. There is, of course, no one she can discuss his increasing brutality with. And when he almost kills her the whole palace conspires to call it an accident - caused by her own willful disobedience. Escape seems impossible, death inevitable.<br /><br /> Kashoggi is not a scintillating writer but the drama and glamor of her story carries the reader along. Besides the plight of her heroine, the author threads several subplots and themes through the narrative - her brother's lifelong feud with Ali, and the secrets of his life with his daughter, Amira's involvement with battered women in America and her difficulties as a single mother, the loneliness of isolation from family.<br /><br /> And the setting is wonderfully exotic with a fully realized portrayal of the lives of the fabulously rich, spoiled and decadent oil royalty juxtaposed to the stifling luxury of their women behind their veils.xtaposed to the stifling luxury of their women behind their veils.	2004-07-24

His story opens with a prologue: Disobeying orders, crackerjack researcher Jack Amirault sets out in a storm to rescue daredevil environmental activist Robyn Cassidy, a mission which costs the life of his best friend and his sister's fiance, Brian.<br /><br />A year later, recovered from a breakdown but still haunted by guilt and regarded with unease by his fellow scientists, Jack is back. And so is Robyn Cassidy, determined to complete her trek and derail an international treaty carving up the continent. Reiss depicts Jack's reluctant, painful attraction to Robyn with steamy intensity, leaving the reader uncertain of her feelings and motives.<br /><br />With all the pieces in place, the plot line actually begins with the death of Jack's sister. Drunk after a party, she had inexplicably wandered outside and fallen into a bay inhabited by dangerous leopard seals. Jack, not convinced of an accident, finds evidence someone was with her. But with his own mental state suspect, he is forced to investigate alone. The suspense builds as accidents begin to plague the base. Things go missing, tempers fray, a howling storm cuts off all communications with the outside.<br /><br />The action never flags, culminating in a battle with the Antarctic elements and human evil, and Reiss doesn't neglect his characters either, pulling the reader into the mind of his protagonist and bringing to life the in-your-face frictions of an almost claustrophobic lack of privacy. Rivetting action-adventure.	2004-07-24

But the car-bombing of a Cuban journalist gives her job an uncomfortably personal dimension and perhaps it's that which compels her to look into an old missing-boy case for a distraught parent. Montero's digging uncovers a disturbing pattern of similar-looking missing boys, all thought to be runaways and given short shrift by the police.<br /><br />But Montero is taken off the story in order to conduct an interview with a difficult leader of the Cuban-American community. Half-Cuban herself and long feeling an empathy with her dead freedom-fighter father, Montero accepts the assignment unwillingly but finds Juan Carlos Reyes intriguing.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to her, Reyes knew her parents. He claims to have a diary of her father's somewhere in storage and promises to find it for her. Montero's mother suddenly refuses to speak to her and another old Cuban, a blustery fighter still trying to mount an invasion, tells a different story about the diary, tying it into the journalist's bombing murder.<br /><br />The two story lines unfold in parallel as a killer hurricane (which Montero ignores) summons strength for an attack on Miami. Buchanan brings it all together in a splintering, action-packed conclusion featuring mayhem, murder and gruesome revelation. A fast-paced story, determined, likable heroine and rich Miami setting.	2004-07-24

The story takes place around the events leading to the murder of Oliver Thirst, a charismatic, brutal and intelligent criminal.<br /><br /> James Knight, the narrator, is a bitter, lonely and highly successful barrister about to 'take silk,' or become a Queen's Counsel, at the time Thirst is murdered. He is suspected of the murder, having lost the love of his life, Daisy Smith, to Thirst. But what at first seems straightforward quickly develops kinks.<br /><br /> The cold, austere middle-class Knight reunites with Daisy (the other suspect in Thirst's murder) 'overjoyed that one man had died and I was a fool again.' While savoring a present Knight knows may be brief, he explores the past.<br /><br /> He and Daisy first meet as university students. Rather than the stiff-necked prig he appears, Knight is a former street-kid, an orphan from the slums fighting his way out. An American from the affluent middle class, Daisy is wild, fun-loving and sexually uninhibitted, with no comprehension of class rigidity in Britain. She stirs Knight to risk-taking bravado and - in the opposite direction - inspires him to strive even harder for material success in his rule-bound profession.<br /><br /> Thirst is a thief, one of Knight's first criminal clients. While grateful for his freedom, Thirst becomes obsessed with the lawyer, envying him his escape from the slums, despising his middle-class dullness. But, seeing only a bleak future of poverty and jail, he seeks Knight's help in rehabilitating himself.<br /><br /> Daisy, who's never met anyone like Thirst, is dazzled. He's clever, dangerous, physical and unpredictable where Knight is cautious, cerebral and dogged. Thirst, like a savage version of Knight, reins himself in only to burst out in reckless action. He also shows not the slightest interest in Daisy. ' 'I should have sat there and took it,' Thirst said as she slammed the door. He was as oblivious to Daisy's anger as he was to her. Her exit might have been a puff of air.'<br /><br /> Burdett depicts a strange world of people who 'help' Thirst, their altruistic veneer quickly stripped (by Thirst) to self-absorbed venal cravings. And when Thirst's efforts at the straight life fail, bitterness supplants ambition.<br /><br /> Meanwhile, as appearances grow ever more essential to the driven Knight, Daisy becomes more hedonistic and demanding until, just as the reader wonders why they tolerate each other, sparks ignite a moment of real passion.<br /><br /> Seen through his narrator's eyes, Burdett's London is claustrophobic, its people eyeing one another enviously from self-constructed boxes. His prose is taut, rich with scarcely alluded meaning, seething with stilted emotions. And when the explosion comes that drives the triangle apart, it seems, not anticlimactic, but pointlessly self-destructive. Circumstances supply the catalyst but injured pride makes it stick.<br /><br /> This is a highly accomplished and complex first novel, rife with human frailty, irony and mixed motivations. It succeeds in portraying characters who are as repugnant as they are passionate, yet keeps the reader interested in what happens to them right up to the last page.ed the door.

He writes of Irish country village life with humor and emotion; it's passions, dramas, small mindedness and, not least, its pervasive Catholicism.<br /><br /> Eddie Drannaghy is the &quot;Ram of God,&quot; a nickname mockingly bestowed on him 15 years previously when he was expelled from the seminary for impregnating a distant American relative. The American was an older woman who came to Ireland for the express purpose of conceiving a Drannaghy child. &quot;The poor fellow was like putty in her arms. He had no chance at all, Thomas,&quot; the village sergeant says, explaining the name to his assistant.<br /><br /> The book opens with Eddie, a strapping, handsome man of 35, being rudely awakened before sunrise by his drunken, shiftless younger twin brothers, ordering him to go and mow the high meadow of the family farm. As Eddie was meant to be a priest, his younger brothers have inherited the farm. Eddie, as usual, swallows his urge to bash their heads together in much the same way he buries his sorrow over his lost vocation in work and sublimates his natural sensuality in prayer and isolation.<br /><br /> But all that is about to change. The twins are marrying the two Cronane sisters, daughters of the village's most manipulative, single-minded and ambitious woman, Mollie Cronane, and will be turning the Ram out to fend for himself.<br /><br /> Eddie, despite his love for the land, is not despondent. He will pursue his seminary training in California, the only place far enough away to, perhaps, escape his nickname and reputation. And his growing interest in Patricia Cahalane, a gentle but strong-minded village teacher.<br /><br /> But, despite the planning, there is foreboding in the air. &quot;Mollie could not shake off a harrowing premonition of impending disaster. Everything was moving too smoothly.&quot;<br /><br /> As Mollie's plans begin to unravel, she goes to greater and greater lengths to pursue the prime land of the Drannaghy farm and add it to the Cronane holdings, using any means, be it violence, gossip or the cudgel of Catholicism.<br /><br /> Eddie Drannaghy, however, finds himself digging in his heels, refusing to give an inch, while never quite relinquishing his dream of a vocation or his daydreams of Patricia.<br /><br /> Keane's novel is populated with vivid, strongly drawn characters with numerous idiosyncracies. A number of subplots, some comic, some tragic, circle his main plot. There is high drama, low comedy and a thoughtful (but never didactic) exploration of prejudice, alcoholism and the use and misuse of religion.<br /><br /> Keane's writing is musical and witty and until the very end the reader is not quite sure how it will all come out. A delightful and absorbing and very Irish novel.e's plans begin to unravel, she goes to greater and greater lengths to pursue the prime land of the Drannaghy farm and add it to the Cronane holdings, using any means, be it violence, gossip or the cudgel of Catholicism. <br />  <br /> Eddie Drannaghy, however, finds himself digging in his heels, refusing to give an inch, while never quite relinquishing his dream of a vocation or his daydreams of Patricia. <br />  <br /> Keane's novel is populated with vivid, strongly drawn characters with numerous idiosyncracies.

This 1996 thriller opens with Jinx Kingsley, fashion photographer and only daughter of self-made millionaire Adam Kingsley, hospitalized and amnesiac after a horrific car accident. A suicide attempt is suspected, particularly since she was earlier found unconscious in her garage with the car running - apparently despondent because her fiance had absconded with her best friend.<br /><br />Only Jinx didn't like her fiance all that well. She was on the verge of breaking up with him herself, even claims she had done so, although the accident came after a week at her parents', making wedding plans. Then two bodies, a man and woman, are discovered. And police discover Jinx's first husand was murdered.<br /><br />Meanwhile Jinx's father has had her moved to a sanitarium where she is having a strong effect on her doctor, Alan Protheroe. By turns prickly, manipulative and vulnerable, Jinx becomes a suspect. As does her father, a forceful, unseen presence whose ruthlessness is legend.<br /><br />Walters keeps the sands of perception shifting. In common with the other characters, the reader's view of Jinx is ambiguous. Her memory returns (or seems to) in painful flashes as the police piece together a skewed picture of greed, betrayal and sexual obsession. An aura of mystery and menace shrouds Jinx's dysfunctional family, suspicion corroding the bonds between them. Walter's writing is literate, character driven and atmospheric, making comparisons - and favorable ones at that - with Ruth Rendell inevitable.	2004-07-24

But the Italian police seem determined to pin the crime on a pair of car thieves. Shifty, hired by the girl's father, does some investigating of his own with the help of an independent, eccentric and sexy Italian photographer.<br /><br />While the plot does not move at lightning speed and some readers may anticipate the resolution, Shifty is an entertaining and crafty protagonist and the Italian setting is well realized ? especially the food.	2004-07-23

The insurance company hires gem expert Mitch Laughton, husband of the fabulously wealthy, beautiful, and blind Maddie, to recover the jewels.<br /><br /> Mitch is a conflicted man. He revels in the intrigue and glamor of the 47th Street jewel trade and savors the adrenalin rush of the hunt. But he hates being beholden to the insurance companies he has despised since the day his jeweler father was robbed twice ? first by armed thieves, then by Columbia Insurance, which seized on fine print to avoid meeting policy terms.<br /><br /> In a &quot;Nick and Nora Charles&quot; (one of Mitch and Maddie's favorite entertainments) parallel, Browne involves Maddie in the hunt, which seems to be arousing more interest than usual ? even for $6 million. Maddie's blindness ? explained by no physical cause ? has given rise to uncanny perceptions and the relationship between them involves elements of voyeurism and vicarious excitement on both sides.<br /><br /> The caper itself is driven almost entirely by greed, giving rise to frenzied and darkly comic events which plunge headlong to an explosive ending which loses none of its excitement to a strong element of slapstick. A couple of noticeable thin spots in the plot are minor distractions, easily overcome by Browne's likable Mitch and Maddie.	2004-07-23

My loss. Rule's incisive, earthy prose captures the spirit and daily grind of small-town rural life with affection and humor, devoid of sentimentality.<br />Her characters are mostly natives who go back at least a couple of generations. They hunt, trap and fish, attend library committee and selectmen's meetings, bring up kids and fight with their spouses, usually about money. These are regular people. There are no drunkards, wife beaters or down-and-outs. When couples wrangle, you feel for both of them. Piercingly, you feel the anxiety of their children.<br />Many of Rule's characters strike an instant chord of recognition. The sour-tempered, know-it-all naysayer, Mort Wallace, who's got nothing better to do but waste everyone else's time cranking away at every public meeting. In \\"Yankee Curse\\" Mort absorbs the unspoken but imaginative curses of his neighbor Miranda Coffey who knits her way through a School District Meeting: \\"May your neighbors steal from your wood pile, Mort Wallace.\\" \\"May a rat die between the studs of your bedroom wall.\\"  Or the grouchy lakefront neighbor who guards her turf by making her newcomer neighbors miserable in \\"The Best Revenge.\\" There's more than one in every town.<br />Some stories are delightfully lighthearted. \\"Lindy Lowe at Bat,\\" one of the few stories told in the third person, is a warmhearted tale of Little League baseball, the adult undercurrents on the sidelines, and a girl's determination. Dryly humorous, \\"The Widow and the Trapper,\\" narrated by the flinty trapper, follows the surprising journey of a blossoming relationship, set against a background of trout, loons and human coexistence with nature.<br />But the most gripping stories are those dealing with family tensions and troubles. And the most gripping of those are the ones narrated by children. The troubles of their parents loom large and scary. Within the framework of rescuing a small cat from a tall tree in \\"Three,\\" Rule evokes a time of grief, calamity, and anxiety for the future, culminating in a moment when a child puts herself in danger because bad things come in three and the thought of \\"the third bad thing\\" happening to her mother is unbearable.<br />Adults are often scary to the children who love and depend upon them. In \\"Walking the Trapline,\\" the father is a man (like many of the men in these stories) who does what he wants and abides no backtalk from anyone. Though the narrator's younger brother is expected to learn about the trapline from age 9, less is expected of her. \\"He allowed me to come along when the weather was fine and the dishes done.\\" The story, following a long, cold day on the trapline, focuses on the shifting family dynamics as the children band together for comfort and companionship, but defect into small betrayals in competition for their father's approval.<br />A day's fishing with her crusty grandfather is fraught with anxiety for the narrator of \\"Peach Baby Food Sandwiches\\" who awaits lunchtime with dread. Though the old man had consulted her about the peach baby food sandwich, his diatribe concerning her usual diet made it clear the consultation was rhetorical only. \\"I said no more on the subject but watched in quiet horror as he laid out sandwich makings on the scrubbed-pine table.\\"  The story is laugh-out-loud funny, but her fear and dread of an adult's explosive anger is palpable.<br />Rule's stories are beautifully crafted. Her situations are recognizable, often ordinary. A man whose family has been living in a cellar hole for four years buys a boat, \\"though he knew Phoebe had the money spent, though he knew she'd pop a gasket when she found out (maybe even because he knew).\\" A woman who decides to run for selectman, against her husband's wishes. A woman coping with a miscarriageby walking in the woods, in the footsteps of her dead great-grandmother.<br />The core of the characters' inner lives, expectations and background emerge seamlessly from the setting and situation. Each story is a small gem, a complete world in microcosm. These are classic stories, full of New England flavor, wit and subtlety.by walking in the woods, in the footsteps of her dead great-grandmother.<br />The core of the characters' inner lives, expectations and background emerge seamlessly from the setting and situation.

The narrator, Henry Pendergast, child star, watching reruns of himself on tape, looks back to a time before.<br />'My parents, in that other life, were teachers.'  Substitute teachers, that is, unable to get permanent jobs. His father, Peter, dreamed of having real time to devote to his novel; his mother, Audrey, churned out TV scripts, routinely rejected.  In the evenings they all watched a black-and-white TV dubbed 'the Gillingham,' for the repairman whose frequent visits were essential to its operation. Until one day Mr. Gillingham put the picture tube back in upside down and it operated perfectly for so many years that shameless journalists, spying through windows, consumed lots of ink speculating on why Henry Pendergast had an upside down TV set in his room.<br />But I digress and get ahead of myself. As in many cautionary tales, the Pendergasts get their heart's desire. Audrey sells a children?s show, 'The Rumpus Room,' which becomes a smash hit, with her as the host, Miss Mary, and Henry as twin, silent, illustrative insects, Bee Good and Bee Bad. Peter goes on teaching for a while, but the money is pointless and the principle vague. Adamantly refusing to have anything to do with the show -- except watch it -- Peter labors on his novel, refusing to discuss it, much less let anyone see it.<br />Their lives disrupted by aggressive journalists, the Pendergasts move to a security-conscious condominium and Henry attends an uppercrust school. The condo was a compromise that pleased no one. Peter wanted to remain in their old neighborhood; Audrey wanted a secluded suburban estate. As their interests diverge, such wrangles increase. Peter digs in his heels, but Audrey, gentle, earnest, well meaning and focused, is a force of nature.<br />Audrey takes her work seriously. She regards TV as a powerful instrument for good or evil. 'Good TV would keep books from becoming obsolete, she said, but my father would say it was good books that would keep books from becoming obsolete.'<br />Eventually Henry gets a little old for the twin bees. Audrey develops a new show about the young Philo Farnsworth, the inventor of television. The network likes it, with some minor changes that remove it from the realm of truth or history, and the show becomes a cult hit, with Henry in the title role.<br />But if Audrey has success, her husband has all the humor - a quality that any fan of Johnston's knows is essential for a balanced life. Audrey, poor thing, has no sense of humor at all (I did wonder, from time to time, how they ever got together in the first place). Even at its most lighthearted, Peter?s humor has an edge, but as the rift grows wider, Peter's wit becomes a weapon. Audrey gets the sentiment if not the sense, but Henry's understanding inevitably becomes complicitous.<br />Henry has inherited his father's humor and his mother's desire for family harmony and happiness, a warring combination. He spends a lot of time in his darkened room watching the Gillingham. His understanding of his parents' motives has undergone the dissection of reflection and in this mood he feels compassion for both, as well as a more pitiless understanding.<br />His own life has been shaped by celebrity. Harassed by journalists, he is virtually a prisoner, with no friends and no activities outside of acting and watching television. He is also becoming a teenager and begins to envision himself as something more than Mom's protege, as something more than Philo Farnsworth, nerd hero. The story builds to a cataclysm of good intentions, rebellion and rejection.<br />Johnston's ('The Colony of Unrequited Dreams,' 'The Divine Ryans') funny, poignant book is a story of growing up as an icon of popular culture, who is simultaneously a lonely unselfconfident boy. It's an exploration of one man coping with his wife?s runaway success. It's a look at the early upswell of television, with its naivety and burgeoning cynicism and it's a running commentary (mostly from Peter) on mass popular culture. It's a sharp and moving novel.is wife?s runaway success.

And, as time went on, &quot;one for family and one for nation.&quot;<br />With the growing city of Annapolis at its hub, the story traces the rise of America. At the heart of the family history is their city house, Stafford's Fine Folly, a mansion that was built and lost and won and lost again through the fortunes, weaknesses and quarrels of generations of Staffords.<br />As the book opens, Jack Stafford, 78, a liberal journalist, is nearing the conclusion of his fictionalized but faithful family history. &quot;But when he came to the grayest area of them all - the things the Staffords had done, and failed to do, in the war that ended certainty for good - he couldn't finish.&quot;<br />Jack sends sections of his book to a distant cousin, Susan Browne, an independent filmmaker doing a piece on the Stafford family. As she interviews Jack's brother, Tom, a Navy admiral, and corresponds with Jack and meets their Navy nephew, son of the brother who died in Vietnam, she begins to realize there is unfinished business in the Stafford family. Vietnam has left scars.<br />Between short sections in which Susan probes for the murky secret that divides the brothers, confronts an oddly bitter family connection named Oliver Parrish, and observes with growing emotion the struggle over who gets Stafford's Fine Folly, the reader is treated to Jack's novel.<br />Jack's family history is driven and punctuated by the country's wars and conflicts. Martin is at his best writing action. The sea battles of America's first tiny fleet are captivating, the sense of personal danger immediate, the smell of gunpowder and the slam of cannon balls vivid.<br />Back home the first of the fallings out between the Staffords and the Loyalist Parrishes concerns the loss of a house and a broken promise. A Capulet and Montague relationship right out of Romeo and Juliet seems assured but never quite materializes, mostly because the Staffords aren't hateful enough. Or else they're just plain oblivious.<br />The families' rivalry continues through the Civil War when the Staffords themselves are divided. Slave-owning but patriotic Annapolis Academy veterans and friends to presidents from Washington on, all but one of the Stafford men remain Union. Martin doesn't ignore the politics of the times but the battles themselves command most of his attention.<br />Much of the suspense derives from Martin's riveting descriptions of fear and exhiliration, noise and blood and lightning-quick changes of fortune. And part of the suspense is due to never knowing who will survive. Many Staffords die in battle and Martin seldom gives warning.<br />After the Civil War, while the book remains a thoroughly enjoyable read, the politics grow more complicated and the family becomes harder to keep track of, simply because there are now so many to remember. The present, and the family secret, exerts a stronger pull.<br />Martin does not disappoint. In a few short chapters he brings to life the ugliness of Vietnam from the innermost circles of power to the intimate gore in the jungle. In a two-pronged conclusion, he delivers a shocking blow and a catharsis strong enough to heal the family.<br />A rousing and suspenseful saga.eet are captivating, the sense of personal danger immediate, the smell of gunpowder and the slam of cannon balls vivid.<br />Back home the first of the fallings out between the Staffords and the Loyalist Parrishes concerns the loss of a house and a broken promise.

The present, and the family secret, exerts a stronger pull.<br />Martin does not disappoint. In a few short chapters he brings to life the ugliness of Vietnam from the innermost circles of power to the intimate gore in the jungle. In a two-pronged conclusion, he delivers a shocking blow and a catharsis strong enough to heal the family.<br />A rousing and suspenseful saga.	2004-07-12

When his wife hinted at a trip to Europe, his terse response was, &quot;I've been.&quot; He was resolutely a mid-western American, a man who changed his name to Abe Trillin, and at the end of his life exhibitted the only prejudice his son ever observed - an impatience with &quot;refugees,&quot; by which he meant people who clung to the language and customs of their country of origin.<br />He was a stubborn man, like most of his family, described by his wife as &quot;Mules!&quot; &quot;I sometimes imagined my father as swearing off things just to keep in practice,&quot; his son observes.<br />He never swore although he collected colorful curses - &quot;May you have an injury that's not covered by workman's compensation.&quot; His honesty was absolute - when a child turned 12 he paid full price at the movies even if he looked 9.<br />He was unassuming. When Calvin was in high school, his father opened a restaurant and took to wearing yellow ties. &quot;He said something about how most people don't stand out from the crowd, and how it helped to have a sort of signature.&quot; This seemed embarrasing to his adolescent son. &quot;What was so great about having someone say, 'Oh, yes, Abe Trillin - the guy with the yellow ties'?&quot; But years later at Abe's funeral, he's touched by how many friends asked for a yellow tie as a remembrance.<br />His father was not a talker. One of his favorite jokes concerned a Jewish actor who finally gets a real part playing a Jewish father. The actor asks his father why he seems disappointed. &quot; 'Of course I'm proud of you son,' &quot; the father says, &quot; 'But we were hoping you'd get a speaking part.' &quot;<br />Calvin writes, &quot;What strikes me as odd now is how much my father managed to get across without those heart-to-hearts that I've read about fathers and sons having.&quot; Without it being talked about, Calvin knew his father was ambitious for him. &quot;It was a given in our family that my father was a grocer so that I wouldn't have to be.&quot;<br />One of their biggest arguments concerned Calvin's joining the Boy Scouts. He hated Boy Scouts but Abe regarded it as essential to American boyhood, a necessary step on the way to Yale, Trillin senior's university of choice, an idea he'd gotten from a novel read as a boy - Stover At Yale.<br /><br />Calvin went to Yale. Yale launched him out of Kansas City, never to return (also as Abe expected). The grocer's son would never be a grocer.<br />In one (somewhat unrealistically) ingenuous chapter Trillin goes to a dinner of prominent writers and realizes that they all went to Ivy League schools as he did. Was there a connection? (Puleeeeze). &quot;For the first time, I realized that my father's vision of how all of this was supposed to work out might not have been as simplistic as I had always assumed.&quot;<br />This slim volume is deeply captivating and affecting. His father emerges as a man of indomitable will, will so strong he imposed it simply by being. He was a man who could afford to be easy going and funny, all the while adhering to a plan of grand ambition which embraced cross country automobile trips to broaden the horizons of his children and simple pronouncements: &quot;You might as well be a mensch.&quot; Much of the book's power lies in the author's recognition of himself as his father's ambition fulfilled - a successful American who  does his best to &quot;be a mensch,&quot; a real human being.&quot;What strikes me as odd now is how much my father managed to get across without those heart-to-hearts that I've read about fathers and sons having.&quot; Without it being talked about, Calvin knew his father was ambitious for him. &quot;It was a given in our family that my father was a grocer so that I wouldn't have to be.&quot;<br />One of their biggest arguments concerned Calvin's joining the Boy Scouts.

Terry (\\"Blood Work\\"), a former FBI agent and heart-transplant patient, died of a heart attack while on his boat, an apparently natural death.<br />But his wife calls Harry when she discovers that powdered shark cartilage was substituted for Terry's essential heart medication. Terry had never stopped working murder cases and Harry, looking for his killer, soon homes in on one file in particular - six missing men - which has the hallmarks of a serial killing.<br />Meanwhile FBI agent Rachel Walling (\\"The Poet\\"), assigned to the boonies since the debacle of that serial killer case, gets a long-dreaded call. Robert Backus, the Poet killer and former FBI bigwig - he was her and Terry McCaleb's old mentor at the FBI - has resurfaced, in the form of a GPS unit sent to Rachel at her old office. Following the GPS coordinates, the FBI is turning up bodies in the desert.<br />Harry and the FBI collide when Harry, piecing together the clues in Terry's file, happens on the FBI's desert dig. Naturally the FBI has no intention of sharing, but Harry connects with Rachel, and warily, egos and agendas clashing, they pool resources. The action picks up as they track Backus to a desert brothel enclave, a grisly murder scene, and his next victim.<br />Harry's narration drives most of the story, but point of view shifts to Rachel and Backus, keeping us informed from all angles. Subplots include Harry's growing relationship with his 5-year-old daughter, a tentative romance with Rachel, and a possible return to the LAPD.<br />The investigation is smart and forensically intriguing, and the characters are prickly and complex, while Backus is truly scary, in an underplayed fashion. Connelly, a master, remains at the top of his game.	2004-07-05

Suicides. And one extra man. Not suicide.<br />London Detective Stella Mooney sorts out the bizarre scene soon enough, but finding the killer of the extra man, small time crook and purveyor of grisly \\"murderabilia,\\" Jimmy Stone, leads her into the shadowy underworld of sex slavery and criminal turf wars.<br />A persistent and attractive journalist who seems to know more about the case than he should complicates Stella's murky personal life as he draws her into the bleak and dangerous corners of London inhabited by Eastern European girls forced into hopeless lives of prostitution.<br />Point of view shifts periodically among various secondary characters from cops and doomed petty criminals to George, Stella's live-in lover, and Ivo Peric, a vicious Serbian assassin (and Jimmy Stone's killer though we don't yet know why) growing bored waiting for his assignment. Each scene's focus is intense and local, and the panorama of views gives the reader a full and complex picture of the crime, the politics and the people.<br />The prose is spare and pointed and often poetic, the characters expertly fleshed and flawed, the pace sharply punctuated. A gritty procedural, sure to be enjoyed by fans of Ian Rankin and any who enjoy urban noir.	2004-07-05

It takes place over the course of one endless, terrifying day in the life of 2-year-old Ursula Wong's parents, and encompasses some of the thousands of years and generations that went into the making of that child.<br />Annie and Justin Wong are on a rare outing with their daughter in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Annie, a librarian, has developed an interest in her ancestors and they are exploring the area where her Finnish great-grandfather lived before his death in a 1926 mine explosion. They stop for a picnic and spot a deer in the trees. Ursula goes after it. It's a charmed moment: a lovely June day, a delighted child, happy, relaxed parents.<br />\\"She gives them a sign in mime: Watch me. Ursula's every gesture seems meant for the comedic stage. She is a natural. She tiptoes toward the treeline. The deer disappears deeper into the forest, as silent as breath. Ursula puts on a burst of speed, silent herself, looking back at Justin and Annie, steps into the trees, and disappears from sight. The only sound is an astonished tiny intake of breath from Ursula as she goes down, like a penny into the slot of a bank, disappeared, gone.\\"<br />As Justin races off to find help and Annie cannot yet take in what we already know - that Ursula has fallen down an unmapped ventilation shaft - the narrative veers, following Annie's anguished thought: \\"So many generations, back into history and then prehistory, all concentrated into this one little girl.\\"<br />At first Hill drops back only a generation.  We meet Justin's warm-hearted mother, Mindy Ji, who never stopped loving Joe Cimmer, the musician who left them both when Justin was little older than Ursula. We glimpse Annie's father, an abusive drunk who probably killed her mother while Annie was in the hospital after a hit and run accident that left her legs permanently damaged. We've already met the drunk who hit Annie, though we don't know that yet - Hill, the omnipresent, omniscient authorial voice, parcels out her knowledge, creating a pattern of pieces that merge into a seamless whole at the end.<br />Hill drops back further to visit key ancestors Justin and Annie will never be (consciously) aware of, in a series of precisely named chapters that alternate with the ongoing scene around the mineshaft.<br />\\"The Alchemist's Last Concubine,\\" introduces Qin Lao, a third-century BC alchemist who, in a happy accident of fate and generosity, has his first and only child in his 79th year. A few centuries later \\"The Caravan-Master's Lieutenant,\\" a deaf man with a captivating gift for storytelling, is smitten by a deaf Finnish girl, who has thus far been indulged by a doting father in her desire not to marry.<br />\\"A Wastrel Killed by a Snail,\\" Chen Bing, fathers a daughter in the California gold fields iin 1851 before he meets his freakish - and timely end. For, had he lived, he would have sexually abused his daughter, causing her eventually to run from him into the path of a runaway horse and be killed at the age of ten, \\"stopping the lineage of Ursula Wong - who would of course never have come to be - then and there.\\"<br />Hill's authorial voice often interrupts these brief, but fully realized life histories to make connections across the centuries, or share information unknowable to the character concerned. This authorial omniscience reveals the patterns visible only at a distance and emphasizes the essential role of each haphazard, accidental life in the intricate and exacting fabric of history.<br />Hill's language is rich, whimsical and visual.

Bob Brier, consulting everything he could find on the subject, realized how little was really known and set out to create a modern mummy to answer some of the practical questions. He took a year just to assemble the right bronze and copper and obsidian knives, to collect the natron from the salt fields north of Cairo, to replicate the embalmer's table. As Brier expected, the actual procedure (accompanied by photos) answered many questions, from the practicality of the obsidian knife to the Egyptians' fairly limited knowledge of anatomy.<br />Brier's attention-getting piece leads on to other mummy research, revealing the prevalence of parasitic disease and the shorter, more brutal lives of the laboring classes as opposed to the wealthy classes. Modern carbon dating and scanning techniques revealed the busy history of a damaged mummy, which had been unwrapped, rewrapped and held together with wooden dowels. But each emerging answer - three dates spanning hundreds of years, for instance - gave rise to new questions.<br />The book's second section explores Egyptian origins, including a lively piece by Renee Friedman on the busy industrial facility (beer brewing, pottery production) at the early, Predynastic site of Hierakonpolis, where mummification was just beginning and the average worker was well-nourished but dead before 35.<br />The third section includes six articles on the \\"Marvels of Giza,\\" including the origins and purpose of the Sphinx, and several examinations of the workers who built the pyramids. An article on dating the pyramids includes surprisingly fascinating detail on the organic materials used in the mortar and how carbon dating is done.<br />Part four explores other sites - \\"The Other Pyramids\\" in ancient Nubia, \\"Hunting Alexander's Tomb,\\" and the gem mines so valuable to Rome.<br />\\"The Saga of Cleopatra's Needles,\\" by Bob Brier, comes in the fifth and final section and describes several daring feats of looting, the most arduous being the American acquisition of an obelisk for Central Park. And Brier has another interesting piece on the gathering of scientists in Napoleon's ill-fated invasion of Egypt. These scientists - chemists, botanists, mathematicians, naturalists, engineers and more - in addition to their many sketches and collections, unearthed the Rosetta Stone in 1799, making possible the eventual translation of the Egyptian hieroglyphs.<br />Sidebars throughout focus in on findings of particular interest - diseases found in studies of skeletons, the burial of a woman who may have been a witch doctor, the secrets yielded up by teeth, to mention a few. Black and white photographs or diagrams illustrate many of the undated articles and there's a useful timeline and index. Appendices include short bios of the authors and suggested further readings listed for each article.<br />Geared for the general reader, most of the articles are written with the juicier details up front and just enough science to remind you that archaeology is a matter of patience and care and excavating a ruin takes a great deal of time - more than some modern projects, like sewers, are willing to allow. The writing ranges from skilled and enthusiastic to pedantic, but the wooden academicians are definitely in the minority.

An odd hostility from local police and Navy officials only makes her more assertive and determined.<br />The diver is a journalist Scarpetta liked and the autopsy - colorfully described, as always - reveals murder. Scarpetta quickly finds herself and, inadvertently, her brilliant, difficult niece (a recent FBI graduate and computer wonder), in the center of a maelstrom of menace which soon includes her protective friend, police captain Pete Marino and her erstwhile, married lover, FBI brass Wesley Benton.<br />Meanwhile the journalist's apartment turns up an arsenal and a book - the &quot;bible&quot; of a right wing cult, full of recipes for murder and terrorism. Then another murder occurs, even closer to Scarpetta, and conspiracy and intimidation loom larger.<br />Cornwell's writing is vivid and Scarpetta is a prickly, sharp-edged heroine who exudes authority and keeps her private fears hidden. The story will keep you turning pages as Cornwell ratchets up the suspense but the explosive ending is jarringly sudden - never giving the reader much chance to put a human face on evil or comprehend its motives.<br />Still, this is Cornwell in her prime.	2004-06-24

Destined to become a nun, there she remained until age 15. Days before she was to take her final vows, she escaped, taking only needle, thread, scissors and a few coins.<br />Despite her previously sheltered existence, de Erauso plunged into her new, wordly life as a man with unusual gusto, as described in her memoir, Lieutenant Nun.<br />Written some 20 years after her flight, when she correctly deemed confession of her ruse and her still virginal state might save her from the rope or an even more ignominious fate, the memoir describes at breathtaking pace a life of soldiering, banditry and dueling in the wilds of Peru and Chile.<br />While this slim volume is packed with action, there is little self-reflection or explanation. Transforming her convent undergarments to boy's clothing, she quickly obtains a position with a scholar, runs off when he apparently exhibits too much attention in the boy, and becomes a page at the king's Court.<br />But when her father (who does not recognize her) appears at court, distraught over his daughter's disappearance, she slips away again. After two comfortable years as a page elsewhere, she quits, &quot;for no more reason than it suited me,&quot; returns to her hometown, sees her mother in church (who also fails to recognize her) and leaves, drifting until she finds work as a cabin boy on her uncle's galleon.<br />While convent education may have fitted her for work as a page, nothing had prepared her for shipboard life. &quot;The work was new to me and I had a hard time at first,&quot; is all she has to say about that.<br /><br />Finding favor with her uncle, who knows her only as another Basque, she jumps ship in the New World, stealing 500 of his pesos and makes her way aboard merchant ships, beginning a pattern of prospering until some slight to her pride causes her to retaliate with knife or sword, necessitating flight or, if captured, jail time, church sanctuaries and scantily described negotiations among law officers, churchmen and the aggrieved parties.<br />Needing money she signs on as a soldier, serves with an older brother she had never met, and endures &quot;three years of misery&quot; fighting Indians &quot;with everything but discomfort in short supply&quot; .<br />Following a disastrous duel in which she kills her brother, de Erauso's career takes a downswing into banditry and the life of a gambler with brawling and knife fights involving several brushes with the gallows.<br />Although wounded in battle and once &quot;stripped&quot; for the rack, de Erauso never explains how she conceals her gender. Her attitude seems entirely that of the colonial male. One murderous knife fight, for instance, is justified when &quot;my companion, with plenty of people around to hear it, told me I lied like a cuckold.&quot;<br />Her well-timed confession to a sympathetic bishop not only saved her from prosecution, but made her a celebrity. She was later granted dispensation by the Pope to live as a man and she finished her life as a merchant in Mexico.<br />De Erauso's delivery is deadpan and devoid of introspection. There is no purple prose, quite the opposite. While the pace is headlong, it raises more questions than it answers.

It is her story Charlie tells, after her death in an asylum fire, a fire she may herself have set.<br />Lily's story begins before her birth, when her mother, Ede, meets an itinerant piano man. &quot;The sight of him was like a match being struck,&quot; Ede recalls, beginning the incendiary allusions that punctuate the novel and haunt Lily's private world.<br />The piano man dies before he can wed Ede but eight years later she marries his brother, Frederick, an ambitious piano manufacturer whose one unorthodoxy is falling in love with Ede. He accepts Lily but without knowing of her affliction - severe epileptic seizures.<br />He is as repelled by Lily's epilepsy as Ede is frightened by it and becomes, for Lily, the demon of her childhood, the focus of rebellion and despair. But even though Frederick locks her in the attic whenever company is expected and finally banishes her to a school for difficult girls, Lily blossoms.<br />A beautiful, vibrant young woman, &quot;hampered&quot; not &quot;handicapped&quot; (the word makes her indignant) by her illness, she goes to England with a friend and it's there that Charlie is conceived. He knows only that the event occurred in January 1910 and he examines Lily's photos intently, imagining fathers, and questions her friends, adding pieces to the life she has already related to him.<br />Lily and Charlie return to Toronto before World War I but Frederick, outraged by Charlie's birth, refuses to see them. They begin a round of living in expensive hotels, going to dances where Charlie is always her partner, and seeing movies. For Charlie the life is a series of enchantments and nightmares as his mother's demons pursue her and drag him along. A child, he learns to watch over his mother although his dependency often renders him helpless.<br />When tragedy pushes Lily over the edge into madness, Charlie is liberated into normalcy - school, friends his own age, relatives. &quot;It made a decent life - secure in ways I had never known.&quot; Lily emerges from the asylum but never permanently.<br />Charlie's voice is wistful, awed, admiring, impatient, petulant and wise. But it is Lily who colors and shapes the story, taking flight from her son's narration. Findley's writing is deeply atmosheric, enveloping the reader in the Canada of 1890 to 1920. He invites an intimacy with his characters (many not even touched on here) that creates a bond without violating their essential human secrecy.<br />A rewarding novel, which will linger in the mind.pursue her and drag him along.

625976:US	52774618	R3U0TDZRAHDK5G	089577819X	431630210	Through Indian Eyes: The Untold Story of Native American Peoples	Books	4	46	49	N	N	Our greatest shame	This oversized and lavishly illustrated volume is a readable and sweeping history of the Indian societies that were disrupted and in many cases, destroyed, by the coming of the white man.<br />The book begins with an overview of the earliest Americans, those who crossed the land bridge between Siberia and Alaska during the last Ice Age, 12,000 to 30,000 years ago, &quot;possibly much earlier,&quot; and, most likely, were responsible for the final extinction of the large mammals - sabre tooth tigers, mammoths, camels, giant beaver.<br />Using archaeological finds - temple mounds, burial sights, artifacts - many of them pictured, the editors construct details of long-gone cultures throughout the arctic and North America, from specialized hunters of the sub-arctic to the intriguing Anasazi, who built the elaborate cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde and Chaco Canyon.<br />The narrative then moves on to better documented pre-Columbian tribes. Organized by geographic region, the book describes the tribes- some nomadic, some agricultural -  giving examples of the foods they ate, the creation legends that were passed down through the generations, trading and warring customs, and technology. Many of these people welcomed the Europeans and the new trading goods they brought, but all learned that &quot;prolonged contact with whites eventually brought terrible disruption.&quot;<br />Pivotal points in the struggle between natives and newcomers are depicted in brutal detail, from General John Sullivan's &quot;scorched earth&quot; policy against the Seneca during the American Revolution to Tecumsah's short-lived success in winning back lost territory during the War of 1812, to the Custer disaster at Little Bighorn in 1876 and the reprisals that followed.<br />The last section deals with modern Indians, &quot;The Reservation Years&quot; (universal citizenship was not granted until 1924), the racism faced by returning veterans after World War I and II, white encroachment on desirable reservation lands, the changing policy of federal Indian bureaus and the rise of Indian militancy culminating in 1973 when Indian protesters occupied Wounded Knee for two months and won national attention to their cause.<br />The book ends on an upbeat note, with a discussion of casino gambling that focuses on the money raised for the tribes and skims over the controversies, mentioning factional &quot;bitter controversies,&quot; without going into detail.<br />While this approach holds true for many issues and incidents raised in the book, there is much here that most Americans know little about, from details of the various battles and callous government policies, to the legends, religious beliefs, medicines, foods and cultural attitudes of various tribes.<br />The volume's design is vivid and highly attractive. Photographs and paintings depict battles, trading scenes, ceremonies and landscapes as well as artifacts like pottery, clothing designs, amulets and sculpture. Although there are four to five illustrations on every double page, the illustrations complement rather than overwhelm the text which is readable throughout and filled with day-to-day details which capture the imagination.<br />While the subtitle, &quot;The Untold Story,&quot; is not strictly accurate (much of this material appears in numerous other books) &quot;Through Indian Eyes&quot; is an attractive and sympathetic addition to a body of history too long ignored.ervation lands, the changing policy of federal Indian bureaus and the rise of Indian militancy culminating in 1973 when Indian protesters occupied Wounded Knee for two months and won national attention to their cause.<br />The book ends on an upbeat note, with a discussion of casino gambling that focuses on the money raised for the tribes and skims over the controversies, mentioning factional &quot;bitter controversies,&quot; without going into detail.<br />While this approach holds true for many issues and incidents raised in the book, there is much here that most Americans know little about, from details of the various battles and callous government policies, to the legends, religious beliefs, medicines, foods and cultural attitudes of various tribes.<br />The volume's design is vivid and highly attractive.

Trouble is, she doesn't write like McBain. The view-shifting is sometimes awkward and Montero's insight, curiosity, impulsiveness and personal problems are parceled out to a crowd.<br />Buchanan knows plots, though. Squad boss K.C. Riley sidelines a promising serial-killer investigation to re-examine an accidental burning death because of her own grief over the similar death of her faithless former lover (also Montero's former lover). A couple of active and increasingly desperate killers dodge a team of smart cops in an accelerating plot of twists and turns that never quite wriggles clear of the writing problems.	2004-06-14

It's not the first - or the last - work of this particular killer and the trail leads into the big-money world of pop-psychology and government-subsidized real estate.<br />Much of Kellerman's popularity rests on compulsive readability. It's an elusive quality, relying on character and plot development more than action. But this time Kellerman seems to be going through the motions, putting his characters through their paces on a paint-by-numbers set, and that engaging readability fizzles out early.	2004-06-14

Undaunted, McKnight delves into old family feuds, and an unsolved murder, while trying to decipher unhappy Natalie's mixed signals and keep from getting himself killed by man or nature.<br />As always the relentless pounding of the Michigan winter is a formidable, riveting character in itself, and McKnight's struggle with his own demons and his small, but growing circle of versatile friends continues to evolve. A top-notch series, which gets better with every book.	2004-06-14

He chooses &quot;Cordelia's dilemma&quot; - her refusal to compete with her sisters in making loud protestations of love for their father, King Lear - as an analogy for &quot;publication bias&quot; - the reluctance of journals to publish boring negative results in favor of more interesting successful experiments. A positive result in a study of AIDS or cancer treatments wins headlines while later failures to duplicate those results are read by few. And most negative results never see publication at all. &quot;Lear cannot conceptualize the proposition that Cordelia's silence might signify her greater love - that nothing can be the biggest something.&quot;<br />In this collection, Gould divides his essays into eight sections. &quot;Heaven and Earth&quot; includes his marvelous experience of the effect of a solar eclipse on the citizens of New York City, and in &quot;Literature and Science,&quot; he ruminates on the moral lesson of Frankenstein and Hollywood's subversion of it.<br />&quot;Origin, Stability, and Extinction&quot; argues that the Cambrian explosion is even more the &quot;key event&quot; in the history of multicellular animals than previously believed, &quot;Stability&quot; includes &quot;Cordelia's Dilemma,&quot; &quot;Extinction&quot; includes the title essay on Darwin's view that &quot;all observation must be for or against some view.&quot;<br /> &quot;Writing About Snails&quot; delves into women's Victorian writings (I'm reminded of the value of negative results), &quot;The Glory of Museums&quot; explores &quot;Dinomania&quot; and &quot;The Disparate Faces of Eugenics&quot; revisits the hilarious arguments of an eminent scientist who argued that cancer causes smoking.<br />&quot;Evolutionary Theory, Evolutionary Stories,&quot; explores the arguments of Creationism and the origin of evolutionary science's best one liner (in answer to a question on the nature of the Creator) &quot;an inordinate fondness for beetles,&quot; and &quot;Linnaeus and Darwin's Grandfather&quot; uses the whimsical observation of the &quot;curious conjunction&quot; of Linnaeus and Gustav III on a Swedish banknote to explore the scientist's classification theories (still used today) and his adherence to a religious Creationism.<br />Certain themes recur in these essays. Gould is a staunch evolutionist and defends Darwin's theories vigorously, even when pointing out mistakes and misconceptions. He takes Creationism seriously - as a threat to scientific reasoning. His interest in natural history extends to the history of human thinking about nature and science.<br />His essays are beautifully crafted, full of literary allusions, anecdotes and turns of wit but always to the point. He loves tracking down the precise source and context of oft-used quotes as much as he enjoys tracing the origin of flatworms, and manages to arouse his reader's interest in both. He is not a writer of wasted words.

A list of salads-by-category follows: classic international (Indian Curried Lentil) rustic (Mushroom and Arugula), exotic (Madagascar Date-Nut), creative (Herbed Tofu), pasta (Mint Flavored Fusilli), fish (Salmon and Avocado), Italian (Artichoke Heart), French (Salade au Roquefort), fruit (Persimmon and Greens), and Saints' (St. Cecile Cauliflower Salad).<br />A charming book, sprinkled with aphorisms from the likes of M.F.K. Fisher and Helen Nearing, it adheres to vegetarian, monastic principles (which do not exclude seafood or dairy), and indulges in a few exceptions, like a delicious caviar dressing.<br />Fresh ingredients are emphasized, of course, but Brother Victor is not above using canned fava beans and jarred artichoke hearts in his Etruscan Salad or a jar of taramasalata (Greek dip made with carp roe) in a scrumptious egg salad. He offers serving suggestions, including temperature, presentation and course, and ends with a chapter on flavored vinegars, oils and dressings. Attractive and eclectic.	2004-06-08

Cartwright, chef at the Kennebunkport establishment, shares 140 of his recipes and Sully waxes ecstatic over the charms of the Inn and its location. The lush photographs (lots of food close-ups) are stunning.<br />For those who have eaten or stayed at the Inn, this is a gorgeous keepsake. Ambitious, experienced cooks with time to make a batch of lobster bisque in advance of their Poached Eggs on Lobster Hash may enjoy the challenge. For the rest of us, it's a mouthwatering read-only.<br />Each seasonal chapter opens with menus.

But mostly this is a book to wow the reader and inspire a visit to the Inn for the real thing. Which is probably the point.	2004-06-08

Numerous lists offer alternatives to high-fat foods (i.e., whole grain bread instead of croissant, Canadian bacon instead of regular, angelfood cake instead of donut. They explain the vital differences between oils and how to read labels in supermarkets,  choose cuts of meat, find high-fiber foods.<br />The second half consists of recipes from breakfast through dessert, each introduced with tips for preparation, variations and storage and including, of course, nutrition information.

With the fourth volume in that series appearing this summer (\\"Ringworld's Children\\"), fans may want to refresh their memories - it's been almost ten years.<br />The series is set in an artificial habitat built as a 600-million-mile ring around a sun-type star, with orbiting sunshades to provide day and night and thousand-mile-high rim walls to prevent the atmosphere from spilling out. The builders of this place vanished before human history on Earth began.<br />Inhabiting this Ring are numerous human species with different skills, diets and requirements, who mostly live in peace due to lack of competition for food and habitat. Their technology is minimal and some species are non-sentient.<br />The third book in the series, \\"Ringworld Throne,\\" takes place after a cataclysmic threat to the Ring has been averted by Earth spaceman Louis Wu (and friends), at the expense of the lives of many inhabitants.<br />The Hindmost, an alien watcher exiled from his own world, calls Wu's attention to a new threat to the Ringworld. Vampires are proliferating at an alarming rate, threatening other species. Vampires are non-sentient hominids who exude a sexual allure to attract prey - humans. This scent is almost irresistible and whole tribes can be wiped out in the course of a few nights.<br />As Wu investigates, he discovers someone is destroying incoming spacecraft, and Protectors - metamorphosed beings of immense power dedicated entirely to preserving their own bloodlines - are dangerously active on the rim.<br />Wu's adventures are narrated in tandem with those of the vampire-fighting Machine People, a technological species who travel the Ring, selling and trading. Niven keeps the pages turning and his development of differing human species is particularly absorbing. A highly enjoyable story.	2004-06-04

Chris Neilson and his wife Matty and their toddler son have just moved there from a California suburb when a relative of Matty's turns up in his red Lamborghini and, after a few deft maneuvers, leaves Chris for dead and takes over his life.<br />From the beginning, Jones manages an off-kilter tension, an unpredictability generated by the Springer character, which grows helter skelter as the novel progresses.<br />Essentially a chase, with a number of outlandish aspects, the novel only flags when Jones pauses to develop character. A former screenwriter, Jones' forte is action and his best character is the larger-than-life villain. Springer is a sadist who enjoys himself, a highly trained CIA killing machine who increases in invincibility as Chris' efforts become more desperate. Suspend your disbelief and you're in for a high-speed roller-coaster of a ride.	2004-06-02

Rather than distill and interpret from his primary sources, Rae has let the people speak for themselves in diaries, letters, newspaper accounts, and book excerpts. The book is divided into eleven chapters and &quot;follows the general progression of life from the cradle to the grave.&quot;<br />Beginning with &quot;Arrivals,&quot; Rae documents the immigrant experience from Indian legends to slaves and indentured servants. An aristocratic young mother escapes from Revolutionary France, and Minnesota appeals for settlers. &quot;Physicians who expect to live by the practice of their profession will find Minnesota a poor field for a location.&quot;<br />Captain John Smith concludes his account of the Jamestown Massacre, &quot;Thus you have heard the particulars...which...some say will be good for the Plantation, because now we have just cause to destroy them [Indians] by all meanes possible.&quot;<br />&quot;Upbringing&quot; includes prescriptions for good behavior and proper schooling as well as W.E.B. Du Bois' touching account of teaching rural black children and a young Crow Indian learning to &quot;count coup.&quot;<br />&quot;Pairing&quot; offers anecdotes from farmers, city dandies, pioneers, Puritans and slaves as well as the British actress Fanny Kemble's wrenching account of her efforts to preserve a slave family from being sold apart, and Benjamin Franklin's amusing story of a failed courtship. Also featured are punishments for adulterers and divorce practices among the Indians.<br />In &quot;Working&quot; an isolated fur trapper immobilized by a broken ankle awaits rescue with harrowing visits from winter, hostile Indians and hungry wolves. Mark Twain describes an Illinois farmer's wife whose day begins before dawn and who concludes, &quot;I have never had a vacation, but if I should be allowed one I should surely be pleased to spend it in an art gallery.&quot;<br />&quot;Housing&quot; offers advice from &quot;The American Frugal Housewife,&quot; a captive woman's description of moving camp among the Sioux, a cowboy's hilarious attempts to winter in a dug-out, and the prodigious diarist George Temptleton Strong's account of a New York fire.<br />&quot;Eating&quot; explores high living and low, from starving in Jamestown and Jack London's experience of prison food, to Ward McAllister's tips on serving dinner to the cream of New York society. Children's games, parties, Custer hunting buffalo and Reverend Increase Mather's views on dancing paint a picture of &quot;Playing&quot; before the advent of television.<br />The variety of American &quot;Praying&quot; takes in Cotton Mather's justification of the Salem witch trials, practices among slaves, spirit possession among Shakers and at revival meetings, and the various prejudices felt by one religion for another.<br />&quot;Erring&quot; encompasses gun duels in the wild west, sodomy among the Pilgrims, an execution for theft during the California gold rush carried out by the jury, and the visceral brutality of the Ku Klux Klan.<br />In &quot;Ailing,&quot; a sick German woman in 1862 was advised by her doctor to speak English as &quot;German was a very heavy language for one as weak as she was.

After so many years, his pursuers have caught up with him, in search of revenge and the treasure Ford absconded with at the end of World War II. By morning, several people are dead, Ford is missing and Chief Superintendent McGarr's fishing holiday is over.<br />With the help of his familiar Murder Squad team, his feisty, scholarly wife, Noreen, and the efficient mainland computers, McGarr begins to put together the pieces. Of less help are the closed-mouth islanders, many of whom despise &quot;foreigners,&quot; whether they be mainland police or longtime benefactors like Ford, known to be behind the anonymous Clare Trust.<br />McGarr soon realizes that the killers did not achieve their objective - the treasure - and will return, losing themselves in the annual reunion of several thousand of the world's O'Malleys.<br />Gill is at his best here; his literary wit in top form, his characters gregarious and sharp, and the suspense heightened by harsh, windswept terrain and sudden, violent spring storms.	2004-06-02

Their investigation leads them into the labyrinths of Chinatown's politics and culture, secret gangs and personal vendettas.<br />And finally, on a sympathy mission for the Engs combined with a chance to learn what really happened to Susan's parents, they travel to Hong Kong and beyond, to the mysteries - and deadly perils - of interior China. Meanwhile the new assistant D.A. is also having misgivings about the case and begins conducting an investigation of his own which seems to point to corruption in the ranks.<br />As the investigations converge, the switchbacks grow ever more dangerous for the two protagonists and Chinatown intrigue is a dizzying intricacy of menacing puzzles.<br />Friedman's attempt to explore characterization sometimes leads to bothersome inconsistencies or repetitions but his big story is throughly engrossing and his prose is crisp and to the point.	2004-06-02

Catherwood and her new husband Gabriel, emigrate from England and settle in upstate New York in 1676.<br />&quot;The whole world was fresh and curious to Catherwood, and there were times that she felt herself the newest of all created things, shiny as a just-minted coin.&quot;<br />Not that Youmans romanticizes. The work of clearing, building and planting, the hardships of winter, and the uncertainties and dangers of pioneering are finely, if sparely, detailed, particularly in Catherwood's letters home. But Catherwood has led a charmed life and knows it.<br />Born a street urchin, she was serendipitously adopted into landed gentry. Deeply cherished by her adoptive family, she was reluctant to journey into the unknown with a stranger. But she finds love in her arranged marriage, beauty in the wild abundance of her new land. Her healthy pregnancy is a joy, although fear lurks close to the surface.<br />Inquiring after a newly delivered relative: &quot; 'Mary - how goes it with Mary?' Cath asked. She slid her arm around Fan's waist. Fan was the little girl-wife in reserve, and if Mary died, Fan would be made stepmother and wife.&quot;<br />The first section ends with the birth of Elisabeth, Catherwood's daughter, and the heart of the novel opens when Elisabeth is 15 months old. &quot;A moment of forgetfulness and the world fell awry, dropped out of truth.&quot; On a cold spring day, Catherwood realizes she is lost in the woods.<br />Of the three things Gabriel has told her always to carry in the woods she has two, knife and firestones. The compass she neglected to take, trusting her knowledge of the path.<br />Initially she refuses to believe in the disaster while ticking off in her head the adequacy of the things she is carrying in case they need to spend a night in the woods. &quot; 'No,' Cath said. She must find the ax-marked trees.&quot;<br />But after a week, &quot;The fear was always there, hands around her neck, for Elisabeth needed clean clothes, cooked food, a warm bed at night.&quot; Grateful for a childhood acquaintance with plants, she forages for food, terrified that Elisabeth will put something poisonous in her mouth or, worse, Cath will poison herself, leaving her child hungry and defenseless.<br />The baby is blithely unaware. Youmans does a masterful job of presenting the child's experience - her curiosity and enjoyment of the adventure, her fretfulness, exuberance and carelessness of danger.<br />As the weeks pass, Catherwood learns to fashion birchbark pots, build shelter from branches, skin rodents with her precious steel knife. &quot;Still, the grasp of fear never left her throat...&quot;<br />Moments of quiet tenderness with the child on a sunny morning or by a warm fire in the evening or the fierce gratitude of happening upon meat that she can kill are brief respites from the arduous trek and Catherwood's ever-present anxiety for their lives.<br />Youmans' prose is vivid, sometimes spare, sometimes rich with the teeming life and wildness of the forest. She leads the reader deep into the intensity of solitude and motherhood, involving us in Catherwood's moment-to-moment existence, her surges of hope, frustration and the ever-present fear.<br />This is a powerful tale of human resourcefulness, love and despair, set in an indelibly rendered world, now vanished forever.ek, &quot;The fear was always there, hands around her neck, for Elisabeth needed clean clothes, cooked food, a warm bed at night.&quot; Grateful for a childhood acquaintance with plants, she forages for food, terrified that Elisabeth will put something poisonous in her mouth or, worse, Cath will poison herself, leaving her child hungry and defenseless.<br />The baby is blithely unaware.

But, as Sarah is angrily absorbing this outrage, she hears a murder plot through a trick of acoustics in the wall. And then a child, one of the new tenants, discovers Sarah can communicate in blinks.<br />The plot devices are a bit dated - relying on numerous hidden eavesdroppers and architectural devices - but Carlon's spare writing skillfully communicates the frustration and terror of Sarah's condition and the dilemmas she faces about communication, given her and her hearer's limitations. And along the way, she also learns something more about life.	2004-06-02

Ratings are abysmal and a new producer has been sent to shake things up.<br />Brandon, 38, middle-class, ambitious and plagued by hair that never does quite what he wants, knows that St. Paul may be the height of his career. Or it may be the end if Dexter Rayburn, the new producer, decides the station will benefit by his firing.<br />Dexter is high-energy demonic. He gets in Brandon's face with jive talk, rap music and vulgar imagery. Brandon isn't &quot;black&quot; enough, he says. In the interests of ratings, he demands Brandon go live in the ghetto for a while, broadcast his show from there.<br />Queasy but excited too - it just might work - Brandon agrees, although he's never spent a day in the inner city and regards its inhabitants as ignorant and baffling.

Chief among the ghetto inhabitants is Nita, young single mother of three, manager of the apartment building, store-clerk, night student. Beneath Nita's tough exterior is a tough interior - and some tired loneliness.

Bing is a recent graduate of and new teacher at the Hangzhou Teacher's School, and Yan is helping her prepare for college entrance exams. With this longed-for goal in sight, she risks everything for their dangerous and unfulfilling relationship.<br />Haunted by a mystery about her birth which surfaces in bloody nightmares, Bing has felt alienated all her life. Flashbacks portray a lonely childhood during the Cultural Revolution, a virtual slave to a harsh but beautiful mother who was once &quot;criticized&quot; herself.<br />At 15 she escaped her family to plant rice in a rural reeducation village. The Party used her to denounce an inoffensive landowner's son, and Bing, shamed, worked even harder, rising long before sun-up to read.<br />The gripping beauty of the novel lies in Wang's depictions of physical labor and the Kafkaesque whirlpool of political danger. So vivid are Wang's images that the reader can feel the yoke of the coal cart on Bing's shoulders, the fear aroused by her paternal grandmother's mysterious rage, the cold dread of the interrogation, the slippery texture of rice gruel and fatty pork.<br />Walking in the rice fields: &quot;My feet sank deep into the ooze of the mud and the droppings of cows, pigs, chickens.

While &quot;The Woman And The Ape&quot; has the pace of a thriller, it couldn't be more different.<br />A love story, a comic satire and a fable about the relations between human civilization and the rest of the world, &quot;The Woman And The Ape&quot; centers on two characters who could scarcely appear more hopeless and helpless.<br />Erasmus, the ape, opens the book with a daring escape from hardened animal smugglers, only to be captured by scientists after numerous run-ins with the city of London prove almost fatal. He is secretly installed at the home of rich and distinguished animal behaviorist, Adam Burden, who sees in this possible new species the fruition of his most ambitious dreams.<br />There, Erasmus arouses a mild curiosity and pity in the book's other main character, Adam's 30-year-old Danish wife, Madelene, an alcoholic beauty with a lousy self-image.<br />&quot;Each morning Madelene was resurrected.&quot; At her mirror, &quot;she did the one thing she knew herself to be truly good at: she re-created the myth which said that Madelene looks gorgeous.&quot; Her next task is to replenish her carafe of ethyl alcohol so she can float through her day being gorgeous and amiable and walling off the terrors of daily life.<br />In so doing she comes across the ape in his new quarters. &quot;With some effort Madelene succeeded in coming up with a sketchy log of the past two days. The ape had arrived the day before  yesterday. She had spent yesterday in bed with her carafe and that dreadful migraine. The bulk of the setup in front of her must have been erected in less than a day.&quot;<br />In her second encounter, &quot;Madelene was overcome by a prickling sense of unease, as though she had sat on an anthill.&quot; Certain small truths home in on her along with the ape's &quot;incalculable&quot; gaze. These she quickly drowns, but something in her has been awakened.<br />She embarks on her own mission to discover what she can about the ape and her husband's activities, launching &quot;new&quot; selves (well fueled with alcohol) to accomplish the necessary daring subterfuges.<br />Hoeg keeps up a madcap energy, as humorous and cheering as it is biting and outlandish. Madelene takes on people she would ordinarily be too frightened to speak to, and in the process of amassing facts about the &quot;impossible&quot; existence of Erasmus, begins to free herself.<br />This she cannot actually do until she &quot;saw her own weakness, saw it clearly, saw herself as the ape had seen her and then she gave up....She gave up drinking.&quot;<br />She organizes a daring, hilarious plan of escape for herself and Erasmus and the novel veers off in another direction - that of love story. This developing love is as lucid and erotic as the fog of alcohol was erratic and prickly.<br />By the end Erasmus has come fully into his own, a larger-than-life ape with a mission and a big surprise for the human race.<br />Hoeg's writing is pure pleasure - vivid and playful, earnest and rich, mocking and touching.

Madelene takes on people she would ordinarily be too frightened to speak to, and in the process of amassing facts about the &quot;impossible&quot; existence of Erasmus, begins to free herself.<br />This she cannot actually do until she &quot;saw her own weakness, saw it clearly, saw herself as the ape had seen her and then she gave up....She gave up drinking.&quot;<br />She organizes a daring, hilarious plan of escape for herself and Erasmus and the novel veers off in another direction - that of love story. This developing love is as lucid and erotic as the fog of alcohol was erratic and prickly.<br />By the end Erasmus has come fully into his own, a larger-than-life ape with a mission and a big surprise for the human race.<br />Hoeg's writing is pure pleasure - vivid and playful, earnest and rich, mocking and touching. His condemnation of animal exploitation is hardly new but his presentation is totally refreshing.	2004-06-02

He lives with his mother and a gaggle of relatives in a house built and now haunted by a Japanese colonel. His father, mostly absent in Vietnam, is a blond disruption with a strange smell.<br />Insu identifies with his Korean roots although the large American presence is a given in his world, a gateway to riches to be exploited by any means at hand. He grows up wild, instructed by his alcoholic uncle's tales of demons and goblins, dabbling in black market goods and thievery, running the brutal streets with his friends.<br />His father's world of America glitters from afar, while its Korean manifestations - school, Christianity, and the contemptuous talk of soldiers, are bewildering and unpleasant.<br />Insu's story is turbulent, often jarring. His aunt commits suicide when spurned by her American lover, a boy he dislikes is killed in a street accident, his first friend at the American School drowns suspiciously.<br />Insu takes it all in stride, as children do. It is his world. But the reader sees it as an artificial and utterly venal confluence of exploitations - from both sides. This portrait is the strength of Fenkl's book, a poignant, wrenching and beautifully written novel.	2004-06-02

From female circumcision to divorce, from finances to education, gender roles, work, and friends, women discuss every aspect of their lives - seemingly freely.<br /><br />Two themes repeat through this largely agricultural world - women's work begins before dawn and ends long after dark and most women feel they have enough children - whatever that number may be.<br />This is a fascinating, captivating and beautiful volume, to be read, not just browsed.	2004-06-02

Alone again and incapable of expressing his emotions, Rebus lives for his job and sleeps in his chair - after more than a few pints and shots.<br />Still haunted by the surreal death of the would-be kidnappers, Rebus is confronted with another spectacular suicide, this one for the edification of an ambitious councilman. Doggedly pursuing tenuous connections, Rebus begins to unravel an elaborate scheme with roots in the prisons and slums and the highest offices in Scotland. And more people die.<br />With a complex and absorbing plot, shot through with blasts of icy Edinburgh wind and Rebus' bleak determination, this is another powerful and absorbing winner from a strong, talented writer.	2004-06-02

You ain't never the same when the air hits your brain....It was built for performance, not for easy servicing.<br />&quot;Rule number two: The only minor operation is one that someone else is doing.<br />&quot;Rule number three. If the patient isn't dead, you can always make him worse if you try hard enough.<br />&quot;Rule four: One look at the patient is better than a thousand phone calls from a nurse.<br />&quot;Rule five: Operating on the wrong patient or doing the wrong side of the body makes for a very bad day.&quot;<br />These pretty much sum up the tone and gravity of Vertosick's rivetting, harrowing and touching book. The son of a steel worker, Vertosick came to neurosurgery almost by accident. His memoir focuses primarily on the years of training from medical student through chief resident.<br />Vertosick's first anecdote, from his first operating room observation, will have readers grabbing their throats - literally - in shock. His mentor, Gary (who becomes a familiar chain smoking, fast-talking irreverent character) picks up a drill. Vertosick asks how it knows when to stop before plunging through the skull into the brain and is told it has an automatic clutch mechanism. Only the mechanism fails. Those who continue reading once their heart rates return to normal will be hooked.<br />In an arrogant profession, Vertosick is an appealing narrator. He can also write. His descriptions of hospital routine and crisis, pecking orders and interdisciplinary rivalries are frenetic and often hilarious.<br /><br />But his portraits of individual patients bring them to poignant life and often death. There are happy endings - the young, virile accident victim whose progressive paralysis indicated spinal damage, but who was saved by a risky diagnosis and fast surgery. But there are many others  - the retarded man whose aneurysm became something worse through a slip of the knife,or  the pregnant woman with a brain tumor who refused to abort her baby and therefore refused treatment in medicine's litigous atmosphere.<br />But Vertosick's memoir is not just a string of anecdotes. It's a portrait of his profession and its effect on a doctor's psyche. He first tasted &quot;the intoxicant of power&quot; after botching a routine procedure on a veteran and being thanked for it. &quot;On the street, this would not be called a medical procedure but assault and battery - with witnesses, no less!&quot;<br />There's the exhiliration of saving life. One of those was a man pronounced brain dead and delivered as an organ donor. Thanks to Vertosick and an observant junior, the man walked out of the hospital a week later and lived another two years.<br />While Vertosick's subject is inherently fascinating, it's the author's ability to convey his exuberance, fear, anguish and joy that leave the reader hoping he'll trade scalpel for word processor again.se aneurysm became something worse through a slip of the knife,or  the pregnant woman with a brain tumor who refused to abort her baby and therefore refused treatment in medicine's litigous atmosphere.<br />But Vertosick's memoir is not just a string of anecdotes.

Maurice Benson, a self-described bird-watcher or &quot;twitcher,&quot; redolent of alcohol and tobacco, wonders if &quot;there might be a story there.&quot;<br />Sylvester Wykes, a newly divorced publisher, recoils at the suggestion. He had received an impression of vulnerability, even despair, from his brief glimpse of Julia and when the train pulls into the station, contrives to prevent Maurice from pursuing her.<br />For Sylvester it seems the incident will end there, but for his occasional musings. But Maurice is determined, partly to revenge himself on &quot;toffee-nosed&quot; Sylvester, to follow it up. &quot;He had what he liked to think of as a flair,&quot; developed during brief stints with the police and a private detective. &quot;Neither career had remotely satisfied those who employed him and in consequence had given him small job satisfaction.&quot;<br />Wesley's dry and occasionally biting humor serves to underscore Julia's terrible loneliness and isolation. She has, we learn, just lost her child and her ex-husband in a car crash. &quot;Julia's mother raised her voice to a shout. 'It was all her fault, that accident; everyone knows Giles was a terrible driver.' &quot;<br />The story meanders leisurely among the characters as Julia picks up the pieces of her life and Sylvester forcefully puts his own house in order, hiring a cleaner through the notice board in Patel's grocery. They communicate, sight unseen, through notes, until the reader begins to wonder if they will ever meet. The cleaner, naturally, is Julia, finding solace in the resurrection of Sylvester's garden.<br />Meanwhile, the twitcher, growing more odious and bloated with every appearance, stalks her, his petty curiosity turning mean and sinister.<br />Wesley populates Julia's neighborhood with a human comedy of venal sorts, none of them as horrible as Julia's monster of a mother, but all thick skinned to a fault.<br />Discussing a party in Julia's apartment building one neighbor asks another if Julia is invited.<br />&quot;Angie said, 'No one with any nous invites a woman whose partner's a drunk.'<br />&quot; 'But he's dead,' said Janet.<br />&quot;Angie said, 'They came once in the early days. He was belligerent, bopped someone on the nose, nobody we cared about luckily, but Peter said we mustn't ask them again.

She also finds herself under scrutiny for the murder - she had quarreled publicly with Chase and had been seen coming from her building around the time of the murder. Then another attorney, a friend, is murdered and Debra finds the body. As police suspicion deepens, Debra begins to get threats from the killer.<br />Meanwhile, her client's victim is an Orthodox Jewish girl, a member of Debra's community, and there is strong pressure on her to drop the case. And, in fear for her life, Debra begins an investigation of her own.<br />Krich's approach is thoughtful, literate and absorbing. She depicts the difficulties of being an Orthodox Jew in a high-powered job, the close knit comforts of the community and the application of Jewish philosophy to moral decisions.<br />And she doesn't neglect suspense. Her heroine is resourceful but not foolhardy in the face of mortal danger and the solution of the mystery (in a smashing climax) is a total surprise - although the reader will be a step or two ahead of Debra in the last few pages.	2004-06-01

These gems of human observation and wit  center on a small community's reaction to an event which affects each member.<br />&quot;The Choir&quot; involves the Cathedral of Aldminster and its boys' choir and school. The dean of the Cathedral, Hugh Cavendish, is a man who buries his disappointment with his four outrageous children and his insensitive wife in single-minded devotion to the architecture and history of the old cathedral and the buildings which encompass its close.<br />The headmaster of the school, Alexander Troy, is currently preoccupied with his independent wife's latest defection. Frank Ashworth, a councilman and a principled socialist of the old school who bemoans the cathedral close's elitist aspect, hatches a scheme to acquire the headmaster's beautiful old house for the benefit of the people of Aldminster.<br />The dean, appalled at the prospect of losing a treasured old building to the council, soon receives another blow - extensive and immediate repairs are needed to the cathedral's roof - and the amount would just about be covered by the sale of the headmaster's house.<br />But the dean sees a way out of his dilemma, a way which will also consolidate his power. He proposes to Frank that the council take over the choir, pointing out that access to it would then become more egalitarian. In return for Frank's support he will consider selling the house, having, of course, no intention of doing any such thing.<br />Meanwhile Frank's grandson, 11-year-old Henry, is the newest and most talented chorister. Henry's father is off making money in Saudi Arabia and his mother, Sally, is ready to end her unhappy marriage. Through Henry's talents Sally meets the organist and choirmaster, the divorced and mercurial Leo Beckford, who falls madly in love with her. And Ianthe, the dean's daughter, who owns a partial interest in a fly-by-night recording company, is suffering agonies of unrequited love for Leo. Then there's the sad and directionless former chorister who haunts his school seeking the sense of purpose he once found there - and finds again in the ensuing fight over the choir.<br />Lines are quickly drawn. The council (as expected) spurns the choir as expensive and irrelevant and the dean dooms it to disband. The headmaster digs in his heels, Ianthe sees her chance to make points with Leo, Sally cuts off contact with her father-in-law, Frank, and Frank, torn between his principles and his personal loyalties, sees all he has worked for in his life slipping away in political backbiting.<br />The ripples of the fight continue to expand as emotions rise, bringing several marriages and friendships to crisis even as the community cleaves together in ways that inspire and exhilirate the whole.<br />Trollope has a gift for seamless development. Although there's a lot going on, the novel never seems overcrowded or confused. And ever simmering under the common public effort are the myriad individual maneuverings and ambitions, all of which contributes to a delightful, absorbing story.<br />Those who have seen PBS' dramatization of The Choir should not bypass the novel - its emotions and motives are far more subtle, complex and comprehensible than the teleplay version and its characters much more appealing.nies of unrequited love for Leo.

He finds it in Tommy Tarpon, a lugubrious Indian, the last of his tribe. Murray's fishing ineptitude breaches Tommy's sullen defenses and Murray's natural salesmanship soon has Tommy agreeing to claim his tribal island heritage and turn it into a casino resort.<br />Unfortunately their plan requires the aid of a sleazy state senator with mob connections and schemes of his own. But the preliminaries go smoothly enough and Murray embarks on the project closest to his heart - winning back his original wife, the one he dumped for the trophy, wife number two.<br />Franny now has her own perfectly good life, but Murray's hapless schmoozing convinces her to visit and meet Tommy. She arrives as the double- and triple-crossings begin and gets spectacularly caught in the crossfire, forcing Murray to stage his most daring and fantastic scheme ever - the rescue of the woman he loves.<br />'Tropical Depression' is a breeze of a read with wholly likable and entertaining characters, ear-perfect dialogue and a zany plot which loses nothing to the Supreme Court decision rejecting Indian casinos in Florida.	2004-06-01

Walter Demming, the bus driver, a psychologically scarred Vietnam vet who has spent the last 20 years guarding his life from involvement, keeps his charges' spirits up with the continuing adventures of a vulture named Jacksonville, counterbalancing the daily harangues from the cult's leader.<br />Demming and the children, ranging in age from 6 to 12, are imprisoned in a derelict bus buried underground in an old barn. Worms and bugs tunnel in the earth packed against the bus' windows. One of their two bare light bulbs has just burned out. The children play tic-tac-toe on the windows and pogs in the aisles between the seats.<br />Fed twice a day on cereal and milk, they fantasize about food. They argue, snap at one another, burst into tears. One of the children suffers from severe asthma. The cult refuses medication and his attacks terrify everyone.<br />Without melodrama or mush, Walker develops a group dynamic that relies on breathing life into the individual children and especially Demming, a reluctant hero who's scared and lost and determined to do his best.<br />Walker alternates between scenes in the bus and efforts on the outside. The police, the FBI and the hostage negotiator have gotten nowhere with Mordecai and don't know where the children are being held. Cates, herself viscerally intimidated by her one meeting with the cult leader, delves into the odd circumstances of his birth and his harsh childhood, which clearly loom large in his religious landscape.<br /><br />Cates' detective work, which involves bending more than a few of her own personal and professional rules, is absorbing and ingenious without being unbelievable. As Mordecai's pathology unfolds, we also get a portrait of Demming from his home and his two close friends.<br />Cates herself is a prickly but appealing character. A loner with a grown daughter, she's in love with her ex-husband (one of the cops) and driven but ambivalent about her job.<br />The suspense is nail-biting, but what makes this novel a stand-out is Demming and the kids. Walker gets the atmosphere of timeless boredom and fear just right, the children's voices ring true and Demming's character, revealed in accumulating flashes throughout the narrative, is utterly believable.<br />A scary thriller with a smashing explosive finish.ly loom large in his religious landscape.<BR>  <BR>Cates' detective work, which involves bending more than a few of her own personal and professional rules, is absorbing and ingenious without being unbelievable.

A small town motherless Irish girl, just out of school and newly unemployed, she's trapped in a round of housekeeping and caring for her hundred-year-old great-grandmother. The old lady is famous as the widow of a hero, killed in the &quot;Troubles&quot; a month after their wedding.<br />An ordinary girl, with no particular talents or ambitions, Felicia's keenest awareness is of her lack of prospects. Not that she plans to do anything about it. But then a young man, older than herself and back on a visit from his job in England, flatters her with his ardent attentions. And leaves her pregnant, having &quot;forgotten&quot; to give her his address in the muddle of leavetaking.<br />After several months without a word (but he doesn't have her address either), Felicia takes her great-grandmother's savings and runs off to England, looking for the factory where he told her he worked.<br />The first night, she wakes, and thinks of returning. &quot;If she goes back now she'll wake up again in that bedroom. There'll be another dawn breaking on the same despair, the weariness of getting up when the bell chimes six, another day beginning. The cramped stairs will again be cleaned on Tuesdays, the old woman's sheets cleaned at the weekend. If she goes back now her father's eyes will still accuse, her brothers will threaten revenge. There will be Connie Jo's regret that she married into a family anticipating a shameful birth. There will be interested glances, or hard looks, on the street....Only being together, only their love, can bring redemption: she knows that perfectly.&quot;<br />Mr. Hilditch, a fat catering manager, is among those she asks for directions. He discerns her predicament immediately and is attracted to her friendless, anonymous condition. Surreptitiously he follows her, awaiting his chance to befriend her and add her to his &quot;Memory Lane.&quot;<br />The narrative moves between them. Hilditch plots, remembers happy times with previous girls he &quot;helped,&quot; and finds Felicia's Johnny with ease, keeping the information to himself. He steals Felicia's money to hasten the day she will be utterly dependent upon his largesse.<br />Felicia, innocent but wary, angers Hilditch by escaping him. She falls in with a religious cult but, when it's time to move on, discovers the disappearance of her money. Trevor underscores the terror of homelessness with subtle portraits of the people she meets, their offhand kindness a contrast to the circus of grubbiness, insanity and drug addiction. Sights and sounds loom larger than life. Hilditch becomes a reasonable alternative.<br />Felicia is not a heroic character. Hilditch, pathetic, self-satisfied and crafty, with flashes of viciousness, is the more interesting.

Ostensibly a detective story, the plot is seamlessly integrated with character, place and time - so perfectly that myriad details will only be recognized as clues in delighted retrospect.<br />But the plot recedes behind its  protagonist, Jonathan Blair. Blair himself has little interest in his mission - the search for a missing curate - forced upon him by his patron, Bishop Hannay, worldly churchman, aristocrat and owner of the Wigan coal mines.<br />Blair's drive is his desire to return to Africa and his Anglo-African daughter. A mining engineer hired to map gold country in Africa, Blair was yanked in disgrace after he appropriated church funds to pay his workers. Expedition leaders were expected to make up a shortfall of funds from their own pockets but Blair, no gentleman, possesses no private income.<br />An American by upbringing, Blair was born in Wigan. His father was unknown and his mother was buried at sea on the journey to America, leaving him in the care of an American mining engineer named Blair. A small child at the time, Blair recalls no other name.<br />Bishop Hannay has promised him Africa in return for finding John Maypole, the zealous curate who was engaged to Hannay's ascerbic daughter Charlotte. Not until he arrives in Wigan does Blair discover that Maypole disappeared on the same day 76 men were killed in a mine explosion of mysterious origin.<br />Blair's hatred of things British, particularly the aristocracy and the grueling fates of laborers, brings an aura of dread and reluctance to all his encounters and descriptions.<br />His soul imbues his observations with beauty, as when he arranges to go into the mine: &quot;In dark fields on either side Blair could make out miners in the dark by the glow of their pipes and the mist of their breath. The fields smelled of manure, the air of ash. Ahead, from a high chimney, issued a silvery column of smoke that at its very peak was colored by dawn.&quot;<br />Miners descend before daylight, ascend after sunset, spending their day a mile below the surface. Seen through Blair's observant eyes the mine is riveting, claustrophobic and tense. There are so many ways to die down there.<br />Blair pursues his investigation among the pit girls (the scandal of Britain in their pants and freedom) becoming fascinated by one, Rose, whose effect on the curate may have lead to his death.<br /> His dogged if unwilling persistence crosses nearly everyone in a town rife with secrets, and brutal in defending them. Blair insinuates himself into miners' lives, the do-gooder activities of Charlotte and her naive curate, the maneuvering of mine owners. He explores abandoned tunnels, and pokes around in the rubble of the explosion. A fight with Rose's beau, a man who excels in a form of kick-boxing in clogs fitted with brass studs, nearly ends in his death.<br />All of these activities lead him closer to the curate's fate but more important, they pull the reader into a world completely alien, involve us in its sensations and smells, longings and loves, dirt and danger.<br />This is a book to read slowly, for the tactile beauty of its prose and the power of the world it evokes.he dark by the glow of their pipes and the mist of their breath.

Inexperienced policewoman Elena Timofeyeva is, to her surprise, assigned to investigate the disappearance (after a tax-police raid) of a houseful of Czarist treasures worth billions of rubles. The enigmatic, dour Inspector Karpo, a devout communist, pursues the &quot;Mafia&quot; thugs involved in a street shooting which killed Karpo's lover. And for himself, Rostnikov keeps the case of the kidnapped capitalist. With Hamilton in tow, Rostnikov grapples with the police methods of East and West, borrowing when it suits him.<br />The mystery and challenge of survival in chaotic Moscow is as much the focus here as the various plot lines. Politics and bribery exert strong pressures as do crowded homes filled with troublesome relatives and smelling of poor food.<br />Kaminsky's laconic tone and colorful prose bring the city and its denizens to life - an often bleak and ruthless portrait. His story is deeply absorbing, full of character nuance and irony.	2004-06-01

Beautifully illustrated with 61 color photographs, this large-format volume uses the latest scientific and anecdotal evidence to show how these birds, slaves to instinct in such things as nest-building, will, nevertheless, use their powers of learning and observation to improvise repairs.<br />She explores the social and family lives of jays who apprentice younger birds in rearing new families, ravens showing off flying expertise in courtship games, crows evaluating food. While perfectly willing to speculate about the mental processes behind bird decisions, Savage is always careful to separate fancy from scientific fact. The writing is clear and entertaining and the pictures are spectacular.	2004-06-01

Heinrich's ever-present sense of wonder (\\"Winter World,\\" \\"Mind of the Raven\\") animates his keen scientific eye, quickening a corresponding fascination in the reader.<br />His observations of geese, \\"peripheral to swamp watching,\\" began in 1997 when a pair of Canada geese nested on a hummock in the beaver pond where Heinrich came every dawn, mostly to observe the beavers. Habituating himself to the pair, he expected to be able to enjoy a summer of observing their family life, but the day after the goslings hatched, the whole family disappeared, not to be seen again. The same thing happened the next year, and the next.<br />Meanwhile, in 1998, Heinrich's toddler son acquired a day-old Canada goose, Peep. In just a few short paragraphs Heinrich conveys the manic difficulties of raising goose and toddler together over a summer, and the regret and relief when Peep disappeared one day, presumably to join one of the migrating flocks overhead. It was two years before he saw her again - standing on his gravel driveway with her mate at dawn, after announcing her presence in a raucous flight around his house.<br />As Peep and her mate, dubbed Pop, showed signs of trying to nest (although Peep was a year younger than the usual nesting age) at the bog pond, Heinrich's enthusiasm for goose watching reached new heights. Often arriving before dawn, he observed the interactions between the resident pair and Peep and Pop as well as other geese that came to the bog looking to nest.<br />The fights were noisy, dramatic, and puzzling, since there was plenty of room and food for all. But the resident pair drove off all comers and Peep and Pop finally chose a less desirable area nearby. To Heinrich's delight, Peep laid some eggs and the pair settled in. But Peep was not as attentive as older mothers tend to be and her nest was attacked more than once, its eggs tossed out. Though Heinrich did not catch them in the act, he suspected the resident geese in the adjacent pond, as the eggs were not eaten.<br />While observing Peep and Pop's trials and tribulations as well as feeding and pair bonding behavior, and the dramas enacted between other geese, Heinrich also notes the inexplicable antics of the red-winged blackbirds, the forest-shaping habits of the beavers, and the baby-sitting behaviors of grackles, among many others. He relates the process of habituating the geese to his presence and how Peep's treatment of him differed from that of the wild geese.<br />Though none ever went so far as Peep and her reluctant mate who visited his yard daily whenever possible, Jane (the resident goose in the main pond) allowed him to examine her nest, even after the eggs had hatched.<br />Watching the geese over several years, Heinrich reports a number of curious and anomalous behaviors. The myth of the faithful goose explodes in a drama of faithlessness and opportunism any soap opera could be proud of, a drama that helps to explain some of the other puzzling anomalies he notes.<br />Like any scientist Heinrich reaches theoretical conclusions, but he saves them until the end, allowing the reader to puzzle things out independently. He also includes four appendices: a chronology of geese at the two beaver ponds; a summary of pioneering ethologist (animal behaviorist) Konrad Lorenz' work with the Greylag geese, which Heinrich read extensively after concluding his own observations; a discussion of the races and populations of Canada Geese, and a list of birds found around Beaver Bog. Naturally he also includes an extensive list of sources by topic.<br />An involving, engaging and vivid writer, Heinrich reminds us how intricate and amazing a placethe world is, while illuminating a bit of its mystery.the world is, while illuminating a bit of its mystery.	2004-05-31

Nothing was known of any illegitimate child until the codicil to his will, made recently and unknown to the partners of his heavy-hitting law firm, comes to light when Marshall dies suddenly of a stroke at his country retreat. The codicil, devastating to Marshall's widow and three spoiled children, provides that the original bequests stand if the Vietnamese child can be proved dead or back in Vietnam.<br />Marshall, a man of vast charm and many women, led a compartmentalized life - his home, the cabin where he went to be solitary, and the secret but long-term New York apartment where he brought his various women. None of his friends or his family recall any mention of his Vietnam experiences, though he did take his children to the Wall in Washington.<br />But, visiting Marshall's country retreat, off-limits to family and friends, Bruno encounters a dangerously crazy Vietnam vet, bristling with weapons and paranoia, who guards Marshall's empty home. And Bruno finds a room dedicated to photos and memorabilia of Vietnam. The people in the photographs are identified only by nicknames and as Bruno begins the painstaking process of identification, most of them seem to be dead. Those still living insist Marshall, upright and married, would never have had anything to do with a Vietnamese woman.<br />Running into one stone wall after another, Bruno's case gets a sudden shot of adrenaline when he receives, anonymously, a letter in Vietnamese, written to Marshall by a Vietnamese man who clearly was searching for the missing woman and child.<br />Slowly, doggedly, Bruno pieces together a dark and painful story, crisscrossing the country by jet and computer. Despite setbacks, false trails and dangerous developments, he digs through layers of lies and complex connections. And, naturally, the family back in New York would like to see him fail and will stop at nothing - perhaps not even homicide - to preserve their inheritance and the power they've come to think is theirs by right.<br />While there's nothing particularly original about the story, Topor's straightforward style suits his narrator protagonist - a resourceful, clever, determined fellow, a loner with very individual but firm scruples. Bruno is likable and only ruthless when nothing less will satisfy. A page turner.ossing the country by jet and computer.

The 70 people on record range in age from 70 to 99 and represent a wide variety of endeavors from labor organizers to CEOs, cops, lawyers, philanthropists, doctors, environmental crusaders, artists, clergy, farmers and more.<br />In addition to a zest for life, which they all share (few, despite physical infirmities, consider themselves &quot;retired&quot;), a few common themes emerge in these recollections. Whatever their background, almost all were affected by the Depression and World War II and a surprising number felt the blight of McCarthyism.<br />Yet most view the young today as facing a tougher road than they did. And while they all claim to find younger people invigorating, most deplore the modern lack of community feeling, the emphasis on self, the ignorance of history and unwillingness to learn from the struggles of the past.<br />The Catholic priest who was a gung-ho soldier in World War II, learned about race in a poor southern parish and went on to join the Berrigans in protesting the Vietnam War, says that what's &quot;lacking today is a national cause in which all can join.&quot; You could say he spoke too soon or those were the days.<br />Jazz musician Milt Hinton's grandmother was a slave of Jefferson Davis. He recalls the apprenticeship of his youth, sitting in with the greats. When prompted he cites the more absurd of racial indignities faced touring the south but prefers to dwell on the good times, voicing regret that those opportunities don't exist for today's young black musicians.<br />All of these oldsters have strong convictions about what's wrong with the world, although surprisingly few sound cranky about it. &quot;I'm deeply accustomed to giving advice that is not heard,&quot; says economist John Kenneth Galbraith, a long time critic of &quot;private affluence and public squalor.&quot;<br />Many of them find a new freedom in old age. &quot;Young people don't have this liberty,&quot; says environmental activist David Brower. &quot;They can't alienate themselves too much from the system.&quot;<br />Some seem to live almost wholly in the present. A Nisei school teacher who spent World War II in an internment camp spends her entire interview enthusing about the young children she teaches and the future before them.<br />An admiral who directs the Center for Defense Information, a whistle-blowing group, was a model naval officer. &quot;My fervor and dissent has increased....as you get older, you realize that whether it be a justice of the Supreme Court or the president of the United States, he's just a human being subject to human foibles.&quot;<br />Terkel, a feisty fighter himself, has naturally picked a large proportion of social and political activists - people who see the world as imperfect then and imperfect now - but always worth fighting for.

The background booklore should fascinate anyone who likes books - from the searching of bibliographies and dusty shelves to the small world of serious collectors and occasional shady operators.<br />Janeway's acquisition puts him in an awkward position between the two when a frail old lady shows up claiming that his inscribed Burton book is part of her grandfather Warren's collection, stolen, or at least fraudulently sold, after his death. Further, Mrs. Gallant claims that Burton and Charlie Warren became friends and toured the south before the Civil War.<br />Her proof - an equally pristine Burton volume with a similar inscription - is hardly conclusive, but Janeway promises to pursue the matter. A brutal murder follows on the heels of the old lady's death and sends Janeway to Gallant's hometown of Baltimore, to an old bookstore with a sleazy reputation and to a woman who uses hypnotism to take oral histories from people like Mrs. Gallant.<br />Which leads to a somewhat awkward flashback-like section in which Charlie Warren (through the taped medium of Mrs. Gallant) tells the story of his trip with Richard Burton and how Burton helped start the war. Armed with this knowledge, Janeway speeds things along and is soon mixing it up with arrogant academics, thugs, arsonists and murderers. And exchanging wisecracks and romantic sparks with a possibly untrustworthy lawyer.<br />Although there's not a lot of depth to the other characters, Janeway is likable and sharp, as well as ruthless when he needs to be.

Initially, the experiment seems a success, if somewhat disorienting. But soon gaps in perception appear - events change according to who narrates them and in the face of this perceptual chaos the human psyche begins a panicky unraveling.<br />The most humorous story is &quot;The First Contact With the Gorgonids&quot; in which the ugly American meets the aliens and the grimmest is &quot;The Kerastion,&quot; in which an artist's desire for permanence leads to tragedy. These are also the shortest.<br />Le Guin often deals with hubris. In &quot;Newton's Sleep&quot; a smugly rational man, driven to isolate his family from the pollution of Earth, is himself isolated by his inability to incorporate the irrational. In one of the churten stories, &quot;Dancing to Ganam,&quot; a man's oversized vision of himself leads to a not entirely unexpected fate.<br />Le Guin's writing is, as always, fluid and evocative. While some stories are more predictable than others, each is a pleasure.	2004-05-23

So, when a splinter group of the Fabians - the Scipians -gathers to camp at the Venn's, Nell decides to kill two birds with one stone, so to speak, by sounding out the Scipians' commitment to women's suffrage while confronting Venn about the painting.<br />It's the younger Venn son, Daniel, a collector of folk music, who comes up with the plan that Nell should steal the picture that's rightfully hers. Daniel has also just got himself engaged to a silent, abused member of the agrarian classes, no matter that he's already engaged to quite a nice woman of his own sort. It's the downtrodden waif who turns up dead during Nell's quasi-sanctioned theft.<br />The historical detail, from ladies' fashions to radical politics, merges unobtrusively with the mystery through the likable and entertaining voice of the intrepid Nell. Her sleuthing skills emerge naturally from her forthright personality, as do her well-reasoned forays into the woods in the dead of night after a killer. A delightful series.	2004-05-23

While on leave on a neutral, Earth-controlled planet, she meets a Trader aristo and is strangely drawn to him, quickly discovering that he too is a psi sensitive. This should be impossible in Trader aristocrats because their sexuality is sadistically stimulated by the sufferings of empaths and their bloodlines are rigorously controlled.<br />However, this aristo is intended as the most dangerous weapon the Traders have ever had - capable of bringing down the entire Skolian internet. Sauscony should kill him, but she's fallen in love.<br />Asaro builds a complex and absorbing story, based mostly on character. Events affecting whole societies turn on personality and personal conflict. The speculative material linking computers and psi power is well done as are the  infrequent space battles. The only drag on the pace is the heroine's inner turmoil which is, at times, repetitive. A small flaw in an otherwise outstanding debut.	2004-05-23

He knew a lot of cops and wanted something quieter and more lucrative for his son.<br />But the Job, which encompassed so many different personalities, \\"offered entry into a drama as rich as any in Shakespeare. And I didn't want to hear the story as much as I wanted to tell it, and I didn't want to tell the story as much as I wanted to join it.\\"<br />Conlon started out with ambitions as a writer and was an English major at Harvard. But reading this book with its rich, articulate prose and vivid anecdotes, its soul-searching arguments and sharp insight, its sprawling grasp and its seamless organization - what comes to mind is adrenaline. Cops, you realize, become cops for the rush, the hunt, the intensity.<br />Conlon starts out patrolling the projects in the South Bronx, a place synonymous with crime, but filled with ordinary families just trying to get by. Not that Conlon sees a lot of those people, except in passing.<br />His encounters are with people at their most desperate; criminal or victim. He might jump from disarming an abusive husband to arresting a drug-peddling junkie to saving a bedridden, half-starved old woman with maggots living in her bedsores, or rescuing two mentally ill tenants from their truly deranged and suddenly vicious cat.<br />The last two (the first horrific, the second hilarious) are among the Aided calls Conlon describes - the most frequent type of call, in which assistance is what's required, not arrest. Arrests, though desirable, at least to Conlon, are tricky and time-consuming, given the atmosphere of distrust. Paperwork and butt-covering are a necessary hindrance in Conlon's view, a subject to which he returns often in the course of the book.<br />But this early section, before Conlon moves on to the more exciting (for him, not necessarily the reader) street-drug squad, is full of the groping and learning that goes on in a young cop's mind. Conlon shows us how cops learn to read people; the nuanced psychology that becomes almost automatic in response to a wide range of potentially explosive, tragic or just messy situations.<br />The drug stuff, in contrast, is a round-robin dance between cop and criminal, in which cops collar street-dealers, keeping them off the street for an hour or so and disrupting the block's drug trade for somewhat less than a minute. Conlon argues for the work, but the squandering of hours in waiting for transport or pushing paper seems to underscore the waste of vast amounts of money in a toothless street-level drug policy. Even the occasional deal for a bigger score almost always peters out in a waste of time for everyone concerned.<br />Conlon sets the Job in context, giving us a cop's eye view of an anti-social Serpico and an overzealous Knapp Commission, the shock of the Abner Louima abuse case and the tragedy of the Amadou Diallo killing, compounded, in his view, by political abandonment at the top.<br />His account of combing the 9/11 remains at Fresh Kills (originally published in the \\"New Yorker,\\" as were several other pseudonymous pieces on the cop's life) conveysthe shock, and the gut-wrenching, tactile and olfactory sense of being there.<br />His own ambitions he treats with both self-deprecating humor and pride. Offered a promotion that sounds like a desk job, he's afraid to refuse. \\"Like a lot of outer-borough street cops, I believed in some inconvertibly primitive place in my heart that there was a catapult on the roof of One Police Plaza, and that if you crossed someone who was influential, they launched you through the air to Staten Island, where you landed on the pavement in a uniform that was too small, and you spent the remainder of your career on a corner, watching empty buses pass.\\"<br />And later: \\"In spite of everything, I learned how a case broke: someone said something, someone left something, someone saw something. None of these occurred at the behest of the detective. Few perps were as accommodating as the man who choked and robbed a woman on the street and was trying to drag her into an alley when a Good Samaritan intervened, driving him off. The perp dropped some papers, which included a snapshot of himself, and a note with his address that said, `Directions to my house.'\\"<br />But the meat of the book is the camaraderie of team work, the rush of a successful collar, the disappointment of a DA's dismissal of same, the good bosses and bad, the never-ending, oft-resented, sometimes contradictory rules, and the personalities that drive it all - perps and cops. Conlon unabashedly thrives on the drama, while aware that the Job can take over the man (or woman), which might not be such a good thing.<br />Big, funny, sad, horrifying, street-wise and thoughtful, this is a stirring portrait of a man, an institution, and a calling.the shock, and the gut-wrenching, tactile and olfactory sense of being there.<br />His own ambitions he treats with both self-deprecating humor and pride.

So, as ex-cop Max sits in his lawyer friend Billy Manchester's Miami penthouse apartment reading 80-year-old letters from Cyrus Mayes, the reader already knows the man's fate.<br />Building the Tamiami Trail across the broad Everglades swamp in 1923 was a slow slog through heat, muck, snakes, alligators and, maybe worst of all, insects. Mayes' recently recovered letters tell of captive labor and runaway workers who are never heard from again, so Cyrus' grandson suspects foul play. But he wants to know for sure. And the road-building company (which could still be legally liable) has stonewalled him.<br />Intrigued, Max takes the letters back to the refuge of his sturdy Glades shack, where a suspicious early morning fire adds to his troubles without distracting his investigation. He braves the closed world of Glades natives to leave a message for the enigmatic Nate Brown (previously seen in \\"Visible Darkness\\"), meets up with his cop girlfriend Sherry Richards (who's preoccupied with an extracurricular case concerning an abusive stalker cop), and then drops off a piece of his burned shack to a forensics lab.<br />While the Mayes case stays in the forefront, King weaves in his subplots seamlessly, revisiting his old demons and working out his present. Trailed by hired thugs, Max pursues his leads into the past and through generations. The action culminates in an all-out boat chase through the Glades, which resonates with the snap of alligator jaws and the hum of mosquitoes.<br />Fine hard-and-soft-boiled prose, with quirky, believable characters, and an atmosphere that veers from the timeless mystery of the Everglades to the up-to-the-minute dazzle of the urban coast, King's series continues to shine.	2004-05-23

A New Yorker through and through, she was apprehensive and fearful, but also excited and determined. Her life was vaguely dissatisfying and she was looking for a change.<br />Reading her memoir is like having a personal conversation with the author. Her tone is personal and intimate. When she stands back for a moment, picturing herself through a passing stranger's averted eye - a middle-aged lady in floppy hat and mismatched tennis shoes, gathering weeds in a basket - we too are startled and amused, having been looking from the inside out.<br />Shulman, recognized for her novels and feminism, reaches her cross-roads at age 50. Her children are grown, her relationship with her husband is a distant truce, the feminist movement has stalled, and her life is overfull of busyness.<br />But the birth of a new passion in her life is serendipitous. Always an adventurous cook, she finds her lengthy trips to the uninspiring island grocery a jarring intrusion on her pleasing solitude and a chore contrary to her new motto, &quot;Do only what you like, nothing you don't!&quot;<br />From years before she remembers mussel gathering, one of the few pleasures of the hurried vacations she had always hated. In those years, with small children and a domineering, orchestrating husband, the summer cabin, with no electicity or plumbing had meant a round of endless drudgery.<br />Now that she has only to please herself, mussel hunting is merely the first of her pleasures. Around her a world unfolds. Armed with Euell Gibbons and determination, she reaps the bounty of wild things, spending her days in exploration and discovery.<br />She finds in herself a new tranquility and simplicity which, as she feared, is invaded by New York's cosmopolitan pace and abundance. The reader is a bit ahead of her here, exhorting Shulman to enjoy what the city has to offer, just as she enjoys her island.<br />And when the author does absorb our advice (given to her by an old childhood friend at a party), she embraces it fully, applying this tactic to her whole life. Thus, when she accepts a position at the University of Colorado, she plunges into an exploration of New Age mysticism, health foods, mountain hiking and Buddhism. You don't have to share her interests to find her open-minded approach admirable.<br />There are upheavels too. Her children are less than thrilled in the back-to-nature changes in their New Yorker mother. Her husband shatters a summer's idyll at the island by sending divorce papers. And romantic love, with all its joy, threatens to disrupt her solitary self. As I said, you don't have to agree.<br />But through it all, Shulman struggles to maintain her equilibrium, making deliberate choices, letting her thoughts range free. She is enchanted by the wholeness of things - how all of nature interrelates - and then dismayed as pollution from the cities and radiation from Chernobyll threatens her island haven.<br />This is a memoir of continuous awakening and endless dialogue with the self and the world. There's helplessness, anger, hope and love and inspiration.

In alternating chapters (most divided between the second generation, Rio, and the fourth, her grandaughter Nomi) the women voice their regrets, hopes, resentments and aspirations.<br />Reiko, the eldest, is a sour, demanding old crone who grew up motherless but with a vision of herself as a princess. As she adapted to something less, her hauteur adjusted to hard work and a scathing contempt for those around her, pinching her naturally strong-willed disposition into something crafty and malicious.<br />Her emotionally oppressed daughter, Rio, dreams of the gentle father she scarcely knew and the one true love she almost had. Brooding and almost bed ridden with depression, she attempts suicide early in the novel when her beloved grandaughter, Nomi, is seven.<br />Tomoe, Nomi's mother, devotes herself to her husband, his female relatives and her own daughters, asking nothing more from life than the pleasure of nurturing. But she's saddened by her husband's remote self-absorption and the lonely fate of her own mother, who, having only daughters, must end her days without a proper home.<br />Nomi grows from a lively child, devoted to her grandmother, to a promiscuous and sullen adolescent with little time for the old lady. Yearning for something she cannot name, she fixes on the idea of going to Japan. Through lovers, spats with her parents and various youthful disappointments, she clings to this dream.<br />Each woman, we come to see, has a dream and a secret. Within them are the seething feelings they hide from others, the lives they wished they had lived and hope to discover in the younger generation. But each suffers from the inability to communicate, even to answer a cry for help. Unspoken, feelings curdle, misunderstandings proliferate. Rio sees Nomi make the same mistakes she did, Tomoe sees her daughters receed from her, Nomi cuts herself off from all of them. Only Reiko, spiteful and unfeeling, seems to go on as strong as ever.<br />Shigekuni's language is thoughtful and reflective, her images sometimes dreamlike, other times sharp and vivid. The voices of her characters emerge as individuals but evoke little sympathy. They seem trapped in their inability to communicate and their histories, finally, do not stir the emotions. Still, this is a subtle, complex story and an impressive debut.em.

This is not how I, the average reader, would advise a new writer to begin his debut novel, but McAdam's voice - and prose - is strong enough to get away with it.<br />Besides, I peeked. Normal narrative was just around the corner. So I was able to sit back and enjoy the brief soliloquies and authorial interjections, which introduce the next two characters, Ottawa builder and developer Jerry McGuinty, and wealthy bureaucrat Simon Struthers.<br />Jerry, the primary narrator, has a vigorous voice, straight from his ambitious, working-class heart. From the vantage point of a tenuous reunion with his just-grown son, he looks back over a life of consuming ambition and familial neglect, or at least willful blindness.<br />Jerry, a plasterer and the son and grandson of plasterers, starts life wanting something more than a weekly wage. Housing developments are booming around 1970s Ottawa, and Jerry deplores the flimsy structures he's building for someone else. He dreams of buying land and building better houses. Then he meets Kathleen Herlihy, who runs a lunch van and renders him speechless.<br />\\"It wasn't fear and it wasn't shyness, really, it was just the thought that this woman handing me a sandwich is what the world will always yearn for as it grows.\\"<br />Canny, sardonic Kathleen coaches him on how to approach the bank and he credits her for his first scary loan, his first real start. But Kathleen has problems. She disappears sometimes for weeks at a time. Her temper is unpredictable. She moves into her van. She drinks. When she gets pregnant Jerry moves her into his first development and they have little Jerry. Jerry relates all this with awe and bewilderment. His days were consumed with building, buying, selling and juggling debt. Kathleen was difficult: mercurial and angry at his absences, unfulfilled by motherhood.<br />Simon's story is less directly told. Point-of-view, primarily third person subjective, shifts intermittently to an authorial first person. Simon, a functionary with the agency that ultimately controls Ottawa's shape and direction, is so self-absorbed that it's unclear how much his vision of himself is real. A womanizer with a Lolita fixation on Kwyet, the daughter of a bribe-taking colleague, Simon pursues affairs with co-workers (and Kwyet's mother) until they tire of him:<br />\\" `Mr. Struthers, to me you are a cipher. A mystery once, and now a perfect zero.'<br />She was so offensive as to be arousing.\\"<br />Nothing really touches him, though he fears she's right. He hides his fear behind that aloof mysteriousness. The son of a prominent politician, Simon dreams of leaving his own historic mark. He borrows a visionary project straight from \\"the dreambook,\\" a collection of whimsical plans too preposterous or expensive ever to come to fruition. A scientific project, with lasting benefits for city and country: a wind tunnel. And he has just the piece of land.<br />The same piece Jerry McGuinty has his eye on for his own crowning glory. Luxury homes overlooking a state-of-the-art golf course. Jerry hates golf and all it stands for, but he hires a specialized architect, and pours money into land the government has yet to let him buy.<br />While Jerry determinedly ties himself in knots of red tape, Kathleen continues her downward spiral. Infidelity, alcoholism - obvious in retrospect, but Jerry, as self-absorbed as Simon in his own big-hearted way, never had a clue. An automobile accident lands her in the hospital, and reveals her cirrhosis, but Jerry still dismisses the facts.<br />\\"I didn't have time to look after her, because the rest of the world was humming, you know, white hot, so Jerry did a lot of the looking after, a lot of the fetching and what have you.\\"<br />A year of this, another hospitalization and young Jerry, 14, has had enough. He doesn't come home. And big Jerry's world finally begins to implode.<br />McAdam's prose is confident, bold, and active; his images sharp and humorous and imaginative. Jerry is a wonderful character, both deeply flawed and heroic. He's a man in whom strength and weakness feed off each other, a man whose willfulness is as destructive as it is powerful.<br />The framework of real estate development, growth, corruption and bureaucratic maneuvering, works both to advance the sprawling plot and as a metaphor for the characters of the men. Jerry bulls ahead, his visions solid and concrete and immediate, but blinkered, while Simon guards his power and prestige, is not above underhanded coercion, and envisions the monumental as his personal legacy.<br />Get through the first 20 pages and McAdam will grab you and not let go until the last page is turned.

Books	5	29	36	N	N	Lively and thought-provoking	With our tendency to anthropomorphize everything, from playful puppies to temperamental automobiles, it stands to reason that the animal mind is a topic of hot debate.<br />Literally. Animal rights activists have torched and bombed facilities associated with medical research or product testing on animals. Wynne finds these zealots baffling. Why, he wonders, focus on researchers rather than farmers, who, for sheer numbers, do away with a lot more animals? The Animal Liberation Front, he notes, in 2001 documented \\"the rescue of 5,000 animals, not one of them a pig. Why not?\\"<br />People simply do not bring an objective eye to bear on the subject of animal minds and that includes scientists. In lively and provocative style, Wynne, psychologist and professor, attempts to remedy this. He devotes chapters to four well-studied species: the honeybee, the pigeon, the bat and the dolphin. Others, particularly apes, also make frequent appearances.<br />He examines what makes these animals different from us, and what we have in common. What is special about these creatures? What is it like to be them? Are animals self-aware? How can we know? Chapters are devoted to the faculties that - supposedly - set us apart and above the animal kingdom: reasoning, language, and \\"the ability to put oneself imaginatively into the position of another - what we would call `theory of mind.' \\"<br />No one argues for the intelligence of bees. Yet the dance of the honeybee conveys detailed information about the whereabouts of high-quality food. The bee knows her food is better than what her sisters are bringing in because unloader bees serve her quickly. Mediocre loads have to wait. But some bees, even when informed their offering is hardly worth unloading, do their dance anyway. They are able to reason that near and plentiful is worthwhile even if the quality is below average.<br />Most, perhaps all, animals learn from experience. Even the sea slug learns to anticipate a poke. But reasoning was thought to be the province of humans until monkeys were shown to do it in the 1980s. A few years later even pigeons demonstrated the ability to make fairly complex deductions.<br />But then, a setback. Monkeys who could negotiate complicated patterns to predict the next in a series, were unable to judge where a peanut would fall through a curved tube. Although the simple mechanism was right in front of them, they still assumed the peanut would fall in a straight line. Wynne deconstructs these experiments to show how the simple logic involved for the animal in each step contributes to a complex task, while what seems to us the simplest diversion of a curve could stymie another primate, unable to make the leap.<br />The language discussion naturally devotes a lot of its energy to ape studies, which seem to show that apes can learn to use sign or symbol language. Wynne debunks this by giving us chunks of original data alongside the researcher's conclusions, showing a clear bias for enthusiasm. Readers of the popular books he refers to may counter with numerous endearing or amazing chimp anecdotes, but Wynne would probably agree that these show a complex and fascinating animal, while not a user of language.<br />Chimps don't have the brain mechanisms for language, but we don't have the bat's echolocation or the dolphin's sonar. He likens the relationship of species to a similarity sandwich with commonalities in a squishy middle, dissimilarities on the bottom and qualities unique to each species on top.<br />Wynne is clear about his own biases - he is basically a skeptic, with an open mind. He has a great appreciation for animals, which does not depend on them being like us. And, like most scientists, he relishes demolishing his colleagues, particularly the ones who, like himself, have written books for the general reader.<br />His writing is clear, well-organized and witty. The jury is still out on whether (and what) animals think, but Wynne's book is a highly entertaining and informative contribution to the debate.ning and informative contribution to the debate.	2004-05-03

The first two chapters are Bronte's, the last fiction before her death in 1855. Acclaimed Irish writer Boylan continues this sketch, remaining true to Bronte's interests and style in developing a romantic mystery of identity and Victorian social issues.<br />Bronte's narrator, Isabel Chalfont, a youngish widow, takes in a young girl called Matilda Fitzgibbon. Her purported father had delivered the child, along with a trunk of sumptuous clothing, to the fledgling, struggling, Wilcox School. But her fees went unpaid, her father's address proved fictitious and the man himself had disappeared.<br />Petted as a wealthy prize, the child is reviled when proved poor. Introverted and miserable, her memory clouded, she nevertheless arouses maternal feelings in the childless Isabel. But shortly after remembering her real name - Emma - the girl runs off to find the mother who sold her, and efforts to discover her origins and whereabouts meet little success.<br />Boylan branches out to tell the story from several perspectives. Chief among them are Isabel, Emma, and Mr. Ellin, a man of indolent habits with hidden depths and a secret past, the one who brought Emma to Isabel and now undertakes to find her \\"father.\\"<br />Emma, alone and soon robbed, finds herself among the lowest of the low in heartless London - but not so low she can't take on another girl, even younger and less fortunate than herself. Together they face hunger, homelessness and the work available to children, including prostitution.<br />Each character's present is illuminated by their past - unjust treatment and romantic reversals deform or temper character - and the plot comes together in a proper Victorian tangle. Boylan's writing (\\"Holy Pictures,\\" \\"Beloved Stranger\\") is always choice and atmospheric, and the Bronte connection gives her free reign to incorporate melodrama, romance and unsavory Victorian attitudes towards class, parental rights, poverty and the ownership of children and women.<br />A sweeping, involving, Bronte-esque novel.involving, Bronte-esque novel.	2004-04-29

The Puritans rage, the populace rejoices, and Christmas Eve begins badly, with the murder of the Dresser of the Queen's Privy Kitchen (there are three kitchens  - one for the Queen and invited guests, a second for courtiers, and a third for the hordes of minions who do all the work). The man responsible for the elaborate design of the finished dishes, poor Hodge had been hung and garnished with the plumage of the peacock he was preparing.<br />With the jokester preparing another nasty surprise for each of the 12 days, the Queen gathers her usual Privy Council, but soon finds reason to suspect even them. Courtiers are jealous, greedy, scheming people and even the best are ambitious.<br />The plot is nicely paced (though the Privy Council red herrings are fairly obvious), but the chief spectacle here is Christmas. A Christmas recipe prefaces each chapter and is featured within during the festivities. The feasts and pageants and costumes are entrancingly described, as is much of the work involved in getting it all done. Excellent in concept and execution.	2004-04-29

Invited to a strange dinner of supplicants at Price's underfurnished house, Tuckworth hears a shot and rushes to find the body of a murdered man. Though dressed in Price's servant's clothes, Tuckworth, with time-honored Holmesian observation, sees he is not the servant.<br />Though Tuckworth soon suspects Price, and, with a likable journalist-assistant, burgles the man's house, he is forced to return to Bellminster without proof. But crime has followed him to his bucolic town and Tuckworth must find his proof before a fate worse than murder befalls its innocent inhabitants.<br />Tuckworth's depths and talents are nicely portrayed as is London and the darker corners of Victorian life.	2004-04-29

But when her 5-year-old daughter, Polly, is diagnosed with a minor, but hereditary ear abnormality, Nathalie is jolted.<br />Nathalie has always exuded confidence (though she flits from job to job) and insisted on her independence, to the point of refusing to marry her live-in partner and the father of her child, Steve. But is her vaunted independence just an inability to commit herself? \\" `I just felt awful, lost,' \\" she tells Steve, that night. \\" `I thought - I thought, what else don't I know?' ....  `I suddenly felt I was in a space.

The big sister, who has always gotten her way, she needs David to join her in the search; to find his own mother while she finds hers. David at first resists - the idea terrifies him. But then, with the urging of his wife, Marnie, he relents.<br />David, happily married, father of three, owner of a thriving landscape business, values stability. His avocation is chess and as the novel proceeds we see that in times of stress he loses himself in the game. To him it's a haven of intellectual challenge with identifiable rules, far from the mess and unpredictability of emotional ructions.<br />And the brother and sister quest causes nothing but emotional ructions. The adoptive grandmother fears being supplanted by these alien \\"real\\" grandmothers. She fears being supplanted as a mother, her life nullified. Steve and Marnie feel left out, rejected. The bond between the adopted siblings has always been threatening - their closeness not only that of siblings, but of adoptees, willing to declare that no one but the other can understand their points of view. And, of course, they are not blood relations.<br />Steve and Marnie bring their own characters to bear on the situation. Steve, a successful designer with his own firm, likes everything in its place. He reigns in his passion for control at home, but it costs him. Nathalie's separateness eats at him - he needs to feel needed. Marnie, giving up her nursery school after the birth of her third child, feels her own control unraveling. Trying to run her family on the same sound principles as she ran the school, her two-year-old son defeats her and her husband turns to  chess more urgently than to her.<br />Trollope stays in the third person, but she shifts point of view among her characters, including the two birth mothers, who are as interesting as they are different. The children - antennae quivering as tensions increase in their families, the way they glean knowledge that adults attempt to hide, their insecurities and fierce need for stability - gain the reader's complete sympathy, while each of the adults needs a good shaking from time to time.<br />All of the characters are changed by the events, but Trollope never does anything so easy as catharsis.

But Caroline's triumph is curtailed by a mental breakdown on the night of her wedding.<br />Caroline's condition, characterized by a midnight slum walk, an attempted suicide, erratic temper and more, causes the three sets of newlyweds, along with a scholar of spiritualism, to convene at her brother's home for a hoped-for Christmas convalescence. Instead, Caroline's deterioration accelerates and a series of nasty accidents threaten other members of the household - much like the eerie coincidences of the popular gothic romances of the day.<br />Elizabeth and Darcy approach the mysterious events from different perspectives and their repartee owes as much to Nick and Nora Charles as to Austen (as Bebris freely admits). The suspenseful climax ushers in a less than credible conclusion, but the journey is enjoyable. Quotes from \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" head each chapter - a particularly nice touch - and Austen readers will find this a diverting entertainment.	2004-04-29

Although outraged to discover they want him - an acknowledged financial wunderkind - to organize their moldy old books, he finds himself oddly intrigued.<br />Before he quite knows what he's done, he's agreed to catalog the books - something he knows nothing about, and to look for a 14th century tome by Gervase of Langford, someone he's never heard of.<br />Before the day is out, Edward takes on another unaccustomed activity - computer gaming. A college friend foists the disk on him and while it's not an activity that has ever appealed, Edward becomes hooked by the unusually vivid graphics, losing swaths of time in the game's strange landscape.<br />The Langford codex soon becomes the focal point of his daytime world. His search takes him to a rare-book repository where he meets the serious and possibly attractive young medievalist Margaret Napier, whose Langford thesis has bogged down in the tedious obscurity of the man. She reacts frostily to Edward's ignorant query - the book he seeks does not exist. It's an 18th century fabrication, she tells him, \\" a sensational and occasionally salacious allegorical journey culminating in a mystical vision of the end of the world.\\"<br />Nevertheless, she succumbs to the lure of the search, which becomes increasingly convoluted, romantic, mysterious and threatening as they delve deeper into the arcane world of books and intrigue. In his spare moments, Edward plunges into the computer game. The apocalyptic world it - or he - is creating begins to bear some startling resemblance to his real world activities and strangely echoes the codex he seeks.<br />Grossman's witty, atmospheric prose draws the reader into a vivid surreal world, in which it's possible to believe that ambitious young bankers lose themselves in ancient texts and seductive computer games, and old books can reach through centuries to affect the fortunes of modern dynasties. The finely tuned characters have elusive depths and the booklore, fascinating in itself, fits seamlessly into the plot.

The gentleman burglar was after a 16th century book written in code, which Kate quickly determines is a collection of intelligence reports from Elizabeth I's reign, during which time Marlowe took on undercover tasks for the Queen's ministers.<br />While she's deciphering the manuscript she takes on another assignment to get next to a shady international art dealer who has just made an 11million dollar purchase from an Iranian intelligence officer. Unbeknownst to Kate, the Iranian and the art dealer are also involved in the smuggling of an American prisoner from an Iranian prison - a man Kate's boss intends to rescue.<br />Marlowe, caught between rivals for the Queen's favor, takes on a smuggling case of his own - arms dealing, which may involve treason in the highest places. Low-tech Elizabethan eavesdropping and peeping, rumor mongering, slandering, blackmail, frame-ups, and political intrigue run counterpoint to slick modern versions of the same dangerous activities, albeit conducted on a global scale at instantaneous speeds.<br />The Elizabethan sections, headed by quotes from Marlowe's plays, sometimes juxtaposed with quotes from Shakespeare, are excellent. Historical intrigues go forward in atmospheric context, amid tavern plates of venison stew or palace dishes of baked peacock, and under cover of crowded cockfights or the deep darkness of wooded estates or fleeting encounters on the crowded, fetid Thames. Tidbits about ciphers, the theater and Elizabeth's court emerge effortlessly through more speculative treatment of the historical players - including an explanation of the fate of Marlowe.<br />The modern sections are less successful. The writing is uneven and while the action comes fast, the actors are too many and the plot becomes dizzyingly complex. Silbert, a real-life version of Kate, at least as far as resume goes, zips among her glittering, globe-trotting millionaires at a heady clip, sometimes switching viewpoints and countries three or four times in a chapter.<br />Still, working the stories in tandem is a fine idea and Kate, while larger than life, is a brainy, enjoyable character, while the historical plotline is enough to carry the novel through the murkier modern tangle.of Marlowe.<br />The modern sections are less successful.

The murder of its leader, Buddy Wing, couldn't have been more dramatic - poisoned by a kiss on live TV. At the height of the service Pastor Wing always kissed the cross on his Bible, and on the fateful day it had been painted with poison. Poison in his water pitcher added insurance.<br />Evidence found at the home of Sissy James, mistress of a rival evangelical leader, prompts the unhappy woman to confess. But Aubrey thinks she confessed to protect someone - maybe her family-man lover. She enlists Maddy to help her ferret out the secrets of the church turn up a generous handful of suspects. Maddy, a sharp but lonely divorcee somewhat past retirement age, welcomes Aubrey's youthful enthusiasm and guts.<br />Corwin, an ex-reporter, knows the insular nature of small town politicos and their sometimes frictional, sometimes cozy relationship with the local newspaper. Aubrey's tussle with the police chief hierarchy rings true, though the spectacle of a couple of evangelical preachers shoving each other around an editor's office strains credulity a bit.<br />The writing is witty and narrator Maddy is immediately engaging. The plot is a humdinger, almost guaranteed to surprise. Corwin has set up an intriguing duo and most readers will be avid with curiosity to see this pseudonymous author's second outing.	2004-04-04

Next we cut to her distraught, terrified mother being gently questioned by Sejer, who shares her dread.<br />But this scenario does not have the expected conclusion. The search party combing nearby Kollen mountain turn up the naked body of a local teenager, and Ragnhild is deposited on her doorstep by the lonely Downs-syndrome boy who had taken her to his home.<br />It's a small, close, valley community where everyone knows everyone else, though not as well as they think they do. The dead girl, Annie, had been bright, outgoing and well liked by everyone. Sure, she'd been subdued, even a bit withdrawn in the last few months, but her family and friends put it down to adolescence. Sejer thinks she had a secret.<br />As he and his assistant, young Jacob Skarre, begin to probe, they peel away layers of deception and self-deception, uncovering cracks and chasms under the tranquil surface. No surprise to Sejer, there are lots of secrets in this respectable, idyllic village, starting right in Annie's family. And there's the boyfriend - brutalized into passivity, he hardly seems her type.<br />Fossum is particularly adept at revealing character through details. A neighbor views Sejer's approach: \\"He assumed a strained expression, but then realized that this might make them suspicious; so he pulled himself together and tried a smile instead. Then he remembered that Annie was dead, and went back to the strained mask.\\"<br />She steeps the story in its semi-rural, woods and mountain atmosphere, but just as telling are the characters' surroundings - a toy-strewn house or a muddy farmyard or a teenager's bedroom. Shifts in point of view heighten the psychological suspense and narrative depth. Sejer is a complex, thoughtful, empathetic character.

Hayes, a former computer whiz at Liz Boldt's bank, has just completed his stint for a wire fraud of 17 million dollars - which was never recovered, or traced to its owner.<br />But Hayes turns up again the next day - phoning Liz to beg her to get him into the bank so he can access the computer and give the money back to its ruthless owners, the ones who have already taken two of his finger nails for incentive.<br />Anguished and terrified, Liz does what she has to - tells Boldt Hayes was the man she had an affair with five years before, reopening that old wound and rocking their marriage once again.<br />Pearson intertwines the marital upheavals with the suspense of police work, and the suspense part is a lot more successful. The criminals are smart and vicious, the police work dangerous and the various intrigues keep the pages turning and the questions coming. When pitting cops against criminals Pearson knows how to ratchet up the tension, but the writing strains against the byplay of painful emotions and the struggle to make a marriage work. The nail-biter climax is satisfyingly long and complex and meticulously choreographed and almost redeems the Boldts from their tawdry past.	2004-04-04

Helen MacFarquhar, owner of a small bookstore in seaside Pequot, is pleased with her life, &quot;even with her daughter away at camp and her ex-husband making so much money.&quot; Conscious of her contentment, she regards her pile of mail as &quot;a group of strangers with only one thing in common, and that one thing was Helen MacFarquhar.&quot;<br />Among the letters, bills and solicitations is a note from her daughter, Emily, sent before her departure, beginning, &quot;I bet I miss you already! Smiling, Helen disposes of her mail piece by piece and only then notices an oddly folded sheet. Beginning &quot;Dear Goat,&quot; and signed &quot;Ram,&quot; it's a love letter, typed, undated, anonymous. &quot;A sudden warmth pressed upon her, unfamiliar, a tenderness, someone else's tenderness.&quot;<br />Initially certain the letter was sent to another, she is as quickly uncertain. Helen, a flirt, has many admirers. &quot;They were a kind of hobby, better even than gardening, which she also enjoyed.&quot; She locks the letter in a drawer, takes it out, rereads it, takes it home with her. Soon she has it memorized.<br />Johnny, 20, three weeks into his summer job at Helen's store, watches her when he can get away with it. He's watching as she locks the letter away. &quot;He was not surprised when she caught his eye, and said 'Yes?' in a poisonous voice.&quot; He finds Helen mercurial, dictatorial and fascinating. She often speaks to embarrass him, &quot;to keep him in his place, which seemed to be the same as everyone's place - at her feet.&quot;<br />On a whim - Johnny's parents are away - Helen makes a project of him, invites him to dinner, attempts to set him up with one of her other student employees. Johnny, who has watched her turn on the high wattage charm for her customers and just as quickly switch it off, is flattered, then infuriated when she does it to him. He comes across the letter (accidentally?) and he too is infected by it.<br />Then one day, in her helpful mode, Helen comes upon him in his backyard, wakes him, and in a vulnerable moment he grabs her. Startled, Helen responds. She initiates their love affair which soon consumes them both.<br />Meanwhile, Helen's mother, Lilian, and grandmother, arrive. Lilian, a cosmopolitan charmer who hates small-town Pequot, has come for  an extended visit, perhaps to live. Harried and baffled, Helen scarcely notices her mother's odd comings and goings, too absorbed in snatching moments with Johnny. But it's not merely self-absorption which blinds Helen - her mother's secret is not one easily penetrated by a daughter.<br />Helen agonizes over Johnny. It will end when Emily comes home from camp. It will end when Johnny goes back to school. But &quot;when they were together reason seemed petty, anachronistic, like removing your hat when entering a house.&quot;<br />Schine takes a chance, mixing comedy with passion, mingling light, deft touches of wit with erotic heat. What could be a tawdry affair is a moving, doomed romance. And her secondary characters - the librarian Miss Skattergoods, with her eccentric habits and her underlying melancholy, Helen's friend Lucy with her distant manner and her incisive tongue, Helen's grandmother who won't part with her unreliable Jaguar and won't drive it either - each of them is lovingly defined.<br />&quot;The Love Letter&quot; is even finer than &quot;Rameau's Niece&quot;.

He's passionate, but not self-absorbed; instinctive but not reckless. And Annie: younger, a bit less certain of herself, leery of Banks' baggage, a bit defensive about her new romance, wavers between assertiveness and stubbornness and can't always tell the difference.<br />And then there's the plot. Fire is a fascinating, scary medium and yields great forensics. The story begins with two live-aboard barges set ablaze, a dead artist on one, a dead junkie on the other. Had the junkie's apparently grief-stricken boyfriend snapped? Had the failed artist crossed his unidentified visitors? Had the junkie's abusive stepfather shut her mouth for good? Then another suspicious blaze kills a lonely man in his isolated trailer on the other side of town and the questions multiply.<br />The pace mixes technical forensics, police procedure, and personal interaction in a suspenseful flow that relies on engagement rather than breakneck action. Shifts in point of view add further dimension. And the writing - atmospheric and nuanced - is as graceful as ever. Robinson (\\"Close to Home\\") has another winner.	2004-03-16

The crime is the murder of the title character, a rich, elderly Detroit crime boss. His resentful assistant, Montez Taylor, who has been written out of the old man's will, organized the hit. When he learns that Mr. Paradiso's \\"girlfriend,\\" high-priced call girl Chloe, is making an unexpected visit, Montez tries to call it off, but fails.<br />Chloe brings along her friend Kelly, a model, who agrees to help out with a titillating cheerleading routine, and Kelly is upstairs when two gunmen burst in, killing both Chloe and Paradiso. Montez intimidates Kelly into pretending to be Chloe - there's a safety deposit box scam involved - but the nice policeman on the scene, quickly smitten Frank Desla, sees through that pretty quickly.<br />That's the set-up and from there it's just one thing after another in turn after subplot after switchback after double cross in gritty Detroit. Tightly plotted, but character driven, this is as zany, comic and smart as we've come to expect.	2004-03-16

Edna has given Doug some names and a fairly generous expense allowance and in no time he meets Aisha al-Kady, a stunning, sophisticated heiress, and Sergei Nikolaisen, a suave and worldly retired museum curator.<br />Then one of his contacts dies and two inept thugs corner Doug in an alley. But Aisha's fond farewell is almost enough to put this out of his mind as he continues his quest to Egypt where a sojourn in jail dims that warm glow. Doug's not finished yet, though, and his further adventures with Aisha and Sergei include a couple of gun battles, a chase across the Cairo rooftops, an enlightening trip to the Pyramids, a try at rugby, a ransom at Raffles Hotel in Singapore, and more.<br />Naturally he's spoiled for Pottsville after all this and readers will hope Benoit has something more in store for his resourceful hero.

He spent 10 years enslaved, suffering frequent beatings and, perhaps worse, almost total isolation, until his escape in 1996. Resettled in America, in Fargo, North Dakota, he put his energies into learning two new cultures, the American, and the Dinka culture he had had snatched from him.<br />America was a shock in almost every way - the food, the language, the freedom, and the pace. Of his first job in a pallet factory, Bok says, \\"For ten years I had been forced to work with Giemma's animals, but not once had I returned home as weary and dirty as I was every night after a shift in the pallet shop.\\"<br />But there was more to come. Feeling his way, Bok quits his job, finds a new one, locates a group of Dinka in Ohio, moves there, acquires one job, then a second, saves for an apartment, makes more friends and discovers contentment. Only to give it all up to move to Boston and become an anti-slavery activist. Despite his total lack of schooling and English, Bok spoke at churches and schools, testified before the Senate and called on two presidents to act. Meanwhile he attended school, and it wasn't easy to place a 6-foot-6 non-English speaker without a first-grade education.<br />Bok's memoir is told in simple, matter-of-fact prose, and the horror and pathos come through all the more strongly for being understated. Throughout his captivity, he slept in a barn, was not spoken to except as related to his work, and was not allowed to associate with any other slaves. He learned Arabic by force of will and kept himself going with thoughts of his parents. Only in America did he find out they had died in the raid.<br />And it's in America that he learns the history of his war-torn country, which he relates briefly, illuminating an old culture clash over land that intensified with British colonization and has since been manipulated into a war between Arabs and Africans, Christians and Muslims.<br />Bok's strength, melancholy and sense of wonder come through on every page, whether he's describing the joy of shopping for hip-hop clothes, the taunts of American classmates, or the awe of speaking before the Senate or meeting President Bush.

Its crew survived though perhaps they later wished they hadn't.<br />In the first days, hostile nomads drove them to escape back to the sea in a small boat with a broken oar only to suffer such dehydration and starvation that even enslavement by the dreaded nomads seemed preferable - until it happened.<br />After a slow, thoughtful start laying out the background of the men and the voyage, Dean's story of the crew's ordeal reads like a runaway suspense thriller with torture. And it's well written and chock full of information you didn't know you needed - the camel, for instance, is an astonishing physical specimen, a creature with a face built for sandstorms; an animal that doesn't sweat or pant, but stores its heat for the cold nights when it becomes a kind of living stove.<br />Dean's book is based largely on two firsthand accounts - one by ship's captain James Riley, and another by crewman Archibald Robbins. Dean also retraced much of Riley's trek, and his selected bibliography is lengthy.<br />Near death, the crew puts back into shore and, unable to find water, throws themselves on the mercy of the first nomads they encounter. The men are immediately stripped naked, then parceled out as slaves - after a bloody and protracted fight among the desert dwellers. Their first guzzle of water and sour camel's milk rips through their intestines, a cycle that is to be repeated throughout their ordeal.<br />Separated, sunburned, depleted, still naked and unable to keep up, the men are put on camels. \\"It is no coincidence that a camel's gait is called a `rack'.\\" Blood was soon dripping from chafed thighs and calves.<br />The ordeal goes from horror to worse. The nomads themselves often have nothing to eat or drink; bloody encounters and thievery are common. The sailors are worth rather less than a lame camel. Less than a good blanket, in fact.<br />The physical suffering is enough to make you marvel at their will to live, but Dean also conveys the helplessness of slavery. Purposely dehumanized, their lives are entirely subject to commerce or whim. Riley, a man of his time who, Dean speculates, may have planned on acquiring a slave cargo, became a fervent abolitionist on his return.<br />Riley comes alive on the page as a man of indomitable will, who takes his responsibilities to his men to heart. Eventually he strikes a bargain with an Arab trader, a promise based on a lie and a gamble that develops into something more personal, if precarious. The denouement is a protracted drama of danger, diplomacy and daring that will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br />Riley's book was a best selling sensation, which remained in print long after his death, so a certain amount of skepticism is necessary. But the later events of his life bear out his energy, strength and charisma. Dean's (\\"Patrick O'Brian: A Life Revealed\\") stirring account, fleshed out with information about the desert, the people, their history and the cultural importance of Islam, as well as the extremes the human body can endure, is as culturally informative as it is exciting.el at their will to live, but Dean also conveys the helplessness of slavery.

And in the palace above her lies a woman born on the same day as Francisca, Maria Luisa, Queen of Spain, dying of poison.<br />With this ending in store, why read further? But among Harrison's gifts is that of arousing curiosity. From the first page, the reader wants to know how every event came to pass. Francisca's father, a dreamer like his daughter, burns his mulberry trees and plants a new improved strain which the worms will not eat.<br />&quot;From this time forward, with my grandfather dead and Papa ruined, the fortunes of the Luarca family would be left to the ingenuity of its women. Hardly a bad thing, on the face of it, as Luarca women lacked for neither talent nor tenacity. In fact, my mother was soon discovered to possess a rare gift, and it was this gift which provided her passport to the palace. It was this gift that would save us for a time, before it also brought destruction.&quot;<br />With each small leap into a more terrible future, Harrison spins a strong cord binding her reader deeper into the story. The narrative is Francisca's but from the beginning her life runs in tandem with that of Spain's future queen, Marie Louise de Bourbon, niece of Louis XIV, a girl who couldn't be more different from Francisca and whose life actually crosses hers only twice.<br />Francisca's dreams turn to ashes as they come to pass. Marie Louise, too carefree to dream, is plunged into a painful reality as soon as she crosses the border from France to Spain. It seems entirely natural, in Harrison's hands, that Francisca should reveal the new queen's most intimate thoughts and emotions as her horror grows, yoked to a grotesque and impotent man. For dreams, Maria Luisa (as she now is) must turn to opium.<br />As the queen, a faithful wife, is more and more reviled for childlessness, Francisca embraces a grand forbidden passion with her priest. The two women's stories unfold alternately in rich, vivid prose steeped in Francisca's magic realism and the morbid superstition that ruled Spain.<br />The Inquisition is everywhere. With cart horses' hooves muffled to deaden the noise of the Inquisitor's night arrival, neighbors disappear. Only their empty shoes left by the door reveal their fate. Anything - a sick child, a dead calf - or nothing at all, may attract the attention of the Inquisitor. Witches abound and in the palace a whole wing is given over to strange creatures who may foretell the future with their bleeding feet or divine secrets with a touch of their hands.<br />These are turbulent, fearful times when the freakish is either fashionable or cursed and good fortune may be a sign of sorcery. Horrible tortures exalt God and purify the souls of witches. Self-mortification is glorified.<br />Harrison's earthy, luminous and intimate prose brings these turbulent dark days into the mind of the reader where it lingers long after the passions of Francisca have been stilled and the husk of the queen has been shattered to release her trapped soul.reveal the new queen's most intimate thoughts and emotions as her horror grows, yoked to a grotesque and impotent man.

She contemplates the changes in her body and forms a secretive friendship with the Viscount's shy son. She also comes perilously close to losing her life in impulsive, childish stunts - swimming alone in the deepest section of the quarry pool, striking a match in a dry barn full of hay.<br />The book opens in September, when summer should be over and school should have begun. But the teachers are on strike and the drought has taken on an implacable force that saps the will of warm blooded creatures. &quot;Gradually, though, objects took on a life of their own and moved without the spirits' help, rising from the surfaces of furniture through empty air that the heat had squeezed even gravity out of.&quot;<br />Recalling that summer in all its torrid detail, Alison wanders into the history of her family - her bookish, now-blind, strong-willed grandmother; her taciturn, hard-working grandfather; her sad-fated, childlike father; solid, enduring mother; her two brothers, one so stolid and silent, the other a quivering mass of nerves and worries, her sister who already seems a guest on the verge of leaving.<br />Alison draws us into the lives of the other villagers as well - the Rector who wrestles intellectually with his faith in an empty 26-room house, the brooding farmer who'd left home for a dozen years when his father criticized his table manners, the hedge-layer, Martin, &quot;the friendliest man in the village, and the most lonely.&quot;<br />Slowly, at various intervals over the course of Alison's free-ranging story, the details of their histories emerge, until each character stands revealed, perfectly ordinary and wondrously strange, with lives of poignant heroisms, hard-won joys and crushing defeats.<br />Dialogue is in the vernacular of the Devon countrypeople and the characters are farmers, each with a supplemental trade - slaughterer, glazier. The Freemantles are no different, yet, choosing wives from outside the village, they stand slightly apart, slightly more prosperous, with a bigger house.<br />Under the singular heat the soil turns to dust, the hay dries to wisps in the fields, the cows' ribs protrude, the hens eggs turn transparent and yolkless. Tension simmers, occasionally erupts. There is death and betrayal. Love affairs begin and end. But there is no single driving  event, no plot. That the novel succeeds in grabbing and holding the reader is due to the Alison's strong and lively narrative voice - quite a feat for any novelist, amazing in a novice.<br />Humorous, sad, magical, &quot;In the Place of Fallen Leaves&quot; is a beautiful novel.illage, and the most lonely.&quot;<br />Slowly, at various intervals over the course of Alison's free-ranging story, the details of their histories emerge, until each character stands revealed, perfectly ordinary and wondrously strange, with lives of poignant heroisms, hard-won joys and crushing defeats.<br />Dialogue is in the vernacular of the Devon countrypeople and the characters are farmers, each with a supplemental trade - slaughterer, glazier.

Poetic, atmospheric prose combines with the small mysteries of behavior to create a duality of beauty and menace. This undercurrent of tension ebbs and flows, like a low-grade fever threatening to erupt over efforts to cope with love and grief and issues too large to grasp and hold.<br />Grieving sculptor Kate Frobisher is the widow of Ben, a photographic journalist who traveled the world's wars. He was killed by a sniper just after photographing a still life of abandoned Soviet tanks in Afghanistan. As the book opens, Kate loses control of her car on a winter night and suffers injuries to her neck and back, which prevent her from resuming work on her latest commission - a monumental Christ figure for an outdoor promontory, which will be viewed from afar as well as up close, presenting profound technical difficulties for the artist, who must make the statue work from two very different vantage points.<br />Stephen Sharkey, a colleague and close friend of Ben's, has come to the countryside to write a book on war, perception, and the journalists' effects on what they see. He will be using Ben's photographs in his book. He and Ben were in New York on 9/11 and Stephen is reminded that life goes on in all its mundane triumphs and tragedies when he calls home to connect with his wife that night only to discover her infidelity. But it's not until after Ben's death that he quits his job, gets a divorce, and starts his book.<br />Stephen's working retreat is a cottage belonging to his physician brother, Robert, near Kate's old farmhouse. Robert and his wife, Beth, have a son with Asperger's syndrome, cared for by Justine, the 19-year-old daughter of the local vicar, a man of deliberate conscience who takes in former convicts. Justine, recovering from an affair with one of them, Peter, a rather aloof, handsome enigma, takes up with Stephen, who finds himself rejuvenated, if a little self-conscious. Peter, recommended by the vicar, has become a temporary assistant to Kate, who dislikes having anyone around while she is working, but requires the physical aid.<br />Each has suffered (or will suffer) some trauma, or at least setback, that affects their perceptions and progress through life. It's only the war-ravaged dead for whom the violation is final, although witnesses, perpetrators and those who interpret the images of atrocities to the wider public immortalize their suffering.<br />Stephen ponders the novel's overt themes -perception and violence - while negotiating his way through an affair with a girl young enough to be his daughter. \\" `Why won't you watch the news?' he asked [Justine]. It staggered him, this indifference to what was going on in the world.\\" Justine, parroting her previous lover, says she can read the papers. \\" `It's the voyeurism of looking at it, that's what's wrong.' \\"<br />With Kate, Stephen discusses the filmmaker on 9/11 who shut off his camera rather than film burning people and Goya's clamorous paintings of violence. \\" `It's that argument he's having with himself, all the time, between the ethical problems of showing the atrocities and yet the need to say, \\"Look, this is what's happening.\\" ' \\"<br />And, as ever, life goes on. Kate struggles with interpretations - of her massive Christ and of her own growing uneasiness with Peter as well as the drastic alteration Ben's death has made in her life. Justine, missing her first year at Cambridge because of an illness, bored and broken-hearted, is both more wary and more uninhibited with Stephen. Beth, trying to seem worldlier to her unfaithful husband, works a stressful job when she'd rather be home with her garden and her troubled son.<br />Barker's writing is simultaneously earthy and mysterious, lofty and mundane. Symbolism and mystery tantalize, while sex and weather and bickering move the plot through its paces. A fine, memorable novel.its paces. A fine, memorable novel.	2004-03-09

One of the funniest - really - is a description of the author's first colonoscopy. Fabiano's wife plays the straight man in many of these pieces and comes off as a very good sport.

They stand on branches as well as on the ground, the better to reach fruit in the trees. For our earliest ancestors, living in areas of mixed trees and grass, shuffling between trees would have been more efficient than dropping to all fours.<br />Stanford reminds us that evolution is not a straightforward progression towards something better, but rather a natural product of what works best for the animal's ability to reproduce. Where upright posture favored feeding and energy conservation, it persisted, with a gradual shift to greater bipedalism.<br />Bipedalism led to everything else. He theorizes that walking, by increasing efficiency over distance and freeing the hands, created better hunters, and the high caloric, protein diet helped fuel the expansion of the brain. He outlines the hunting strategies of the modern ape and how these may have evolved in early hominids.<br />Again and again he returns to the modern ape to compare behavior and anatomy, similarity and divergence, throughout the hominid fossil record. Bipedalism is an anatomical trade off. Our broad pelvis, backbone shape and large gluteal muscles give us stability and forward efficiency, and free the lungs from coordination with stride (eventually permitting speech), but decrease climbing ability, make childbirth difficult, and deliver a baggage of back problems.<br />The history of hominid research is one of many stories and few bones. Stanford traces this history, showing how new finds give rise to new, frequently opposing, theories, how the same scrap of bone can be described in starkly different terms by equally eminent and adamant scientists, how psychology, imagination, ambition, and graduate schools have as much (or more) to do with evolutionary views as hard evidence does. Stanford also looks at bipedalism in the big picture - dinosaurs - which had a wide range of bipedal habits without developing speech or big brains.<br />The writing is clear and well organized. Stanford (\\"Significant Others,\\" \\"The Hunting Apes\\") paints a picture of an Africa teeming with variously bipedal hominids, most of which went extinct comparatively quickly. Others, made powerful by their two sturdy legs, spread out into the world, leaving fossilized remains to prove it. Then there's us, the last wave out of Africa, and the only ones left (according to mitochondrial DNA evidence). Are we the best? Or just the last ones left standing? A fascinating, concise and intelligent book.with evolutionary views as hard evidence does.

Only with farming can people begin to put down roots, feed larger numbers, accumulate pottery, build cities, and construct - or steal- a system of writing to leave an account of themselves for posterity.<br />Farming began in the Near East - Mesopotamia (present day Iraq) - the birthplace of civilization, as every schoolchild learns. Interestingly, and logically, as Cook shows, the last place civilization caught on in the Old World was Western Europe - its best soils being too heavy for the available plow. When a heavier plow was developed halfway through the first millennium, cities sprouted and armies reaped the benefits.<br />In broad strokes (with accompanying broad maps) Cook credits geography, climate and natural resources for driving early advances. Cultural flow is more problematic - why did Greek culture spread while Egyptian did not?  Or why did Buddhism wander to China while Hinduism stayed put in India? Cook raises many such tantalizing questions and explores what evidence there is, offering cogent theories of his own. And he shows how technological advances shaped larger movements - expensive bronze favoring elite rule, while cheap iron empowered the masses, for instance.<br />But if farming made civilization possible, monotheism began to shape the world as we know it. Christianity made its way through the scattered Jewish diaspora of the Roman Empire and was, as a political expedient, finally adopted as the state religion by Constantine. It then became attractive to frontier peoples as a trapping of civilization. Islam (Cook's specialty) solved a political difficulty by uniting two Arab tribes in Arabia to form a state, which then had the power to coordinate a wave of conquest, which resulted in the largest empire ever.<br />Cook organizes his book in four parts.  He begins with an overview of prehistory and inevitable development and concludes with a question, \\"Toward One World?\\" which embraces the Islamic expansion, the European expansion and the modern world. Three-part chapters within each of these sections focus on broad geographical masses and the cultural developments within, then draw it all together by homing in on particular features: the complicated marriageability rules among the Australian Aranda, Chinese ancestor worship, caste and sexuality in Hinduism, Greek pottery and more.<br />Much is left out; much is simplified. Naturally. And the most interesting bits are the story-like chapter conclusions. But Cook uses these to illustrate his broader points and to show the individual peculiarities of human cultures. His writing is lucid, often witty, and seldom dry. And he gives an extensive \\"further reading\\" list for each chapter.

For this novel, she has chosen the famous medieval tapestries, which appear to show a ladys seduction of a unicorn (now hanging in a Paris museum).<br />The story opens in 1490 Paris. Nicolas des Innocents, a talented, arrogant artist, receives a commission for bloody battle tapestries from Jean le Viste, a nouveau aristocrat, rich and important at court, but a man of little taste. Glad for the work, but uninspired by the subject, Nicolas welcomes the distraction of a beautiful young girl summoning him to le Vistes wife.<br />Assuming the girl to be a maid, Nicolas embarks on his usual seduction (one le Viste maid is already big with his child), which involves a suggestive unicorn story.

His wife and two daughters feature prominently, as always, allowing him to play the hapless, push-over curmudgeon. Wry and economical with words, Trillin takes on any aspect of American culture that strikes his fancy and gets to the nub of absurdity without ever resorting to sneers or viciousness. A delight, as Trillin's collections always are.	2004-02-10

Her husband's congregation does not share her sanguine view, however. Upon her return from a short holiday, which has made her acutely aware of the Bosnian war through her friendship with a refugee waiter, Rosemary finds plots afoot to oust her from her role in church activities.<br />While not particularly attached to these activities, Rosemary resents the plotters' methods. And when her refugee friend turns up at the vicarage, she must aid him and thwart the tide of gossip as well. The murder, when it finally occurs, bringing in Barnard's black detective Charlie Peace, serves to force all the undercurrents out in the open. As much a witty novel of manners as a suspenseful mystery, &quot;Samaritan&quot; is distinguished by its crisp writing and wry perception of character.	2004-02-04

Sound familiar? Mary Willis Walker's &quot;Under the Beetle's Cellar&quot; develops a very similar premise. Both books even include an asthmatic among the kidnapped children.<br /><br />But in Deaver's skillful hands, the story works again. The two protagonists are Arthur Potter, senior FBI negotiator, nearing retirement, and Melanie Charrol, a young, timid deaf teacher whose lonely passion is music. The three kidnappers are prison escapees who have already killed three people before holing up in an abandoned slaughterhouse with the terrified hostages. Potter works against time to get inside the head of their leader, Lou Handy, and derail his threat to kill one hostage every hour until his demands are met.<br />Meanwhile, state officials have their own agenda, as does the press, and their machinations ratchet up the suspense in several different directions. And, inside, Melanie fights her fears, holding onto an image of Potter (who she has glimpsed outside) as inspiration, and works feverishly to save at least a few of the girls.<br />Deaver's characterizations - the outbursts of rebellion and tears among the children, the gleeful coldbloodedness of Handy, Potter's feverish analysis and risky gambles, Melanie's terrified bravery - hurtle the plot forward, while the slaughterhouse atmosphere is dank and cold, and the action is non-stop, right up to a couple of switch-back twists at the end.	2004-02-04

The cars then vanish.<br />That night it becomes more personal when Montero herself witnesses a car-jacking that goes wrong - resulting in the killing of a baby and the maiming of its mother.

They vanish into the roadside woods when a new pick-up truck, also with New Hampshire plates, pulls up.<br />The truck leaves but the pair's car turns up at the scene of a drowning. The dead girl resembles Melinda but her face is unrecognizable, smashed up, according to the police, by the rocks in the water. Cuddy, unconvinced, goes looking for the boy, who reminds him of a dead buddy in Vietnam.<br />He traces the boy's home to Elton, New Hampshire, where the taciturn police are unhelpful and the the boy's even more taciturn parents heighten Cuddy's suspicions with their spooky religious zeal. A run-in with the driver of the pick-up results in a gruesome killing in self-defense with a rather shocking aftermath. It also results in Cuddy's next lead.<br />Armed with false identification and an illegal gun, Cuddy heads for the Florida Keys (stopping off at the Vietnam Memorial in D.C. for a poignant visit) to investigate an evangelical religious organization where he suspects the boy is being kept.<br />But the heavily secured compound is open only to privileged church members.

She asks Genevieve to report its condition.<br />Shocked that something so valuable could be simply abandoned -for whatever reason - Genevieve appropriates it as a trysting place, her curiosity only slightly piqued by the abandoned, burned car in the garage, the photographs hidden away, the food and champagne left in the refrigerator.<br />And so begins a story in tandem as Genevieve's stolen meetings alternate with Stella's story of her own doomed love. Character precipitates the events of the plot, and as we increasingly sympathize with Stella's shy dignity and Genevieve's fretful ardor, foreboding envelops the narrative like a London fog.

Maggie Darling, the quintessential Connecticut celebrity hostess, parades her prodigious efficiency from the first page as she surveys her domain, in splendid readiness for \\"The Christmas Feast for Two Hundred.\\"<br />This breathlessly detailed perfection, capped by the arrival of the first glittering guests and Maggie's ritual panic attack, captures Maggie's life at its peak. But all that is about to change.<br />In the midst of her party, Maggie catches her husband of 26 years in flagrant infidelity and casts him out that very night. It might seem that life could only improve with the dissolute rou&eacute; banished from her life, but, instead, life begins to unravel. Maggie succumbs to several unsuitable entanglements; her attempt to rescue an old friend backfires; friends and family members become involved in shady activities and worse; crime grows rampant, and the world itself seems to be crumbling around her.<br />But rather than give in to encroaching despair, Maggie rouses herself to cook, or at least make a list, thereby fending off chaos for another day. Though Kunstler (\\"The Geography of Nowhere,\\" \\"The Halloween Ball\\") grants Maggie plenty of human frailties, meanness is not among them and neither is snobbishness, despite her exacting, stylish, rich-gal standards. She is delightful and Kunstler's writing has a stylish, precise archness and a madcap energy that suit his heroine right down to the over-the-top ending. Kunstler's first novel in 10 years is a winner.	2004-02-02

Thomasina, Holly's shattered mother, shocks everyone by running off to Egypt with a retired general, never having set eyes on her grandchild.

Acerbic and funny, but without the venal self-absorption of the rest of the gang, these three help work the story to a satisfying conclusion, as Gardam adroitly allows all of her characters at least a modicum of self-knowledge.

Carl Turnage, bachelor awning salesman, on the doorstep of middle age, and self-conscious about his lack of height and high voice, has always taken care of the women in his family.<br />He was an only child, doted on by his mother and her two childless sisters, but now Aunt Lil is all that's left. Lil has had a bad fall and landed in the Rosehaven Convalescence Home, a pleasant convivial place, as such places go. Though many get around in wheelchairs, the patients are at least mobile (sicker ones are shipped out).<br />Carl is shocked at his favorite aunt's rapid decline since her fall, but Lil still enjoys planning - and executing - outings, and talks of going home. After one particularly harrowing experience, Carl resolves to speak to her about giving up driving, but somehow Lil evades this conversation. When not lunching out with Carl, Lil likes to sit on the porch, smoke a cigarette, and hatch schemes with fellow residents.<br />One of these - a delightful plan to make churches and nursing homes interchangeable - inspires the excitable L. Ray Flowers, an itinerant preacher in temporary residence recovering from an injury. Though put-off by the preacher's volubility, Carl, too, is inspired by the man. He takes up the country music he's always loved and joins the preacher in weekly performances. But time brings decline in a place like Rosehaven and the playful interlude can't last.<br />Edgerton (\\"Raney,\\" \\"Walking Across Egypt,\\" \\"Where Trouble Sleeps\\"), switches points of view to reveal inner turmoil - Lil's sad secret, Carl's insecurities, dreams, and brief lapses from sainthood. The strong ending is both sad and heart-warming. As usual, Edgerton's touch is deft.	2004-02-02

Chance and greed enter the mix, precipitating action.<br />Meanwhile, Alberg is contemplating reluctant retirement to marry Cassandra Mitchell, still recovering from her ordeal in &quot;Touch Of Panic&quot;.

Melanie's home life is strict and Wexford assumes she's shaking off the yoke until the claims adviser who helped Melanie at the job center is found murdered.<br />Meanwhile Wexford's whiny daughter Sylvia and ill-matched husband are both jobless and going on the dole. Wexford, fretted by guilt at his impatience towards his daughter, and knowing that he would not be making daily visits to Melanie's parents if they were not black, muses over social attitudes, ingrained prejudice and motives for murder until the body of a young black woman is discovered.<br />There are few blacks in Kingsmarkham and despite several small clues to the contrary, Wexford assumes it's Melanie. After a night of grief, the family arrives at the mortuary only to find a stranger.<br />Wexford, mortified, approaches the three-part investigation with new insight - re-examining every assumption, taking note of every tiny discrepancy.<br />Kingsmarkham is large enough to encompass slums, council flats and elaborate estates, allowing Rendell to involve a wealthy and flashy female politician, a surgeon and his lackadaisically privileged children, a petty thief, an adulterous businessman, unemployed youth and a hidden black underclass in a story that unwinds in dark twists and turns of grubby secrets.<br />Although the explosive ending may seem unrealistically grotesque to some, it's still vintage Rendell - suspenseful and wholly absorbing.	2004-02-02

Klempner's first novel concerns the defense of a homeless man charged with felony murder - a death caused during the commission of a crime. It's a headline case, since the dead man is the police commissioner, and appears hopeless since the defendant, ignorant of the felony murder law, freely admits robbing the man who apparently died of a heart attack during the mugging.<br />Court-appointed defense attorney Dean Abernathy is overwhelmed by the prosecution's evidence which includes two eye witnesses, a knife and a signed confession. There are some contradictions in the evidence and the district attorney seems to be stonewalling unnecessarily but Abernathy tends to believe the prosecution's case.<br />However, Abernathy is thorough. And when the seemingly pointless contradictions begin adding up, he digs further, getting a fortuitously big break from a blue movie. As Abernathy embarks on the trail of an explosive conspiracy, he finds himself falling in love and confronting an ethical and professional dilemma of momentous proportions.<br />Klempner's writing style matches his protagonist - thorough - with careful attention to legal detail. Although the plot becomes somewhat unwieldy, with a couple of holes big enough to drive a truck through, the legal maneuvering is fascinating and Abernathy is an appealing and determined character.	2004-02-02

But to him it was an opportunity to write about the personal accomplishments of interesting people. \\"I was never happier,\\" he says.<br />Each of the superb pieces in this collection of writing from the 1960s to the 1990s exemplifies his elevation of curiosity to an art form. The opening piece, \\"New York Is a City of Things Unnoticed,\\" his first article for \\"Esquire,\\" in 1960, (and the opening of his first book, \\"New York: A Serendipiter's Journey\\") combines elements from a number of stories he had written for the \\"Times.\\" Talese portrays the city's vastness and variety in a catalog of wonders and personal vignettes and portraits, from the gallons of soap used on a big day at Yankee Stadium to the doorman with parts of three bullets in his head, to a snapshot of the city during its quietest hour (5 a.m.).<br />Many of these pieces are classic profiles of famous people. \\"Frank Sinatra Has a Cold,\\" is a riveting portrait of a complex man at the center of his universe, not always comfortable, but always in command. For this piece - one of his most famous - Talese never spoke to the man, using only his considerable powers of observation and fleshing it out with brief interviews with family, friends, employees and fans.<br />There are several profiles of prize fighters, including a particularly poignant one of Floyd Patterson after his loss to Sonny Liston, in which Patterson describes himself as a coward: \\"He stopped. He stood very still in the middle of the room, thinking about what he had just said, probably wondering whether he should have said it.\\" Talese pursues the subject and Patterson explains, \\"It's in defeat that a man reveals himself. In defeat I can't face people. I haven't the strength to say to people, `I did my best, I'm sorry, and whatnot.' \\" Over his career Talese has written 38 articles on Patterson, which may help explain why the fighter is so forthcoming.<br />\\"Joe Louis: The King as a Middle-Aged Man,\\" and \\"Ali in Havana\\" also portray the fighters after their heyday. These portraits are affectionate, admiring. Though virtually crippled by Parkinson's disease, Ali signs his full name for autographs, though it takes him 30 seconds for each one. \\"He does not settle for a time saving `Ali' or his mere initials. He has never shortchanged his audience.\\"<br />As for Louis, his reputation for naivety and, well, dimness, is legendary. \\"And so it was with some unexpected elation that I found Joe Louis to be an astute businessman in New York, a shrewd bargainer, and a man with a sense of humor often quite subtle.\\"<br />A profile of the \\"New York Times\\" obituary writer, Alden Whitman, \\"Mr. Bad News\\" is a gem of appreciation, humor and personality as well as an inside look at the job where Talese honed his own profiling skills.<br />Two pieces show another side of Talese - rapier-sharp, satirical wit, made all the sharper for flashes of admiration. \\"Looking for Hemingway,\\" portrays George Plimpton's \\"Paris Review\\" crowd as a group of dilettantish (but talented) poseurs, and \\"Vogueland,\\" is a hilarious view of \\"Vogue\\" magazine's muscular snobbery.<br />Talese, all but invisible in his profiles, reflects on his own life and work in several later pieces; two on writing, \\"Origins of a Non-Fiction Writer,\\" and \\"When I Was Twenty-Five,\\" and one on the resurgence of Puritanism in New York, \\"Walking My Cigar.\\" \\"The Brave Tailors of Maida\\" is taken from \\"Unto the Sons,\\" his book about his Italian father.<br />Each of these wonderful pieces attests to Talese's talent as a close observer and a careful listener, skills honed from his childhood eavesdropping on customers at his parents' shop. Author of the bestsellers \\"The Kingdom and the Power\\" (about \\"The New York Times\\") his mafia profile, \\"Honor They Father\\" and his expose of sexual mores \\"Thy Neighbors Wife,\\" as well as a previous collection, \\"Fame & Obscurity,\\" Talese is a writer to savor.of Puritanism in New York, \\"Walking My Cigar.\\" \\"The Brave Tailors of Maida\\" is taken from \\"Unto the Sons,\\" his book about his Italian father.<br />Each of these wonderful pieces attests to Talese's talent as a close observer and a careful listener, skills honed from his childhood eavesdropping on customers at his parents' shop.

Steve Carella lands the case, but he and his fellow cops at the 87th precinct expect the FBI to snatch it away any second. Though none of them have heard of Tamar, it's clearly a glitzy case.<br />The feds get into it, albeit late, but Carella stays on, thanks to Barney Loomis, Tamar's big-shot producer. McBain has fun with the posturing and politics of the FBI and the posturing and glamor of the music industry. The Lewis Carroll theme and distortions-on-a-theme are clever and amusing. He's up to his own high standards of crisp, humorous dialogue and dry observation as the procedural story unfolds at a page-turning clip. Point of view switches among the cops, and with scenes from Tamar's viewpoint, showing her to be a gutsy, determined and observant 20-year old.<br />Everything about this story is just right, in fact, except the climax, which is as jarring as it is predictable. An ending which spoils the mood of the whole. McBain hasn't lost his touch, but this time it packs an unpleasant punch.	2004-02-01

Eddie knows it's got to have some connection to the Russian mob, but what?<br />Not one to hang around thinking (a character trait that usually, but not always, works for him), he goes after his old Russian boss, who points him to the new boss, Borodenko. Eddie firebombs the man's car to get his attention and that night someone slings Eddie's crooked ex-partner's severed head at his front door.<br />The feds jump into the mix, looking to trade for Russian mob secrets. Eddie will take any help he can get, but knows he's mostly on his own. Dee's Russians are truly, badly scary and the tangled plot material - Russian medicare fraud, gas tax schemes, car smuggling, money laundering and murder; FBI wiretaps and deals; crooked cops, and Italian mafiosi rip offs - feels as authentic as it is fascinating.<br />But the engine powering this story is Eddie. Relentless Eddie proves unstoppable. Even he doesn't know what he might do next. With his keen intelligence, and deep, but not self-pitying, regrets, this fearless implacability makes him a rivetting protagonist.<br />From Coney Island to the Dunne family Irish bar in Yonkers, Dee knows the sociopaths, con-artists, grimmer corners and old neighborhoods of New York. His characters, from 6-year-old Grace to the incomprehensible ruthless Russians, live and breathe on the page. A terrific read.	2004-02-01

London journalist and first-time novelist Kelly then jumps back a week, introducing Dryden on his way to a watery crime scene in the damp, frozen Cambridgeshire Fens.<br />He rides in a decrepit taxi driven by the mountainous, mostly silent Humph, kept on retainer by Dryden, who hasn't driven a car since the accident that put his wife, Laura, into a coma two years earlier. Philip was driving. His car was startled off the road into one of the Fens rivers and he remembers little else, except that he was pulled out in time and his wife wasn't. He left his fast-track Fleet Street job and came home to the Fens to become senior reporter for the local weekly and visit his wife's hospital room in the evenings.<br />The police are winching a car out of the water when Dryden arrives. In the trunk is a body. But when a second body  - 30 years dead- turns up during some restoration work on the cathedral roof, Dryden's investigative skills prove more adept than those of the local police. He seizes his chance to trade newspaper resources for the sealed file on his accident. But the killer doesn't plan to sit idly by and let Dryden ferret him out.<br />Kelly requires diligence from his reader, particularly at the start, as the story unfolds by association rather than chronology. But the author rewards our attention. Flashes of humor and brilliant visuals accompany the brooding insularity of rural society and guarded secrets as Dryden chips away layers of deceit and betrayal.<br />\\"A dedicated physical coward of extraordinary range,\\" Dryden knows \\"with sickening self-knowledge that his bravery was the product of a tremendous desire to show off.\\" He's also tenacious and irreverent and burdened with guilt. A great man to have along on a story, Dyden's first venture should be the beginning of a fine new career for Kelly.	2004-02-01

British soldiers are billeted throughout the tavern she has managed for her Uncle Samuel (a Patriot) since losing her husband and son to a fever eight years before. Her 15-year-old-daughter is smitten with one of the dashing young officers; one slip of her rebel tongue would lose the tavern to the British; and then she finds a guest's body in one of the rooms, impaled by a sword.<br />Pocketing evidence to keep it out of the hands of an imperious British captain, Abigail lands herself in the midst of an intrigue of espionage and treachery. And she still has a tavern to run.<br />The tavern milieu is exceptionally well done - from clothing, wartime food concerns and the useful organization of the warming kitchen, to the stables, sleeping accommodations, the fine meals and gossipy service, the evening card games and brandy, and the behind-the-scenes work of laundry, kitchen and bill-paying - all of it organic to the setting and plot.<br />The British and Patriot points-of-view are also subtly done, and the mystery sufficiently baffling. A strong woman who balances on a knife-edge of neutrality, and knows how to pick her battles, Abigail is an appealing, intelligent heroine.	2004-01-19

Rescued (as Joseph) by an evangelical, itinerant preacher who's aghast when he discovers her deception, but then secretly performs a marriage ceremony, Josie embraces religion and love.<br />But calamity is never far away in the war-torn colonies as roving bands of redcoats vie with vigilante patriots in cruelty towards their enemies. When the preacher, John, is seized by the British and his cabin burned, Josie flees again and - still dressed as a man - joins the North Carolina militia, where (as we know from the prologue) she is wounded and her disguise revealed.<br />The story's near-constant fever pitch of danger and desperation is disrupted from time to time by a switch to John's point of view, and a man tormented by his own human frailties is not nearly as interesting as a girl marching to war in the freezing mud without boots, or even shoes.<br />Josie's period-perfect voice and the eloquent immediacy of Morgan's (\\"Gap Creek,\\" \\"This Rock\\") descriptive prose keep the reader immersed in a world of hurt and hardship. The battlefield scenes are a riveting mess of confusion, blood, terror and bewilderment, and the love scenes are transporting. A visceral story, elegantly told.	2004-01-19

The Barbados section is the most dramatic; its emotions raw and violent. Every aspect of life is tainted with the tension, fear and hate between slave and master, and the white societys total rejection of anything local or non-white, even effective medicines.<br />The period detail is colorful and organic, from the political and religious turmoil of the time, to personal details of dress, food and accepted thought on a wide range of issues involving medicine, marriage, birth, slavery (in Barbados Balthasar owns slaves), and a mans place in society.

The victim was killed with an antique harpoon, recently acquired by the tribe from the Smithsonian, along with the mummy it belonged to.  The mummy was immediately \\"liberated\\" from the local museum, where it had been put on display, but the obvious suspects have good alibis.<br />As Active digs deeper, tribal legends and old traditions come into play. Understanding how the pieces fit into a modern murder requires the help of various villagers, including Active's birth mother and grandfather. The spectacular setting takes a central and active role too as Active asserts himself in places he may not be ready for.

Thumps knows Stick didn't kill anybody, but his evasions and disappearance aren't helping.<br />GoodWeather plays the casino controversy without overplaying, and Thumps' sleuthing is well paced, allowing a range of believably quirky characters to emerge.

As Israeli author Yehoshua's novel opens, Rivlin fidgets in the background of his Arab student's wedding, miserable, and impatient to be home.<br />\\"His wife, Hagit, who knew all too well how weddings had depressed him in recent years, had warned against it. `Why do you need the aggravation?' she had asked. `But they're Arabs,' he'd answered mildly, with the innocence of a man pursuing an academic interest. `As opposed to what?' she had wanted to know. `Human beings?' `On the contrary...on the contrary...' he had tried defending himself, at a loss to explain how Arabs, although not among the many objects of his envy, could be more human than anyone else.\\"<br />In this rather melancholy and enigmatic comedy of manners, Yehoshua explores the intimacy of hatred and interdependence and ordinary decency in the Palestinian/Israeli situation. Rivlin is a professor of Arab Studies at Haifa University, unable to finish a book exploring the Algerian independence fight because of his incomprehension of the 1990s carnage there. His department head speaks fluent Arabic and publicly despairs of the Arabs ever understanding the concept of freedom. His ambitious and newly married student, Samaher, has failed to finish a paper for her degree and as the novel proceeds, the reasons are increasingly mysterious.<br />But it's the mystery of his son, Ofer's, divorce that obsesses Rivlin. It's an unsettled time for him - a new apartment; his wife, a judge, preoccupied with an important, secret case; his book in the doldrums. The death of his son's former father-in-law provides just the excuse he needs to go sniffing around his former in-laws, prodding Galya, the remarried daughter-in-law, for answers, which he does not get.<br />During the course of the story, Rivlin finds himself giving in to uncharacteristic impulse - a tense, heady night accompanying an Arab Israeli to visit his homesick sister in Galilee, unable to return to her home in Israel because of her marriage to a Palestinian, attending a concert at a Palestinian Christian Church, spending the night there waiting to pick up Arab workers at dawn, and repeated visits to the in-laws, cajoling secrets out of his their trusted Arab retainer.<br />Yehoshua's characters are educated people and very civilized toward each other in Haifa, Israel's most peacefully integrated city. But underneath the Arab hospitality simmers a resentment which bubbles easily to the surface, while the Jews cannot help a certain condescension that goes with their unstable, but dominant position.

She begins with the violence - a bus blown up by a suicide bomber, then follows the tentacles of conflict into everyday life. It's the violence that fuels the youth culture of work hard, play hard, and fosters a cross-cultural, patriotic military solidarity that cuts through religious and political differences.<br />While the first section concentrates on what Israelis share, the second divides them into groups. The European Ashkenazi, educated, dominant, and often secular, arouse resentment in the middle-Eastern Mizrahi who are more religious, more conservative and poorer. Then there are the Russians, hordes of them, mostly secular, and many not even Jewish (only one Jewish grandparent is required for immigration). And strangest of all, the Ethiopians, wholly isolated and heroically rescued, many of whom never saw electricity until emigration.<br />The third section explores religious differences: the anti-Zionist Haredim who, ironically, absorb the most from the welfare state with their large families and non-working, scholarly fathers; the Orthodox, who make up the bulk of the settlers in the occupied territories, and write the rules for marriage and divorce, and the Non-Orthodox who make up 80 percent of the population. Then there are the non-Jews: the Muslims, Christians, Druze and Bedouin.<br />And finally there's the sexual revolution - marriage and divorce, homosexuality, prostitution.<br />Rosenthal lets individual voices emerge from the clamor and cacaphony to plead their way of life with fervor, hope, defiance and sometimes bewilderment. Her reportage and history blend seamlessly with the interviews to provide context. This is a masterful portrait of a country built on a commonality, but rife with contradictions.

Rachel's uncle Pono is chased down by the Health Inspector and taken away - a leper - and Rachel is warned to tell no one. But soon a sore appears on Rachel's leg and then her foot. Though her mother desperately hides the signs for a year, the disease is discovered and Rachel, too, is snatched from her family.<br />Though reunited with her uncle, Rachel is subjected to dehumanizing medical examinations and can see her family only through a barrier. Pono is taken away again, this time to the leper colony of Kalaupappa on the island of Moloka'i. Rachel is only seven when she follows him, though their reunion is brief and she is sent to live in the Catholic dormitory with the other girls. The families left behind are also ostracized, for their association with lepers. Thus far the story is heartbreaking, and bewildering for Rachel, but slowly she begins to adapt to a new life.<br />Though every step forward seems accompanied by another catastrophe - the death of a playmate, loss of contact with her mother, more death - this is not a litany of woe. Brennert paints a vivid picture of a community struggling for normalcy, as people do. Rachel (who has the milder form of Hansen's disease, leaving her comparatively healthy for years) forms friendships, knows joy, marries.<br />Brennert's meticulous research charts the changes in the colony and in Hawaii, as the American presence grows larger. Improvements are made in living conditions and treatments; new experiments provide new hopes  - usually dashed. Missionaries strive successfully against the old \\"pagan\\" ways while Rachel, brought up a Christian, learns about her own culture from Pono's new woman, who becomes a surrogate mother (though her influence is resisted by the colony's Catholic nuns).<br />This is a novel about life amidst overwhelming obstacles and a novel about the disease itself - its mythology, its mystery and the growing triumph of medical knowledge during the twentieth century.

Told in the voices of eight characters in alternating chapters, the story illuminates their patriarchal family- and church-centered lives, the daily privations and hardships of pioneering farmers and, as the world begins to intrude, community turmoil.<br />The baby is the third daughter of Eliza and Yost Hershberger. Her death occurs deep on a March night, after midnight concludes the Sabbath and the family, at Yost's insistence, hurriedly rigs the sugaring apparatus. When they return, the baby is dead, suffocated under her parents' mattress. Polly, Eliza's younger sister, visiting to help with the baby, thought she saw a figure in the window earlier. Yost, extracting hazy details, seizes on her vague description of a jacket to denounce his brother, Reuben, as the murderer.<br />Though Reuben proclaims his innocence, the community sides with Yost, and church leaders formally decree Reuben's shunning. Even his wife, who loves him and knows his innocence, obeys the church and ends their sexual life. There will be no more children  - a public proclamation in a culture of large families. Placed outside church and family, Reuben at first remains proud and steadfast, then moves to the new frontier in Ohio to try and start again, and finally drowns his sorrows in whiskey when the shunning persists.<br />Reuben's failure to confess is like a festering thorn in the church community. It worries at Bishop Isaac's self-doubts and hardens Yost's unreflective determination. It divides families in small unspoken ways and divides family branches between staunch hardliners and wavering sympathizers. These tendencies are reflected through the years as the shunning fades into the background, its reasons forgotten by youngsters, and the church confronts the changing times, often by splitting into angry factions.<br />Miller's prose is simple and unadorned, like the people she animates. Over the decades her narrators work, love, and live within their religion. They withstand the heartbreaking deaths of babies and siblings and parents and spouses, and then die themselves. Their lives are hard, and hard work is a primary virtue. But there is happiness too. Families are close and love the life they've chosen. Religion is the core of their community and it brings them together, though the world threatens.<br />Miller's portrayal is full of sympathy and understanding. She brings the Amish to life from the inside, details emerging in the course of daily life.

Tom Bissell's \\"Eternal Winter\\" explores the death of the Aral Sea, a hopeless Soviet-made ecological disaster with endless ghastly repercussions in a surreal landscape. Peter Chilson writes about the Tuareg rebellion at the edge of the Sahara, in Niger, which perpetually resumes with the harmattan, the dust and sand storms that cripple visibility, allowing swooping raids on merchant caravans through the desert.<br />Scott Carrier witnesses the Afghan view of war and life in Mazar-e-Sharif and makes a harrowing road trip to bombed-out Kabul, while Andrew Solomon, there for much the same purpose, discovers the wonders of Afghan food and hospitality.<br />Ecological warriors are the focus of Patrick Symmes' \\"Blood Wood,\\" and Tom Clynes' \\"They Shoot Poachers, Don't They?\\" Symmes journeys along the Brazilian Amazon meeting fierce and endangered activists striving to stem the lucrative, illegal, and often deadly mahogany trade. Clynes reports on American conservationists in the Central African Republic. \\"Their mission was to drive out the marauding gangs of Sudanese poachers who were rapidly wiping out the region's elephants and other animals. Their authority: shoot on sight.\\"<br />There are pieces on journeys made for their own sake, but these are no vacations. Lawrence Millman has a funny, scary piece on being stranded on an uncharted, uninhabited desert island - in the arctic. And Kira Salak follows the trail of doomed early-19th century explorer Mungo Park, paddling 600 miles down the sometimes very hostile Niger River in an inflatable kayak.<br />For lighthearted contrast there's Michael Specter's profile of rapper Puff Daddy, now a fashion designer, in Paris for Fashion Week, and Lisa Anne Auerback's \\"Pope on a Tow Rope,\\" exploring Pope John Paul II's Polish skiing days.<br />Off the beaten track and often intense, from Wilmington, Delaware to Timbuktu, this all-around fine compilation has all-around appeal.often intense, from Wilmington, Delaware to Timbuktu, this all-around fine compilation has all-around appeal.	2003-12-22

A dubious prospect. But, whether it's youthful enthusiasm or the editor's \\"firm, unrelenting\\" guidance, the result is a funny, serious, edgy, clever and thoughtful mix, for all ages.<br />There's a long, quietly chilling piece on Saddam Hussein by Mark Bowden and a buoyantly resolute piece on growing up American and Muslim during the first Gulf War by V. Kvashay-Boyle.<br />A number of pieces turn on the traumas of childhood and dealing with family. \\"Then there's the time I went as Hitler for Halloween,\\" begins Ryan Boudinot. David Drury gets childhood cruelty and suburban conformity down pat in \\"Things We Knew When the House Caught Fire.\\" David Sedaris, funny as ever, offers up his family on his brother, Rooster's, wedding day, and Jonathan Safran Foer has a clever piece on the silences of family communication. More edgy are Douglas Light's wrenching story of abandoned sisters, J.T. Leroy's tale of an angry, ambitious, homeless boy, and Judy Budnitz' eerie, creepy story of a girl visiting her busted-up brother in the hospital.<br />The journalism is first rate, especially George Packer's fascinating exploration of what, exactly, happens to all those donated clothes, \\"How Susie Bayer's T-Shirt Ended Up on Yusuf Mama's Back;\\" and Chuck Closterman's profile of a tribute band, \\"The Pretenders.\\"<br />Shorter pieces - Sherman Alexie's meditative \\"What Sacagawea Means to Me,\\" as well as the Onion's humorous \\"I'll Try Anything with a Detached Air of Superiority,\\" and Amanda Holzer's brief, smart, story in song titles - round out the mix.<br />Whether funny, grim, hip, winsome or informative, all these pieces are stimulating, gripping, thought-provoking.

It's spring in the Park, a breathtaking time of wildflowers and calving icebergs. Kate is feeling her way through parenting her dead lover's teenage son, Johnny Morgan, and possibly embarking on a romance with State Trooper Jim Chopin. Then a body is found beneath a melting glacier.<br />Everybody knew the dead man, Len Dreyer. As a talented handyman, his skills were in high demand. But, as Kate helps Jim investigate, she finds that while everyone praises his work, no one really knew him at all. This community of self-sufficient loners may be close, but it's not necessarily intimate.<br />This theme recurs again and again - during the investigation, but also in the human drama of Kate's prickly relationships with lovers, friends, her dead Aleut grandmother and her new son. Her independence is a property that requires a lot of room and good fences - with creaky gates.<br />The plot moves right along and danger threatens as Kate probes too deep. Though there's a little too much affectionate banter, there's also plenty of suspense and a disturbing, unexpected ending, but the power behind this one is magnificent Alaska - a place that sets its inhabitants apart.	2003-12-08

Though her brilliant forensic pathologist, Kay Scarpetta, has gotten increasingly earnest, self-righteous and humorless over the last few books, my annoyance hasn't hindered the turning of the pages. And, while this latest is a bit of a slog, I eagerly await the next.<br />Scarpetta, after the unhappy debacle concluding \\"The Last Precinct\\" is now a private forensic consultant. Still mired in her grief over her slain FBI lover, she is called in to consult on a Louisiana cold case, because of a letter the coroner received from a serial killer on death row - the repulsive Jean-Baptiste Chandonne. The outcast \\"wolfman\\" of the ruthless French crime family, long obsessed with Scarpetta, Chandonne has been busy with his letter writing, much like a boy poking a hornet's nest.<br />What results is a page-turning mess, which involves Chandonne's twin brother (\\"Black Notice\\") on a serial-killing rampage which dovetails with Scarpetta's cold case, a conspiracy of unbelievable complexity and motivation, and some very dubious black ops work. Trouble is, if you don't read this one, you'll never figure out what's going on in the next one.

It all begins with a skeleton on a piece of scrub land in Lincoln Prairie where the African-American former Chicago cop now works and lives with her mother, husband and three children.<br />The skeleton turns out to be a Potawotami Indian, but before Marti and her partner \\"Vik\\" Jessenovick can identify him, a budding archaeologist working on a dig for the prominent Smith family is killed in an apparent accident on the site. The family has been plagued by peculiar accidents throughout its history, which dates from Ibdash Smith, reputed to be a link on the Underground Railroad.<br />Meanwhile, point of view switches among characters out of the police orbit, which include a black man researching his family history and an Indian trying to put his behind him, as well as the Smith family patriarch, striving to keep the family secrets buried.<br />These voices give the reader a bit of a lead over the cops, but Marti's boys help fill her in on local history (while Marti reflects on how little was taught of her heritage in her schooldays) while cop smarts and outside experts put them so far inside the picture, they become targets themselves. Bland works family life in without having to create any formula tension and the police procedure is logical, absorbing and spiced with action. A strong series, getting stronger.	2003-12-08

Their father, Eugene, is not only a wealthy industrialist, and devout Catholic, but also publisher of an outspoken newspaper, critical of the repressive regime.<br />But the glittering exterior hides a rotten core. Eugene, a religious fanatic and Anglophile who despises the old ways to the extent of repudiating his traditionalist father, indulges a sadistic abusiveness when his family fails to live up to his impossible standards. He is always sorry, afterwards, for what they made him do.<br />Then her aunt and cousins visit. \\"Every time Aunty Ifeoma spoke to Papa, my heart stopped, then started again in a hurry. It was the flippant tone; she did not seem to recognize that he was different, special. I wanted to reach out and press her lips shut and get some of that shiny bronze lipstick on my fingers.\\"<br />And when Eugene is persuaded (against his better judgment) to let the children visit his sister, a new world opens to them. This is no surprise, but Adichie's portrayal of the awakening - amidst a time of political turmoil and fear - is halting and fraught with danger.<br />Replete with beauty and horror, Adichie's novel of self-hatred, fear, and family, with its political/allegorical overtones, is a moving, sometimes breathtaking, debut.	2003-11-22

When displeased with her husband, she balls his dirty socks up and puts them back in the drawer. Or lets the razor slip when she cuts his corns, drawing blood. Not that he notices. Chanu, like many busy, ineffectual men, hasn't a clue.<br />Nazneen lives her life by the precepts of her mother's favorite story of her: \\"How You Were Left to Your Fate.\\" She was stillborn, then breathed but refused the nipple. Her mother refused medical help, family advice. Instead, she waited. God would decide.<br />In the first chapter, Nazneen's path is charted: \\"What could not be changed must be borne. And since nothing could be changed, everything had to be borne. This principle ruled her life. It was mantra, fettle, and challenge. So that, at the age of thirty-four, after she had been given three children and had one taken away, when she had a futile husband and had been fated a young and demanding lover, when for the first time she could not wait for the future to be revealed but had to make it for herself, she was as startled by her own agency as an infant who waves a clenched fist and strikes itself upon the eye.\\"<br />The story begins with Nazneen's arranged marriage at 18, after her sister Hasina's shameful elopement, to a man living in London. Ali, herself born in Bangladesh, skillfully conveys the loneliness and bewilderment of a village girl in a block of flats teeming with immigrants. Chanu wants her to live a traditional indoor life, though she has none of the traditional family support. She keeps her feelings to herself, finds ways to obey the spirit, if not the letter of his will. Her best friend is loud, cigarette-smoking Razia who defies respectability and speaks her mind out loud.<br />Then her sister's \\"love match\\" collapses, and Hasina flees her abusive husband. A woman alone in Bangladesh is by definition in danger. Nazneen is desperate for her husband to act, but he does not. This bitter time, and her small revolts, further shape her marriage and Nazneen's inner turmoil is a secret from her husband, fostering larger betrayals.<br />Letters from Hasina, though they sometimes read like a device for conveying the growing turmoil in Bangladesh, and a woman at the mercy of her patriarchal Muslim culture, further underscore the divide in Nazneen's marriage. But Chanu, though he may be an intellectual dreamer, incapable of action, is a good-hearted, kind man who loves his wife.<br />Eventually, her daughters Westernized and rebellious, Nazneen gives in to passion, taking a lover from among the burgeoning radicals in the community - young people born to a Bengal culture in a new country. Torn between Western temptations and family traditions, beset by racist resentment and fear, they cleave to Islamic fundamentalism in a complex mix of anger, pride and preservation.<br />When, at last, she asks Karim why he chose her, he says she is \\"the real thing,\\" a village girl who doesn't dance in short skirts or wear the burkha and \\"ARGUE.\\"<br />Ali's eloquent, deceptively simple prose underscores the complexity of her world. Her dialogue is pitch perfect and her characters express themselves equally strongly in their silences, their gestures, their grooming, and their posturing. Her multi-faceted portrayal of post-September 11 reactions segues into a personal resolution that remains in doubt until the last page.

Now Harmony copes with the sudden news that Pepper, who she hasn't seen since Pepper left for New York at 17, six years before, is dead.<br />In her late 40s, Harmony has settled into a routine. She has a job in a recycling plant and an adored 5-year-old son named Eddie. Her current boyfriend, the latest in a long line of losers, runs off rather than deal with her grief. \\"She was not the same cheerful woman he had left only eight hours before.\\"<br />Grief overwhelms Harmony, but Eddie keeps her tethered. \\"Eddie was the one person left that she absolutely had to think about.\\"<br />Meeting her Oklahoma sisters at the airport, Harmony finally finishes the letter from Pepper's roomate.

Or Chitrita Banerjee's essay following her mother's Bengali widowhood, a cultural sentence of privation.<br />Some are actually about food itself - Elizabeth David's piece on herbs, Nigella Lawson's sensual celebration of cooking, Corby Kummer's sojourn at a coffee plantation, New Hampshire poet Charles Simic's ambivalence about the bio-engineered tomato - but most are about life's associations with food.<br />Jay Parini began a career of writing in restaurants in the hubbub of Lou's diner in Hanover, NH. Putting together a New Year's feast for her young daughter inspires a tirade of cultural memory in Ntozake Shange.

The story moves from the deathbed of a notorious Japanese crime boss to a passenger plane spinning out of control at 40,000 feet, and a hunted man who claims to know why the planes are crashing.<br />Aviation lawyer Roger Case and accident investigator Brian MacHenry try to determine if the crashes are bombs, as the FBI claims, or equipment failure, which could torpedo the Boeing deal. Meanwhile, Japanese economic police investigator Shig Onishi finds his own examination of connections between a respectable and wealthy foundation for atomic-bomb survivors, and the Nippon Aerospace Consortium growing ever more strange and complicated and leading, eventually, to the halls of Boeing and a clash with MacHenry.<br />White keeps the pages turning with a plot that's perhaps too complex, at least on the economic side, and characters that, while not deeply fleshed, are appealing. Shig, particularly, with his unJapanese independent streak and his handy knowledge of marshal arts, could be the beginnings of a series character.<br />White includes plenty of Tokyo color, from scented telephone booths to the odd details of office protocol and the decorative uses of &quot;office flowers.&quot; And the finale offers not one but two hair-raising bang-up, smash-up aerial battles.	2003-11-16

And it ends (I'm not ruining any surprises) with Elbridge's death and Lewis' first steps back into the world.<br />In between is the story, told in alternate voices - first person for Elbridge, third for Lewis, of how the destinies of these two Southern men so far from home become intertwined.<br />Lewis and Elbridge have little in common besides an impoverished boyhood, a hideous tragedy and fire. Lewis is a white boy from North Carolina, son of a drunk, who often ends up in foster care with a viciously abusive church-going woman. From the age of 8 he has worked the tobacco harvest, graduating from barn to fields at age 11. Heat waves rise from the page with McLaurin's descriptions of this backbreaking work and the people who do it. Lewis' fellow croppers are all black: &quot;Sweat had dried on their faces, and their forearms and hands were caked with tobacco gum.&quot;<br />Elbridge is the son of a part-Indian white woman who ran off in his infancy and a black man he never knew. Raised in a Kentucky mountain hollow by his grandfather, a retired coal miner, he suffers the taunts of his schoolfellows with a bewildered fatalism. But home to Elbridge is a place of simple warmth where you can almost smell the greens melting down in bacon grease.<br />Elbridge's needs are met by the garden, the fishing and his grandfather. And when he was 12 Elbridge received a shotgun. His grandfather warns him, &quot;It can kill you like a snake if you let it. Don't ever forget that. But it can feed you too. And it can free you from the world. Maybe just for an hour or so, but it can free you.&quot;<br />Lewis, too, receives this gift of freedom, which makes his isolation an idyll rather than a prison. But suddenly he gets his growth and the &quot;white trash&quot; outcast becomes a football star - and much in demand by the world, so much so his only escape is into the woods with his rifle.<br />No spurts of growth for Elbridge. Instead his grandfather dies and he's forced off the rented land. Wandering, he finds religion. &quot;I kept reading my Bible, and I found out I was invisible. ...My mixed blood was only on the outside, and the real me was inside and pure as the first snow....I was a temple.&quot;<br />Both men establish families and lose them, which is the crux of the story. For Lewis, tragedy is a taunt from a vengeful god and he dares God to kill him and is, very nearly, killed in a fire. For Elbridge the fire is the tragedy which takes his life but leaves him still walking the earth, following God's will in a search for meaning.<br />McLaurin's early chapters are the strongest, immersing the reader in the heat and earthy smells of the south, the all-encompassing loneliness of a child, the petty meanness and wisdom of adults. While the beauty of the writing never flags, the book's themes of self-deception, blame and eventual self-knowledge and acceptance seem simplistic and weaker than the fine prose they're couched in. Still, this beautifully written book shows a strong knowledge of, and sympathy with, the human heart.by the world, so much so his only escape is into the woods with his rifle.<br />No spurts of growth for Elbridge.

Stuck in a temporary workers' dorm until proper housing can be found, Anna takes refuge from her rambunctious house mates in wine, and lonely but satisfying drives into the desert.<br />A rash of medical emergencies at Cliff Palace gives rise to adolescent talk about spirit activity among the mysteriously vanished cliff dwellers, the Anasazi. Until a fellow ranger dies in Cliff Palace in strange circumstances and Anna begins looking for a human hand in the proceedings.<br />Barr steeps the story in western mountain smells and sights, and the lingering mystery of a vanished people; an atmosphere in sharp contrast with the daily rush of visitors to one of the country's most popular parks. The story is evenly paced, with a bang-up conclusion, and Barr excells at action scenes - like  heart-pounding rescue efforts over the cliffs and harsh terrain. Another winner for the likable ranger.	2003-11-16

Books	5	5	5	N	N	A chowhound's infectious enthusiasm	Like Calvin Trillin, Texas food writer Robb Walsh (\\"Legends of Texas Barbecue Cookbook,\\" \\"The Tex-Mex Cookbook\\") will go anywhere in pursuit of the perfect regional dish. Partial to spice and barbecue he's been to the pepper farms of the Caribbean seeking the best hot sauce and to Monterrey, Mexico, for the consummate cabrito (barbecued goat). He's eaten stinkfruit (durian - redolent of rotten eggs) in Thailand, musing on other cultural affinities for smelly delicacies. He's traced specialties to farms, factories and fishing boats. He's been entertained by the finest of convict cooks and French chefs.<br />This compilation of humorous, informative pieces comes mostly from the \\"Houston Chronicle,\\" and two magazines, \\"American Way,\\" and \\"Natural History.\\" Walsh explores food's chemistry (Hawaii's love affair with Spam; seaweed's association with McDonalds, or Martinis) and culture (stuffed cabbage lovers may not have even that in common; one man's greasy spoon is another's comfort zone), and shares the adventure of tracking to the source, be it the world's best coffee beans, sitting unsaleable in a Jamaican warehouse, or cagey French truffle hunters, or neighborhood restaurants from Houston to New York and beyond.<br />Witty, eclectic, and opinionated, Walsh is ready to try anything so you won't have to.	2003-11-16

The police hierarchy prefer another suspect, a black man with a motive who can be placed at the scene.<br />Maggie, giving most of herself to her investigation and a bit to a budding romance, may just go along with her bosses for once, especially when, almost by chance, she hears something peculiar about the lab where her friend was tested.<br />Gross handily builds the narrative, reaching several crescendos before pulling it all together in a protracted, edge-of-the-seat climax. Maggie's quirky personality is a welcome addition to the genre.	2003-11-16

But few hosts have the wit and knowledge to explore the subject analytically - as universal power play, manipulation, social arbiter, and occasion of fear.<br />Browner proceeds back in time through Hitler, the Renaissance courts of Europe, the Dark Ages, the Romans and Petronius' \\"Satyricon,\\" and the Greeks' kindness to strangers, and ends with a poignant, personal meditation on his family's Thanksgiving.<br />Each chapter is a small feast of historical detail, anecdotally presented and peppery with humor, opinion and personal identification. Against the forbidding, sumptuous settings of despots and kings, we imbibe personal foibles, like Hitler's dyspeptic asceticism (\\"His tastes in food hovered somewhere between the mundane and the revolting\\"), and Louis XIV's adroit humiliations (the duchess who preferred to stand than accept a stool).<br />He reveals the personalities behind the successes of Gertrude Stein and Audubon (\\"confidence and hubris\\") and their failed counterparts. His chapter on the Dark Ages - its incivility attributable completely to the Germans' uncouth disregard for any but drunken hospitality - is a savage delight.<br />Two portraits of men behind the thrones - Olivier de la Marche who proudly arranged parties for the ambitious Duke of Burgundy, and Petronius, who orchestrated Nero's excesses, while secretly penning the \\"Satyricon\\" poking fun at it all - take us behind the scenes to muse on the motivations of those who stand and watch. And then there are the Greeks, whose generosity to strangers was compelled by fear of divine retribution.<br />Browner's personal engagement and breadth of knowledge combines fortuitously with his natural storytelling ability and effortless prose style, like the consummate host who makes it all look easy. For those who want more, he appends a chapter-by-chapter bibliography. A well-nigh perfect blend of erudition and entertainment.	2003-11-16

To us, it's an exotic craziness that either doesn't exist or is sensationally unpredictable and dangerous.<br />Phillips, pseudonymous author of 'The Magic Daughter,' not only makes the disorder (now called Dissociative Identity Disorder) credible, she puts one scared and human face on it. Phillips' memoir began in April 1993 as a suicide note. But in trying to explain why life was too difficult to bear, she became absorbed in the project and it eventually became a means of integrating her \\"selves.\\"<br /> Phillips fits none of the stereotypes. She's a college professor whose students and colleagues are unaware of her disorder. She was considered thorough - because several selves would independently do her work, each needing to ensure it was done correctly - unbeknownst to Jane herself. She learned to cover when greeted by people she didn't remember. Nothing was more relaxing than hours spent gazing into the mirror, communing with a parade of faces, young, old, boyish, feminine, wise and foolish - none of which seemed to be hers. But just getting through a normal day could be exhausting as she fought to control conflicting emotions and maintain a moment to moment chronology.<br />Since junior high she had been secretly aware of something wrong. \\"Mostly I just never seemed to be who I really was - although I had no idea who that was.\\" All through college, through marriage to an alcoholic, she thought of seeing a psychiatrist but all she could think to ask was \\"What's wrong with me? Why is life so hard?\\"<br />At 30, she finally sought help after a summer tormented by headaches, profound depression and uncontrollable bouts of terror and anger during which she tore out all the flowers in her beloved garden, carried a gasoline can to the house intending to burn the place down and spent hours in her closet crying because none of the clothes seemed to belong to her. But she was still, despite the psychologist's prodding, unable to express what she wanted out of therapy.<br />Probing her childhood, the therapist precipitated a wrench back in time. \\"Suddenly, weirdly, I was nine years old again.\\" Out came memories - the anger and violence of her older brother, Hank, who had tormented his younger siblings. And attempted to rape his sister Jane, failing only because their parents arrived home unexpectedly. \\"I couldn't tell if I had remembered it or made it up.\\"<br />Her brother's attacks and elaborate malice - much of it sexual - continued throughout her childhood. But there was another side to her home life. On both sides her family was overrun with boys. She was the girl all the adults had been waiting for. She was petted and loved and expected to rectify all the deficiencies of her mother's childhood. Failure to measure up was met with anger and recriminations. It was a turbulent, tormented childhood, but many children suffer worse horrors.<br />Multiplicity, says Phillips, has three main causes. The first is a predisposing brain chemistry, second is trauma and third is a lack of recognition or acceptance of that trauma by adults.<br />While she was recognized as dissociative early on, she was not diagnosed as a multiple until five years into therapy. Her memoir brings home to the reader how thin the line is between normal emotional turmoil and a fragmented personality. Even some of her truly bizarre symptoms, such as an inability to distinguish between current and remembered pain, or to explain symptoms before another personality takes over and the symptoms disappear, arouse empathy.<br />This passionate, harrowing journey towards self-understanding and, ultimately, integration, makes unusual demands on the reader. Perception is a solitary thing - Phillips believed for years that everyone had psyches like hers but other people were braver and smarter about life.It's not the fragments themselves that defy comprehension but the wholeness and separateness of them - the personalities that remain forever 5 or 15, personalities that know only fear or loneliness or anger. With this book, Phillips makes it possible to understand how she protected her core by snapping off bits of herself which then took on particular functions in daily life, setting up a cycle which made her days almost impossible to negotiate.It's not the fragments themselves that defy comprehension but the wholeness and separateness of them - the personalities that remain forever 5 or 15, personalities that know only fear or loneliness or anger.

In three months, he was married.&quot;<br />Floundering, she overhears a stranger on the subway, &quot; 'There are no guarantees in this world, but chances are that people who take out ads in the New York Review of Books aren't idiots or crooks.' &quot;<br />And that's how she ends up in Truro, Mass., in winter, sharing an ultra-modern mansion on the ocean with glamorous Isabel Krug who needs a ghost writer to capitalize on her one claim to fame - her intimate connection with murder. Isabel's rich and older lover had been shot by his wife when she caught them in her bed.<br />Harriet is confident of her ability to write this book - eventually. First there's the research, which may take a while. Harriet is a long-term veteran of writing groups whose members' idea of success is an encouraging letter from an agent.<br />Meanwhile, Harriet is meeting the other denizens of the house. Pete, 36, the man of all work, is a local fisherman, complete with (irritating after a while) accent. Harriet finds him attractive but is painfully aware of the difference in their ages. Costas, a mildly sinister, repugnant and brooding figure, is Isabels' husband. A prominent painter, he was disgraced in the art world when it was discovered that his photo realistic paintings were, in fact, photos touched up with paint.<br />Harriet, a rather conservative, self-effacing creature, is soon cooking all the meals and fretting over her ambiguous and unpaid position. Encouraged by Pete, she makes tentative steps towards self-assertion. Then &quot;With Pete gone I was free to be apologetic. 'Is that okay with you? If we discuss some things?' &quot;<br />But Harriet is open to influence. With Isabel's flamboyant urging, she gets a haircut, modifies her wardrobe, becomes just daring enough to call a man from her former writing group.<br />However, failure isn't through with Harriet yet. Despite the engaging banter and dizzy characters, Lipman has her gaze firmly fixed on reality and Harriet gets another dose of it. If this lighthearted and clever novel has a flaw it's the ease with which Harriet adjusts to devastating disappointments - she reacts more like a 25-year-old than a woman in her 40s.<br />Lipman's writing is snappy and quick, her characters outrageously loopy but with enough mystery to make them believable. Within the convolutions of a spiraling plot, Harriet grows and blossoms, leaving the reader satisfied and vastly entertained.aircut, modifies her wardrobe, becomes just daring enough to call a man from her former writing group.<br />However, failure isn't through with Harriet yet.

Into Africa  is a present-tense daily diary of his 1991 trip to his old and present haunts. In it, he manages to describe an entire career of accomplishments and disappointments.<br />From the fatigue of long airline flights to the frustration of searching for lion worm medicine in third world pharmacies, or losing a day's water samples to an especially deep rut in the road, Packer exemplifies the dedication of scientists who brave the hardships and precarious politics of the third world to study Africa's great animals.<br />Introducing new research assistants to lion watching, Packer recalls his own early days - the long hours of boredom (lions mostly sleep) punctuated by moments of excitement and discovery. He leads us through the trials and errors of collecting parasite data and explains how research thus far has revealed why lions live in groups and why the wealthiest of lions - those in the food-rich Ngorongo Crater - suffer from inbreeding, much like the old royal families of Europe.<br />While describing the social lives and eating habits of lions, Packer invites us into every aspect of the researcher's life, including internal squabbles, money problems, dangerous night flights and vehicle breakdowns.<br />Then it's time for him to move on to Gombe, &quot;the unhealthiest place in the world,&quot; which he approaches with a mixture of dread and anticipation. We soon learn that it's not only the hot, damp, parasite-rich environment that haunts his memories, but the kidnapping of four students during the 70's, a fate narrowly escaped by Packer and his wife who left Gombe to be de-wormed elsewhere.<br />While describing the exciting discoveries made at Gombe from its earliest days, he also recalls the fate of a researcher who died in a fall and remembers the treacheries and heroisms of some of the African workers. And then he drinks some water. The next entries are a haze of illness, fear and, pushed by time constraints, work.<br />The diary ends with a conference of scientists pooling their data to try and decide how to best use the resources of the Serengeti National Park. So much knowledge coming together serves to show how much still has to be learned and how every change in the ecosystem affects every other aspect - land, animals, people.<br />The diary format suits Packer. The immediacy is exciting and allows the reader to see the day-to-day work, hampered and occasionally aided, by serendipity and disaster. Packer is so well-organized that this close-up view never detracts from the big picture.the African workers. And then he drinks some water.

With only 18 hours to go before a convicted murderer is scheduled to die, a newspaper reporter, narrator Steve Everett, finds reason to believe the man is innocent. His minute-by-minute account alternates with gut-wrenching death-watch scenes from the convict's cell.<br />Everett is yanked out of his editor's wife's bed for this assignment - by the editor himself, who already has plenty of reason to despise cocky, cynical, philandering Everett. This time Everett knows that even his old friend and boss, Alan Mann, who shares his view that &quot;issues are what we make up to give us an excuse to run good stories&quot; - even Mann can't save his job this time.<br />Everett needs a good story. But the &quot;human interest&quot; interview about the condemned man's &quot;feelings&quot; isn't it. Digging into the background, getting the details of the convenience store-clerk's murder, he uncovers some minor unanswered questions, which lead to more questions.<br />Juggling the vengeful editor and his own fed-up, straight-laced wife, who's sure to leave him once this latest infidelity is out, it dawns on Everett that proving Beachum innocent could be the single answer to all his immediate problems.<br />Meanwhile Beachum is saying his last farewells to his wife and daughter. A devout Christian, he is determined to act calm, resigned and unafraid. &quot;But it did make him terribly lonely. To have her here, to hold her, to want to tell her everything that was in his heart - and to jolly her along like this instead.&quot;<br />The tension mounts, page by page. Everett's discoveries are tantalizingly inconclusive, every leap forward is confronted by an obstruction, a setback, a reasonable explanation. And the scenes in Beachum's stark cell grow more and more painful to endure as the man wrestles with his inner fears, the shattered hopes of a life, his anguish, impatience and dread.<br />Everett is not a nice guy. But the reader remains aware that this is his book, the powerful and disturbing insight of the Beachum chapters as well as the wise-cracking, cynical chase. And while we identify with Beachum's awful plight, we turn away from his unbearable pain, then turn the page to see what happens next.<br />Klavan has written a rivetting story which presents a devastating portrait of the real cruelties of capital punishment, not that it will change any minds.r fears, the shattered hopes of a life, his anguish, impatience and dread.<br />Everett is not a nice guy.

He's also a man who lost an eye three years earlier defending a Jew.<br />As in Australian author Browne's Italian Inspector Anders novels (\\"Inspector Anders and the Ship of Fools,\\" \\"The Wooden Leg of Inspector Anders\\") the pace is deliberate, the protagonist deliberating. The tension builds by increments as the enormity of the bank's move into Nazi business becomes clear to the hapless bankers.<br />Nazi functionary Dietrich, attached to the bank, quickly homes in on Lilli Dressler, the director's Jewish secretary. As Jews have been barred from banking, Dietrich arranges to have the Gestapo arrest her. Schmidt and Lilli's boss separately attempt to save her, and when their illegal efforts fail, Dietrich is exultant. Magnanimously sparing the men from prosecution, Dietrich has them where he wants them.<br />In chilling increments it becomes clear that every aspect of privacy - from phone lines to family relationships, personal friendships and private histories - is compromised. Dietrich seems omnipresent. Heartsick, Schmidt's resolution hardens into a daring plan of heroism and revenge.<br />Browne has captured the Nazis' fanatical mania for control, their mastery of detail and intimidation, their paranoia and arrogance. Schmidt's complexities reveal a tangle of motivations, not all of which he understands, or admires in himself. Events build, from the first slow tightening of the noose to a choking breathlessness. A masterful thriller, as intelligent as it is dark.	2003-11-12

Intrigued by the possible Triad murder of a silk-pajama-clad man in a popular park, Chen is told to sideline the case in order to shepherd US Marshall Catherine Rohn around Shanghai.<br />Rohn is there to pick up Wen Liping, wife of a reluctant witness in an important immigrant smuggling case, who is to join her husband in the witness protection program. But Wen has disappeared - kidnapped by the Triad smugglers, or in flight from them.<br />Wen, a worn-out peasant with an abusive husband, was once a Shanghai native, a promising and beautiful \\"educated youth\\" sent to the countryside during the Cultural Revolution. Chen's assistant, Yu, (whose life also was altered irreparably by the Cultural Revolution) has gone to her village to investigate, and Chen allows the insistent American marshal to assist on his interviews with Shanghai contacts.<br />Punctuated with Chen's poetry quotations and Confucian proverbs, and lots of Chinese meals, Qui's (winner of the Anthony Award for his first Chen mystery, \\"Death of a Red Heroine\\") writing is evocative, though his dialogue can be clunky and too expository and the pace of the mystery is uneven, its path overlong.<br />But his picture of China in transition, a generation burdened by the Cultural Revolution (and what a difference in lives a year or two in age has meant), the opportunists homing in on changing economic policies, the power of the Triads, the meaning of communism to the people who live it - all of this is succinctly, adroitly drawn. The title, for instance, refers to Wen and her exuberant performance of the only dance allowed during the Cultural Revolution - a dance holding the Chinese character for Loyalty to Chairman Mao.<br />In the course of their hunt for Wen, and Chen's continuing interest in the park-murder case, the mismatched pair travels around China, allowing Qiu to showcase the cultural gulf and human commonality between them.

Settled, though not easily, with his wife and daughter in Berlin, Vlado works construction and scrapes by. It's not an easy or satisfying existence, so when an American - Calvin Pine - from the war crimes tribunal at the Hague offers Vlado a job, he jumps at the chance.<br />All he has to do is help capture Pero Matek, an old Croatian war criminal from WWII, living profitably under an assumed name in Bosnia. The French want him in return for their help with a wanted Serbian general.<br />When Vlado is let in on the secret of how he was chosen for the job, his whole world is thrown out of kilter and the mission becomes personal. Which doesn't stop it from failing in spectacular fashion, and Matek slips away, as does the Serbian general. The cat-and-mouse chase is on, with various international interests weighing in.<br />Political compromise, cynicism and corruption dog this mission as Vlado and Pine pursue their man across borders and generations. Vlado, like (seemingly) everyone else, has his own guilty secret, which threatens his sleep and, increasingly, his safety. But the footing is uncertain everywhere and Fesperman keeps his characters hopping, dodging and feinting.<br />There's no glory in Fesperman's wars, just blood, death, survival and, for some, opportunism. Atmosphere and the shadowy corners of the human heart - even the best of human hearts - are integral to the plot. Character and circumstance are the primary motivators and Fesperman knows how subtly each can shape the other. A Berlin reporter during the Yugoslavian wars, Fesperman writes with authority, intelligence and grace.	2003-11-12

At first the narrator feels only the futility of political effort - for him, history is already ordained and the fervor of people like Masroor seems futile and puppetlike.<br />But once he is caught up in life - earning a living as a waiter, developing attachments, saving a young, unwed, pregnant actress from the clutches of a pornographer, meeting his grandmother, doing his inept best to manipulate the lives of his friends for their own good - history becomes a backdrop to life.<br />Beautifully written, funny, sometimes raunchy, sometimes sly,  the novel's only real flaw is its meandering story line. Some events (as in life) seem to have no real purpose and no goal. Others serve only to introduce figures of history whose walk-on parts intimately affect the lives of those who've never met them.<br />An unusual and entertaining novel with layers of meaning, many of which I suspect eluded me as they may elude other American readers.<br />An unusual and entertaining novel with layers of meaning, many of which I suspect eluded me as they may elude other American readers.	2003-11-11

Nine years later she wakes one morning to find a drop of blood on her pillow, legacy of the previous night's nosebleed.<br />As if waking from a dream, she sees her future - death might be a sweet release but helpless crippling is the more realistic probability. Already her kidneys are damaged. Rose flees, taking only her purse and her husband's bank card.<br />Thus far the violence has taken place off-stage and the reader experiences it in horrific fragments as the core of Rose's life. The terror that travels with her is palpable and riveting. Like Rose, we expect Norman, a canny and experienced cop, to pounce on her at every street corner, enraged at her audacity.<br />But, through the kindness of strangers, Rose Daniels becomes Rosie McLendon (her maiden name), discovers friendship at a battered women's shelter and begins to put her life together. The day before she moves out of the shelter she stops in a pawn shop to see what she can get for her ostentatious engagement ring.<br />The ring is a phony but the pleasant young proprietor is willing to trade it for a mediocre painting of a classical scene which Rosie suddenly has to have. The painting of a woman on a hill in a rose madder chiton calls out to her although the temple at the foot of the hill is clearly out of perspective.<br />Rosie also gets a job out of the encounter - a customer who admires  her voice turns out to be a producer of audio books - and a romance with the shop owner, Bill.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Norman is on his way. King begins to alternate between Norman's unraveling psyche - a polluted and vile but cunning place - and Rosie's continued blossoming.<br />While Norman becomes more and more savage, Rosie enters the realm of the painting in the book's first supernatural scene which is, while obligatory, not half as scary or involving as her real life.<br />The painting seems to embody some version of the Furies - female earth dieties who exact retribution from human transgressors. The leader, the one Rosie identifies with, is no fairy godmother. A dangerous creature, consumed by madness and some leprous disease, she demands a perilous mission from Rosie which involves crossing the river of forgetfulness and entering a dead version of the garden of Eden as well as outwitting the Temple bull in a maze.<br />For the climax, King no longer spares us the violence up close. There's lots of blood and gore as well as supernatural interference on both sides.<br />A page-turning good read..<br />The painting seems to embody some version of the Furies - female earth dieties who exact retribution from human transgressors.

Manion's mentor, J.J. Legendre, an honest man shunned by the corrupt New Orleans police department, gets the Pano case while being locked out of the big news - a serial killer patterning his murders of women on a 19th-century killer called the &quot;Meddler.&quot;<br />But the new Meddler witnessed the killing of the woman in the Pano case and takes a personal interest. Without seeing his face, the reader learns the killer is a man of position in the city and regards his killings as a means to an end.<br />When  J.J. finally gets assigned to the Meddler case, he notices an anomaly that turns the investigation around. But as J.J. gets closer to the killer, the killer homes in on the cop's new girlfriend. After a riveting climax, Lochte jumps his novel back to the present.<br />J.J. is dead and Manion is discovering a few connections his old friend missed. The Meddler is still out there and he hasn't mended his ways.<br />Lochte takes a risk nestling a story within a story but makes it work. New Orleans is steamy, J.J. and Manion are both quirky individual presences and the action reaches climactic heights twice.	2003-11-07

He began his odyssey, and begins this unusual and entertaining book of essays and recipes, with his navy tour of southeast Asia during the Vietnam War.<br />The early essays of his youthful navy days - quitting smoking while moving nuclear missiles ship to ship during typhoon conditions, a bittersweet dalliance with a Malaysian prostitute, in pursuit of pepper among Borneo headhunters - are hilarious, moving, and riveting.<br />As the years pass, his travels become more food focused, and the anecdotes more general and nostalgiac. But as his knowledge of food becomes more sophisticated, so do the recipes. And Sterling remains game for anything, including fried locusts, blood soup and dog, specifically puppy. And he includes recipes for everything - with substitutions for less adventurous palates.<br />There are numerous mouthwatering curries, satays, stews, soups and streetfoods includng traditonal dishes like pad Thai, chile prawns, green mango salad and Cambogee beef, along with Navy classics like boiled coffee and El Rancho beef stew. Exotica includes fish grilled with large red ants and two versions of grasshopper or cricket snacks. Great stories and good food.	2003-11-07

The previous five had been in the ice from 10 to 57 years. The sixth had been held suspended in the very spot where he died, for 5,000 years.<br />The excitement of this momentous discovery quickly degenerated into farce as nations began squabbling over jurisdiction. Was the man found in Italian or Austrian territory? Konrad Spindler, the first archaeologist to examine the body and intimately involved in its study ever since, reports this bureaucratic wrangling as scrupulously as he does every other detail of the find in this thorough and absorbing book.<br />He begins at the beginning, with the hikers who spotted the emerging head and shoulders and goes on to mention every other person who arrived at the site, tourists as well as officials and recovery experts. Although this at first seems puzzlingly excessive, it's important.<br />Recovery, made difficult by the weather and the reluctance of the glacier, was suspenseful, interrupted, and involved a certain amount of hacking and other disturbance. But the glacier preserved the iceman (and yes, Spindler explains exactly how) so perfectly that tourist photos and recollections of the scene are important to reconstructing his final hours. The picture that emerges is so clear and intriguing, it's amazing that -in fiction - so far only a children's novel has been inspired.<br />The iceman was clearly a mountaineer accustomed to spending prolonged periods far from home (his carefully sewn garments were crudely mended and his teeth were worn from a steady diet of dried meat). Spindler describes his clothing - from water-shedding grass cloak to leather loin cloth and grass-stuffed shoes  - in every detail, from the first steps of construction through each sign of wear, explaining why pelts would be cut just so and how sinews are dried and frayed for superior thread.<br />Among the man's possessions were a birch bark container that once held a live ember for the man's camp fire. Modern science could detect traces of previous embers, indicating, through the wood used, the various terrains the man had crossed. Also found were fire making supplies, a belt pouch containing tools, a dagger, a net Spindler speculates was used for snaring birds and, most interesting, an unfinished bow stave, and, in his arrow quiver, two broken arrows and a number of unbroken, unfinished arrows.<br />From this last, and from the iceman's broken ribs, scientists deduce he had, no more than two months previous to his death, encountered a violent event which probably involved other humans and may have caused him to flee into the mountains at a dangerous time of year, exhaustion and bad weather contributing to his death.<br />Spindler's final section (save for his disapproving comments on other, more sensational reactions to the find) concerns life in the Neolithic Age and where the iceman fit in. This includes a lot if interesting tidbits, such as the fact, determined from pollen research, that agricultural grazing began on the high slopes rather than the valleys, as well as technical data more detailed than the average reader is looking for.<br />All in all, a fascinating book, if not scintillating with wit and adventurous suppositions. Spindler will leave that to the fictionalizers.ark container that once held a live ember for the man's camp fire.

After a tantalizing prologue describing a series of 20-year-old unsolved murders featuring book collectors, the story begins with Janeway accepting a job to trace a woman who skipped bail.<br />It's not the sort of job Janeway would ordinarily take, but this woman has been accused of, among other things - like shooting - stealing a rare book. A book that doesn't, in fact, exist. Jetting to Seattle, Janeway captures the young woman easily. But instead of dragging her to justice, Janeway, charmed by her knowledge of rare books and intrigued by certain puzzles in the case, allows her to visit her family.  The girl disappears and people start getting murdered.<br />Meanwhile, a number of collectors seem eager to get their hands on this non-existent book, an elegant edition of Poe's The Raven, supposedly done in the same year its small and specialized publisher died in a fire.<br />The plot grows complex but never incomprehensible. Janeway is a tough but tender sort who drops plenty of fascinating book lore among the bodies and chase scenes.	2003-11-07

But suddenly there's an eruption of screams from next door. The old wife, it turns out, has tied her unfaithful husband in the bath and rubbed him all over with chilli powder. Triton chucked away his onion quarters; &quot;they seemed too tame, but I was not ready to use chilli yet.&quot;<br />But soon, after a scene of abuse Triton can never speak of, Joseph is banished from the house and Triton has what he wants. He has Mr. Salgado to himself and he goes about his work with single-minded dedication, anticipating his employer's wishes, reading his books, emulating him in small matters like list-making.<br />But even this is not enough. With the outside world irrelevant, except as it affects the mood and movements of his master, Triton, an ambitious man even if he doesn't know it, transforms himself into a chef extraordinaire. There is nothing he cannot create.<br />And a new, exciting presence at the house, Nili, a woman with an appreciative appetite, and a salutary effect on Mr. Salgado, spurs Triton to go all out. The food is &quot;more than good. I knew, because I can feel it inside me when I get it right. It's a kind of energy that revitalizes every cell in my body. Suddenly everything becomes possible and the whole world, that before seemed slowly to be coming apart at the seams, pulls together.&quot;<br />The house enjoys a resurgence of love and energy but outside events intrude, eroding their homelife and threatening their physical safety. Triton ignores politics as no concern of his, but no one can remain apart from the world, although it doesn't necessarily do any harm to try.<br />Absorbed in his art, focused on his master, Triton finds contentment and satisfaction which he conveys in simple, delectable language and deceptively offhand anecdotes. Triton is a captivating character and Gunesekera a subtle, graceful writer with a rich feel for language.ate.<br />And a new, exciting presence at the house, Nili, a woman with an appreciative appetite, and a salutary effect on Mr. Salgado, spurs Triton to go all out.

He has observed ten &quot;common denominators&quot; of chronic illness which undermine the immune system and exhibit a wide variety of symptoms which often cannot be diagnosed as specific illnesses.<br />Golan begins his book with two case histories illustrating his approach. The second chapter is a master symptom survey for each of the ten common denominators, allowing the reader to rate his or her health in accordance with each. Golan then devotes three chapters to diet - presenting the most common American hazards, discussing the importance of dietary balance and the specific properties and energies of various foods and offering menus and recipes.<br />And then, having given the reader an understanding of how food works chemically in the body, Golan devotes a chapter to each of the common denominators - nutritional deficiencies, poor digestion and assimilation, the toxic bowel, the sluggish liver, hypoglycemia, adrenal exhaustion, yeast overgrowth, food allergies, chemical hypersensitivity and environmental illness and finally psychoneuroimmunology or the body-mind connection. A last chapter in this section discusses the relationship of the immune system with these underlying conditions. Readers may want to use their symptom surveys to determine which chapters will be of primary interest - reading all of them at once can lead to information overload.<br />The next hundred pages lists common ailments and natural remedies. Discussions of alternative medicine follow, including fasting and cleansing (which he embraces enthusiastically), herbs, massage, hydrotherapy, acupuncture, homeopathy and more. And Golan concludes with a chapter on choosing and relating to your doctor.<br />While much of his advice is common sense, Golan gives lots of specifics. For instance, it's not enough to choose oils that are polyunsaturated. Heat triggers generation of tissue-damaging free radicals in many oils and almost all supermarket oils (except extra virgin olive) are processed with heat.<br />Excess sugar is seen as an underlying factor in a dizzying number of health problems from depression to gallstones and Golan offers tables listing sugar amounts in popular cereals as well as other foods. There are also tables describing the purpose and consequences of numerous food additives, tables showing symptoms associated with excess consumption of popular foods from milk to peanut butter, tables illustrating symptoms of vitamin and mineral deficiencies, tables listing sources of heavy metals and their consequences. You get the picture.<br />Golan does not expect readers to instantly adopt lives of disciplined asceticism. He advocates a gradual introduction of healthier foods and avoidance of toxins until a healthier diet becomes a joy rather than a chore. Unlike many nutritionists, he is a strong advocate of vitamin supplements, and prescribes them for individual ailments as well as general health.<br />This is book for anyone willing to take a few extra steps in the interests of general health and well being.luding fasting and cleansing (which he embraces enthusiastically), herbs, massage, hydrotherapy, acupuncture, homeopathy and more.

Far from the intrigue and politics of the court, Thu schemes to escape her dusty village, enlivening the monotony with fantasies in which her Libu mercenary father is actually a prince in exile.<br />She convinces her brother to teach her to read and when a great seer visits the village she swims out to his elegant barge and offers herself - all she owns of value - for a glimpse of the future. In an eerie scene aboard the dark barge the seer, Hui, spurns the coarse peasant smelling of river mud. But he finds himself as intrigued by Thu's strange blue eyes as she is repulsed by his albino white skin and dazzled by the luxury that surrounds him. He has seen her face in a vision, he tells Thu, their fates are intertwined.<br />Hui takes Thu back with him to Pharaoh's court where she is confined to Hui's estate for months while he has her softened, polished and trained as a lady while indoctrinating her in history, politics, writing and medicine. Thu's rigorous training provides a detailed, colorful portrait of Egyptian life while illustrating the vast gulf between the peasant and even minor nobility.<br />Meanwhile Thu's initial jubilation gives way to boredom and jealousy. She wants more. When a favored servant stands in her way, Thu exhibits a ruthless streak which escapes her control. But fortune still favors her and she finds herself moving from Hui's house to the Pharaoh's harem. Although it's not all she hoped for, Thu perseveres and becomes the Pharaoh's favorite - at the same time advancing Hui's political goals.<br />Gedge's fine, understated prose allows the story to tell itself. Although Thu is the narrator, she is not always in full possession of the whole picture. A complex character of intelligence and ambition, Thu tends to overestimate her irresistible charms and keen mind. She is calculating and naive, scheming and schemed against, childlike in her quick sorrows and regrets and impulsive in her cruelties.<br />Gedge's novel is a multi-layered story of intrigue, Egyptian decline, and the personal choices that make up a destiny. The author's vivid, seamless prose brings to life the teeming activity of the Nile, the merciless heat of the sun, the hot house perfume of the gardens of the wealthy and the dust of impoverished villages. Gedge seems almost to have lived herself in that glittering bygone world of vengeful gods and fabulous feasts where the height of whimsical fashion is a perfumed cone of fat, slowly dripping down an elaborately coiffed wig at a state dinner.<br />This is a historical novel for those who want something richer than the formula of feisty heroine and stormy romance - a novel that is powerfully atmospheric and unexpectedly poignant.nd naive, scheming and schemed against, childlike in her quick sorrows and regrets and impulsive in her cruelties.<br />Gedge's novel is a multi-layered story of intrigue, Egyptian decline, and the personal choices that make up a destiny.

It's also a moving personal story about catastrophe, agonizing recovery and adjustment.<br />A week after graduating with honors from Harvard Medical School, Heymann suffered a severe seizure and was rushed to the emergency room. Awakening with no memory of the event, she found her arms and legs strapped to a hard slab. Unable to move, surrounded by strangers, she was terrified and kept calling for her husband, wondering what &quot;they&quot; had done to him. No one answered her cries.<br />And this was only the beginning. As Heymann describes the nightmare of awaiting diagnosis, clinging to the stoicism she learned as a medical student -  good patients are quiet patients - she begins to understand that hospitals are constructed around the convenience of the professionals. She reflects on the small things that might ease a patient's anxiety - knowledge mostly. Explanations about what is happening and what they can expect of themselves on release.<br />Heymann had bled into her brain and surgery was recommended. The operation was botched, through medical oversight, but Heymann's anger about this is less than her anger at the lies, evasions and brush-offs which follow. After numerous conflicting reports, her doctor tells her the hemangioma had all been removed. But one of the books most chilling passages comes later. The pathologist's study concluded that her hemangioma had not been removed. Her doctor never informed her of this report (she does not say how she learned of it).<br />Discharged after surgery, Heymann is so weak that watching television is too taxing and caring for her toddler son is impossible. No one was prepared for the sort of care she would need. And Heymann herself refuses to compromise her ambitions. She believes strongly that meaning in life comes from helping others. She and her husband (also a doctor) had always intended to work in a clinic in a third world country. They also want a second child.<br />So she embarks on her grueling internship as soon as possible, terrified of the seizures which may wreck her career. Numerous heart-tugging case histories are interspersed with her own halting progress. Explaining procedures and home care to her patients, she shows how the frightened &quot;difficult&quot; patients are calmed and easier to treat when given a modicum of understanding.<br />This well-written, moving and deeply scary memoir should be widely read but probably won't be. In a letter Heymann wrote to the New England Journal of Medicine protesting prejudice against people with seizures she described herself as &quot;a physician who has both treated patients with seizures and lived with seizures.&quot; The Journal  removed only four words. &quot;They would not print that I had lived with seizures, only that I had treated others.&quot;clinic in a third world country.

Sound familiar? Well, yes, but that doesn't make it a bad plot.<br />In this case the variation is classical. The letters are from Thanatos, Greek for death, and address Irene as Cassandra, the seer who's fated never to be believed until too late. Thanatos describes his victims and methods in terms of Greek and Roman mythology and taunts Irene with the possibility that if she's quick enough she might save a victim and catch the killer. And if she's not, she may be his final victim.<br />Burke keeps the pace moving. With ingenuity, police work and investigative skills that ring true, Irene and her fiance, police detective Frank Harriman, find a link between the victims that reaches back 40 years. Still the mystery is far from solved and people keep dying while Irene finds strange tokens from Thanatos in her locked car.<br />A good, suspenseful story with plenty of meat in the plot, a bang-up finish and just a little too much wise-cracking banter from Irene.	2003-11-05

Winner of the Whitbread Award for best novel, this is a witty and affecting journey to the brink of madness.<br />The narrative takes the form of letters from Eliza Peabody, affluent 50ish wife of a senior civil servant, to her equally middle-aged but less dutiful neighbor, Joan. The first letters begin as brief notes, reproaches from a stiff-necked busybody to her hypochondriac neighbor.<br />But then Joan absconds to wander the Middle East, leaving husband and children behind, and Eliza wonders if she is to blame. She takes in Joan's husband and encourages his attentions. The letters lengthen and become more erratic as Eliza's personality spills out on paper. Her own marriage dissolves when her husband goes off with Joan's husband, and Eliza traces the years of its unraveling between visits to a young man dying of AIDS in a hospice, long walks with the two dogs (hers and Joan's), and musings about the other neighbors.<br />As it becomes apparent how isolated Eliza is in her South London home, her narrative becomes increasingly suspect. It seems less certain that her husband and Joan's have any relationship other than a desire to escape Eliza. Far from being a most important personage at the hospice, Eliza is shunted off to do the dishes, possibly because she talks too much and inappropriately too.<br />Yet her self-revelations to Joan are plaintive, appealing and sometimes hilarious. As Eliza reveals herself less of a figure in the world, she becomes more of an individual - a wildly imaginative individual with a flair for anecdotes.<br />But it seems that not all of Eliza's anecdotes are real. But what is real and what is not becomes increasingly difficult for Eliza herself to determine. Meanwhile she continues to explore her deepest feelings on motherhood (Eliza is childless), marriage and social expectations.<br />She develops new relationships in the community, particularly with the precocious children of the overbusy curate and his wife. Or does she only wish that she has?<br />Midway through the novel, everything is suspect, except for Eliza's voice which grows stronger and truer as she sheds expectations- both of and for herself. Gardam brings her protagonist back from the abyss of madness at the end. She also lets the reader know where Eliza has crossed the line between imagination and reality and why.<br />Unfortunately, to do this, she uses a device which is too simple and detracts from the integrity of its protagonist and the complexity of a marvelous narrative. This ending mars a novel which is otherwise sharply, incisively written with an intriguing heroine balanced on her private desert of shifting sands.that she has?<br />Midway through the novel, everything is suspect, except for Eliza's voice which grows stronger and truer as she sheds expectations- both of and for herself.

An outspoken loner, drawn to the more remote parts of the globe, her beautiful but rugged experiences fascinate and educate the armchair traveler - without inspiring similar ambitions.<br />As a 60th birthday present to herself, Murphy undertakes a 3,000 mile journey through Eastern and Southern Africa on her Dawes Ascent mountain-bike, &quot;the cyclist's equivalent of a Rolls-Royce,&quot; named Lear. The trip was a &quot;self-described unwinding therapy.....a carefree ramble through some of the least hot areas of sub-Saharan Africa.&quot;<br />But &quot;carefree&quot; it is not, though nothing - not heat, torrential rains, hunger, illness, hostility or impassable roads - can stop her.<br />Murphy is greeted in Nairobi by drought and a mothers' hunger strike which rapidly degenerates into a riot when paramilitary troops arrive to disperse the women. Leaving the city as quickly as she can, Murphy contemplates the contrast between Western luxuries and construction projects alongside the shanty towns and hungry children.<br />From her first stop in a dusty village for a Tusker beer, AIDS predominates and a pattern is set which endures thoughout the lands and cultures she passes through during the coming months. By day she enjoys the solitude and scenery of rural Africa; by night she is embroiled in local discussions of politics and Western incursions and AIDS, often dodging individual pleas for help in getting to the land of opportunity - the West.<br />Ukimwi is Swahili for AIDS. In Africa, wherever she goes, it surrounds her. Some blame Western conspiracies and medical experiments; missionaries preach behavioral changes and deny condom distribution; men say they cannot survive without a variety of female partners; wives say their husbands refuse condoms; prositutes say they would have no business if they insisted on condom use.<br />Everywhere Murphy meets widows, orphans and more orphans.<br />She at first resists the pull of AIDS. For her this is a pleasure journey and she can do nothing to slow the epidemic. But it has become part of the fabric of culture, threatening traditional family life, taking the most productive and leaving behind the old and the young to fend for themselves.<br />In addition to the scourge of AIDS, Murphy finds much of Africa suffering from economic collapse, spurred in large part by misguided Western &quot;development projects&quot; that destroyed the local agrarian economy, often displacing the people and departing, leaving behind devastation and tribal strife.<br />She meets hospitality and hostility, and takes what comes; be it a bedbug, mosquito-infested tourist hotel, or an earthen floor, or a spontaneously offered bed in a local home. She sets out at dawn hardly knowing whether to expect a corrugated wartorn road or spectacular mountain scenery or a beguiling path that ends in a swamp (through which she is guided by a silent tribal elder). She pushes Lear up rutted mountain tracks and hurtles down, marveling at the African cyclists she meets everywhere - man cycling, two children on the cross bar, wife behind holding baby and toddler, and a heavy load balanced over all.<br />With a cast-iron stomach, she eats and drinks whatever is available (which is generally awful), especially enjoys her beer, cycles through bronchitis and is finally felled by malaria. Even that she comes to regard as fitting - ending her journey in Zimbabwe where &quot;Blacks had been subjugated as nowhere else in British Africa.&quot; Murphy  concludes that Westerners ought to get out of Africa once and for all - that  Western systems have not &quot;taken&quot; and have only undermined traditional culture.<br />Whether you come to agree with her or not, her harrowing, thrilling, eye-opening and heartbreaking journey will stay with you when other travels are long forgotten.ets widows, orphans and more orphans.<br />She at first resists the pull of AIDS.

Martha immediately wins their open-armed attention by diving into the cold water and saving their leader, Isis Moonwagon, from drowning. Another decisive act concludes the book but in between Martha remains passive, aloof, flowing with the current.<br />Martha, 30, is at a low point in her life. So low that &quot;lately she'd had a persistent sense of being watched and judged and found wanting, even when no one was looking and she was the only one in the room.&quot;<br />Recently dumped by her lover she broods &quot;about the many faults in herself that had given him no choice.&quot; Among these is her job as fact checker at Mode, a fashion magazine, &quot;a job not merely boring, underpaid and demeaning but also pointedly symbolic of what she most despised in herself: her starchy literal-mindedness, her unintuitive narrowness.&quot;<br />So she allows herself to be swept up by her new acquaintances - women without men - widows, divorcees, celibates and lesbians - united in their conviction that the world would be a better place if it were run by women.<br />But skeptical Martha can't help thinking of Margaret Thatcher and the cruelties of little girls to one another. And the Goddess worshipers themselves are not above sniping and bickering.<br />Still, Martha tries to &quot;embrace the irrational,&quot; stifling her embarrassment at flaky rituals in her desire to be accepted.<br />The narrative culminates in a retreat to Arizona to study with a Native American healer. The trip's petty disasters are hilarious and the strain begins to tell. Martha's true withdrawal begins as, shuddering at the image of all of them naked in a sweat lodge, she lies to get out of it. When disaster strikes, Martha acts while the others are dithering and debating, planning a healing circle and turning to the only man around for help. &quot;As soon as her daughter disappeared, Freya had stopped praying to the Goddess and instead kept muttering, 'Jesus Christ. Oh Jesus.' &quot;<br />Martha's voice, cool, ironic but self-deprecating, avoids any temptation toward facile fun-poking. While Prose no more than sketches the histories of the Goddess women, Martha sees through their props and posturings to the person hiding there - which doesn't necessarily make any of them more likable.<br />Prose's prose is spare, sharp and finely tuned. She has achieved a delicate balance - parody without condescension.aked in a sweat lodge, she lies to get out of it.

When one of them is murdered with an arcane horticultural poison, Chief of Police Joe Silva quickly discerns that each has a secret.<br />George Frome, the murdered man, was a spartan master of efficiency who suspected a thief among the members. Or did he? The day of the monthly board meeting Frome called Silva to Arbella House to inspect security. But Silva couldn't shake the feeling Frome was putting on a show for some hidden purpose of his own. Frome's suspicions cause fireworks at the board meeting and the next day Frome is found dead in the attic, sprawled before a group of 19th-century paintings which don't belong there.<br />Suspects include a society matriarch who was about to sell an important family heirloom to Frome; her heir and nephew whose devotion to his garden is exceeded only by his devotion to his aunt; an obnoxious social climber with a new interest in 19th-paintings; an antiques dealer on the verge of financial ruin, and a single mother whose fear of the past leads to panic attacks and strange acts of household cleaning.<br />Oleksiw moves easily among the minds of these characters, heightening the reader's curiosity with glimpses of their private terrors.

Violence, then, as now, was a way of life. All boys fought - life was worse for those who refused. Violence and the rituals surrounding it established the social pecking order. In the preface to his memoir Canada says, \\"The difference is that we never had so many guns in our inner cities.\\"<br />Canada's first memory of street violence came at age 4, when his two older brothers had a jacket stolen at the playground. The boys' mother sent them right back to fetch it, promising them a beating \\"ten times as bad as what that little thief could do to you,\\" if they failed.<br />They left the house in tears and returned triumphant, with the jacket. Their mother sat them down and told them it was a lesson in not becoming a victim. The author, her youngest, was unconvinced.<br />Then a neighborhood boy who habitually refused to fight was \\"stretched\\" over a car and savagely beaten by a group of boys. \\"The lesson was brutal and unmistakable. No matter who you fought, he could never beat you that bad.\\"<br />Canada's memoir is a thoughtful, moving portrayal of social behavior in a culture of violence. A quick study, Canada learned to use posturing, attitude and negotiation as well as his fists to minimize the number and severity of violent encounters.<br />But he is absolutely convinced that violence is a learned response, not innate. He and the other small boys, says Canada, were aghast at the prospect of fighting. Only fear of worse violence and a life of cowering in corners spurred them to fight.<br />Today, says Canada, the same imperatives operate. But guns have shattered the rituaized formality of the pecking order. Toughness is no longer determined by fighting skills or \\"heart\\" but by willingness to pull the trigger.<br />This is the book's most chilling precept. The streets are now ruled by those whose most important attribute is a lack of compunction about killing.<br />Canada's own experience as a gun carrier is a perfect illustration. Home from college he found a nearby street ruled by a gang of toughs so intimidating he would take a circuitous route to avoid them. So he bought a gun. Carrying it, he found his whole personality changed.<br />Instead of avoiding the block or even crossing the street he would swagger through the gang, his whole attitude provoking a challenge. But back at school in bucolic Maine he saw his behavior in a different light. Appalled at how close he'd come to shooting someone, he threw away the gun.<br />Those who don't leave the ghetto don't have the luxury of contemplation.<br /><br />Canada has devoted his life to helping poor children and reducing street violence. Today he runs a program which offers classes and recreational activities which involve the whole community. The Rheedlen Center uses public school buildings, open 17 hours a day, in an effort to provide children and families with safety.<br />At the end of the book, Canada offers a program for solving the problems of violence in the inner cities. Chief among them is getting handguns off the streets by using buyback programs, registration at the place of manufacture (so any gun can be traced) and registration of ammunition.<br />Whether the reader agrees with his solutions or not, Canada's memoir is powerful testimony of a future of little hope without major change.

Hard-drinking, womanizing, bad-boy member of the 77th Street Station's Four Horsemen or &quot;Whoresmen,&quot; Frady was making time with a cop buddy's girlfriend and making enemies among the street gangs he was rousting. Then there's the house where his body was found - a few blocks from the hideout where the Symbionese Liberation Front was holding Patty Hearst. And there's his ex-wife and a maniac cop-killer who was stalking his beat at the time.<br />Wisecracking MacGowan plunges into the crumbling neighborhood with her crew (who reveal plenty of private agendas of their own), digging up secrets and setting events in motion that lead to more murders and headlines, much to the network's delight. MacGowan favors the SLA as culprits but tawdry personal motives keep getting in the way.<br />Complicating the story are: MacGowan's lover, LAPD detective Mike Flint, an old partner of Frady's; MacGowan's teenage daughter, away from home for the first time, and her sister, vegetating in a coma. Even if her characters, including the old women, have a rather tiresome penchant for raunchy banter, Hornsby mixes it all up nicely, showing a deft touch with thorny issues like trust and infidelity and right-to-die decisions without ever losing a beat in her complex plot.	2003-11-03

The narrator's voice, recalling an arid, lonely childhood during World War I, seems at first more plaintive than engaging, her circumstances more pitiable than interesting. But wait. Alice Moore is a curious, winsome child with awakening sensibilities. She soon draws you into a world so small and self-assured and complete its inhabitants cannot see the precipitous brink before them.<br />After a factual exposition of the case of Roger Casement, a protestant who tried to raise an army to drive the British from Ireland (these asides into the wider world occur throughout the narrative), Alice's story opens in 1912 Ballydavid, Ireland, at the estate of Alice's maternal grandmother, a woman of deep Anglo-Irish principles and conventions.  \\"The entertaining of children was not, either in my family or in society at large, given the importance that it now has,\\" Alice recalls, 50 years later. Hours of boredom and starched discomfort were punctuated by meals and sleep, with the occasional excitement of adult visitors. Alice would strive for invisibility, so as to hear their conversation.<br />After an interlude at their home in London, Alice and her mother return to Ballydavid the summer after the war begins. Her father, a frugal, unpretentious New Zealander, has never been completely accepted by her mother's family and seldom stayed long at Ballydavid. \\"When Mother was with her family, she was in the position of silently defending him from their silent criticisms, these unspoken thoughts batting around the room like shuttlecocks, inhibiting and coloring even the occasional remarks of day to day family life.\\"<br />Much communication remains unspoken, from what is served at tea for visitors (or if tea is served), to articles of dress, deportment, and table manners. Much more communication is between the lines, the sort of bland, pointed remarks the British excel at, in novels, at least. And as the war drags on and signs of Irish unrest increase, culminating in the 1916 Easter Rising, more subjects become off limits.<br />But by then Alice has begun to note the contradictions in the world.

While the story is in places fantastic, Guild's narrative skill keeps it moving with deft characterizations of Kincaid and his new romance, an atmospheric revisitation of the past and the tension of a stalking serial killer.	2003-11-03

But first there's the cocktail party to get through on her first Sunday evening at the ski chateau, where she makes a huge gaffe by laughing when someone suggests the day's avalanche - which gravely injured two hotel guests - was caused by the overflight of American military planes.<br />A maelstrom of human activity soon flutters around the comatose couple - an English publisher, Adrian Venn, and his much younger American wife, Kerry. Gathering around the hospital beds are: Kerry's bewildered 14-year-old brother, Kip, left caring for his 18-month old nephew; the grown British children from Venn's previous marriage; an illegitimate French daughter and her suave, cynical husband, and - from afar - the mothers of these disaffected offspring.<br />Johnson moves from one character to the next, sketching their aspirations, disappointments, grudges, and libidinous urges. Venn's English lawyer, Osworthy, insists his client - declared brain-dead by the French doctor - must be moved to a better-equipped English hospital. Amy, with American can-do spirit, puts her money to a good purpose and organizes the move. But is Osworthy trying to save his client's life, or just have him pronounced dead on British soil?<br />Belatedly, Amy discovers that French and English laws differ widely in the disposal of a man's affairs. The French, following the Napoleonic code, disperse property among blood relatives, regardless of the wishes of the deceased, and to the detriment of the spouse. The British, like the Americans, allow a person to leave their property as they wish, vindictive or nonsensical as their desires may be.<br />With sharp wit and masterful, but kindly, ambivalence, Johnson lets her characters loose on each other in the throes of self-interest, guilt, sorrow, anger, longing, attraction, and all the other messy emotions divorce, new families, death and property engender. Cultural misunderstandings, insecurities and chauvinisms flourish among rash and sometimes regretted couplings.

(Jay Fletcher Thrillers)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Ethical dilemma fuels hacker thriller	Holt's debut thriller features FBI agent and computer hacker Janet (Jay) Fletcher, whose zeal doesn't always follow proper legal channels. When her illegally obtained evidence blows a murder case, she is assigned to an arson detail in Santa Fe. But she can't help running her computer tracking system to find a local serial killer.<br />Find him she does but her methods are not court admissable. Agonizing over what to do, she finds herself face-to-face with the killer - and evidence of an on-line network of people like himself - serial killers who've made a game out of ritualistic murder.<br />Holt knows computers, and uses this fantastic scenario to dazzle rather than confuse the reader. The action never flags but even more interesting is the ethical nail-biting. With expert manipulation, Holt fires the reader emotionally with gruesome murder scenes then asks &quot;What's more important - stopping a serial killer or obeying the law?&quot; And to really make it disturbing, Fletcher begins to get a thrill out of her rogue vigilantism. Exciting from first page to last.	2003-11-03

Narrator LuAnn Hagerdorn Garrett accepts her wealthy and politically powerful father's present of a restaurant in her home town of Tallagumsa, Alabama, as the solution to her family's financial woes and the dangers of bringing children up in Atlanta's city dangers.<br />Her husband, Eddie, a political cartoonist, is not enthusiastic about the move. LuAnn is entirely too much in thrall to her father and he sees their shaky marriage crumbling under the strain, which it does.<br />Plunging into her new life, LuAnn meets an attractive journalist and, defensively, begins to pursue the small town's most shameful mystery - the murder years before of two young black men on their way to integrate an Alabama college. But when her efforts uncover evidence leading to the indictment of her father, now front runner for governor, LuAnn is devastated. Believing totally in his innocence, despite his strange behavior and unwillingness to defend himself, she is further shaken by his ruthless behavior to other family members.<br />Wallace's successfully creates a contradictory Southern milieu - personable old ladies with streaks of vicious bigotry, obsession with the past, the easy-going small town with its deep distrust of outsiders. The atmosphere is absorbing, the story taut and the resolution a total surprise. The only problem is the father-fixated narrator. LuAnn's willful blindness and careless cruelties alienate the reader and in the end she gets off much too lightly.	2003-11-03

Reunited with his wife, Fiona, after her successful mission in East Germany has leapfrogged her ahead of him up the intelligence hierarchy, Samson still chafes at being kept out of the loop by his wife.<br />As revealed in the previous trilogy, Fiona's defection to the communists was an elaborate ruse, and her husband was among those successfully hoodwinked.<br />Brooding over his relations with Fiona and his feelings and obligations toward Gloria, the young woman who came into his life during his wife's absence, Samson takes on a dicey mission in East Germany. A Russian military man wants to defect and has requested Samson as his contact.<br />Samson's unease is quickly justified as he and his inexperienced assistant arrive at the meeting point to discover a dead man - their Russian, apparently, has been assassinated.<br />With his usual flair for nightime chases and crafty double-crossing, Deighton mixes personal agendas with political maneuvering. Friends, lovers and colleagues lie and few things are what they seem on the surface.<br />Samson ducks his own agency in order to follow his instincts and, against his better judgment, gets mixed up in two mysteries - the odd circumstances surrounding Fiona's sister's death, and the equally peculiar, if unconnected, circumstances around the killing that ended his East Berlin mission.<br />In setting up this new trilogy Deighton poses questions about Fiona's stability as well as the future of the Samson marriage and the fate of Gloria, Samson's appealing lover. The political picture is even murkier and the book ends with most of its mysteries intact.<br />Although this and all other books in the Samson series are meant to stand alone, readers unfamiliar with earlier volumes may have difficulty understanding motives and some of the subtly barbed dialogue. Deighton fans should enjoy the atmosphere and dialogue although Samson's dour personality has become a trifle grating.ans should enjoy the atmosphere and dialogue although Samson's dour personality has become a trifle grating.	2003-11-03

It opens in 1935 with a vivid glimpse of Constantine's hardscrabble life as the son of a Greek peasant farmer, then jumps to 1949, with Constantine, the young immigrant, in love with Mary. \\"He had a second life now, inside her head. He worried, almost every moment, that she would realize her mistake.\\"<br />By Easter 1958, Mary, the working class girl from Newark, has three children. Striving for perfection in a cake shaped like a bunny, she is harried by the demands of her family and too little money. When their son, Billy, wakes while she and Constantine are filling Easter baskets, spoiling the surprise of them, Constantine loses his temper. \\"He might have conquered his own anger if Billy had remained defiant. But Billy began to cry and without quite having decided to, Constantine was shaking him.....\\" The scene grows, Mary frantic, throwing herself over Billy.  \\"Constantine was in a passion now, a crackling white glory. Delirious, he knocked the baskets off the table. Jelly beans sprayed like stones against the walls. Chocolate lambs broke on the floor, plastic eggs cracked open and spilled out the trinkets Mary had hidden inside. He started to ram his fist into the cake.\\"<br />But instead of destroying the cake, Constantine falls into a passion of regret, begging forgiveness from his son and wife. \\"She neither welcomed nor recoiled from his touch.\\"<br />This is a pattern set for life; Mary striving for perfection in the appearance of things, Constantine raging at the imperfections of his wife, his son, the life he had envisioned for himself in 1949.<br />And when Constantine stikes it rich, comparatively, by becoming partners with a Greek contractor building tract homes, the money solves nothing. Mary worries about fitting in in affluent suburbia; her eyes are opened to new horrors of failure.<br />Billy, especially, is a disappointment to his father. Brooding, effeminate, Billy grows increasingly bitter and isolated. After a particularly violent scene, the teenager Billy remarks to his older sister, Susan, \\" 'Have you noticed how he never breaks stuff?' \\"<br />Only Susan seems to have a handle on life. She takes after her mother, follows the rules, fits in with the cheerleaders and football players, has a shot at becoming Homecoming Queen. She's the peacemaker and on the night Billy vows to someday kill his father she goes to Constantine with soothing words and, finally, feeling the power sexuality can bring her, a most undaughterly kiss.<br />Zoe, the youngest, is an unknown. There's something wild and feral about her but only Zoe seems to stay completely clear of domestic storms.<br />Reeling from the loss of the Homecoming Queen crown, seeing herself clearly branded as Italian-Greek interloper, Susan decides on impulse to marry Todd, her insider boyfriend, and thereby escape her father's continuing clandestine \\"kisses and hugs.\\" This is one of the book's few jarring notes. Susan, accepted at college, ambitious and  vaguely contemptuous of the boyfriend who wants nothing more than to continue the life he's always known, has other means of escape. Instead she lets her mother organize an elaborate suburban ritual.<br />\\"The wedding was flawless, except for the guests.\\" Mary regards Constantine's colleagues balefully. Subject to vague sharp stabs of anger, Mary takes a pill and concentrates on her daughter. \\"It seemed that Susan had gone to another country, where all the girls were effortlessly thin and beautiful and all the boys had futures sturdy as suspension bridges....This one, at least, was safe.\\" So little do parents know their children.<br />Zoe slips into a drifting life in New York City where her best friend is a drag queen and her days are taken up with sex and drugs. She conceives a child by a black man who never knows of the pregnancy - the child remains an oddity to his grandparents who dote on Susan's boy, Ben - a rugged docile child whose inner life is a turmoil of secrets. Ironically, Ben's biggest secret is his burgeoning homosexuality, the same tendency Constantine spent his youth trying to beat out of Billy.<br />Billy seizes his independence from family the minute he goes off to Harvard as an undergraduate. He works at it, changing his name to Will, living in squalor, perpetuating several non-violent but nonetheless seering cruelties upon his parents. But he makes a life for himself, teaching, living quietly in Boston's gay community, eventually falling in love and coming to terms with some of his demons.<br />The episodic structure of the novel lends itself to drama and melodrama. But Cunningham's subtle portrayal of character imbues each scene with delicacy of feeling. Although people often react to the buttons others deliberately push, Cunningham explores the underlying complexities. In this way he successfully puts individual faces on such broad issues as AIDS, homosexuality, family violence, adultery, suburban posturing and, through it all, intergenerational misunderstanding. Without being heavy-handed about it, Cunningham underlines the unchangeable constant - one person can never completely see into the heart and soul of another.<br />\\"Flesh and Blood\\" is a marvelous work, moving, thought-provoking and wholly absorbing.ity where her best friend is a drag queen and her days are taken up with sex and drugs.

The first of these limited Jews to public benches marked for them, thereby denying the elderly, many already displaced from their homes, the solace of parks. The second occurred when her elderly mother smiled at a functionary who processed her emigration papers. The official screamed at her mother for her effrontery.<br />\\"That's when I realized that these people were beyond the reach of human kindness,\\" says Adelsberger. The third was the denial, after months of wrangling, of her mother's exit visa by the host country.  Adelsberger realized finally that \\"the outside world didn't want to get involved.\\"<br />Adelsberger missed her last chance to flee when her mother fell sick. As round-ups of Jews accelerated she found herself praying her mother would die before the SS came for her. Those prayers were answered but her own ordeal surpassed her worst imaginings.<br />In unadorned prose Adelsberger recounts life and the varieties of death at Auschwitz. Her voice is gentle, her eye sharp and compassionate, quick to note small ironies as well as gratuitous kindness and cruelty.<br />As a doctor, Adelsberger was assigned to the gypsy camp where an epidemic of typhus was raging. There were no medicines and hundreds died daily in their own filth. Why the camp commanders bothered with a hospital at all is a mystery which can be inadequately answered only by the Nazi passion for order.<br />Meticulous records were kept of everyone. One of the camp's most grueling rituals was the daily roll call. With 25 to 35,000 inmates in the women's camp alone, with the camp's policy of moving inmates from one section to another without notice, and with hundreds dying enroute to forced labor or hidden in a corner of their block, an exact roll call was difficult to achieve. Twice a day, before dawn and after work, inmates stood for roll call. This encompassed everyone except the dead and lasted one to two hours  unless the tally did not match. \\"A roll call that lasted a day and a night without interruption was nothing unusual.\\"<br />Roll call, the unexplained withholding of food from already starving people, forced labor, these were routine. Then there were the days that stood out. Sunday in the gypsy camp when gymnasts and musicians put on a show (the Gypsies were allowed to keep their possessions) and an audience of 16,000 sang and danced to  music which ended abruptly with an order for \\"block confinement.\\" After hours of waiting  and the Gypsies know what they're waiting for  the SS appear, calling out names and numbers. That night 2,500 Czech Gypsies were sent to the gas chambers.<br />Adelsberger also tells of strategies for survival, although she says no one expected to leave the camp alive. But certain work details  the kitchen, the bathhouse where prisoners were stripped of their last possessions, the band, were coveted. Barter and communication systems were devised despite the dangers of detection.<br />But the vast majority worked in the mills or munitions factories or the potato bunker. Or they dug graves. The worst was reserved for young, healthy Jewish men. Totally isolated from the rest of the camp, they worked in the crematorium. After two or three months they too were gassed. \\"Sometime while at work, one never knew when, the valves of the gas chamber would close, the gas would be turned on, and  a new Sonderkommando would replace the old.\\"<br />A heart-rending memoir, yes, but it speaks as much for the beauties and strength of the human heart as for the incomprehensible monstrousness of the experience.hidden in a corner of their block, an exact roll call was difficult to achieve.

The fifth, The Cherished Wives, picks up the Whitmeads in the late 1700s, as George Whitmead, a wealthy merchant with the East India Company, returns from India to England to choose a suitable bride.<br />George may be young but he has decided ideas about wifely deportment and his interval at home stretches as one young woman after another proves too talkative, too opinionated, too forward, too independent. Then his eye falls on Lucy-Anne, 17, shy, quiet, inexperienced and protected.<br />Even before the wedding Lucy-Anne understands that the sun shines on George exclusively and that her own orbit will be of his choosing. But at her wedding her great aunt Henrietta bestows an unusual blessing: &quot;I wish you well, my dear, and I wish you power and freedom too; more of them than I have ever had.&quot;<br />Her words ring in Lucy-Anne's mind over the years, most often ironically, for power and freedom were not part of her marriage bargain. Lucy-Anne traded away any chance at either in return for the security she gains from being George's wife and mistress of his Surrey Estate.<br />But it's a hard bargain. George, disappointed in an heir, returns disgruntled to his beloved India, leaving his wife in the care of his mother, both cocooned in respectable seclusion on his estate. But old Mrs. Whitmead soon dies in a most protracted and hideous manner and Lucy-Anne is left to cope on her own. A particularly blistering and insensitive letter from George destroys the last of her regard but Lucy-Anne struggles to run the estate and live according to his proscriptions while carving out a niche for herself.<br />Since anything she does is likely to annoy George, deception becomes a way of life and repressed emotions smolder, needing only the slightest spark to shatter her artificial and lonely life. That spark is, of course, supplied. But this is no passionate bodice-ripper, no tale of triumph for the headstrong heroine. Quite the opposite. Passion turns to ashes when doused with the cold water of reality and every small gesture of assertiveness on Lucy-Anne's part is beaten back tenfold.<br />Anand's compassionate but unsentimental eye creates a vivid world in which the characters are wholly of their time. Her prose is colorful and evocative, her characters, especially the women, completely human, and the richness of historical detail forms the textural background inseparable from the story itself. Those who have not read Anand before will find themselves turning with pleasure to her earlier works.al and lonely life. That spark is, of course, supplied.

Hilarious and manic, this first novel features a room full of brokers strung out on fear and greed. &quot;It was a filthy profession, but the money was addicting, and one addiction led to another, and they were all going to hell.&quot;<br />The book's great strength is the writing, which snaps and sizzles with wicked glee and doesn't let up from first page to last. Its weaknesses are lack of plot and no main character.<br />Sid Geeder is the closest Bronson comes to a protagonist. An old man of 34, with just nine months to go before his five years are up and he can cash in his shares and become a rich man who will never have to work again, he's the King of Mortgages. The more he hates an offering the better he can sell it, in hopes one of these deals may finally bring the whole corrupt system crashing down. He sells the Resolution Trust Corp.'s &quot;preposterous intention to borrow a gazillion dollars in order to shut down some thrifts,&quot; by assuring his accounts &quot;that the government is a safe investment because we can count on them never to solve their problems.&quot;<br />Eggs Igino is the new kid, the maverick. &quot;In a world of unmerciful uniformity, rebels were hard to come by,&quot; muses sales manager Coyote Jack. He was King of Mortgages in the old days, four or five years earlier when &quot;Mortgage bonds were brand-new and nobody understood them, so they were easy to sell, because no client wanted to admit he lacked the intellectual brain power to understand these complex variable cash flows.&quot;<br />Nowadays he clings to his own Third Law: &quot;Never hire anyone you can't fire,&quot; and berates his crew unmercifully. &quot;Coyote Jack watched with unbearable pleasure. To have Sidney Geeder howling angry and Eggs Igino wildly subordinate was the perfect market condition for selling bonds.&quot;<br />The deals get more and more outrageous until finally U.S. capitalism has decided to attempt a hostile corporate takeover of the assetts of the Domican Republic. Eggs Igino mysteriously disappears and is there ever any hope Sidney will get to cash in his shares and retire?<br />Forget suspense, story line, all that rot.

921805:US	52774618	R1LPOW8CNYMQ6R	0684825236	55578677	A Good Life: Newspapering and Other Adventures	Books	4	29	31	N	N	A portrait of interesting times - from the top	Easily the country's best known newspaper editor (thanks to Watergate, the movie: &quot;All The President's Men&quot;), Ben Bradlee retired in 1991 at age 70, having fulfilled his life's ambition - the transformation of The Washington Post from something of a mess to a paper of stature and influence to rival The New York Times.<br />In this memoir, Bradlee emerges unapologetically as a cheerful white male born into the power elite, not particularly reflective but aware of his abilities, particularly his aptitude for recognizing talent in others and his willingness to make decisions. Work and ambition were central to his life, even costing him two marriages - although neither marriage ended until the next wife was waiting in the wings.<br />Bradlee is a reporter rather than a storyteller and the first third of his memoir is guaranteed to irritate those for whom Harvard was not a given and who can't conceive of &quot;scrounging&quot; up $10,000 (in 1946!) to invest in a start-up for a first job in newspapering, in Manchester, N.H.<br />Given his family and contacts and, yes, hard work, Bradlee's jobs were all interesting but the meat and excitement of the book begin with his friendship with John F. Kennedy. The Bradlees and the Kennedys became Washington neighbors while Kennedy was a senator, Bradlee was beginning to break &quot;out of the herd&quot; at Newsweek magazine and Jackie and Tony Bradlee were pregnant.<br />As the &quot;foursome&quot; spent many social hours together, the line between friendship, politics, and the big scoop, blurred. Bradlee relates a number of amusing anecdotes, best among them an exclusive on the swap of U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers, &quot;sourced from the President of the United States, [dictated] from a telephone just off a White House dance floor.&quot; Heady moments indeed.<br />Then came the assassination. Friendship and profession crashed head-on. And a few months later Bradlee's sister-in-law, Mary Meyer, was murdered. The CIA came looking for her diary. When Bradlee and his wife found it they were shocked to learn Meyer had been conducting a two-year love affair with Kennedy. Interestingly, Bradlee does not speculate on conspiracy theories, with regard to JFK or Mary Meyer.<br />But Bradlee is sparing with personal detail - incidents aplenty but not a lot of insight. His portrait of Jackie is most poignant for being so sketchy. Her deeply private nature baffled Bradlee and made him nervous. Their friendship faded after the assassination and Jackie never spoke to Bradlee again after he published Conversations With Kennedy in 1975. To this reader it seems obvious that Jackie was deeply offended by Bradlee's exploitation of their private moments but this never seems to occur to him.<br />However, this nonreflective quality can be valuable in a newspaperman. When the Vietnam war was raging, when his own wife was marching in protest, Bradlee's concern was good stories. &quot;I concentrated on trying to discover what was going on in Vietnam, on trying to determine who was telling the truth about Vietnam, before it occurred to me to find out where I stood myself.&quot; New at the helm of the Post, Bradlee wanted &quot;a new Hemingway ...who could explain the drama...in terms of the young soldiers.&quot; He found Ward Just.<br />In addition to assembling a maverick team of &quot;new&quot; journalists in the mid-60s, Bradlee was tireless in improving the production end of the newspaper. And he knew when to sink his teeth into a story and hang on. Watergate is the high point. It came at just the right time for the Post.  Bradlee's position was consolidated, his ground work on talent and organization completed.<br />Bradlee captures the adrenaline-filled days of relentless reporters and the dogged quality the Post encouraged in them. For almost a year the paper was virtually alone in its pursuit of the story, until James McCord's damning admissions vindicated the Post. Gleefully, Bradlee includes scathing personal attacks on him and the Post by Bob Dole, Chuck Colson and prominent republicans everywhere. When a new piece of the puzzle fell into place, &quot;Just the recollection of that discovery makes my heart beat faster, two decades later.&quot; And, of course, &quot;People in the know, people in power, were already speaking of The New York Times and The Washington Post in the same breath....&quot;<br />If this was the high, Janet Cooke's Pulitzer Prize winning story of an 8-year-old heroin adict that turned out to be fiction (1981) was the low. Bradlee explores this debacle as openly as he does the happier lessons of Watergate. Race certainly played its part.<br />Bradlee, running a major newspaper in a city with a 70 percent black population, had never known a black person, save a Haitian Frenchman in Paris. And he was surrounded by a similarly insulated group of connected white males. &quot;Female Phi Beta Kappa graduates of Seven Sisters colleges who can write the King's English with style don't grown on trees....&quot;<br />No kidding. But actually Cooke had never graduated from Vassar, much less with honors. The Brahmin background that propelled Bradlee's career from prep school on served him poorly when it came time to include some of the hoi poloi in the editorial mix.<br />Whatever his faults, Bradlee comes across as scrupulously honest. He doesn't give away any big secrets - you won't discover the identity of Deep Throat, for instance, but &quot;The Good Life,&quot;  chock full of our time's headiest moments, will fascinate anyone interested in the insider's view of current events and prominent people.hing personal attacks on him and the Post by Bob Dole, Chuck Colson and prominent republicans everywhere.

Olivia immediately hates the idea of another rival for her scattered mother's affections and is doubly appalled when the sophisticated older sister she has pictured turns out to be short, chubby and unabashedly extroverted.<br />Kwan, fascinated by all things American, asks embarrassing questions in front of Olivia's friends, prompting the younger girl to retaliate with numerous minor cruelties. Worse than usurping her mother's affections, Kwan usurps her maternal role, leaving Olivia's mother free to enjoy shopping trips with her girlfriends and pursue a love affair with the first of Olivia's stepfathers. But worst of all, Kwan has yin eyes - she sees into the world of ghosts and converses easily with people long dead.<br />When Olivia betrays her secret of the yin eyes, Kwan is sent to a mental hospital. Although Kwan never bears a grudge but remains open and unqualifyingly loving toward Olivia, a pattern of guilt and  resentment is established. Olivia humors Kwan's ghost talk but keeps her older sister at arm's length, unless she wants something from her.<br />When she falls in love with Simon, a half-Hawaiian Chinese who is haunted by his love for a dead girlfriend, Olivia gets Kwan to pretend to see Elza in the yin world and to deliver Elza's message setting Simon free. But Olivia herself sees Elza and hears her beseeching Simon to wait for her forever. She discounts Kwan's odd knowledge of Elza's life, her real name, her private aspirations, certain she must have told Kwan more than she remembers. But her own horrific vision haunts her married life and she is certain Simon withholds half his love for the dead girl.<br />Eventually the marriage breaks down. Kwan, dismayed, tries to convince Olivia to reconcile with Simon, certain that fate means for them to be together.<br />Meanwhile, a Chinese tale, Kwan's mythic story of a previous life during a bloody uprising in Chiangmian, interrupts Olivia's narrative of modern discontent. Kwan's story is of missionaries and warriors, imperialists and magic, love and betrayal, and Olivia has been hearing it impatiently all her life.<br />And when Olivia and Simon are convinced by the force of Kwan's desire to accept a magazine assignment that takes all three of them to Chiangmian, the two disparate stories come together in ways that call upon all the hundred secret senses of the human soul.<br />Kwan's accumulated wisdom has taught her that true love cannot thrive until the defensive walls of the soul have been breached, and this takes patience and loyalty. To develop the theme it's necessary for Olivia to be a repressed, suspicious and self-absorbed character but as it's her voice that tells the story, these whiney, petulant qualities get on the reader's nerves.<br />Tan is a consummate story teller and her prose is faultless but her narrator's particularly American preoccupation robs the narrative of the complex resonances of The Kitchen God's Wife or the broad soap-operatic canvas of The Joy Luck Club.olds half his love for the dead girl.<br />Eventually the marriage breaks down.

The event's main attraction, a famous author identified only as \\"Q.,\\" bemoans and celebrates his \\"doppelganger, a malignant shadow who lived in the mirrors and under the floorboards and behind the drapes of his own existence, haunting all of Q.'s personal relationships and all of his commerce with the world.\\" This mischievous double would pop up occasionally \\"to ensure that human misfortune...continued unabated in Q.'s life. Otherwise, of course, there would be nothing to write about.\\"<br />After his opening speech, Q. is never again seen in anything but a state of alcoholic catatonia. But Tripp finds much to sympathize with in this speech, calling his own version \\"the midnight disease.\\"<br />Tripp's own role at the festival is nebulous and seems to consist mostly of providing entertainment for his old college chum, current editor and flamboyant homosexual Terry Crabtree, who arrives towing a transvestite he met on the plane, but soon dumps her in favor of Tripp's darkly tormented and talented student James Leer.<br />As the festival opens, Tripp is terrified Crabtree will demand to see his novel. At 2,600 pages it has five unsuitable endings. And his third wife, Emily, has left him - although it takes him a full day to absorb the signs, having consigned them to paranoia generated by his perpetual marijuana fog. When his girlfriend, Sara, the college chancellor, tells him she is pregnant, thereby issuing an ultimatum on their relationship, Tripp dives into the bourbon he had forsworn four years earlier.<br />In a haze of pot and alcohol he spots his possibly suicidal student James Leer with a gun and takes him under his wing. Tripp is no stranger to suicide demons - his own father was a suicide as was the first writer he ever knew, and the first he ever plagiarized. Hoping to distract Leer, Tripp leads him deep into the chancellor's house, into her bedroom and her husband's closet where his prized memorabilia collection is housed, including the jacket Marilyn Monroe wore when she married Joe Dimaggio.<br />Sara's guests leave and Tripp and Leer are alone in the house. Tension and inevitable disaster loom over the audacious comedy of the scene.<br />When the chancellor's dog comes snarling, Tripp is attacked and bitten. \\"I was afraid, but not too afraid for it to occur to me that dying torn to pieces by blind, mad dogs had a certain mythic quality that might work well in the section of Wonder Boys....\\"<br />And the roller coaster ride is begun. Leer's little gun goes off and the dog is dead. Tripp loads the dog into his trunk and heads off to tell Sara. But he can't quite. Things get worse and he consumes more pot, more bourbon. Lies to the police, grabs James Leer and abandons WordFest, heading off to join Emily's family for the Passover Seder, then turns back to confess all to Sara, chickens out - no surprise - and resumes his pursuit of Emily and a family to belong to. Seeing Emily, he is again unable to get a morsel of truth to pass his lips and resorts to using family members as chancy go-betweens.<br />All of this manic and downwardly spiraling activity is conducted amidst a monologue of what it has meant to consciously cloak oneself in the writerly personna and, after everything, to face the specter of failure. Tripp and Crabtree are the old \\"wonder boys,\\" running uphill to stay that way, while James Leer is the newest \\"wonder boy\\" with a passable novel in his knapsack, a made-up identity and a whole baggage of self-loathing and despair. In James, Tripp sees himself but even his attempts to rescue Leer are formless and misguided.<br />Tripp returns to WordFest intime for its finale and his own nadir of self-destruction. Although images and prospects of suicide haunt the narrative, there is never any expectation that Tripp will choose that fate. He loves life, he just doesn't like the present version much.<br />His approach to relationships and events is an often contradictory mix of guilt, self-preservation and a writer's reflective curiosity. He's addicted to the sensation of pot which \\"makes me feel like everything already happened five minutes ago.\\" He's a collector of interesting people. Emily, a Korean refugee, is the adopted child of a Jewish couple whose biological son died in an accident. Emily is as self-contained and austere as Tripp is sloppy. Which doesn't mean she hurts any less.<br />Tripp follows her, not so much with any idea of resuming his marriage (he's already anticipating a dalliance with the 20-year-old student who lives in his house), but to recollect her odd and endearing family and introduce them to James. These rather chilly motivations are, however, well wrapped in layers of emotional yearning. Sara is a woman with a well-constructed life, carefully built up a step at a time with education, career advancement and prudence - until, having accomplished her goals, she falls in with Tripp. Tripp, naturally, is hoping she'll decide on abortion, although he'd never say as much to her.<br />Chabon's writing is sharp, barbed and appealing, as contradictory as his hero. His images are crisp and complete, offering boldly sketched characters which come near but never succumb to caricature. Tripp, though he shouldn't be, is likable and the reader roots for him to get out from under the weight of his novel as if it's that and not himself which prevents a fresh start.<br />Chabon enjoys his contradictions. Academia is staid and stuffy, childish and wild. It's at the heart of Tripp's life but remains on the fringes of the novel. The tone is melancholy while events are antic. Tripp revels in sensation for the sake of something to write about and is so overcome by sensation he cannot write coherently.<br />And while the story of male mid-life crisis is not new, Chabon's voice is entertaining and thought-provoking. Amidst all the humor and bite is a meditation on what it means to strive too hard to be a writer.

Chappie is deeply into anger and rebellion and has no sense of self-worth. When the thefts are discovered, Chappie slams out of the house.<br />Homeless, Chappie begins dealing weed to keep his spot on the couch in his friend Russ' squalid apartment, which Russ shares with a revolving group of thuggish bikers. He drifts, getting high and hanging out at the mall until the bikers begin boosting stereo equipment. Russ wants in but Chappie wants no part of it.<br />\\"For them [adults] I guess what was right was what you could get away with and what was wrong was what you couldn't, but it made me feel stupid that I didn't know it too.

Bone strikes out on his own. He's picked up by a pedophile who appeared earlier in the novel and manages to abscond with the pedophile's cash and his little girl captive, Froggy.<br />Bone returns to the bus which is now sweet-smelling and occupied by the book's Jim character, a run-away migrant worker from Jamaica, a pot-steeped Rastafarian who calls himself I-Man. Awed by I-Man's evident wisdom and peaceful sense of himself, Bone clings to him as friend and father figure, absorbing as much Rastafarian mysticism as he can. Eventually he travels to Jamaica with I-Man, after returning Froggy to the crackhead mother who sold her and trying one last time to reconcile with his own mother.<br />Banks is clearly familiar with the Jamaica the tourists don't see. Bone, meeting up with his real father, lives on the edge between the rich white residents and the black Jamaicans who score off them as best they can. Here is a world as brutal and unforgiving as the one Bone left behind and alien too.

Bone, after working hard at becoming a Rastafarian, cuts off his dreadlocks and embraces his white American identity in a spirit of guilt. \\"I knew if I wasn't white, if I'd been a real Rasta-boy like I'd been pretending to be I'd be dead now.\\"<br />Banks' vernacular voice never flags or falters.

His swing is effortless; his skill uncanny. Like a young Tiger Woods, he ought to have it made in the shade. But there's a problem. It's 1953 and Train is a black kid from Watts with an abusive stepfather. \\"Civil rights\\" is not a term anyone is familiar with and Train would be barred from play on most golf courses in the country. He's a caddy at Brookline, LA's most exclusive country club.<br />Enter Miller Packard. Train, who comes up with names for most of his \\"totes,\\" dubs him \\"the Mile Away Man,\\" for his distracted air. The reader has already met Packard in a prologue chapter set in Philadelphia five years earlier. A war veteran who spent five days in the Pacific Ocean after his ship went down, Packard became a firefighter, famous for the risks he took. But the rush grew stale.<br />\\"And so, needing a hobby, Packard became a runner.<br />\\"Here was Packard's training schedule: Midnight, he would walk into a neighborhood where he did not belong, say Kensington or the Devil's Pocket. He'd sit down in a bar, order a beer, and insult one of the locals. The easiest way to insult one was to use a word he didn't understand. Avuncular, bulbous, crescendo. Say the word avuncular and the next thing you knew, fifteen of them had bats and were chasing you down the street, screaming, `Kill the queer.' \\"<br />Eventually, even this becomes too tame for Packard. That's the sort of guy he is. But Train doesn't know any of that. If he did it might make him a bit more wary. There's enough everyday danger in Train's life without going looking for trouble. He doesn't know Packard is a police sergeant either. If he had, he'd have steered clear of him, despite his easy confidence and respectful manners.<br />But he doesn't steer clear of him; Train even takes a beating trying to fulfill Packard's expectations of integrity. Then a woman is raped, and two men killed by a couple of the caddies at Brookline and all of them are fired. Packard, the cop on the scene, becomes involved with the widow, and Train, homeless and shaken by his own capacity for violence, takes up with Plural, a brain-damaged ex-fighter who makes him feel safer. His and Packard's lives diverge.<br />Train finds another golf course, a better one, for him. It's an integrated development with housing, but money is tight and no one knows anything about managing a golf course. Train soon has a free hand with the place. He has to bring Plural along, though, feeling responsible for the man, and Plural, always unpredictable, is now blind too. So, even as things are looking up, that edgy feeling remains; disaster just around the next bend.<br />Then along comes Packard, ready for a new challenge in his life. He moves Train and Plural into his new wife's guest house in Beverly Hills, and begins championing Train at golf matches around the country, winning thousands.<br />\\"He [Train] liked winning, and he liked hearing the excuses. He liked that feeling when he took the heart out of other players with shots they never thought of hitting. He liked it every time he make them reassess him up.<br />\\"He begun trying to think of some way to keep it like this, looking beyond tomorrow. Begun to think like it was his.\\"<br />The reader knows just as well as Train does that that's not likely, and there's no saying what Packard knows. After the first chapter we never see inside his head again, and his motivations are a mystery to the other characters. It's obvious why he wants to run Train, but why put the two young black men - one a scary looking, violent and unpredictable ex-fighter - into proximity with a woman who's been raped and seen her husband killed by two young black men? Is he just stirring the pot to see what rises?<br />Packard, though he seems to have less than the normal range of human feeling, fascinates. Train is the one who engages.  He's a young man with looks, talent, brains, heart, and complexity - all of it canceled out by the color of his skin. Dexter's story, and Train's life, turns on racism. Casual, brutal and inescapable.<br />In Dexter's hands golf is a study of human nature, most of it bad. Sneers and temper fits and excuses from losers: arrogance and insults from winners. There's cheating, lying, and trying too hard. Occasionally there's respect and good sportsmanship. Though the tale is LA noir at its bleakest, the writing is comic (yes, blackly so) and there are a lot of funny golf moments:<br />\\"That was all you wanted in your head to swing a golf club, a light breeze to empty things out.<br />\\"Didn't mean you had to be stupid to play the game, but it didn't hurt.\\"<br />Dexter, winner of the National Book Award for \\"Paris Trout\\" has come up with a solid page-turner, which turns on one of his favorite themes - the damage racism can do to a man, a community and a culture.- all of it canceled out by the color of his skin.

Small things gather momentum. She begins fighting with her husband, resumes smoking, goes out drinking after work. The imaginary playmate from her childhood returns. It's quite some time before she realizes the seductive, insistent third voice inside her head (after the initial voice of temptation, and after the sober rejoinder of the voice of reason and resistance) isn`t her own. Or is it?<br />Gran's (\\"Saturn's Return to New York\\") short novel is a fairly straightforward tale of demonic possession, made chillingly delicious by the spare, unadorned voice, quick pace, and subtleties of psychological desire. Amanda's fate is not inevitable; there are ways to counter the demon, but does she have the faith required, or the strength of mind? Does she perhaps prefer to give in? Thoughtful as well as scary, Gran's tale evokes the lonely fears of adulthood.	2003-10-20

Two survived, along with a guilt-ridden cop. Tim was unharmed but his girlfriend died. Kyle was brain damaged, transformed from angry young man to perpetual innocent. The dead teens flit from person to person, drawn by thoughts of themselves. But the cop, Brooks, and Tim, and Kyle's grieving, overburdened mother, all of them sad with guilt, draw them the most.<br />There are lots of creepy possibilities here, but O'Nan chooses a bleaker route and after a while the suspense can't hold up under the atmosphere of fatalistic realism.

Weber's third novel (after \\"Objects in Mirror Are Closer than They Appear\\" and \\"The Music Lesson\\") poses this question in a playful, multi-referential coming-of-age comedy.<br />Affluent New Yorkers, the elder Greens, Janet and Lou, are brainy, academic, sophisticated, loving, and fascinating to each other and to their three devoted daughters. Meg, 20, a student at Yale, is levelheaded and deliberative; Joanna, 17, is a plainspoken tomboy, and Amy, 15, is impetuous, hotheaded and artistic. They revel in being sisters and family life is stimulating, comforting, wholly engaging. In a word, bliss.<br />Then Janet, the English professor, has an affair with one of her students. But Lou refuses to be enraged and Janet refuses to prostrate herself in abject shame; both reject histrionics. Their rapprochement is civilized and does not involve their daughters. Janet and Lou refuse to even discuss the matter with the girls, stubbornly ignoring their outrageous taunts and vicious insults. Betrayed, infuriated, the sisters decide to go live with Meg in her New Haven apartment. \\"We left our mother and father because they wouldn't leave each other.\\"<br />Joanna narrates. It's four years later and she has written an autobiographical novel. Since her account involves her sisters she has entered into a \\"binding agreement\\" to allow them to insert \\"reader's notes\\" in the text, which she responds to in \\"author's notes.\\" They settle in with Teddy Bell, their orphaned flatmate, and attend an inner city school, which presents a ghastly contrast to their privileged private school, while learning the alarming value of money when it's lacking. Joanna relates their solidarity, their sorrow and their disagreements, sparking affronted commentary from her sisters, who see events differently. These interjections offer lively variations on the events of the story - a witty, sisterly bickering that explores the role of the unreliable narrator, the wobbly relationship between perception and reality, the novelist's responsibilities and the self-serving aspects of fiction. These notes also create new dimensions to the characters Joanna has depicted in her novel.<br />Though the ending is a trifle abrupt and the story's climax - a revelation of secrets and coming-of-age ambiguities - feels rushed and unresolved, this is a delight from first page to last. Written with humor, compassion and irony, the novel explores issues of class and fairness as well as family dynamics and the all-important role of perception and point-of-view. Weber's prose is elegant, spare, charming, witty and engaging.

Patterns soon begin to emerge and a story - well, several stories - gathers momentum.<br />The narrator, Chrysallis, is a Peruvian Indian who was adopted as a baby by her CIA father when he found her crying outside a massacred village. Or so she's been told, anyway. She has no memory of her infant life, and her adoptive father is long dead in a far-away place.<br />Chrysallis is the more familial of the siblings - Eddie did not even show up for his mother's cremation, while Chrysallis organized the funeral. \\"Because she had nothing suitable, I lent Mom the dress in which she was cremated.\\"<br />But it's Eddie who inherited and he has brought Ralph as the star attraction in the Tibetan School of Miracles, a moneymaking scheme to gull the gullible. Ralph - not his real name - a \\"trailer trash\\" potter with a gift for physical stillness and tough love, met Eddie under coincidental circumstances, but greater coincidences are in store. It turns out Ralph is the brother of Eddie's one true love, a professional blackjack player. Who somehow knew Eddie and Chrysallis' father.<br />It gets a little confusing, keeping track of all these relationships and parents and stepparents, but as the story unfolds the connections make sense and assume an inevitability that fits perfectly with Chrysallis' blossoming understanding.<br />This is a daring debut, neatly constructed, moving from the fragmentary to the whole, reflecting the narrator's growth, until the girl and her story are so grounded that a conventional ending becomes permissible.

Initially taking on what seems to be an infidelity case, Maisie is lead to a home for convalescent veterans run by a man whose charisma seems mesmerizing. Beset by her own demons, Maisie is drawn to the place, curious about the men - most with devastating facial damage - who give up the world to live in this closed-off compound.<br />While cult tactics are familiar to modern readers, Winspear does a good job of presenting Maisie's investigation as a tentative, but dogged foray into the unknown. Maisie is a careful, driven character with plenty of inner scarring from her own war experience. Winspear artfully presents the psychological effect the war had on its generation and the changes being wrought on society. Its flaws are a long middle section detailing Maisie's rise from lower-orders poverty, thanks to a titled benefactor and a wise mentor, and a jarring ending. But these are first-novel flaws, which won't stand in the way of a beguiling heroine and great series premise.	2003-10-03

He's fallen a notch from his Oxford Days, but not so low he can't feel ashamed when his cruel, clever jeering ruins the career of a \\"patterer,\\" Henry Owler, whose sale of true crime verses barely keeps his daughter and his ward in greasy soup and straw pallets.<br />Owler seeks the exclusive confession of a serial killer, William Ryan, dubbed Chokee Bill, \\"the fiend in human form,\\" and extracts a promise from Whitty (by arranging an involuntary visit to a labyrinthine slum) to resurrect his reputation if his verses prove true. Owler has an in at the prison, but there's a problem. Chokee Bill insists on his innocence and the killings have continued - hushed by the police, the merchants, even the pickpockets and Owler himself - all the people who suffered while fear of the fiend kept business away. Only Whitty, ever in need of a sensational story for his readers - has reason to pursue the real killer.<br />Gray takes us into the lodgings of the privileged and the reeking shacks of the destitute, the variously appointed taverns of journalists, prostitutes, thieves and worse. He takes us to brothels and drawing rooms and the prison cells of condemned men. And he spins a classic yarn full of heroism and hypocrisy, viciousness and desperation, thrills and just desserts and low blows.<br />The atmosphere is odoriferous and visual, the plot full of characters who belie their appearances, and the writing is witty, sardonic and Dickensian.

Fearless, aptly named, has a soft side for women in trouble, so when a woman asks him to find her husband, a man Fearless has been working for, he enlists Paris' help.<br />Paris shudders at the thought, but his big friend brings out the courage in him - \\"being friends with him was like having one of God's second cousins as a pal\\" - and besides, a white man shows up looking for Fearless. \\"I needed to know if my friend's problems were going to spill over onto me.\\"<br />Mosley writes a well-plotted mystery, full of twists and murders and double crossings, but within the mystery framework he explores nuances of character and the ways black people get by in the white people's world. Inarticulate, dangerous Fearless, living day-to-day, is a generous, principled man with an uncanny ability to read people, while Paris, the literate one, fights a craven, selfish streak. Paris is reflective though, and while not always proud of himself, he knows what he can live with.<br />The plot takes us through the alleys and backstreets of LA, to bail bondsmen, aggressive cops and LA's wealthiest black businesswoman who has suffered a robbery so devastating she won't talk about it. As always, Mosley's writing is eloquent and compact, atmospheric and gritty. Grasping family members, racist cops and lowlifes of both colors, as well as the fluid Fearless and the twitchy Paris, propel the plot through the force and weakness of their characters.	2003-10-03

His latest novel is firmly rooted in his Texas homeland, with a brief, powerful excursion to Scotland.<br />The book opens with an antic, visual scene, which introduces all of the characters, quickly drawn in bold, precise strokes. The Huttons have gathered for a memorial service for the family's crotchety matriarch. The setting is a sun-blasted field, filled with chairs all carried from a house filled with little else in the way of furniture. And when all the chairs are brought to the field, \\"the house was empty of chairs, and yet still full of them.\\" Aunt Edna, an unmarried school-cafeteria worker who cared for her dying mother for 20 years in that house, is an artist who paints only chairs, an eccentricity no one questions. \\"Aunt Edna liked to draw and paint chairs in the same way that my father liked to read books about the Civil War, or Aunt Margaret liked to play charades.\\"<br />The narrator, looking back on that summer, is her niece, Sarah, whose marriage is reeling from the blow of her husband's infidelity. \\"We were two fat women, eighteen years apart, a chair artist and a designer of Christmas ornaments, who only knew we had troubles and a hot summer to get through.\\" Sarah writes her story with the benefit of hindsight, so we know from the first that Aunt Edna has died and her paintings now hang in museums. How these events come about are two mysteries in a story full of revelations, small and large, about life, love and hard choices.<br />Gathering for the reading of the matriarch's will, the Hutton family is shocked to hear that the old lady wanted her ashes scattered in Scotland, a place she had no ties to and had only seen in a large picture book. Texans, if the Huttons are any example, can't see why anyone would want to travel more than a state or two away anyhow. But Aunt Edna is adamant and Sarah, her life in limbo, decides to stay with her aunt and accompany her to Scotland.<br />Their sojourn together, in the house and on the trip, is one of new beginnings - Sarah revives her art career from the doldrums of successful ornament design, and Aunt Edna accepts a marriage proposal from an old friend, a blind, black, chair repairer. Scotland gives both women a jolt. Its gray stone, heavy sky, and magnificent age are the antithesis of Texas. It seems a place at once alien and enfolding and apart from ordinary life. As they travel, doling out spoonfuls of Grandma and Grandpa's ashes in castle gardens, Aunt Edna's physical decline becomes obvious. Her pithy, impatient advice to her niece - mostly in the form of admonishment - takes on new urgency and a greater aura of wisdom.<br />Coomer's exploration of the mistakes and lessons of life, the crisp, often humorous debates on love, forgiveness and family, are saved from the dangers of preachiness or clich&eacute; by the quality of his writing and by the hindsight structure of the narrative. It's natural that Sarah, after all is said and done, gives greater weight to her dead aunt's wisdom. And Coomer's characters have complexities rather than quirks. Their talk arises from the weight of their hearts. As in previous novels, Coomer explores circumstances of personal epiphany occurring in the course of ordinary life, and makes the reader feel the better for the journey.with her aunt and accompany her to Scotland.<br />Their sojourn together, in the house and on the trip, is one of new beginnings - Sarah revives her art career from the doldrums of successful ornament design, and Aunt Edna accepts a marriage proposal from an old friend, a blind, black, chair repairer.

Arranged by course, from condiments to desserts (three chapters!) this book reflects the serious authority of its authors, particularly Lewis (\\"The Taste of Country Cooking\\"), who has won numerous awards over the years.<br />From Blackberry Cordial and Smoked Pork Stock, Old Fashioned Boiled Dressing and Wilted Salad, to Slow-Cooked Oxtails, Spicy Collards in Tomato-Onion Sauce, Corn Pudding and Buttermilk Biscuits, the authors encompass the range of time-honored dishes, each prefaced with a touch of history or a word on technique.<br />Emphasis is placed on quality of ingredients and, with the south's long growing season, the natural match of seasonal foods. This is a book that's nearly as nourishing to read as it is to cook from and comprehensive and elegant enough to be the only Southern cookbook you need.	2003-09-23

Narrator Top heads an Athens, GA, research firm, Polymath, founded as a tax cover for his real job - operative for Shaw's Mercantile, &quot;the world's leading booking agency for mercenaries, bodyguards, and probably worse.&quot; Top, wound tighter than the tops he collects, is itching for a challenge, but Shaw's cuts him loose instead. \\"My heart lurched against the inside of my rib cage as if I'd stood on the brakes in the fast lane....`What do you mean there's no assignment?' \\" His adrenaline jones has made him too reckless, a liability.<br />His severance package consists of a valuable heads-up. Shaw's just turned down a recovery-and-termination contract from a drug dealer who thinks Top has the money that disappeared when a courier, Dee Lane, disappeared.<br />Dee Lane is one of Top's boyhood friends. The other is Bob John, a cop. All of them enjoy the buzz of adrenaline, though none so much as Top. And now he has a job. Find Dee Lane, find the money, stay alive. The latter may be difficult as the drug dealer is not the only one who thinks Top has the money. Suddenly he's beset by DEA agents, redneck thugs, ambitious freelancers and worse - treacherous friends maybe.<br />Top is a delightful protagonist; witty, action-oriented and impossible to stump on a quote. His trusted employees, the quiet, knife-wizard Benny, and the beautiful administrator Gellie are always trying. How can you not like a widely read man who still throws up every time he sees a dead body?<br />The southern setting - from backwoods shoot-outs to decaying small-town insularity and hair-trigger racism - is well done. Bennie, deep and determined, and fast as lightning, is a valuable asset; complex, private and African American. The plot, though occasionally hard-to-follow or over-the-top, zips right along, but who cares about plot when the characters are so much fun and the writing sparkles with wit. Smart, funny and unapologetic, Top Kiernan is a winner. Let's hope we see more of him, and Benny, and the big, rambling old elementary school where they live and work.h wit.

First, it's a FedEx delivery from a dead colleague, complete with anthrax scare, then it's a narcoleptic collapse in which he relives the sudden death of his friend, and finally it's a surprise visit from his new psychiatrist, Rachel Weiss, who doesn't know where he lives. And all this is just the first chapter.<br />The pace picks up as Tennant tries to stop the project before he too is killed and the artificial-intelligence is activated. Iles, bestselling master of the thriller (\\"24 Hours,\\" \\"Dead Sleep\\"), blasts off in crisis mode and pours on the speed. Tennant manages to fill in the back-story as he goes, accompanied now by the beautiful, enigmatic and possibly treacherous Weiss, who considers Tennant paranoid/delusional at a minimum.<br />Project Trinity is near completion and its originator, the dying billionaire genius scientist, Peter Godin, wants to cheat death by loading his mind into the computer, creating an intelligence quantum leaps (literally - there's a quantum physics subplot that complicates the speculative possibilities) beyond the human. As National Security Operatives hunt Tennant with the latest military technology, and his narcoleptic visions become intense visions of Christ's last days, hair's breadth escapes and slippery twists keep the story buzzing, despite the cartoonish characters of the villains, particularly the security boss, a beautiful, scarred and oversexed killer with a daddy complex.<br />The New Agey ending, though predictable, just about spoiled the whole thing for me, but other readers may enjoy the slightly offbeat speculation. High marks for Crichton-like pacing and plot, but disappointing characters and resolution.

983165:US	52774618	R1C8CNMGW1PZSE	0802733786	862959785	Domino	Books	4	12	12	N	N	Painterly masquerade	Narrator George Cautley is an old man at the opening of this lush, dense story of 18th century London, King's first novel (written before his bestsellers, \\"Ex-Libris\\" and \\"Brunelleschi's Dome\\"). At a masquerade ball Cautley captures a young man's attention with the portrait miniature of a beautiful woman known as Lady Beauclair. Cautley offers to tell the boy his - and her - story, a tale of innocence and masquerade, deception, jealousy and corruption, that ends, Cautley says, with his becoming a murderer.<br />Cautley's narrative is actually two life histories, 50 years apart. His tale begins with his arrival in London in 1770 at age 17, and the second, Lady Beauclair's story of the operatic castrato Tristano, takes place 50 years earlier and is told to Cautley as Beauclair sits for her portrait. Yes, this becomes confusing, but the reader's disorientation is part of the fun, dovetailing playfully with King's themes of elusive identity, perception and deceptive appearance.<br />Cautley comes to London seeking his fortune as a portrait painter. The orphaned son of a country parson, he is earnest, naïve, clumsy, ambitious, and a bit of a prig. A potent combination. Taken by his rich friend Toppie to one of the masquerades so popular at the time, Cautley is relieved of what little money he has by a set of genial card sharps who gladly lend him more. His resulting insurmountable debt turns out to be his best luck, as the lender is none other than the man Cautley has been trying to meet, the famous portrait painter Sir Endymion Starker.<br />Later at the same party Cautley becomes disoriented by the numerous passageways, and is rescued by a glamorous costumed lady who bears a startling resemblance to a portrait he has just been admiring on the wall. Lady Beauclair invites Cautley to paint her portrait and hear the life story of the old man in the garden whose curious plight has caught Cautley's eye.<br />Beauclair's lodgings are in a decrepit, even dangerous part of town, but her rooms are elegant and her portrait costume most provocative. As her dress slips down her shoulder and the light from a single candle dances over her artfully painted face, she relates the sad, passionate story of the impoverished Italian boy who became one of the greatest singers in Italy in the 1720s. Cautley, entranced by Beauclair's aspect, (\\"the face that, as its vizard was removed, tallied in every point with my youthful standard of beauty\\") intimidated by her boldness, and in awe of her mystery, disregards some of the more doubtful elements of her allure.<br />Meanwhile, Cautley discharges his gambling debt to Starker, the great painter, by becoming his temporary apprentice. Starker has two studios - his big fashionable public address, where the rich come to have their portraits painted - and his secret, shabby bolt-hole where he keeps an angry mistress and paints his \\"true\\" art.<br />Beauclair takes Tristano toward his fate in the London opera houses, Cautley succumbs to a corrosive jealousy, and Starker reveals himself (in Cautley's judging eyes) to be a hypocrite in matters of love as well as art. Every straightforward drama and intrigue is draped and shadowed with mystery, illusion and doubt. Identities are obscured by costumes and masks, and motives are similarly cloaked. Much of the narrative takes place at the elaborate masquerades popular at the time (and 50 years earlier), where lords dressed like buxom serving maids or lusty soldiers and ladies wore the raiments of goddesses or shepherdesses. And those with real secrets wore dominos, the simple robe which hides form, figure and face.<br />King's writing is painterly. Paragraphs hurtle through teeming crowds and elaborate costumes and extravagant decadence as he immerses the reader in the period. There's fascinating detail on the lives of the castrati, the rigid demarcations of class, and attitudes toward art, music and morality, public and private. Hypocrisy and deception abound.<br />Though beautifully written, with an intriguing, suspenseful plot and vivid historical detail, the novel has a few minor plot flaws (why, for instance, would a prominent and wealthy painter bother fleecing an impoverished country bumpkin?) and a larger character flaw. Cautley, the naïf who becomes corrupted by his doubts, is not that likable to begin with and he diminishes through experience. Lady Beauclair is fascinating but ultimately unknowable and Tristano, barely glimpsed in the flesh, is more pawn than power. In other words, there are no heroes in King's elusive and colorful world. But it's a fascinating, evocative world and King's prose is pure pleasure.ough beautifully written, with an intriguing, suspenseful plot and vivid historical detail, the novel has a few minor plot flaws (why, for instance, would a prominent and wealthy painter bother fleecing an impoverished country bumpkin?) and a larger character flaw.

Indeed, Van Reid's droll storytelling depends upon it.<br />Misdirection and misunderstanding form the strong foundation of the meandering and digressive missions of the League's six members, who gather at the Shipswood Restaurant in the spring of 1897 for one of their regular dinners. They raise their water glasses (prohibition has been in effect in Maine for 46 years) to their only female member, Miss Phileda McCannon, who's making a journey to settle her deceased aunt's affairs. Mr. Tobias Walton, their chairman and the oldest at 48, is a bit subdued on this occasion as Phileda has not given an answer to his proposal of marriage.<br />Joseph Thump, Christopher Eagleton and Matthew Ephram are still in a small state of excitement after nearly running down a tavern keeper named Sparks who could have been Thump's double, but for his workingman's clothing and his high-pitched voice. The youngest member, Walton's faithful assistant Sundry Moss, 23, is the only one who dares to hazard that the crowd of ruffians backing away from the near-accident were pursuing Sparks rather than attempting his rescue.<br />The trio of Thump, Eagleton and Ephram have not seen the last of Sparks. Walking home through an unfamiliar and doubtful part of town, Thump happens to save a policeman from certain death-by-falling-piano, thereby incurring Mrs. Sparks' heartfelt gratitude for preserving her cousin, the perpetrator, from a murder charge.<br />This might again have been the end of it, but the trio, inspired by an incident in a play, determine that the lovely balloon ascensionist, Mrs. Roberto, must be in need of rescuing. Their mission leads them to a house of ill-repute (not that they ever realize where they are) and a run-in with the gang that's after Sparks, from which they escape thanks to Sparks' youngest son and his urchin friend who lead them over Portland's slippery rooftops. Sparks' network of less-than-respectable relatives continues to aid the trio as they seek Mrs. Roberto from Bangor to Dresden Mills, taking up with a large party of hoboes along the way.<br />Meanwhile, Moss, attempting to distract his employer, has taken Walton to visit his uncle in Norridgewock, though they never make it quite that far. The train is delayed in Bowdoinham where Walton is pressed to come to the aid of a glum prize pig. Perplexed by the locals' assumption of his expertise in porcine matters (the reader has been let-in on the misunderstanding), but as willing and easy-going as ever, Walton embarks on a visit to the Ferns, unhappy owners of the depressed pig, where Moss, a farmer's son and a bit more worldly than his fellow Moosepathians, soon susses the problem.<br />With digressions for the furtherance of romance and good acquaintance, Reid piles misunderstandings upon misunderstandings, constructing a hilarious journey through the towns and by-ways of Maine and the social strata of its best inhabitants. It all culminates in a spectacular and chaotic natural disaster, reuniting the League and necessitating numerous rescues and confusion and some wonderfully vivid writing.<br />Lots of local color and history round out the adventure. Reid's prose is playful, witty and dry, as well as eloquent and visual. The contrast between the transparent innocence of the steadfastly clueless trio and the sharp wits of Sundry Moss (think young George Burns and Gracie Allen) is a pleasure, further enhanced by the ready-for-anything calm of Toby Walton. Reid (whose Maine roots go back more than two centuries) leaves us with a tantalizing hint of the next to come in the League's adventures.

This adds to the fun as Karen juggles sleuthing, scruples and love life with her pursuit of tenure.<br />Enfield College is staging a murder mystery conference, academic style (from a feminist perspective), and has assigned its demanding celebrity guest, Sunnye Hardcastle, and her muscle-bound rottweiler, Trouble, to Karen. In addition, a whole set of 19th century penny-dreadfuls Karen needs for her own \\"Murder in History\\" paper has been stolen and an inventory has turned up greater thefts, among them the original manuscript of Dashiell Hammett's \\"Maltese Falcon.\\" And then, opening night, a thief is murdered in the library.<br />Karen likes Sunnye a lot better as a suspect than as sharp-tongued celebrity and is soon at cross purposes with the cop in charge, her boyfriend, Charlie. The thief's house is a treasure-trove of rare books - all stolen - and there's lots of rare-book lore along with the diverging lines of amateur, police and private eye (an old high school pal of Karen's) investigation.<br />Dobson keeps her wit sharp skewering every mystery genre available, as well as the academic setting, but keeps her humor from taking over the mystery, which wraps up in a neat surprise, scattering red herrings along the way. A clever balance.	2003-08-22

Sure, Turner was a city homicide cop, but why would any self-respecting lawman seek out a man we already know spent 11 years in prison?<br />It's a question that will have to wait. Sallis develops his story in parallel; the present investigation proceeds between alternating chapters exploring Turner's past. It's a history of abrupt starts and stops, of daring and competence, of tragedy and darkness, intelligence and pain. But in the present Turner moves cautiously into engagement with the people he meets, particularly the easy-going sheriff and another newcomer, a banjo-playing female attorney with the state cops.<br />Sallis' atmospheric, poetic prose delineates the complexities of human relationships, often between the lines. Though his characters build from loss, this story is less dark than previous novels, but his sense of place is as deeply orienting as ever. There's suspense on both sides of the story, but Turner, without apparent effort or desire, takes command of center stage. A fine novel.	2003-08-22

The security tape shows him entering the house the night of the murder and leaving 20 minutes later. But the security tape is missing.<br />And we, the reader, know who has it. There are a lot of voices in this novel, but Sloan segues well, moving among thugs, illegal domestics, nasty rich folk, cops and criminals, mouthy kids, angry parents, worried parents, grieving parents and bystanders.

They write on politics or art or culture or economics. But Vargas Llosa, Peruvian novelist (\\"Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter\\") and essayist (\\"Making Waves\\"), refuses to be pinned down. In the \\"Touchstone\\" column he writes for Spain's major newspaper, Vargas Llosa laments the demise of the British Reading Room with the same conviction and assurance with which he lambastes the leadership of the Chiapas rebels in Mexico or celebrates the erotic abandon of Rio's four-day Carnaval.<br />Vargas Llosa has been writing his column since 1977 and this second collection includes columns from 1992 to 2000. The title, which comes from a tribute to fellow writer and \\"intellectual agitator\\" Octavio Paz, is a fitting one. Not that Vargas Llosa could ever be accused of hot headedness. Though he does tend to describe destructive elements on the extreme right or left as \\"idiots\\" or \\"absolute idiots,\\" his impassioned opinions are informed by 60 years of global travel, observation, reading and thought.<br />His politics can be described fairly simply - he believes in secular democracy and the free market. Socially he is moderately liberal. But those simple terms embrace a host of cogent arguments and ironic observations from around the world.<br />Vargas Llosa relishes irony and contrast. There is amusement in his vivid description of the bejeweled rich who paid big money to sit enraptured at a lavish production of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill's masterpiece of anti-capitalism, \\"The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny. A bitter irony is found in the appropriation of the liberal argument for multiculturalism in defense of the abhorrent practice of female \\"circumcision\\" among immigrants to Western countries. More baffling is the contrast found in a thoughtful intellectual known for penetrating literary criticism and subtle reflections on the various world religions, whose 1939-45 \\"Journal,\\" is filled with an obsessive anti-Semitism that \\"lingers like a noxious miasma in the reader's memory, like the stink of cheap brothels, the smell of sharp tobacco, dirty feet, and rue-water that cannot be washed away or masked with dousings of cologne.\\"<br />He pokes fun at those who proclaim the death of literature and the demise of culture, like the French functionaries who believe \\"that languages must be shut up in concentration camps and guarded by flics and mouchards disguised as lexicographers\\". He rails against those who would preserve their culture with hate mongering or use their religion to deny others their human rights (particularly women).<br />But the most moving and inspiring pieces are his brief portraits of the people he admires, like methodical Vermeer's passionate perfection, Monet's obsessive search at the end of his career to paint the elusive qualities of reality, Frida Kahlo's \\"Painting to Survive.\\"<br />One of the best is his evocation of Nelson Mandela from a visit to his prison at Robben Island.  Another, completely different, is his discussion of V.S. Naipaul and Paul Theroux upon the publication of Theroux's compulsively readable savaging of his former friend, \\"Sir Vidia's Shadow,\\" which Vargas Llosa concludes with a perfect personal anecdote.<br />Vargas Llosa writes about anything he pleases anywhere in the world - the Catholic Church, Islam, Palestine, Latin America, books, art, music, history. He writes about a romance writer who lived life entirely in her imagination and an Andean maiden mummy who \\"testifies - depending on how you look at it - to the ceremonial riches and the mysterious beliefs of a lost civilization, or to the infinitely cruel ways in which human stupidity once exorcised its fears, and often still does.\\"<br />Though necessarily brief, each piece is well shaped and elegantly argued. Whether celebrating or fulminating, Vargas Llosa is intellectually rigorous and passionately engaged, a man of the world in the best sense. This is a collectionthat will be of interest to anyone with reasoned opinions, whatever their political slant.n that will be of interest to anyone with reasoned opinions, whatever their political slant.	2003-08-20

Paula, age 4, and her sisters, Teresa, 6, and Penny, 3, prove too much for the old lady and enter into a long and rocky relationship with the Fresno, CA, foster care system.<br />Paula McLain's harrowing memoir of growing up among strangers who may or may not become family teems with complex, shifting emotions. Chief among them, especially in the early years, is fear, and the yearning to belong to a family, any family. But that was not to be. Not quite anyway. McLain's fluid prose captures the reader with its immediacy; its sense of urgency and its intimacy. This is a page-turner with real orphan children to root for.<br />It never seems to occur to the girls, as it does to the reader, that they could be separated. But they never are, which is the saving grace of stability that runs through their Dickensian childhood. Their first brief placement ends with a charge of thievery, but their second is a mystery. The Clapps are wealthy and their children are grown. Mrs. Clapp has no humor and no affection. Her rules and routines are rigid and she is fanatically house proud.<br />One rainy day after school, the girls slosh through puddles to the car. \\"Just as we got to the Cadillac, the sky started to drop hail like frozen BBs. Mrs. Clapp sat behind the wheel in her lavender rabbit-fur coat, her dry fingers toying with the door lock as though it were a chess piece, deciding whether she would let us into the car. We'd ruin it, we would.\\"<br />So what does she want with three little girls? This is not McLain's question; it's the reader's, and McLain never comes out with the horrifying answer, either. She simply takes you there and lets you see for yourself how things are. The third placement, also brief, is the most heartbreaking. These people want children, delight in their new girls, and yet suddenly, mysteriously, it's over and the sisters find themselves with their fourth family in three years.<br />\\"If we felt any hope that this new situation would be different, then it was the stowaway version, small and pinching as pea gravel in a shoe.\\" The Lindberghs make no secret of their reason for taking in three foster girls. Their daughter, Tina, is an only child and wants siblings. It's that simple. Bub Lindbergh is a big bear of a man, \\"easy to love,\\" who teaches the girls to ride and gets each of them a pony, while his wife, Hilde, a German immigrant, is prickly and unpredictable. She spoils her \\"real\\" daughter and delights in telling perfect strangers the sad history of her foster daughters.<br />McLain's anger comes through in shock waves of description - hilarious bizarre incidents perpetrated by blotchy, oversize, cartoon character Lindberghs. Interspersed with moments of tenderness, even joy. McLain (her first book of poems, \\"Less of Her\\" was published in 1999) is a visual, visceral writer unafraid to mix brutal honesty and laughter. She and her sisters are not easy children and never lose sight of the fact that, unlike other children, they can be cast off at any time, their worldly possessions lumped in a trash bag in the back of the social worker's car.  It's a scary way for a child to live.<br />McLain's memoir is many things: a gut-wrenching portrayal of growing up insecure and longing for love, a celebration of sibling solidarity, a catharsis and a satisfying revenge on people who once had the power, and will recognize themselves as they read.

It's a scary way for a child to live.<br />McLain's memoir is many things: a gut-wrenching portrayal of growing up insecure and longing for love, a celebration of sibling solidarity, a catharsis and a satisfying revenge on people who once had the power, and will recognize themselves as they read. Funny, bleak, angry and winsome, McLain's debut is beautifully written and compulsively readable.	2003-08-20

This is a great book to read in an airport, waiting for a delayed flight, say, with an impatient spouse. The pieces are short, clever, affectionate, and funny. From packing to coming-home fantasies, Weisman puts things in perspective. She understands her own shortcomings - and her husband's - and mines them to full effect.<br />Larry likes camping, authenticity, moving where the spirit takes him. Mary-Lou does not. \\"I travel the way I cook. I follow directions like a fascist....I don't improvise and I don't make substitutions.\\" As for authenticity, Weisman tells a funny story of Paris in their youth, a night in a cheap hotel that turned out to be a whorehouse, followed by a morning in the public baths and concludes, \\"If you're the sort of person who insists upon having a wonderful time while you're on vacation, authenticity may not be your thing.\\"<br />On packing, she's wistfully reminded of a friend who traveled to India taking only clothes she was tired of wearing and leaving an outfit behind in each place she stayed. Neither of the Weismans is so disciplined. \\"I'm always the one to give in to temptation first, a precedent established by Eve in Genesis 3....I am seized by a perverse and irresistible urge to pack more.\\"<br />Weisman, needless to say, likes her comfort. So it's a real act of love when she agrees to a white water rafting trip for Larry's 50th birthday. She already knows she's going to have a horrible time. \\"But as well as I know myself, I have failed to take into account a serious character flaw that is serving me well on this trip. I tend to behave myself when people are watching.\\"<br />The flip side is their spa trip the following year. Larry is determined to hate it. When she says that yoga will make him feel \\"stretchy and catlike,\\" he responds, \\"If I want to feel catlike, I'll get a litter box.\\" But even that one works out well - for Larry. Then there's fantasy real-estate purchases in Paris, boredom on a Caribbean beach, and a few adventures which are better in anticipation than reality, like sand-boarding in Chile, and trekking in Tibet.<br />Weisman's writing is engaging enough to take the irritation out of misplaced reservations. Every reader will find their traveling selves somewhere in these pages - and find them pretty likable too. This is a great book to take on vacation (it's small!).

I identified more with the sidebar piece by Jennifer L. Leo, describing her coma-stress response to a hearty call for Naked Basketball.<br />Other pieces focus on more mundane female conundrums like underwear with tired elastic (yikes!) menstrual surprises (even worse!), sanitary facilities, euphemisms in foreign languages, attempting to pass unnoticed in a chador in Kuwait, finding a book in a French airport with a teenager in tow, dealing with the runs, bad hair days in Hong Kong. Ellen Degeneres does a piece on fear of flying and Adair Lara packs for the fantasy person she expects to become halfway around the world. There are men, like Germaine W. Shames' eloquent Mexican lover, though not so many as you might expect in an anthology by women. There may be more pieces on squeezing excess flesh into bathing suits.<br />Mostly these are good-natured women finding the funny side of mishaps in places as far flung as the red-light district in Bangkok and the 50-pound sack race in small-town Nevada. There are plenty of laughs and - a side benefit - some handy warnings on what not to do when traveling.	2003-08-10

The horror of the woman who lost 23 years in the blink of a stroke. The woman whose consciousness sometimes vanished while her body continued to go through the motions. The man who can no longer feel emotions. The man who feels too much. The man who relives the exact same emotion with every recall, like reliving a traffic accident over and over, yet can no longer read people's expressions or hear words other than literally.<br />British neuropsychologist Broks studies what happens to people when particular parts of their brain are damaged. He understands our morbid fascination and has made it his quest: where and what is, consciousness? And what makes us who we are? \\"But when it comes to understanding the relationship between the brain and the conscious mind, my ignorance is deep and there is nowhere to turn.\\"<br />This is the theme of his first book of essays, a theme which deals with our worst fears - becoming someone else. Like the man who wearied of his boring suburban life and left his family and job to live a more bohemian existence. A few years later when his brain tumor was revealed and removed, he woke asking for his wife and kids.<br />In his pursuit of consciousness Broks also explores out-of-body experiences and dream imagery, like that which helped Robert Louis Stevenson create \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\\" He provides thought experiments and ends with a sci-fi story which aptly (and entertainingly) frames the dilemma of consciousness and body and where the \\"I\\" begins and ends.<br />Though Broks occasionally goes on at too great a length, his unanswerable question is posed from many though-provoking, and occasionally startling, directions. Those most interested in brain physiology and behavior should stick to Oliver Sacks, those with more philosophical inclinations will definitely enjoy Broks.	2003-07-31

As the season changes, he lies awake, worrying. \\"He rebuilt it in his mind in the lee of a gentle hill. But he said nothing and did nothing. Days passed and weeks and the winter came, and the Cob House remained where it was, in the pathway of the annihilating winds.<br />\\"It was their first winter. The earth under their boots was grey. The yellow tussock grass was salty with hail. In the violet clouds of afternoon lay the promise of a great winding sheet of snow.\\"<br />With Joseph is his new wife, Harriet, 34, grateful to be saved from a stultifying spinsterhood as a governess, and his widowed mother, Lilian, who spends the cold days mending china, broken on its long journey from home. Uprooted, alienated by this inhospitable place, Lilian is miserable, but Joseph and Harriet both have ardent hopes.<br />Joseph has fled England with a terrible secret to put behind him. He believes that strong, capable Harriet will renew him \\"and living sensibly with her, without loathing and without damage, then, he believed, his past would slowly vanish. He would be able to grow old without it, just as, if a man is careful, he can grow old without yearning.\\"<br />But, a product of his times as well as his nature, he begins by stifling Harriet's dreams, first refusing her desire to help in building the Cob House (a structure meant to be temporary, built of mud and grass), then denying her longing for a child. Though growing disappointed with her marriage, Harriet retains her optimism. She surveys her hard-won garden with satisfaction or looks out at the distant mountains with wonder and desire.<br />Then, during a thaw after a devastating snow storm, with Harriet gone to get help from their richer, more established neighbors, Joseph finds gold in their creek. It's not much, but it sends him into a frenzy of feverish work and secrecy. Instinctively he hides the dust he's found and takes pains to keep his work from Lilian and Harriet. Though he finds no more, his obsession builds and when gold is found on the other side of the mountains he seizes the chance to escape his failed life and eroding marriage.<br />The narrative continues to move between characters, primarily Harriet and Joseph, but also Lilian, and their neighbors, the Orchards. Tremain brings alive the privations, filth, obsession and excitement of the Gold Rush; the struggles of the two women to maintain their Cob House holding in the face of an onslaught of New Zealand elements; the even, tranquil tenor of life at the Orchards' ranch.<br />Eventually Harriet gets to fulfill her longing to go into the mountains, only to find them impassable. Joseph's failure to find gold inflames his self-absorption with hatred for the world, and young Edwin Orchard becomes afflicted with a strange, Maori-inspired illness. Harriet perseveres, obligated to meet up with Joseph one last time and the novel rises to new heights of cataclysm and a romantic obsession so intense it moves at times into the surreal.<br />With its majestic, forbidding landscapes, passionate characters and precise imagery, \\"The Colour\\" is a beautifully written novel and a riveting read. Though the setting couldn't be further from the ultra-civilized 17th century royal court of her last novel, \\"Music &amp; Silence\\" (winner of the Whitbread Award), Tremain's deft depictions of self-defeating narcissism, and (on the other hand) the human longing for experience beyond the ordinary, remain elemental themes.<br />Not that the book is without flaws. The mystical connection between Edwin Orchard and his Maori nurse is more alienating and puzzling than intriguing and Joseph seems, at times, overwrought. Quibbles aside, this is a masterful novel with a story, setting and characters that will stick with you long after the last page is turned.side, this is a masterful novel with a story, setting and characters that will stick with you long after the last page is turned.	2003-07-21

She'd already been that route - years ago - and got no thanks for it. Instead, she tells the cleaning lady he'll be back on Sunday and when he isn't, she eats the custard Marisol left him, blasting one of his favorite cds.<br />\\"It began with these small things. Monday, she left a knife with peanut butter and an empty orange juice glass by the sink. Tuesday, his unedited manuscript on the coffee table. Wednesday, a bouquet of sweet peas on the windowsill behind the baby grand, some loose change on the hall table. Thursday, a cigarette butt in a seashell from their honeymoon in Belize, his rumpled tuxedo shirt over the side of an armchair.<br />\\" `It's so nice to have him home again - the house is filled with joy,' Marisol commented, as she swept the remains of the ashes with a soft rag.\\"<br />Soon she's setting her alarm to bring coffee to the doorman as was Laz's habit. She sets out two wet umbrellas on rainy days, leaves up the toilet seat (this one's harder to remember), puts his clothes in the laundry hamper, becomes increasingly inventive with the excuses she gives her quietly zany parents at their weekly dinner and scrabble. She orders in his usual cake and champagne for his birthday and has a dozen roses sent to her at their big anniversary dinner. There are occasional blips in this routine - duplicate coffees for the doorman, a \\"guest\\" on Laz's computer, an extra dozen roses at the anniversary dinner, an unaccounted-for delivery of special light bulbs - but Grace rationalizes these with growing ease.<br />Somewhat more disturbing is the discovery of his wedding ring behind the detritus in the bathroom medicine cabinet and an unfamiliar lipstick in the pocket of his leather jacket. And, reluctantly, Grace becomes aware that Laz is caught in a controversy over his last book - his personal account of a six week pose as a mute Muslim prisoner in a Kosovo prison camp. She begins to avoid newspapers and TV. \\"Laz's troubles may now involve a national scandal, but in her home everything would be preserved, even Laz's reputation.\\"<br />Her vigilance becomes its own reward. \\"Until recently Grace had been unaware of how simple it was to deceive. Not to be deceived - she's always known that it was easy to let oneself be fooled. That was a personal choice people made. Grace was not gullible. Rather, she chose - and this was a great distinction for her - to have faith. Deception was her new hobby. What she found most disconcerting was how much she liked it.\\"<br />It seems, though, that her newfound talent has taken away her faith. Almost against her will, Grace delves into the hidden corners of Laz's life, and as his secrets emerge, her insistent focus on the status-quo relaxes. She's free to act out of character occasionally. There's to be an epiphany - we're in no doubt about that - but Solomon keeps us - and Grace - guessing until the last page.<br />There's darkness in Solomon's smart, urbane and witty first novel and this pattern of light and dark gives it an enjoyably disconcerting originality. The writing is incisive and oblique, like Grace, and the affluent Manhattan setting also seems an essential quality of her character.

In her first novel in six years, National Book Award nominee Garcia (\\"Dreaming in Cuban\\") explores the Chinese-Cuban experience across the span of four generations and more than a century. The novel opens in 1857 China. Impoverished, childless farmer Chen Pan, looking for work in the city, agrees to exchange his daily struggle for dreams of riches and adventure in exotic, tropical Cuba.<br />Crammed into the hold of a stinking boat with similarly tricked men, Chen realizes he has failed his duty to his wife and mother. Chen endures, but lack of food, water, space, and hope drive others to suicide. When a melon grower jumps overboard, \\"the furling waves received him with indifference. The melon-grower had been an orphan and a bachelor. No destiny would be altered but his.\\"<br />Chen is sold into eight years indentured servitude cutting sugar cane. He and the other Chinese men live as slaves among the African slaves, sharing in their beatings and body-breaking work. After killing a brutal overseer, falling in love with a slave who is raped and sold, and witnessing the recapture and mutilation of a group of Chinese escapees, Chen escapes and hides in the woods.<br />At this point the novel jumps to New York City in 1968 where Domingo Chen and his father are trying to survive on menial jobs after fleeing Castro's Cuba. His father mired in depression, Domingo lives day to day, chasing girls and sharpening his wardrobe.<br />Though Garcia soon returns to Chen - who establishes a successful second-hand shop in Havana, buys and frees a slave woman, Lucrecia, and her child - the riveting bond between character and reader has loosened and the novel has changed. Garcia moves between old Chen and his descendants - the granddaughter in China he never knows he has, his herbalist doctor son Lorenzo, who returns to China to study for 10 years, Lorenzo's sons, Domingo and his tour in Vietnam. The book is now more about the immigrant experience, the dreams, heartbreaks, the mingling of blood and traditions, than it is about one man or even one family.<br />Chen is a complex, deliberative character, a gentle, steely man with an edge of desperation who embraces his life with passion, all the more ardent for its depths of regret, fear, ambition and loneliness. Lucrecia, too, is fully, deftly developed and their love is memorable, almost heroic in its quiet consideration. But the other characters, despite Garcia's empathy, and the clarity of the spare, telling, vignettes, remain acquaintances. There simply isn't room enough in this 250-page novel.<br />But so beautifully does Garcia write and so dramatic are the times and crises she portrays, that this is almost a quibble.

Characterized by \\"innocent, irreproachable maliciousness,\\" the Mayborns, once a large, rapacious clan of dairy farmers who absorbed the women and land of their neighbors, have grown increasingly shiftless over the generations. Now nothing is left of their holdings but a house, yard and dog run.<br />Mayborn girls are born with black, shriveled fingernails, which the townspeople consider a mark of the rumored, unspeakable Mayborn sins, including, but not limited to, incest and infanticide. June Mayborn, 14, a pariah among her schoolmates, has fallen into an affair with Ed Cipriano, a shopkeeper whose wife is away. When the wife returns, June pays one last visit to the Cipriano bedroom where her heightened sense of smell assaults her with the stink of all three of them. To purify the air, she lights a fire, which burns the place down, incidentally killing Joseph, the terminally ill tenant in the next room.<br />Toby-Potter manages to arouse both sympathy and repugnance for June. She is too self-absorbed to be pitiable in her loneliness, too amoral and creepy to be likable in her innocence and vulnerability. June is a hard-sell as a protagonist, but the death of Joseph brings some new blood to town. Joseph was guru of a hippie cult, which disintegrated after his affair with Iris, a beauty whose own self-absorbed amorality is more than a match for the Mayborns'. Iris and Joseph's son disappeared while in the care of Iris' young daughter, Lee, and he has never been found. Lee, now June's age, is as grounded as Iris is flighty, and as serious as Iris is hedonistic.<br />When Iris lands in jail for snatching a child she thinks is her missing son, she has Lee put in the care of the Mayborns, her \\"relatives,\\" a connection Lee flatly rejects until confronted with her sister June's black, twisted fingernails, identical to her own. Now, bereft of belongings and friends, Lee, dressed in June's clothing, feels herself succumbing to the Mayborn pull.<br />Toby-Potter involves half the town in this welter of secrets, misfits and flawed heroes. She handles the large cast well, fleshing out her characters while retaining their mystery, allowing them to reveal themselves. The Mayborns are truly scary - too human to be despised, too brutish to garner sympathy. The story probes and prods and worms its way to a jolting, shocking climax and fitting, plausible resolution.

Or who she is. Time passes, her captor returns, taunting her with coming death, reveling in her helplessness. During the hours he's gone she concentrates on staying alive and tries to remember how she got there. This creepy, claustrophobic interlude of sustained terror goes on until the reader can hardly bear it, until, by a fluke of luck, Abbie gets free.<br />Traumatized, hospitalized, much of her memory returns, but the week or so before her capture remains blank. It's the police and the psychologists who discover she'd left her job and her boyfriend, that it had all been highly dramatic, that the boyfriend was abusive. With no evidence to back up her story of abduction, doubts arise and are finally resolved in a finding of delusion - case closed.<br />But Abbie knows the killer is out there and still after her. With her memory stubbornly blank, she must retrace her steps. French (\\"Killing Me Softly,\\" \\"The Red Room\\") continually surprises - Abbie as well as the reader - as she reconstructs her movements, drawing closer and closer to danger. Abbie proves herself resourceful and strong (so what was she doing with the nasty alcoholic boyfriend?) and the psychological suspense mounts with constricting tension, building to a harrowing climax. Another winner for French in the tradition of Minette Walters and Ruth Rendell.	2003-06-30

His alternate universe, complete with time travel and fictional dimensions, hangs together with mind-bending logic, and Literary Detectives SpecOps Agent Thursday Next is resourceful, quick-witted, and determined, but still has lots to learn (code for blundering, impetuous and rash).<br />As the story opens, newly married Thursday Next is enduring a round of celebrity for the exploits of her first adventure in \\"The Eyre Affair,\\" in which she restored \\"Jane Eyre,\\" with an \\"improved\\" ending, ended the Crimean War and defeated an arch villain, trapping a minor villain, a Goliath Corp. executive, in the stanzas of Poe's \\"The Raven.\\" Amid all the furor nobody much cares about the lost exec, except his half-brother, head of Goliath, a conglomerate increasingly recognizable in our own world.<br />But the Goliath boss cares enough to \\"eradicate\\" Thursday's husband in revenge, killing him off in a childhood accident. To get her husband back, Thursday must rescue the boss' brother from \\"The Raven.\\" But the pages of Poe are dangerous and her navigation skills are shaky (though she is to be tried in Kafka for her interference with the Eyre ending). So she takes on a new career in Jurisfiction, apprenticing to Miss Havisham, though keeping her husband-saving mission secret from the sports-car mad, man-hating old lady.<br />Meanwhile, she's dodging death-by-coincidence with the help of an entropy monitor - a jar of lentils and rice - given to her by her retiring genius Uncle Mycroft (who shows up mysteriously in the pages of  Sherlock Holmes) and helping her eradicated, time-flitting father save the world from ending in pink goo within days.<br />Jam packed with wit, winks, allusions and puns, fueled by a madcap plot and an ever burgeoning series of subplots and side trips, and fleshed out with the attention to detail that has earned Fforde comparison to J.

Readers of previous books (\\"The Cabinet of Curiosities,\\" \\"Reliquary\\") will know more about the enigmatic agent than the clueless folks of Medicine Creek, but he's still mostly mystery.<br />Dressed in his signature black, remote and dapper, Pendergast outrages the town and its cranky sheriff by insisting the killer - soon a serial killer - comes from among them. The town fathers are particularly eager to avoid taint as their dying town may be rescued by agribusiness research seeking a home for gene-altered experimental corn fields.<br />But Pendergast too is baffled. This killer doesn't fit any of the patterns he has constructed over the years.  Compulsive and unpredictable, yet arranging the grisly remains with care, he seems to kill whoever he happens upon, effortlessly. One survivor dies of fright while attempting to describe his attacker. And what's the connection with the Indian mounds and the ghostly Indian massacre of predatory outlaws 100 years before?<br />Pendergast acquires an assistant; a disaffected teenage girl whose outcast status can provide him with the unfiltered insider information he needs, but whose intelligence and rashness leads her into jeopardy. The plot proceeds in typical thriller fashion, with the horror overtones the authors are so chillingly good at, and a menacing backdrop of corn, corn and more corn. The climax is a sprawling, literally labyrinthine chase involving multiple victims lost in a pitch-dark maze during a mammoth storm that cuts off the town. The conclusion is a hideous shocker and a final hair-raising twist ties the ends in a grisly (if not wholly believable)knot.<br />This is fine page-turning summer fare, but it's not \\"Relic.\\"	2003-06-30

Take Peter Cashwell, for instance, an English teacher (why couldn't I have had a teacher like him?) and self-styled victim of Birding Compulsive Disorder, whose first book, a lively and very funny loose-knit collection of essays, begins a description of pelican flight:  \\"If pelicans were drivers, they'd own huge, rectangular American luxury cars with plush interiors....\\"<br />Or how about this perfect picture of  Skimmers off a damp, chilly beach: \\"thirty or forty slim, scissorlike black birds wheeling around in the deepening gray; they looked like feathered knives tossed aloft by a master juggler.\\"<br />Cashwell, who cross-references an eclectic knowledge of popular culture (particularly rock music and comic books), serious literature, and research with his birding, divides the book into three sections: Birding, Birds, Birded. The first section leans toward the evolution of a birder - boyhood experiences with birds and mosquitoes in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, his later establishment of a life list (the move from casual to avid), migration counts, haiku from the Peterson Field Guide, and the serendipitous birding experiences of daily life, like the inherently funny attempted rescue of a vulture in the front yard.<br />The second section focuses on individual birds - how the cardinal got its name, why the starling deserves our hostility, the \\"social cachet\\" of raptors, and the poignant, funny tale of the owl that saved Christmas.  And the third leans a bit more to the outings of the experienced birder, trips to add to the life list in Delaware, Iowa, even Long Island, NY. These are particularly evocative and full of the surprises that Cashwell finds especially rewarding in birding.<br />Those who pick this book up for the funny stories and incisive visuals of chilly, drizzly beautiful dawns, and then succumb to Cashwells' infectious enthusiasm will also find plenty of practical information on birding whens, wheres and hows. A word of warning though; casual backyard birders are likely to find themselves itching to get up at dawn and go tramping around bug-infested habitat with a pair of binoculars and a Peterson guide.iasm will also find plenty of practical information on birding whens, wheres and hows.

From the views of the lush and meticulous one-acre garden out the freshly painted farmhouse windows, to the seasonal food artfully arranged on the plate, the experience is a treat for the eye as well as the palate. With the garden full of flowers, herbs, vegetables and heirloom tomatoes for inspiration, the food is creative and bursting with bright and subtle flavors.<br />The owners' first book reflects this with a balanced presentation of recipes, gardening advice and personal details. Organized seasonally, the authors showcase Maine staples such as lobster, Maine shrimp and cod and halibut, fiddleheads and blueberries. But the fiddleheads come served in brown butter with Bundnerfleisch, a German cured beef (you could also substitute prosciutto or smoked salmon); the lobster comes in an Asparagus Soup with Lobster, Morels and Chervil, and the lobster salad is served, not with mayonnaise, but with Tomato-Tarragon Vinaigrette.<br />The authors cross cultures freely and do not mind a little extra effort for a spectacular result. The skewers for the Chinese-inspired Grilled Lamb Brochettes on Basil Skewers with Spicy Basil-Cilantro Marinade, for instance, are basil stems left to dry over the winter.<br />Each chapter opens with a short essay on the season and state of the garden (which provides 90 percent of the restaurant's produce) and business, then moves on to feature appetizers, main and side dishes, sauces and desserts. Recipes are prefaced with short, useful notes on growing (even in Maine, \\"tomatillos grow like weeds\\"), selecting (the best piece of bluefin tuna, for instance), variations, accompaniments, and cooking tips.<br />Interspersed with the recipes are short gardening pieces - how to grow tomatoes or peppers, growing and using herbs, watering with soaker hoses, using up zucchini, making the most of a small space, edible flowers, saving seeds and lots more.<br />But the food is what Arrows veterans are looking for here. For a tantalizing taste of summer, try a Sweet and Sour Fennel Salad or a simple plate of Marinated Tomatoes or a Sugar Snap Pea and Rock Shrimp Salad. Then maybe some Maine Sweet Clams with Risotto and Arugula, or Grilled Rib-Eye Steak with Herbs and Caramelized Onions. Accompanied perhaps by some Thai-Style Corn-on-the-Cob (soaked in coconut milk, grilled), or Yam and Leek Gratin, and your own Onion and Rosemary Focaccia. Topped off with Cinnamon Basil Shortcakes with Peaches or Blueberry Ice Cream or Steamed Raspberry Pudding.<br />This is an attractive, personable, conversational book, as much fun to cook from as to browse. The recipes are not difficult, though some are time consuming and many feature ingredients you can find, but not necessarily at the local supermarket (but isn't a new discovery half the fun?). A delightful book and a kitchen inspiration.seeds and lots more.<br />But the food is what Arrows veterans are looking for here.

No witnesses despite the crowd, and the tide has washed away any evidence, so it's days before Bognor Inspector \\"Hen\\" Mallin, a compact, cigar-smoking dynamo, identifies the woman as Emma Tysoe, a psychologist professor and serial-killer profiler. She was on leave from her college in order to help the police with something she described only as \\"Huge, if it's true.\\"<br />His curiosity whetted, Diamond teams up with Mallin and both ignore the Home Office national command to keep clear of Emma's last hush-hush case - a crossbow killer targeting a named list of celebrities and dropping clues from \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\\" Brushing up on his Coleridge, Diamond and his new pal, the unintimidated Hen, also track a rebuffed suitor and a reluctant beach witness, while delving into Emma's coded computer files and her active private life.<br />Winner of the Diamond Dagger for Lifetime Achievement, Lovesey crafts an intricate mystery with neat surprises around several unexpected twists. Hen Mallin is a fine addition to the series; gruff enough to hold her own even with Diamond, she's comfortable enough to be friendly, even vulnerable, and has a ready sense of humor. Diamond, still melancholy a year after his wife's murder, has recovered his edge although he's not nearly as insensitive as he used to be. Various points of view juggle the action and fine secondary characters give the story further depth. As well written as ever, Lovesey's latest will please old fans and new.	2003-06-02

Jack and Sarah are a rough match - both damaged by murder; she in the self-defense death of her abusive boyfriend, he in a Florida bust gone bad that killed another agent and ended his career - but it works. Their hesitations, withdrawals and unspoken longings, without being overdone, manage to give them a vulnerability to balance the requisite toughness. And it's a toughness that will be called upon more than once in the course of a story that builds into mayhem, greed and murder.<br />Living hand-to-mouth at a Charlestown dock on his 40-foot sloop \\"Lila,\\" beset by enemies, both local and Floridian (relatives of the dead DEA agent), he readily agrees to help Sarah with the boat repo, despite a twinge of fellow feeling for the deadbeats. But these are rich debtors; young, with good jobs, a fancy house and no good reason to run. But following their trail up through Portsmouth and Portland, Me., it becomes clear that running is what they're doing. Eidson succeeds in bringing the pair to life during the investigation, without switching to their point of view (except for the prologue).<br />And as the mystery of their disappearance deepens, and the repo team closes in, Eidson introduces a real bad guy, a rich, twisted techno-geek with a disgusted, but avaricious protector. Between this tycoon's sick proclivities, and the murderous intentions of Jack's Florida and Boston enemies, and a few surprises along the way, the action gets fast, furious and bloody and stays that way until the very end when Eidson neatly ties up all the loose ends and sets things up for the next book in the series.<br />Jack and Sarah - prickly, difficult and talented - make a dynamic start in a series that should win Eidson new fans.	2003-06-02

With a small prod from another former cop, this one left quadriplegic in a shoot-out, Bosch takes up a four-year-old cold case: the murder of a young movie-production assistant. The murder scene has always stuck with him, though Bosch was taken off the case a few days later when the murder was upstaged by a two million dollar heist and shoot-out on the movie set itself. Though it might seem a tad suspicious when a movie producer insists on the use of two million real, which is promptly stolen, no connection was made and no trace of the money was found. Except for a bill which turned up on a list it shouldn't have been on. A list drawn up by an FBI agent, gone missing.<br />The case is complex enough to make your head spin, but Bosch always knows just what he's doing, which makes it easier for the rest of us. Tightly plotted and so beautifully written you're drawn deep into Bosch's life almost without noticing, the novel explores the ambivalence of loneliness and the need for a sense of purpose, while delivering a real page-turner. There's also a visceral view into the days and despair of a helpless quadriplegic and the caregiver spouse. And Connelly (\\"Blood Work,\\" \\"City of Bones,\\") provides in-your-face L.A. atmosphere, from the trendy clubs and movie mansions to the crowded freeways and the streets of Hollywood. This is Connelly at his best and you don't get much better than that.	2003-06-02

From the pages of an small English food journal, \\"Petits Propos Culinaires,\\" available only by subscription, comes a remarkable anthology, a veritable page turner. Started in 1979, by Sara and Alan Davidson and shaped by the views of Elizabeth Davidson and the immediate requirements of Richard Olney (you'll just have to read the intro), PPC set out to explore the less trammeled areas of food study.<br />The results - a distillation of 20 years - range from the hilarious (an experiment in cooking while driving, \\"Manifold Absurdity\\") to the erudite (restoration of a 1670s manor kitchen, \\"Ham House\\"). Most essays contain elements of both. The book is divided into seven sections, the articles briefly described in a succinct chapter introduction and each article headed with a background note.<br />The book begins with \\"Scoops,\\" and includes an expos&eacute; on the identity of the trendy red peppercorn, the origin of Summer Pudding and the ongoing labors of INTERSPI, the intercontinental spicy mystery detectives, in sniffing out the humble origins of a spice with a fancy name. \\"Culinary History\\" explores the Japanese evolution of British curry rice, \\"An Experiment in Bronze Age Cooking,\\" and the history of hunting and eating herons, while \\"On Your Plate\\" focuses on particular dishes, such as the ins and outs of snails, the real deal on olive oil and the infamy of eggplant.<br />\\"Books and Cooks\\" includes \\"Breakfast with Jane Austen\\" (delightful!), food with Chekhov and Rossini and a Thai funeral cookbook. \\"Exotica\\" has several related pieces on the culinary charms of worms and snakes as well as an American mountain boy's 19th century observations of trail food. While many of the essays feature recipes, the \\"Recipes\\" section homes in, including a must-try strawberry jam, a Russian Easter Kulich and a pine-scented mussel feast. \\"Notes and Queries\\" is the journal department for odds and ends, letters from and to the editors on any number of obscure subjects, from politically correct food terminology to French kitchen fads.<br />Not all of the writers are professional food writers (though many of the best are present) but the writing is, without exception, lively and personable, even though most of the essays come with source notes. There are lots of inside jokes, but the reader never feels left out, and the essays are fascinating, informative and witty. This should be a hit with anyone interested in food (who isn't?) and should win PPC armies of new subscribers (contact info provided on the last page).ect food terminology to French kitchen fads.<br />Not all of the writers are professional food writers (though many of the best are present) but the writing is, without exception, lively and personable, even though most of the essays come with source notes.

His benevolent, patriarchal father ate raw garlic with his meat at dinner, while beaming over his wife's cooking, his great aunt began her descent into dementia by throwing a pot of Romanian cornmeal mush against the wall. Young Abe engaged in self-conscious sex in Japan while studying sushi and reached the height of embarrassment at a stringent French table peeling a peach.<br />There's a poignant, almost plaintive air to these pieces - a divorced, melancholy man recalling emotionally vivid, mixed moments throughout his life. In one he's quietly, musingly cooking with turmeric when a \\"friend\\" calls to tell him he's never really been in love. In Paris an acquaintance feeds him black radishes in sour cream while awaiting her drunken husband. He recalls eating ashes in Jerusalem, and picking through lentils one by one to avoid eating insects.<br />Touching and vivid, with bright bursts of humor and food lore, Opincar's memories weave food and life in a wholly absorbing and evocative manner.	2003-05-23

He also spends some time rummaging around in New York, looking for finds worthy of chowhound.com and revisiting old haunts in Chinatown and new ones in the boroughs. Despite the loss of his wife and traveling companion, Alice, in 2001 (she is present through much of the book), Trillin maintains his high standards in humor, from dry and wry to laugh-out-loud, and his gratitude for real food, wherever it's found.	2003-05-23

The 30-year-old narrator, Sam Browne, spent a year in Australia as a boy, living with his mother who had left his American father to return to her native land. Here he fell in love for the first time, an experience he deftly describes, remembering how, \\"I felt older, as though my presence filled more of the world than it had just that morning.\\" From his adult perspective he recalls how it distanced him from his mother, \\"neither of us understanding  we had arrived at a crossroads, a place where our paths would slowly move apart, mine leading more toward school and women, hers  bringing her more deeply into the country she again called home.\\"<br />As Sam enjoys the first pangs of love, his mother turns to the past, attempting to understand her own mother through her unpublished writings, essays on life and nature she wrote in the years she lived alone in Australia's Blue Mountains after leaving her husband, a man who had always yearned for England. It was only after his grandmother's death - a \\"walkabout\\" into the mountains from which she never returned - that Sam's mother returns to Australia and assembles her mother's papers for publication, becoming so absorbed and intrigued that she follows - too literally - in her mother's footsteps.<br />Sam's short marriage disintegrates painfully and inevitably. He too, immerses himself in his grandmother's writings, plumbing his own Australian roots as, more vulnerable, but wiser, he grows into a new love, finds new hope.<br />Pierce has a lot going on - first love, mature love, the emotional resonance of place in self-identity, the difficulty of knowing those closest to us, particularly family.

What speculation there is revolves around the role of fate in our lives and how small actions can have unforeseen consequences. But mostly this is the story of a man's mid-life self-assessment, the role grief and guilt have played in his life, and the man he might have been.<br />Shakily married to Flo, his childhood sweetheart and now a hard-working pediatrician, Josh Winkler is an unsuccessful artist beginning to face up to his mediocrity - by avoiding work as much as possible. It's a summer of storms in Euclid, Illinois, the only place either has ever lived, and their teenage daughter is making her first real break for independence. The marital tension, fueled by Josh's growing unreliability, goes back to the roots of their relationship - an \\"accident\\" that left Flo's brother dead and Josh's permanently brain damaged.<br />Then one day, running the path behind his house in a storm, Josh slips 15 minutes into the past. Which prepares him to believe and help the desperate young girl who claims to be from 1908 and whose plight becomes more desperate with every moment she's gone. As the town - and Josh's marriage - roils with believers and non-believers, Dickinson explores how a jolt out of the accustomed tracks of life can change a person in unanticipated ways.<br />Dickinson's complex characters reveal themselves in sometimes surprising, but reasonable ways. Examining the paradoxes of time travel and the inevitable consequent ripples, Dickinson also speculates on how  circumstances may be shaped by chance, but the essential tenor of a life depends more on the nature of the person. A well-written, thoughtful, understated novel which should add to Dickinson's readership.	2003-05-06

Which doesn't make it any less futuristic. Set among the lean and hungry of the ad world and the hip outsiders of cyberspace, the story roams the globe from London to Tokyo to Moscow as protagonist Cayce Pollard tracks the origin of mysterious video footage, rubbing elbows with obsessive of every stripe from wealthy tycoons to criminals to techno-nerds.<br />Cayce is a \\"cool hunter,\\" a \\"sensitive\\" to market trends, \\"a very specialized piece of human litmus paper.\\" Her instinct comes at a price, however. She is \\"allergic\\" to fashion, and certain brand logos can bring on panic attacks - Tommy Hilfiger and the Michelin Man in particular. Cayce herself wears stripped-down black, all logos and labels obsessively removed. She has been brought from post 9/11 New York (still grieving for the father who mysteriously disappeared that morning) to the \\"mirror world\\" (her term) of London to evaluate a logo for a cutting edge ad agency, \\"more post-geographic than multinational.\\"<br />The self-obsessed owner of the agency, Hubertus Bigend (\\"who looks like Tom Cruise on a diet of virgins' blood and truffled chocolates\\"), has become intrigued by \\"the footage,\\" anonymous video clips that make unpredictable internet appearances, attracting a cultish following of \\"footage heads,\\" who pour over each clip, seeking coherence, a storyline, characters and meaning.<br />Bigend (\\"The only thing Cayce enjoys about Bigend is that he seems to have no sense at all that his name might seem ridiculous to anyone, ever.\\") hires Cayce to find the footage maker and despite her misgivings - Bigend can't or won't say what he intends to with this knowledge - Cayce plunges into the chase, using Bigend's money and technology to further her own dubious quest, which oddly dovetails with her search for her presumed-dead father. Cayce lies with the best of them and is lied to in turn - as well as spied on, followed and even attacked. She finds allies and enemies in unlikely places and everyone seems to have their own secret, multi-layered agenda.<br />There's suspense and high-tech fancy-footwork aplenty, but it's Gibson's portrait of our familiar yet alien world that drives the narrative. His hard-edged portrayals of logo-bedecked cities and posing, ambitious people contrast sharply with Cayce's grieving memories of 9/11 and New York in its aftermath.

Robert Mallon, a successful builder who struck it very rich in a development deal and then retired after his divorce, has been in a stall for ten years. The girl, who won't even tell him her name, awakens something more than his Samaritan instincts and when she succeeds in killing herself two days later, Mallon determines to find out why.<br />What's begun on a whim turns deadly as Mallon and his private-eye friend, Lydia, probe, uncovering different, contrasting sides of Catherine Broward, unearthing uglier, sadder secrets as they go. The reader will be well ahead of Mallon in figuring out why Catherine killed herself, but the reader has a fair amount of help, as Perry keeps pace with Mallon from the viewpoint of Parish, a rather stereotypical (but no less scary for that) mercenary hunter.<br />As always Perry's writing is a pleasure and from Mallon's quiet, dogged awakening emerges a man of determination and thoughtful sympathies with a growing understanding of how little we can know anyone and how easily people dupe themselves. There are, however, some unbelievable plot elements. Take, for instance, the idea that affluent white people - and all witnesses - could be efficiently dispatched without anyone making a fuss.

Ronnie Raw Deal, a drop-dead gorgeous up-and-coming hot-shot movie producer, finds herself in a seedy bar after a really bad day at the office, nursing her fury at a sabotaging co-worker, when a huge black man walks in and starts whaling on a waifish slip of a girl at the bar. The reader already knows the back story on these two: Neon Polk is a sadistic, single-minded, psychopathic enforcer and Antsy Carruthers is the prostitute hes been hired to kill. Ronnie, seeing in this tableau the story of her life, loses it, and minutes later the big guy is stretched out on the floor, bloody and barely conscious.<br />Ronnie now has bigger troubles than the conniving, knife-in-the-back producer at work. Neon has reduced himself to a single goal  revenge. He makes this known in graphic Neon style and Ronnie quickly determines she has only one way out: kill Polk before he kills her. But how? She needs an assist from someone who knows about such things. Like Ellis Langford, a hungry ex-con with a screenplay  a good one, with all the elements she needs.<br />The reader has also met Ellis previously, a fundamentally decent man who, like Ronnie, is a product of his mistakes, particularly one big mistake  manslaughter. Hes trying to make it in pizza delivery when a couple of punks rip him off for fun and Ellis is virtually compelled into the inevitable escalation of events. He turns down Ronnie, of course, sniffing something rotten in the huge money she wants to pay his unknown self for his unknown screenplay and shes forced to enlist his aid through honesty instead.<br />Sounds outlandish? Absolutely. Cartoonishly, rivettingly, raucously, hilariously outlandish. The breakneck pace, punctuated generously with bloody mayhem, accelerates as the twisting, cinematic plot races to a satisfying finish. The Tinseltown setting is wickedly devised, the humor is sardonically witty, and the writing is slick and clever.

When 84-year-old Portuguese tuna-boat captain turned Ford dealership tycoon, Pete Braga, is bludgeoned to death in his San Diego bayfront home, homicide cop Tom McMichael catches the case. Braga had killed McMichael's grandfather 50 years earlier and gotten off with self-defense. Braga's son was later brain damaged in a beating long ascribed to McMichael's father, but never proven. Then, years later, the feud derailed the first-love passion between McMichael and Braga's headstrong granddaughter.<br />The initial suspect is the beautiful young nurse whose home is full of items from Braga's various collections, but her alibi pans out and a romance with McMichael heats up. The investigation branches out to include political wrangling and underhanded business-as-usual money deals in a proposed new airport, a Mexican smuggling operation using Braga's new Fords, and, of course, the heirs. The plot is complex (sometimes confusingly so) and McMichael's inappropriate love life comes to the attention of police department politicos, further muddying the waters. While the story is not particularly compelling or suspenseful, Parker's characters are well-fleshed, preserving a touch of human mystery and murk, and the blustery San Diego winter provides a moody backdrop.	2003-04-29

At the ripe old age of 27, Ginger Lee is beginning to feel the panicky stirrings of failure. After wasting precious years on an uncompleted PhD, she has come to New York to be the oldest fashion assistant at the trendy magazine \\"A La Mode\\". \\"A better name for the magazine would have been 'Waste,' as in the brainpower, time and trees that were squandered within its office walls.\\"<br />Her do-nothing job is a favor from her college friend (and now boss) Sam, who, as the book opens on a busy day in Ginger's life, begins a cut-throat competition with a colleague for a big promotion. Ginger becomes a pawn in the cut-throat duel between Sam and her rival, but there's actually something much bigger happening in Ginger's life. Her mother has arrived, barely giving Ginger time to toss the previous night's beer bottles and cigarette butts. \\" `Your bloom is almost over,' \\" she tells Ginger. \\" `I come to fix your life.' \\"<br />Between humoring her mother and fending off her efforts to fix her up with a doctor, the son of an old family friend, who happens to be already engaged, to - horrors - a white woman, Ginger finds herself taking more interest in her job. As the two editors slug it out - often using her as their [controversy] of choice - Ginger has more to do, from setting up a charity designer-clothing sale to organizing a fashion shoot. In her off hours she accompanies her mother to Korean events, from restaurant meals and birthday bashes, to a storefront church service (hurriedly fled, when her mother finds the service full of new immigrants with no English and no money). Though Ginger resists, she also agonizes.<br />Ginger's problems stem from her beloved brother's defection - he went off to Harvard and returned to marry a white girl, a betrayal which estranged him from his devastated mother. Mrs. Lee, abandoned by her husband to raise the children alone in a strange country, had counted on her son to do her proud. Though she has, against all odds, become a successful real estate agent, she will never recover the loss of face the divorce cost her. Ginger, determined not to hurt her mother further, is too American for the Korean men her mother pushes at her. She is attracted only to white men, so is resolved not to marry at all.<br />There's lots of Korean flavor juxtaposed with fashion glitz, underlining the [gap] between Ginger's roots and her Americanization. Hwang thoughtfully examines the cultural dilemmas and compromises Ginger negotiates without dragging down her funny, often farcical, but also poignant, story.  Her writing is wry and deft, her scenes vivid and hilarious, especially the Korean ones, and Ginger is a sympathetic, realistic voice. There are some thematic loose ends - her friendship with Sam is partially examined, then dropped; her feelings about work don't jibe with the less-than-expected resolution, some big family issues are resolved in a rush or not at all - but the novel succeeds on many levels and Hwang shows herself a writer to watch.ndoned by her husband to raise the children alone in a strange country, had counted on her son to do her proud.

As has she.<br />Holden's heroines generally have unfortunate taste in men and are prone to nervous misunderstandings and Grace is no exception.<br />The book opens at a literary festival famous for its celebrities and Holden has great fun with the barbed, glittering one-ups of envy and ambition. Grace is there to support Henry Moon (\\"an author his own mother would describe as obscure\\"), who's written an adventure-travel book called \\"Sucking Stones.\\" But Henry, it turns out, was mistaken for a woman writing a tell-all about Rolling Stones groupies, and, once the organizers realize their error, his spot is canceled. Grace is mortified, particularly as the previous night's wine-fueled evening ended in a thoroughly enjoyable spot of unfaithfulness to her thoroughly odious boyfriend.<br />Sion (born Simon), a sneering left-wing activist and as dislikable a creature as a man can be - slovenly, self-absorbed, humorless, bossy, patronizing and jobless - is hilariously awful. But handsome, very handsome. Not until she catches him -thanks to Henry - with a rapacious, amoral, scandal-mongering journalist, does she ditch him. This does Henry no good, however, leading only to another set of misunderstandings designed to keep them apart, as Grace's efforts on his behalf (TV interviews, book signings) continue to backfire and Grace's matchmaking mother inadvertently boosts Grace's career into celebrity orbit.<br />The neat and clever plot is as predictable as it should be, right down to the quirks of a mysterious cleaning woman. The characters, except for the hapless protagonists, are so savagely dilineated as to border on the cartoonish. In the hands of a lesser writer, this could grow tiresome, but Holden wields her pen with rapier skill. From tabloid journalists to literary divas, Holden skewers the fashionable, the fake and the fusty and leaves the reader laughing.writer, this could grow tiresome, but Holden wields her pen with rapier skill.

It's a dangerous empathy though. She so closely sympathizes with people - and their deaths - that she can take on their characteristics.<br />This series opener takes Cree to New Orleans and the 150-year-old Beauforte House. Lila Beauforte's attempt to live in her ancestral home ended so badly that her family fears for her sanity. They - a venerable old family gone to seed - humor her terrors to the extent of hiring Cree to exorcise the ghost they don't believe in.<br />But all too soon Cree begins unearthing violent secrets (through a combination of ghost work and detecting) and real ghosts and the family circles its wagons against her. All but Lila, who has kept the true horror of the house to herself. Hecht keeps the pace brisk, juxtaposing suspense with investigatory digging and parapsychology, which culminates in a violent climax and cathartic resolution.<br />The series set-up is intriguing  - a balance between the scientific (Cree's technological partner is on another case in this book) and the supernatural - and Cree is likeable despite an irritating tendency to angst and depression due to her husband's death nine years before. This pall becomes wearing and unfortunately pads a story which doesn't need padding. With romance, detective work, ghosts, murder, mayhem, sordid secrets and history to juggle, Hecht has more than enough substance. Good ghost detectives are hard to come by so let's hope Cree gets over it in her next adventure.	2003-04-14

And it's what led her to leave her husband and \\"everything familiar\\" to make an urban life at age 56.<br />Born in a small town in 1914, Polly Spence grew up among fine people with conservative, narrow-minded values. She tells of the coming of the Ku Klux Klan and her newspaperman father's public outrage, she tells of her mother's complacency when the ladies' club blackballed a less conventional woman. In 1927 her family moved further west to cow country where ranchers were affronted by a locked door, and your private life was your own affair. \\"Political attitudes are conservative, personal attitudes are loose and relaxed.\\" She describes hard times and storms, pigheadedness and kindness, friends and work and parties and the stories of old relatives. She gives one woman's perspective on the Great Depression, the aftermath of one war and the coming of another, and the changing face of a rural land.<br />All this and more is the backdrop and fabric of a life. In lively, reflective, anecdotal prose, Spence fleshes out her family, from her beloved father and older brother to her tempestuous relationship with her mother, her early joyous years as a rancher's wife, the coming of babies and the long, slow decline of her marriage. Spence packs a lot of life into this slim, captivating volume.	2003-04-07

Paraplegic police consultant Lincoln Rhyme is at his curmudgeonly Holmesian best in this over-the-top pyrotechnic psychological thriller of murder and magic. The plot twists and turns from page to page as a mad conjurer embarks on a killing spree (seen from his POV) using classic magic tricks as his template. Sleight-of-hand, quick-change disguise, Houdini-like escapes, smoke-and-mirror illusions: this world-class magician soon has the police spinning in place.<br />Rhyme and his prot&eacute;g&eacute; (and lover) police detective Amelia Sachs require a little help on this one - an enthusiastic young apprentice magician, Kara, who explains the tricks and delivers some of her own. The plot takes center stage with its split-second timing and double-triple-quadruple twists, buttressed by Kara's dissection of the tricks, particularly the psychology behind audience deception. And sure enough, more than once, Rhyme outsmarts himself.<br />A white-supremacist sub-plot folds cleverly into the mix and the story is fleshed out with Rhyme's physical challenges, Sachs' ambitions and Kara's relationship with her sick mother. A dazzling show, this one will fool you to the last page.	2003-04-07

Though he ascended headily from penniless refugee to cocky and successful broker in the world's first commodities exchange, a dip in the market and a few mistakes have brought him just as quickly to the edge of ruin.<br />\\"How long, he wondered, until his wide and boyish face turned pinched? How long until his eyes lost the eager sparkle of a merchant and took on the desperate, hollow gaze of a gambler?\\"<br />Liss' adroit and energetic second novel, more intricate and less swashbuckling than his acclaimed (and Edgar-winning) first, \\"A Conspiracy of Paper,\\" again finds excitement, suspense, duplicity and romance in the arcane world of finance and the precarious community of Jews among Gentiles.<br />Where the protagonist of \\"Conspiracy\\" was a 17th century London thief-taker and brawler, purposely estranged from his family and heritage, Lienzo is devout and ambitious to secure himself a prominent position in Amsterdam's strict Jewish community. He wants nothing more than to prosper, read Torah, and establish a family. As the novel opens, however, over a bowl of dark, murky, uninviting liquid, foisted on him by a wily Dutch widow, Lienzo's goals are receding.<br />Reduced by debt to a room in the basement of his dour brother's house, he has also made himself a powerful enemy, a trader with a disappointed daughter and an influential position on the Ma'amad, the rule-making body of Amsterdam's Jews.  The Jews may be free in Amsterdam - but not if they want to remain Jews. The Ma'amud imposes strict rules of conduct, including many restrictions on fraternizing with Gentiles in personal and business life. Offenders risk ex-communication. And there's another enemy, less powerful, but less predictable too - a Gentile whose money Lienzo lost along with his own - a man who seems to be losing his mind along with his respectability and who dogs the trader in the streets and sends him threatening letters demanding his money back.<br />But as the sexy widow urges Lienzo to sample the repellant brew and join her in a partnership to promote it, she describes its enticements. \\" `You take it not to delight the senses, but to awaken the intellect,' \\" she tells him. \\" `Beer and wine may make a man amorous, but coffee will make him lose interest in the flesh. The man who drinks coffee fruit cares only for his business.' She paused for another sip. `Coffee is the drink of commerce.' \\"<br />As the coffee inflames his blood, it fires his imagination. Lienzo pictures himself rich beyond his dreams. He devises a scheme which dazzles him with its brilliance and beautiful intricacy. All it requires is secrecy and money. Money he can get from the widow, though she's reluctant to say where it comes from and cannot be believed when she does. And secrecy - it's the lifeblood of the exchange, and traded about as freely as everything else. But Lienzo has faith in his ability to hoard his own secrets while sniffing out others'.<br />Meanwhile, his brother's unhappy wife has discovered Lienzo's stash of coffee and become a fiend for the berries, which she crunches throughout the day until, almost on a whim, Lienzo introduces her to the brewed version. The attraction between them, long smothered, smolders ever hotter over copious bowls of coffee.<br />Plots and counterplots, intrigues, lies and disbelieved truths tangle with unforseen events. Guessing, scheming, second guessing, Lienzo nimbly remains a step ahead of his enemies. But who, exactly, are his enemies? What is the mysterious widow  up to? And what about the money lender, whose own first-person narration interjects the advantage of hindsight - as well as another plotter's point of view. There's none so easy to deceive as a deceiver and no easier form of deception than self deception.<br />Liss brings his plot to a rousing, suspense-filled climax, but saves his best twists and secrets for the denouement. In a beautifully written, intricately constructed story, Liss transports the reader into a little known period and community. His psychological insights ring delightfully true and Lienzo, with all his faults and hubris, is engagingly sympathetic.

Written after the success of AYS and her first novel, \\"My Dream of You,\\" \\"Almost There\\" muses on the changes acclaim has brought - financial security, prestige, Italian holidays and writing sojourns in Manhattan. She describes the writing of the novel and the lover she had at the time - nearly illiterate, married, elderly and secretive - with a clear-eyed distance that combines rueful, wry self-knowledge with raw passion. She shows where she borrowed from real life for her fiction, she tells how AYS affected relationships with friends and old lovers, whose versions differed, sometimes, sharply, with her own. \\"I hadn't realized before I wrote AYS that I for one need constantly to relearn a simple thing - that I do not understand other people as they understand themselves.\\"<br />There's a great deal in this vein, how \\"the memoir changes its own conclusion by virtue of being written.\\" And there are the things that haven't changed - a deep vein of self-perpetuating loneliness, and, in contrast, an optimistic certainty of her capacity to change. And in the end, she leaves us curious, as she did at the end of AYS - does she work things out with her lover's child? Does she persevere this time?<br />And there's much reflection on age, on how the shortness of time reduces options.

Set in a laid-back California hippie commune and a rural corner of Alaska, the novel is populated with misfits, layabouts, villains and sweet young things yearning for enlightenment. At the heart of the story is Star (formerly Paulette), who dropped out from teaching elementary school to go West with her high school friend and new lover, Pan (formerly Ronnie). Looking for Utopia, Star wants to believe she's found it in Drop City.<br />And, milking goats one fine morning, after ditching the sexually opportunistic and coercive Pan and not getting high for three days, she feels maybe she has. \\"The moment was electric, and she could feel it through the soles of her bare feet, through her every pore; this was the life she'd envisioned when she left home, a life of peace and tranquility, of love and meditation and faith in the ordinary, no pretense, no games, no plastic yearning after the almighty dollar.\\"<br />At that moment she meets Marco, who's been \\"living simple\\" after running out on a possession charge and a draft notice. But that was two years ago and he's tired of drifting, though not free to rejoin society, even if he wanted. Neither of them really knows what they want, only what they don't want, like most everyone else in Drop City. But Marco begins to make a life there with Star, building things, getting to work on real latrines, finding himself some purpose.<br />Boyle's depiction of the overcrowded ranch with its disgraceful sanitation, mushy food, and druggy rituals is tactile and vivid, full of chaos, noise and stink and occasional real horror, like a mother calming her two grubby children with tokes of marijuana or letting them drink LSD-laced juice. The people are real too, hiding their insecurities and venalities behind a curtain of righteous talk and incessant highs. Norm, 37, owns the ranch and refuses to set rules or deny welcome to anyone, even when charges of rape and racism polarize the place. And the county is coming, shutting them down.<br />Meanwhile, Sess Harder, an Alaska loner hunkered down in a tight cabin on the Thirtymile, courts Pamela, an Anchorage girl who's had enough of city life. Theirs is a different kind of dropping out - no welfare and food stamps and brown rice and free love. Theirs is a calculated choice, honed with hard work and determination. Not that everything is hunky dory in the land of the midnight sun (and the most hellacious mosquitoes). There's Joe Bosky, for one, a mean, crazed bush pilot out for blood in his ongoing feud with Sess.<br />Down the river from Sess is the neatly abandoned cabin of his mentor - Norm's uncle. And Norm's Drop City is on its way. Much of what happens next is predictable - the culture clash of hippies and frontiersmen and the human shake-out as the bliss of communal highs gives way to shorter days and frozen isolation. But nothing about this novel is ordinary. The characters grow and change and not always in the ways we want them to. Boyle's people are flawed and passionate and crafty. Their youth is buoyant and full of possibility, their naivety is sweet and pathetic, the opportunists among them are as mean (or selfish) as they come. The \\"catastrophe of the hour\\" is usually just that and no more, but not always.<br />Boyle's prose is rich and pitch perfect, and the story  - full of ideas, humor and suspense - grabs you from the start. This is one of those books you want more of; more of the brief, glorious Alaska summer and the winter-long Alaska night, more of the people determined to succeed there, more of their young lives and their good - or bad - or disastrous - choices.

Theirs is a different kind of dropping out - no welfare and food stamps and brown rice and free love. Theirs is a calculated choice, honed with hard work and determination. Not that everything is hunky dory in the land of the midnight sun (and the most hellacious mosquitoes). There's Joe Bosky, for one, a mean, crazed bush pilot out for blood in his ongoing feud with Sess.<br />Down the river from Sess is the neatly abandoned cabin of his mentor - Norm's uncle. And Norm's Drop City is on its way. Much of what happens next is predictable - the culture clash of hippies and frontiersmen and the human shake-out as the bliss of communal highs gives way to shorter days and frozen isolation. But nothing about this novel is ordinary. The characters grow and change and not always in the ways we want them to. Boyle's people are flawed and passionate and crafty. Their youth is buoyant and full of possibility, their naivety is sweet and pathetic, the opportunists among them are as mean (or selfish) as they come. The \\"catastrophe of the hour\\" is usually just that and no more, but not always.<br />Boyle's prose is rich and pitch perfect, and the story  - full of ideas, humor and suspense - grabs you from the start. This is one of those books you want more of; more of the brief, glorious Alaska summer and the winter-long Alaska night, more of the people determined to succeed there, more of their young lives and their good - or bad - or disastrous - choices. This is Boyle's best novel in years.	2003-04-07

Narrator Eve Diamond, a young reporter for the LA Times, ranges from the squats of homeless kids to the trophy mansions of the powerful and the solid, working-class neighborhoods of the settled Mexican community in her pursuit of converging stories on the mayoral race, slumming suburban teens, and the thriving Mexican-American music industry. The kick start for each story is a murder, but that seems all that connects them, disparate aspects of a city with numerous, often hidden, faces.<br />Juggling her stories, her increasingly personal interest in the murders and a burgeoning romance with a suave suspect, Eve takes the reader across town and into the eclectic, eccentric hills and the affordable suburban valleys. Eating her way from glitzy west to gritty east, she reveals two cities with nothing in common but proximity and dependence. Economic and ethnic divergence compartmentalize the sprawling space between ocean and desert. Eve's sharp instincts take her to an encampment of homeless transvestite prostitutes, a somber Mexican funeral, various (less interesting) political functions and several (more interesting) Mexican music venues. Along the way she catches body lice from a homeless waif, stumbles over her straight-laced boss' sordid secret, and nearly gets herself fired for good cause. In the end she discovers that all communities hide low secrets and greed and hypocrisy are universal vices. She also catches a murderer in a slam-bang ending that stretches credulity a bit, but succeeds in spiking the suspense.<br />Eve is an energetic, likeable and irreverent character and Hamilton moves adroitly in a newsroom. A well-paced mystery with a stylish and serious urban atmosphere.	2003-03-16

The plot twists and turns from page to page as a mad conjurer embarks on a killing spree (seen from his POV) using classic magic tricks as his template. Sleight-of-hand, quick-change disguise, Houdini-like escapes, smoke-and-mirror illusions: this world-class magician soon has the police spinning in place.<br />Rhyme and his protégé (and lover) police detective Amelia Sachs require a little help on this one - an enthusiastic young apprentice magician, Kara, who explains the tricks and delivers some of her own. The plot takes center stage with its split-second timing and double-triple-quadruple twists, buttressed by Kara's dissection of the tricks, particularly the psychology behind audience deception. And sure enough, more than once, Rhyme outsmarts himself.<br />A white-supremacist sub-plot folds cleverly into the mix and the story is fleshed out with Rhyme's physical challenges, Sachs' ambitions and Kara's relationship with her sick mother. A dazzling show, this one will fool you to the last page.	2003-03-16

Narrator Jack Taylor has been fired from the Irish police, which is almost impossible. \\"You have to really put your mind to it. Unless you become a public disgrace, they'll tolerate almost anything.\\" Drink was, and is, his downfall. He's trying to be a private eye, a non-existent profession in a land that distrusts \\"informers\\" of any stripe. One day, in his local, an attractive woman approaches, asking him to investigate the supposed suicide of her teenage daughter.<br />The case proceeds in classic, character-driven PI fashion, only drunker, as Taylor begins to uncover a mess of corruption, blackmail, underage sex, revenge and callous cold-bloodedness. His investigatory style is desultory at best; addled from drink, with days lost to blackouts, he's not always sure what's real and who's who. He does dry out, which is a relief to almost all, including the reader, and he even gets a romance going with the mother, but it's all too precarious to last. The one solid presence in his life is books and the narrative is punctuated with quotes, from Francis Bacon to Walter Mosely to Elvis Costello to W.H. Auden; quotations for every mood, the more sardonic the better.<br />The story is gritty and brutal and the telling is sharp, swift and blackly comic. Bruen (\\"The White Trilogy,\\" \\"London Boulevard\\") is a must for all fans of Celtic noir.	2003-03-16

Rescuing the girl (her father wants to trade her for two 16-year-olds), Lena all but stumbles over the body of the Prophet. Inevitably, Rebecca's mother is arrested for the murder.<br />All pretty straightforward so far, but Webb (\\"Desert Noir\\") takes a turn into the all-too-real surreal as Lena, determined to find the murderer, infiltrates the community by posing as a polygamist wife. In absorbing detail, Webb sets out the daily minutiae, the religious tenets (the more children, the better heaven), domestic routines, casual brutality, and the abject position of women, whose daily humiliation and powerlessness (including the offloading of widows onto other husbands) stacks up as nothing against the monstrous secret Lena finally uncovers.<br />Webb's writing is lively, well-paced and suspenseful. Dark humor accentuates the bleak setting. An afterward gives the background on Mormon polygamy and the state of law-enforcement disinterest. Powerful stuff.	2003-03-16

From George Washington's preoccupation with mules to George W's fitness regime, she pokes fun at personal quirks while touching on the major historical moments in each administration and showing that however bad we think things are now, they've been worse. Campaigns, for instance, are models of honesty and restraint in comparison to the days when Adams was not only accused of listening to his wife but described in the newspapers as \\"old, querulous, blind, crippled, toothless.\\"<br />These thumbnail sketches remind us not only of who all those middle-19th century one-term presidents were and when, but give us the firsts. New Hampshire's Franklin Pierce, for instance, was the first to have a Christmas tree in the White house and installed central heating too.  Benjamin Harrison was the first to watch a professional baseball game And Andrew Jackson was the first \\"to decide that a President can veto a perfectly constitutional bill just because he doesn't like it, and he was like a kid with a new toy.\\"<br />Most of the presidents known for freeing their slaves never did, but Robert E. Lee did and \\"he didn't wait till he was dead to do it, either.\\" Some presidents were more interesting for their wives - Holland gives most of Madison's space to Dolley and not just his space either. Taft's wife wanted the presidency more than he did and nudged him at conferences to stay awake while Pierce's wife was so unhappy at his election, she refused to attend the inauguration.<br />There are scandals and wars and statesmanlike deeds, sure, but there are also pets and bratty children and fashion statements and swelled heads. A useful, funny and caustic book.	2003-02-23

Dallas, who casually drops designer names too haute to otherwise cross my radar, accepts a gig to create the look for a new all-girl band, put together by a record company contest. Dallas' first chore is an unlimited clothes-shopping spree in Paris before meeting the girls on the private Caribbean island where they are shooting their first music video. Green pulls out all the stops in describing this place, every room a palace of indulgence, a chef as handsome as he is talented, even \\"a stylist's fantasy\\" workshop. Except for its hidden door and a Mafia boss's trademark button.<br />It should all be too much, but somehow it works in a froth of fascinating glamour. Dallas is a dab hand with cutting-edge clothes (even if one of the girls has ballooned to a shocking size 8, maybe even 10!), the characters posture and pose delightfully, the island food and drink will make your mouth water, to say nothing of the temperamental chef, and, oh, yes, there are mysterious anomalies, nagging questions, even secret passageways and sinister secrets. We know there's a murder because the body appears on page one, before the story backtracks to its Paris beginning, and that's enough to know. High style fun.	2003-02-21

Though most of the park is under water, the above-ground part is covered by Fort Jefferson, a brick behemoth built during the Civil War and obsolete before it was finished. The diving is fabulous, but after two weeks Anna is ready for something else to distract her from thinking about wedlock (fans will remember Sheriff Paul Davidson). She's beginning to understand how her predecessor went mad after his girlfriend left him.<br />Then her sister sends a box of letters from her great-great-aunt, Raffia, wife of Fort Jefferson's commanding officer in 1865, by which time the fort was a military prison, full of deserters and rebel prisoners. That same night Anna's second-in-command, a spit and polish type, goes missing on patrol. And the story - both stories - told in alternating, cliff-hanger chapters, takes off.<br />Raffia's story involves her 16-year-old sister, a handsome rebel soldier brutalized by a thuggish sergeant, and the arrival of the Lincoln assassination conspirators, including Dr. Samuel Mudd, who proclaims himself innocent of anything except setting the assassin's leg. Intrigue and collusion are in the charged air and a young girl's romanticism can get people killed. Barr brings the original fort to teeming life through the lonely, compassionate eyes and tart voice of a woman isolated in an uncommunicative army marriage.<br />The present-day story involves a number of breathtaking near-death experiences for Anna, as well as spectacular dives and dogged detective work piecing together a tangled (but not totally surprising) modern conspiracy which culminates in a gorgeously over-the-top finale. The parallel tale-telling works well to entangle the two though it can be maddening leaving Anna trapped at the bottom of the ocean with her air hose just out of reach....<br />But, as always, Barr's (\\"Hunting Season,\\" \\"Firestorm\\") evocation of the natural setting (and the human menace) is vivid and the action scenes are among her best.(\\"Hunting Season,\\" \\"Firestorm\\") evocation of the natural setting (and the human menace) is vivid and the action scenes are among her best.	2003-02-21

When the nanny turns up drowned and pregnant and the police pass it off as suicide, Hitch drags his morose, unhappily married ex-private eye  friend Pete Munger into the case and gets a bit of help from his gorgeous, zany ex-wife Julia as well.<br />Hitch's sense of humor and determination never flag as the case leads into a morass of shady dealings, adultery and quasi-religious opportunism. Another murder, a near miss for Hitch and a second missing nanny heat up the action, while Hitch juggles romance and funerals between times.

Except one of her students has been gruesomely murdered. And some of the others are acting peculiar. And her new romantic interest comes under suspicion.

The plot gets a little wobbly but keeps moving, the characters are well drawn, the setting is lovingly rendered and the writing is crisp, fast-paced and humorous - though not quite as smart as it starts out to be.

He introduces his daughter to his childhood home and reaches out to her with stories of kids with names like Dub, Butchie, Psycho and Tweetie. And he volunteers his time teaching a writer's workshop at his old high school, though it's tough getting anybody to show up at first, \\"like pushing a rope,\\" as the principal says.<br />Price's (\\"Clockers,\\" \\"Freedomland,\\" \\"The Wanderers\\") writing is urban, fluid, snappy and visual. He reveals his characters the way life does, in increments. Ray is immediately likable. He's an animated storyteller as interested - or more perhaps - in the other actors as he is in his own role. As a volunteer teacher he's eager, but self-conscious. That first day, no one comes and alone in the room Ray fidgets, \\"to conceal how awkward and vaguely embarrassed he was beginning to feel...coming off busy as hell, yet when the school's principal, Bill or Bob Egan, knocked on the open door of the empty lounge, Ray almost shot to his feet with relief.\\" But the apologetic principal is only there to ask him to try again. \\" `Sure,' Ray said, the day now like chalk in his mouth.\\"<br />The story then jumps forward a month as another alumni of the school, a black policewoman, Nerese Ammons, arrives to give a presentation and is asked by the principal to look into a vicious assault on a volunteer teacher, Ray Mitchell, now lying half dead in a hospital bed. \\"For the first time in months she felt something in herself akin to joy.\\" Nerese, we quickly learn, is the Tweetie of Ray's initial story, the 10-year-old who'd been accidentally struck by a stickball bat, her wound staunched with the t-shirt of a mute, shocked Ray who had nothing to do with the accident. Nerese has not had a lot of selfless kindness from the people in her life and now, weeks from retirement, she sees a chance for payback. But Ray won't cooperate. She's sure, despite the severity of his head wound and his semi-dazed responses, that Ray knows his assailant. And Nerese determines to get justice for Ray whether he wants it or not.<br />The narrative continues to switch between Nerese and Ray, between her investigation and Ray's life during the previous month. Cracks begin to appear in Ray's character. He's not just a former high school teacher who made good in TV land, he's an ex-cokehead who destroyed his marriage, fled fatherhood and messed up more times than he can count. He's a man who has never for one minute been comfortable in his own skin. So how did such a sad-sack get to Hollywood? A bit of luck in his life, a store of goodwill to draw on. Ray likes to say, even think, it was Ruby who got him off drugs, but the truth is less romantic. He likes to think he's a generous, giving man full of good deeds and second chances for those less fortunate, but he's never so self-conscious as when he's watching himself be a do-gooder or showing off his largesse to Ruby. On the other hand, Ray really does like people. He wants to connect, he wants everyone to like him, he takes a genuine interest. He wants to be good. He's soon surrounded by people with various motives to bash his head in.<br />Nerese is the one for selfless acts, for all the good it's done her. Despite her tough exterior, her no-nonsense firmness and her generally low opinion of humanity, Nerese has a lot of people who depend on her and she comes through for them, while adhering to her solid moral principles. Nerese's dogged police work uncovers evidence; her experience and view of human nature interprets it. At the same time we see how she compartmentalizes her life for safety's sake, how tough love is bedrock truth for her.<br />In one scene, after she finds a gun on one of her teenage son's friends, she takes her son to visit his cousin in prison, \\" a field trip to Christmas Future.\\" But inside the prison she realizes she's made a mistake. \\"What she had interpreted as revulsion was in fact, self-revulsion. Darren - she should have known this - so far from being the type of kid who would ever wind up in a place like this, had spent the last hour and a half surrounded by what his young music-video-molded mind imagined to be REAL men, hardcore to the bone; not constantly scolded mama's boys like himself; and it made him feel like a punk.\\" Before the visit comes off, Nerese drags Darren out, but pauses to deposit money in her nephew's prison account, \\"by way of apology.\\"<br />Ray's flashbacks reveal the gaps between Nerese's evidence and reality. Things are not always what they seem; sometimes they're worse. The action of the plot reveals character. As the novel proceeds there are some shocks in store. Wanting to be good, wanting to connect, however briefly, can be selfish, dangerous, harmful. Ray, unlike Nerese, is not a person who weighs consequences, and consequently he runs hot and cold. Unconsciously, he toys with people's lives. Being inside his prickly, jumpy skin is painful, but you still can't help but like him, root for him, hope he lives and wises up. Wry, dark, full of heart and energy, Price's latest grabs and doesn't let go.Future.\\" But inside the prison she realizes she's made a mistake. \\"What she had interpreted as revulsion was in fact, self-revulsion.

Not all of the stories come directly from the show  two of the most powerful involve research that Xinran did herself. A visit to an orphanage run by mothers who had lost children during the 1976 Tangshan earthquake relates the unbearably painful memories of women whose tragedies arose not only out of natural disaster but also mans inhumanity to women. And the final story, the one that was one too many for her radio career, takes her to a remote desert village of almost unimaginable poverty where the womens only relief from isolation and hardship is the bowl of egg and water given them on the birth of a son.<br />The story of Xinrans own traumatic childhood during the Cultural Revolution (she was born in 1958) comes out during an interview with a woman imprisoned for loose morals, whose childhood was one of serial rape and blackmail. Another woman, brought up as a boy, and gang-raped when the masquerade was discovered in puberty, causes a ruckus at the station when she begins discussing a forbidden subject  lesbianism  on the air. This woman attaches herself to Xinran, becoming obsessed, a stalker. But there is no real menace in her, only a pitiful loneliness, and Xinran is able to defuse her with sympathy and firmness.<br />Sexual repression and ignorance was for so long an official tenet of Chinese society that even Xinran, an educated city girl, says she refused to hold hands with a boy at age 22 for fear of getting pregnant. Many of the letters she receives ask naïve sexual questions or confide long-secret (shameful) rapes. Sexual abuse is at the root of many of her stories.<br />Relating the genesis of her program, the author quotes a letter from a peasant boy describing the plight of a 12-year-old girl, kidnapped and sold into marriage. To prevent her from fleeing, her elderly husband keeps her in chains. The boy asks Xinrans help, but when she calls the police they shrug and tell her its a common occurrence. The policeman quotes a Chinese proverb to her:  In the countryside the heavens are high and the emperor is far away.  The villagers, he says, are not afraid of the police and would torch our cars and beat up our officers. But, faced with her determination, he relents and gets the local agricultural authorities to threaten witholding of fertilizer. In Xinrans presence, the girl is freed and returned to her frantic parents on the other side of the country. But Xinran is not praised for her efforts, only criticized for  moving the troops about and stirring up the people.   Shaken, she begins to wonder, Just what was a womans life worth in China? Not much, the reader will come to answer, as Xinran does. This first story is one of the few with a happy ending.<br />Many of these stories are rooted in the past  in the Revolution itself or the Cultural Revolution of her own childhood  and come to Xinran from outside. But others involve the circumstances of todays Chinese women, observed by the author in her daily life  homeless women, discarded women, bitter, successful women, impoverished, ignorant women, mothers, sisters, wives, daughters. Her struggles to make the program more open  to take calls on the air, for instance  illustrate the combination of fear and excitement that accompanies increments of loosening in China. Xinrans heartfelt writing, peppered with Chinese proverbs and imbued with ancient Chinese culture, brings these stories to life in all their terrible strength. A sad, powerful, inspiring book.To prevent her from fleeing, her elderly husband keeps her in chains.

These in-depth interviews reveal cross-cultural commonalities among women in family and work relationships as well as deep divides between Western and Pakistani attitudes toward women. Several make a distinction between Islam and tradition, saying men interpret religion to reinforce patriarchal culture, a point which is best articulated by Sufi feminist, Nilofar Ahmed. She explains that a lot of accepted knowledge is a matter of interpretation, \\"and we did not find any female scholars in this line. ...Even the most sincere male scholar with the best of intentions could not look at the law from a woman's point of view.\\"<br />They are all university-educated English speakers and several have done advanced studies abroad. Each describes herself as \\"different\\" from other women, by which she means determined, rebellious and independent and, usually, as a child, interested in \\"boy\\" activities. Most were encouraged in their education, at least until they got married. Divorce or separation and child custody are discussed at length as well as difficulties (and advantages) of extended family living. Though women worldwide still marry to escape the parental yoke, Western women get to make their own mistakes. These Pakistani women made arranged marriages and three were unhappy. Another, a widow, describes her husband in the same breath and repeatedly as \\"wonderful\\" and \\"difficult,\\" \\"special\\" and \\"bad-tempered.\\" Several found it easier to work and continue education with the support gained from an extended family, several found the demands of in-laws suffocating and demoralizing. Marital separation, leaving aside financial considerations, is difficult for a woman who loses her children (considered to belong to the father), is condemned by family and society, and, if she tries to pursue any kind of independent life, is assumed to be of loose morals.<br />One intriguing woman lives two lives - a government official in Lahore, and a feudal lord in her rural village. In Lahore some  men refuse to work for her because of her sex, but in the village feudal position trumps gender. Men and women rely on her for advice, financial aid, arbitration, even spiritual counseling and healing. Born to a second marriage, Ayesha was treated like a boy by a man with no sons. Though proud of this and of her ability to \\"act like a man,\\" several years after her interview with Haeri, after studying (War Studies) abroad and marrying, she writes Haeri that this posture destroyed \\"my sensuality, my appreciation of the other sex.\\" Ayesha also has complex dealings with family - legal wrangling over property coupled with a desire for closeness; severe parental restrictions coupled with demanding expectations.<br />Parental restrictions are a common complaint, followed in due course by marital restrictions - brought about by precepts of \\"izzat\\" or honor. Woman must be pure and her behavior reflects on her family or husband. \\"Hence, the threat of women's mobility and autonomy,\\" Haeri explains in her succinct, illuminating introduction. All of these women are politically active (one builds sanitary facilities for the poor, several are involved in education and human rights) and one, Rahila Tiwana, suffered torture in police custody, though she denies reports of sexual assault, saying her family was too well-respected. Rape, Haeri explains, is used to dishonor men, by besmirching the purity of their women.<br />Haeri lets each woman speak in her own voice and speak they do. The interviews come alive with passion, intimacy and intellectual power. Independence comes at the price of loneliness and conflict, even separation from children and family.

Young narrator Jeremy Proctor, Fieldings eyes and legs and increasingly mature assistant, tells the tale with verve, initiative, and wit, indulging in a little romance of his own along the way.<br />The case involves the theft of inflammatory letters and the collateral murder of a footman at the home of an arrogant British lord, secretary of state for the American colonies. Though Lord Hillsborough refuses to divulge the letters contents, its clear they connect with the rising colonial foment. Dinners with Samuel Johnson and Benjamin Franklin speed Fieldings cogitations while Jeremy scouts the back alleys and low taverns for the hired miscreants. The central mystery is a bit weak, but it hardly matters as Alexander brings history to life from the perspective of those making it and Jeremy continues to charm and provide the action, from disarming a mob to battling a ruthless assassin. Franklin appears in all his warts and brilliance and only the British aritsocracy comes off worse. Well-written, atmospheric and intirguing, the series continues to delight.	2003-01-20

Richard Von Knecht took a header off his balcony, but suicide is ruled out even before Huss and her colleagues have finished gawking at the deceased's lavish furnishings - far beyond the means of even rich Swedes. As the team makes its way through the dysfunctional Von Knecht family, a bomb goes off in the murdered man's office, killing two more people and sending Huss into the underworld of bikers and drug dealers and easy death.<br />Though Huss has a supportive husband (for a refreshing change), there's trouble at home with a burgeoning skinhead daughter and trouble in the force with colleagues covertly and overtly uncomfortable with women. Tursten changes viewpoint with ease and each member of the squad has a chance to shine, from the hard-pressed superintendent trying to mesh personalities and political change to pretty, young Birgitta, enigmatic Rauhala, abrasive Blom and more.<br />Well-written, if a little long and convoluted, \\"Huss,\\" provides an intriguing portrait of the workings of a murder squad as well as modern Swedish life.	2003-01-20

From its jarring opening at the scene of a robbery gone bad to the sad, clever twist at the end, Edgar-winner Kaminsky keeps the reader hooked with wry characterizations, dilemma-fed action and a well-organized plot. A man of earthy decency with a face like an old bloodhound and a quiet persistence to match, Chicago detective Abe Lieberman manages to stint neither his family nor his job as he starts his day with the confession of a would-be killer and moves on into the week with two murders to solve and a bar-mitzvah and a roof to pay for while his Irish partner, Bill Hanrahan, defies a Chinese tong leader to marry the woman he loves. Point of view shifts among the very bad day of a jewel thief on the run, Hanrahan, some middle-class punk kids mixed up in murder and Lieberman himself. An insomniac with high cholesterol and a love of good Jewish food, Lieberman maintains his good humored resignation to the things he cannot change while occasionally dispensing his own generous justice.<br />Kaminsky's deadpan rythmn is reminiscent of Ed McBain's 87th Precinct novels, while his dark humor, morally centered plots, economical, observant prose and dogged, amiable hero set the series apart.	2003-01-20

Penny Bone, who lives with her daughter and her Aunt Clare, but whos really been on her own a long time, centers the novel with her strong, young voice, a voice so strong people dont see the fear at her core. As the story opens, Pennys Aunt Clare is missing and her 7-year-old daughter, Tory, unearths some writing on a white stone at the edge of their yard. A gravestone, perhaps.<br />Penny latches onto the stone as a focus for her fears. Her mother died when she was a baby and her father  was killed in the war when she was 11. Raised by Clare, who is subject to benders and running off with men, Penny learned self-reliance before she knew what it was. She met John Bone in Crawfords tiny school, married at 17 and lost him by the time her daughter was born. Not that John Bone is dead. John accidentally killed a girl and got 20 years for manslaughter. Penny recalls: When they took him away he says, Im dead to you, and you got to be dead to me.  And now Clares been missing for weeks, longer than shes ever been gone before.<br />After a while, even with Tory sitting next to me and chattering about the stone, I felt kind of lonely and sad. It seemed like the air I inhaled could spread out anywhere in my body, and make me cold and afraid at the same time. I cant explain it. I wanted a car to come. Somebody I knew to get out and visit for a spell.<br />The narration switches to John Bone, feeling the first stirrings of hope hes allowed himself in six years. During a jail break-out, when he could have run, he saved a guards life instead. Theres talk of doing something for him in return. But the man who did escape, Peach, a thoroughly chilling psychopath, had once for treasure up at the old Crawford place at the top of the mountain, near where Penny lives, and Bone worries hes headed back there.<br />Back in Crawford, Pennys friend Morgan, an old man who can remember the last of the Crawfords, the one who became the Gypsy Man, worries over the signs hes seeing of the Gypsy Mans return. Born with a birthmark that blighted half his face, kidnapped, supposedly by Gypsies, as a toddler, then returned a few years later, the last Crawford became a fire bug. Though he was nearly 50 when he disappeared for good 40 years before, people still blame the Gypsy Man whenever theres a fire or a missing child. The last child to go missing still haunts the community  a boy from the black enclave further down the mountain, he was the first to integrate Crawfords school and the sheriff still looks for him. Now Morgans seeing the signs again and Pennys after him to help her dig out that white stone.<br />When Clare shows up, beaten and evasive, her house key missing, the reader knows its Peach shes been with, and the sinister undertone takes on an edge of dread. The narrative shifts among the varied voices of the characters, including the schoolmaster, his wife, Clare, the sheriff, Morgan, Penny, John, Peach and more. They dont always tell the whole truth and some are guilty of deceiving themselves, but they each contribute to the fabric of a community trying to hold together in the face of calamity, loss and horror. Before its done theres more death and horror, but also redemption and acceptance as Penny learns that hope has value and love endures.<br />Bauschs (A Hole in the Earth)risky narrative works because of the distinctiveness of his characters voices and the rich simplicity of his prose. These mountain voices reveal more than the depth of their prejudices and the foibles of their character, more than their level of education and the regrets that come with age, more than the small piece of the whole theyve seen from their considered perspective. Individually they reveal the hidden places in the human heart; together they show the complex weave of a community, in all its ugly grubbiness as well as its Sunday best.s in the human heart; together they show the complex weave of a community, in all its ugly grubbiness as well as its Sunday best.	2003-01-15

It is hard to imagine that we will behave differently in the future.\\"<br />The story itself gets off to a liesurely start. A brief preface begins at the end - the kids sick, people dead, a world of scary uncertainty. The narrator, Jack Forman, reflects: \\"Sitting here in the dark, it's hard to believe that a week ago my biggest problem was finding a job. It seems almost laughable now.\\" The novel then drops back to that week ago, to Forman's increasingly satisfying routine as a stay-at-home dad, refereeing arguments between his pre-teen daughter and son, changing the baby, getting everyone fed and clothed and ferried. Months before, Forman had lost his job as a computer programming manager as a result of trying to do the right thing - now he finds himself blackballed all over Silicon Valley.<br />But his wife, Julia, has a good job at Xymos, a nanotechnology company on the verge of a breakthrough.  The company, she tells Jack, has had a stunning success. It has broken the nanotechnology manufacturing barrier and is producing a sub-microscopic camera, which can roam the human blood stream, with obviously spectacular medical implications. Crichton delivers a bit of technical data, explaining some of the stumbling blocks to successful nanotechnology, information delivered painlessly between Julia's increasingly irritable moods, and Jack's growing conviction that there's more than workaday tension behind her erratic behavior. He suspects an affair.<br />But before he can confront Julia, their baby daughter breaks out in a mysterious, painful, posibly life-threatening rash, which baffles the emergency-room doctors and then disappears as suddenly as it arrived. The pace begins to pick up. Strange events - a broken MP-3 player, out of place items in the baby's room, sightings of imaginary people - charge the atmosphere as Julia grows ever more hard and beautiful.<br />Then Jack is called in to consult at Xymos. Apparently it's one of his artificial intelligence programs, PREDPREY, \\"a goal-seeking program based on predator/prey dynamics\\" that Xymos is using to control their real nanotech project - self-guiding micro-cameras for the military - and they are having problems keeping the goal steady. Jack is uncertain, but after his wife has a car accident, he takes the job. Now the pace goes into overdrive.<br />There's been contamination, leakage from the plant resulting in some dead animals. The project manager, an old prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Jack's, is evasive, even deliberately misleading. But it's not giving anything away (the jacket copy does that) to say that the project itself has escaped human control and is evolving rapidly, according to the basic parameters of its predator/prey programming, but with lots of rapid and unforseen innovations. Humans have become the prey.<br />Can Jack stop the proliferating nano-clouds before they change the world?<br />Crichton (\\"Jurassic Park,\\" \\"Congo,\\" \\"The Terminal Man\\")mixes in the science effortlessly, giving his readers some fairly complex lessons without slowing the action. He's less successful with characters, though, and it's hard to believe Jack's motivations at times - refusing the consulting job, despite his suspicions and then abruptly taking it after his wife's accident - yes, there was an odd van that showed up at the scene and yes, maybe there was someone else in the car, but his wife's condition is critical and what about the kids? There are worse crimes though - Jack, the seasoned project manager, heading out on a mission ofextreme danger and not bothering to organize the equipment they will need or even make sure someone else has done it. But these are minor quibbles and nothing you won't find in any Crichton novel. Crichton's strength is ideas and action and there's plenty of both in this one.ger and not bothering to organize the equipment they will need or even make sure someone else has done it.

Tim Cahill, self-described (and humorously self-deprecating) adventurer, fits that bill perfectly with his far-flung expeditions dodging bandits across the Sahara to tour the salt mines, swimming with Great White Sharks off South Africa, touring the guerilla lands of Columbia with Robert Pelton, author of \\"The World's Most Dangerous Places,\\" and, on assignment, taking a yoga retreat in Jamaica (now that sounds like something I could do).<br />But Cahill's (\\"Pass the Butterworms,\\" \\"Jaguars Ripped My Flesh\\") essays are never just about the adventure. In his introduction Cahill calls these stories \\"a representative sampling of my life\\" (\\"What can I say? I have a low threshold of boredom...\\") and adds, \\"if there is any organizing principle at work here it is emotional.\\" Encounters with people who live or work in the out-of-the-way places he visits provide depth and interest. Cahill is a thoughtful as well as irreverent writer. His \\"Search for the Caspian Tiger\\" in the mountains separating Turkey and Iraq is as much a portrait of his companion, war correspondent Thomas Goltz, and his bizarre trip to Columbia, \\"hands down, the most dangerous destination we could have chosen in the Western Hemisphere,\\" is really a portrait of Pelton.<br />There are forays into his own life, from adolescent stunts to the death of his first wife and his own near crippling injury, brought about by a bout of stupidity that could happen to hardly anyone. He muses on writing and teaching and hurting people's feelings. Poignancy and laughter coexist in fluid and jarring ways. Along with his habitual irreverence, Cahill has a fine appreciation of irony and the absurd. Take the wild and pristine stretch along the Columbia river still \\"very much as it had been when Lewis and Clark camped nearby in 1805,\\" a place where new species of flora and fauna are being discovered, a place where wildlife thrives - kept that way because of the off-limits presence of the hemisphere's largest repository of nuclear waste, the Hanford Site.

And besides, many are think pieces from magazines like \\"The New Yorker\\" and \\"The Nation,\\" \\"Vanity Fair,\\" \\"salon.com\\" and \\"The Atlantic Monthly.\\"<br />The book is divided into six parts, each followed by a \\"National Conversation,\\" with column-length opinion pieces. Election 2000 includes five pieces from the likes of Vincent Bugliosi (liberal) and Charles Krauthammer (conservative); Politics in the Bush Era features Margaret Carlson and Nicholas Lemann, with columns from Molly Ivins and Paul Krugman. Lani Guinier and Frank Rich sound off on (Not) Politics As Usual, then Barbara Ehrenreich and David Brooks give their View from Main Street. The second half of the book concentrates on September 11 and the War on Terror and we hear from Richard Perle, Fouad Ajami, Richard Rodriguez, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Henry Kissinger. Among others.

The security system on his old house is surprisingly sophisticated for a Shakespearean scholar with no interest in material goods, and then there's the noises at night - someone throwing gravel at the roof, it sounds like, though the police find no gravel or evidence of any disturbance at all. Sleepless and terrified, Lee gets her college roommate to come and together they set a trap for the mysterious prowler - a trap that backfires, ending in a man's death.<br />Instead of calling the police, Lee and Casey get rid of the body. This is a bit hard to swallow and, in my opinion, not key to the plot, but naturally leads to some harrowing difficulties. Not nearly so harrowing, however, as what happens after Lee makes a shocking find while searching the house and decides to take action, putting her life and others at risk.  The last half of the book is a chase and discovery as Lee puts her phenomenal memory to work exposing the dark underbelly of southern racism and atrocity, staying barely a skip ahead of the villains.<br />Wilhelm's (\\"Desperate Measures,\\" \\"The Good Children\\") flair for nuanced psychological suspense is in top form. Lee is a woman to root for as she finds purpose in life and puts the plot in high gear with her fine intellect and amazing memory. Though fast-paced, the story makes room for the character development Wilhelm readers look for. That first body niggles at the reader though, a loose end never satisfactorily resolved.	2002-12-23

Bloom, (\\"The Western Canon\\"), says his choices were \\"arbitrary.\\" \\"These are certainly NOT `the top one hundred' in anyone's judgment, my own included. I wanted to write about these.\\"<br />And write he does, with erudition, wit and verve. The most difficult thing about this book is the introduction, with its elaborate explanation of the book's structure, based on the Kabalistic \\"Sefirot,\\" attributes of God and God's image, emanating out from an infinite center. Once embarked on the essays, Bloom's enthusiasm animates his scholarship. He begins with the \\"crown,\\" five masters, \\"each of whom dominates his genre forever.\\" These are Shakespeare, Cervantes, Montaigne, Milton and Tolstoy. The essays are short and tend to seize on one aspect, character or work to celebrate the whole. For Shakespeare it's Falstaff. \\"Does anyone else, in all of literature, enjoy what he is saying as much as Falstaff does?\\" And \\"All that Hamlet, Falstaff, and Cleopatra require of you is that you not bore them.\\"<br />Bloom's writing is tart and barbed; he enjoys taking aim at his critics nearly as much as extolling his subjects. Perhaps it is partly to needle those who disdain his partiality for dead white males that he posits the Biblical writer J, or the Yahwist, (writer of parts of Genesis and Exodus) as a woman. He pokes fun at revisionists and deconstructionists, though he seldom wastes a full sentence on any of them. \\"In our increasingly virtual reality, three authors seem immune to the decline of authentic reading: Shakespeare, Austen, Dickens.\\"<br />All three, says Bloom, share one profound gift: \\"personalities major and minor burst forth from the pages of these writers, in a profusion otherwise unmatched in the language.\\"  Personality is essential to Bloom, who has plenty of it himself, and his discussions of artists as varied as Milton and Hemingway, Dante and Tennessee Williams, George Eliot and Muhammad, Iris Murdoch and Mark Twain, are fired with their difficult personalities, and the personalities of their art, their place in their world, their yearnings, longings and demons.

The book takes the form of a chronicle written from a Siberian prison by 23-year-old Miriam for the daughter she has not seen since the day of her birth, six years before. It's late winter, 1911, and the long season has taken its toll.<br />\\"We're beyond tired, beyond cold. The blood that fills my mouth is sticky, souring even as I still draw breath. Job floats unbidden into mind. NAKED CAME I INTO THE WORLD AND NAKED WILL I LEAVE IT THITHER. The cold drags on even as the light returns. I write to you, but my hand falters. TO EVERYTHING ITS SEASON, and mine was this: twenty-three years in the bowels of the turning century. I feel my end coming. THE LORD GIVETH AND HE TAKETH AWAY. Then I cough again and it's the taste of my own blood that spurs me on. Is it not still thick and pungent and rich as the heart that pumps it? I pick up the pen once again and move it across the page.\\"<br /> Miriam then begins her life story with the circumstances of her birth in a rural shtetl in 1887. Her mother drowned herself the day after her daughter's birth and Miriam spent her first six years with a large, boisterous peasant family before her shoemaker father remarried and reclaimed his daughter. The talented seamstress, Tsila, his new wife, her face \\"marked by Divine anger\\" (a large strawberry birthmark) is considered ill-tempered, but Miriam, though intimidated, is struck by the beauty of the unmarked profile and soon benefits from her stepmother's sharp intellect. True, the house is quieter than Miriam is used to and Tsila has no patience for the gossip and superstition of village life, but she teaches Miriam to read and fosters an interest in the wider world.<br />Unfortunately, revolutionary fervor comes to the shtetl while Miriam is old enough to be wandering about on her own, but not old enough to benefit from her stepmother's wisdom. Flattered by an offer of friendship, Miriam toys with revolutionary ideas, feeling like a fraud for her lack of real interest. Nevertheless she hides a parcel of dynamite for a young man she barely knows, frightening Tsila into setting in motion a plan for emigrating to Argentina. But before they go Miriam journeys to Kiev to find Tsila's sister who is shamefully cohabiting with a young revolutionary. Miriam is seduced by the city - its multitudes, architecture, variety - all its teeming life. Day by day, week by week, she resists returning home, and once again is drawn to the young intellectuals - the revolutionaries.<br />Richler successfully evokes the emotions and wonder of a young girl at the turn of the century, struck by her first metropolis, falling almost without volition into the danger and excitement of revolution. Miriam is never political. Her fate is a simple accident of timing, and all the sadder for that. Richler's brief portraits of other revolutionaries hint at similar irrelevant motivations: rebelling against a parent, following a man, winning respect, seeking thrills, bonding with the group.<br />Richler's moving portrayal of the shtetl details its joys and agonies in a vivid depiction of daily life. We see the closeness of people who've lived beside one another forever and their narrow mindedness too, gossip, failure and superstition passed on through generations. We see them at work and at worship, religion woven into the fabric of their lives. The devout pride of Jewish life lives hand-in-hand with the fear of pogroms, often instigated by the manipulations of a government and aristocracy eager to deflect the population's rage from themselves.<br />The writing is richly descriptive, the characters subtly drawn.

With this third novel, set in 1989, at the time of the Tiananmen Square upheavals, he again demonstrates his command of the English language and the nuances of human behavior.  His prose is spare and compact and charged with the sense that anything might happen.<br />The book opens calmly, even placidly, as the narrator, graduate student Jian Wan, explains that his mentor, Professor Yang, has suffered a stroke. Yang has been helping him prepare for the Ph. D entrance exams for classical literature at Beijing University, the foundation of Jian's meticulously planned future. He will pass the exams and join his fianc&eacute;e, Professor Yang's daughter Meimei, in the city, \\"where we planned to build our nest.\\" He will become a teacher himself and spend his life in scholarly pursuits, a spiritual aristocrat, rich in heart, as his teacher has counseled. Now, as the closest thing to a family member available, Jian has been assigned to nurse Yang, which he is glad to do, though uneasy about the lost time. \\"I was anxious - without thorough preparation I couldn't possibly do well in the exams.\\"<br />A sober, conventional, conscientious young man, Jian's settled outlook is soon disrupted by more than inadequate study time. The professor is suffering a kind of dementia that at first seems nonsensical. But as the days pass, Yang focuses on events which seem to come from his past. An intellectual, Yang was a \\"target of the struggle\\" during the Cultural Revolution. He had been denounced, humiliated, his books burned.  Once he had told Jian that during difficult times he would quote Dante to himself. \\" `They could hurt me physically, but they could not subdue my soul.' \\" But now, his mind wandering, Yang's lofty sentiments have deserted him. One morning he belts out a rousing political rhyme. \\"His singing made my scalp itch as I remembered hearing Red Guards chant it in my hometown. By so doing, those big boys and girls had contributed their little share to the revolution; but that had been two decades before, and now the song was no more than an embarrassing joke.\\" Additionally, Yang \\"would not have been entitled to sing such a progressive song together with the masses.\\" How, Jian wonders, did he learn it?<br />Listening to his professor's ravings, Jian is unsure how much is real, how much made up. Yang bounces from oddly skewed parables to blissful descriptions of an adulterous affair. His moods swing from joy to savage recrimination. He makes bitter pronouncements on family and scholarly life, the political hypocrisy and expediency of communism and academic backbiting. He is sarcastic, angry, blubbering and regretful. Jian is often \\"shocked,\\" sometimes repelled, but intrigued too. Could he have understood so little of his teacher's life? As he comprehends his professor's vast store of disappointment, he begins to question his own assumptions. Things have been kept from him - university maneuverings, petty jealousies and passions, a  welter of unspoken thought. From Yang's dementia emerges a hopeless prospect, the uselessness of opposing political force; the shame of sacrificing personal integrity. Naturally this hopeless prospect dismays young Jian. He must act to prevent it.<br />Meanwhile the events at Tiananmen Square are building. Jian and his friends, far away, listen to the Voice of America, with mixed feelings. Meimei, in Beijing, never mentions the demonstrations, but exhorts Jian to study and concentrate on getting ahead. Jian, tossed one way and another, struggles to find his way through his doubts and the events conspiring against him. Eventually he goes to Beijing to take part in the demonstrations. And we all know how that turned out.<br />But rather than despair over the state's crushing fist, Jian's insight is personal. He did not go toBeijing for some great ideal, but to impress Meimei. Most revolutionaries, he reflects, joined the struggle to \\"escape an arranged marriage or to avoid debts or just to have enough food and clothes. It's personal interests that motivate the individual and therefore generate the dynamics of history.\\"<br />Ha Jin's novels are multi-layered, deceptively simple stories with an undercurrent of tension and unease. The State looms over the individual with the powers of catastrophe and reward and the individual maneuvers within it as best he can. Though the bulk of \\"The Crazed\\" takes place in Yang's hospital room, Ha also takes us to Jian's Spartan dormitory quarters, meals with his friends and even a trip to the rural countryside, which contains more shocks for Jian. The struggles of daily life continually challenge the individual to small rebellions and betrayals, balanced against risk and integrity. Finally, Jian comes of age, a man less blinkered, but not without hope and plans for his future.ng for some great ideal, but to impress Meimei.

Emphasizing quality ingredients and constant tasting, she painstakingly explains what to look for and how to taste. More than once she cautions that it may take several tries before a dish sounds that note of perfection on the tongue. Rodgers' style of cooking requires some forethought - all her meat and poultry is lightly salted at least a day before cooking - to \\"open up\\" the proteins, and some dishes, like Artichoke Caponata, improve when made ahead.<br />The book is organized by course and the introductions to each recipe offer tips on ingredients or technique, suggestions for leftovers and sometimes the dish's history in her repertoire, which is French and Italian-influenced. Some dishes are simple - her signature Roast Chicken with Bread Salad is a snap as long as you remember to salt the chicken the day before (it does make a difference). Several soups (Asparagus &amp; Rice with Pancetta &amp; Black Pepper) are quick and easy, as long as you've got the stock on hand - canned stock is beneath mention - and several pickles, condiments and sauces (Preserved Lemons, Roasted Pepper Relish, Sage Pesto) are simple enough to keep on hand, but basically, Rodgers is not about quick and easy. The hamburger that the pickles are served with starts with grinding your own chuck - twice. Pasta with Sardines &amp; Tomato Sauce begins with cleaning, broiling, then filleting the sardines, although the roasted tomato sauce is quick, easy and different. Pot Roast begins with reducing a bottle of red wine to a half cup and four cups of beef stock to two.<br />There are detailed instructions for cooking omelettes and risotto, making the best stock, braising meats, preparing a cheese tray, making granitas and sorbets. She gives reasons for every step from choosing a pot to skimming fat - or not.

His way with vegetables offers simple variety - Saut&eacute;ed Greens with Vinegar, Skillet-Fried Corn and Tomatoes, and a baked Cauliflower Alla Parmagiana that has become a staple in my house - whatever the vegetable. There are desserts too, mostly fruit with a few comfort items like Caramel Panna Cotta and an easy tiramisu, but the real pleasure comes from the savory.

The characters are human and likeable, the stories involving and optimistic. Nothing too awful happens and what awfulness there is will inevitably work out for the best in the end. And the writing is fine, drawing the reader into the bustling atmosphere of today&#146;s Dublin.<br />At the center of the story is a restaurant, Quentins. The primary protagonist is Ella Brady, a young woman who first felt grown-up at Quentins at age 6. Loving daughter of doting parents, her life proceeds smoothly until she falls hard for the charismatic and married Don Richardson, whose treachery sends shock waves through the city, devastates Ella and bankrupts her family. In desperation she throws herself into a documentary about modern Ireland, as seen through the evolution of her favorite restaurant and its clientele.<br />Most of the primary characters work in or around Quentins and fans of Binchy&#146;s will again meet Cathy Scarlet and Tom Feather from &#147;Scarlet Feather,&#148; as well as the incorrigible twins. Nora from &#147;Evening Classes&#148; works at Quentins and Ria from &#147;Tara Road&#148; offers practical comfort to Ella and her family. The documentary brings in a host of minor characters with brave or heartwarming stories of overcoming adversity, whether from without or within. Ella&#146;s story continues to develop - there&#146;s missing money and visits from the Fraud Squad as well as betrayal and one very serious dilemma to cope with, but there&#146;s no doubt Ella will do the right thing &#150; whatever it turns out to be. In Binchy&#146;s world good nature triumphs over bad and it never feels pat or saccharine; it feels like the way life should be.	2002-11-11

Bernard is a devout but irreverent soul whose narrative is a defense against accusations following his investigation of the murder of a superior, the ascetic Father Augustin.<br />Augustin and his guards were dismembered, their body parts strewn over the countryside. But the sharp-witted Bernard (as he is quick to declare himself) soon questions whether the butchery was only to disguise a missing body  the culprit. Assigned a new superior who blames the murder on sorcery, the horrified Bernard struggles to discover the truth and conceal his newfound passion for a suspect.<br />Jinks breathes life into her narrator, a man of complex passions and humor, proud of his work in keeping heresy from taking root. Exploring the phenomenon of the Inquisition, Jinks shows how fanatics joined forces with Church bureaucrats like Bernard; how fear drove hysteria; how neighbor turned on neighbor. This world, so strange and repugnant to the modern mind, so ordinary to Bernard, gains understanding with the reader as it loses luster for Bernard. Well-written and penetrating, as well as entertaining and well paced, this deserves wide readership.	2002-11-07

It takes place over ten years and, while centering on British explorer Alexander Burnes, shifts points of view among the London upper crust, a Russian emissary/adventurer, a supercilious English journalist, several merchants, Afghanistan's Amir, a homosexual British deserter, various misguided British officers, a brief appearance by a modern-day archaeologist coming upon a field of unburied bones, and more.<br />Far from being confusing, this plethora of views grounds the novel in its time; a world which not only appears to be, but is, very different to Dost Mohammed, the Amir of Kabul, than it is to the serious and fashionable Bella Garraway, falling in love with Burnes at the height of his London Season, or to Burnes' younger brother on his first passage to India or to a nervous, charismatic Russian with a shadowy past. It's a story full of romance and treachery, politics and intrigue, merchant caravans, intrigue, imperialism and arrogance and war.<br />The narrative moves at a leisurely pace, opening in Kabul with Burnes, passing his days as a virtual prisoner, awaiting an audience with the Amir Dost Mohammed. He is Britain's eyes and ears - the British are wondering whether the Amir should be replaced by an Afghan leader less hostile to their Indian allies. Impressed by the spare order of the Amir's court, the Afghan leader's canny questions and the welter of strange sensations and smells of Kabul, Burnes writes a book on his Eastern adventures and becomes the toast of London. He wins Bella's heart, but she retires to the country with a secret of her own as he travels East again, already replaced by the next London sensation.<br />Worried by Russian incursions and influence, the British Governor General moves a massive army, complete with officers' wives, baggage and lapdogs, from the Punjab to Afghanistan. Meanwhile a digression to the Crimea introduces Vitkevich, a brilliant and mysterious Russian soldier, whose concern with serfs and land improvements becomes sidetracked by a trip to Afghanistan where he will share Christmas dinner with Burnes.<br />And back to the British army for domestic difficulties, social wrangling, desert hunting games and inept diplomacy. Eventually the British reach their goal and settle outside the gates of Kabul to enjoy their victory, blind to the end. The cultural misunderstandings, born of ignorance as well as arrogance, are sympathetically developed, and suggest chilling echoes for the present day.<br />Hensher's writing is rich and unhurried. He envelops the reader in the feel of a place - it's smells and weather, architecture, clothing and people. Though the characters are many they are well developed. Almost all remain enigmas to some extent, but that is entirely intentional. The narrative draws the reader deep into the subtleties of culture and aggression.

Having saved the historian Niketas, Baudolino proceeds to tell him his story; a grand epic which stars Baudolino as poet, statesman, reluctant soldier, spy, lover, holy man, philosopher, and pilgrim to the mythical realm of Prester John. It encompasses the Crusades, the search for the holy grail, the mysteries of the East, the circular wrangling between pope and potentate, the petty, fluid and bloody rivalries of Italian cities and the state of science at the time.<br />But there's one caveat. The young Baudolino originally caught his patron's eye because of his two greatest talents - languages and lies. So what to believe?<br />The choice is yours and the journey is stimulating, although the drug-enhanced Paris student arguments on the great questions of the day begin to read like student arguments of any era, despite the wit. Baudolino is engaging, but as an untrustworthy narrator he maintains a certain distance from the reader. Eco's fans, dictionary in hand, will enjoy the play, but those who got bogged down in \\"The Name of the Rose\\" should skip this one.	2002-10-28

Many of Iversen's ideas combine tropicals with temperate-zone plants, and he uses color, leaf texture and height throughout for striking effects.<br />The last 30-plus pages offer a glossary of 100 tropical plants. Each entry includes a color photo, the plant's origin, decorative interest (foliage or flowers), culture characteristics, height, propagation (cutting or seed, season, time to maturity), horticultural use and overwintering needs.

These realities - hampered movements, sabotaged phone systems, suicide bombers - do much to enhance the action and suspense and Land leads the reader into a labyrinth of past and present where hides a secret so great no one alive can be trusted with it.<br />Land fuels his thriller with a realistic sense of man's horrifying inhumanity and the glimmers of hope to be found in individuals.	2002-10-21

Replete with color photographs, charts and plans, the Gertleys' combinations of flowers and vegetables in formal designs satisfy the desire for beauty, productivity and the urge to impress the neighbors.<br />Beginning with an overview of gardens of the past, the authors proceed to design, discussing elements of color, texture and space and offering specific and detailed photos and plans for gardens inspired by anything from quilts to honeycombs to a scaled down version of the kitchen garden at the Chateau de Villandry in France.<br />In addition to detailed designs, the Gertleys offer guidelines and advice for drawing on your own inspiration, from mixing colors and adding elements of texture (organic or artificial) to plant height and arrangement. On the less creative side of things, they discuss planting timing and harvesting, growing from seed and buying seedlings and garden preparation and maintenance.<br />The practical advice is basic; useful but almost an afterthought. Weeds, for instance, don't get mentioned until page 134. The designs, however, are well illustrated - from flourishing result back to graph paper plot and plant placement.

As a writer, his gift for capturing the absurd is surpassed only by his ability to laugh at himself, making for an aborbing, educational and hilarious trip through the remoter regions of Peru and Inca culture.<br />Ridiculously over-supplied, Shah struggles with his mounds of luggage from campsite to crowded bus and train, from dusty village to timeless ruins to, at last, the jungles of the Amazon rain forest. To start, a four-day backpacking trip across mountain passes brings him to sunrise over the lost Inca city of Macchu Pichu, missed by the gold-hunting conquistadors, but overrun by busloads of modern tourists. Here Shah examines a temple dedicated to the condor, but his guide tells him his obsession with flight misses the point. \\" 'Whether the Incas flew or not is irrelevant,' she said. 'Instead, you must ask why they wanted to fly.' \\" Shah takes this advice to heart and incorporates the spiritual element into his quest.<br />Passing the time with shopkeepers, launderers, expatriates and anyone else who crosses his path, Shah acquires good luck totems and encounters the looted graves of Peru's mummies, the mummies themselves littering the ground. In small museums he finds hundreds of woven birdmen in the mummies' exquisite funerary robes. He pauses in a town famous for vampires (to tourists anyway) and stays in a deserted luxury hotel, haunted by a bloodthirsty ghost. He reaches his own conclusions about the Nazca Lines, ancient desert etchings of animals whose forms can only be seen from the sky. He meets several shaman, one of whom cures Shah's troubled mind with a rite which involves a guinea pig and a prohibition against shaking hands for 40 days. Others use datura or curare.<br />Meandering, Shah  makes his way toward the Shuar, the Birdmen, who live still in the remote jungle. A group of missionaries was murdered only the previous month for arriving with empty hands, he's told. Loaded with gifts as well as his state-of-the-art gear, Shah at last embarks in search of the tribes and their ayahuasca, a mind-altering \\"Vine of the Dead,\\" their secret of flight.<br />His guide is a taciturn naturalist and Vietnam vet, an American named Richard, who seldom sleeps. The mysteries of nature are Richard's passion...Their transportation is a half-rotten hulk and after their first night, Shah discovers his shoes have been gnawed by rats. He decrees death to the rodents but the boat is shortly overrun with cockroaches and then wolf spiders - staples of the rats' diet. At a shoreside village, Shah buys new rats.<br />This is only the beginning. After arriving at his first Shuar village (...) Shah is taken to a shaman in the jungle and his description of the trip perfectly captures the difficulty of the modern traveler: \\"...\\" By the time he arrives at the Shaman's village he contemplates taking up life there. \\"...\\" But only here, deep in its natural home, can he fulfill his desire and learn the Shuar's ancient secret of flight.<br />Reader's of Shah's previous book, \\"Sorcerer's Apprentice\\" (a quest for magic in India) will recognize his unique affinity for the bizarre and surreal encountered while fulfilling his avid curiosity for the knowledge and traditions of other cultures.

Though a scholar and historian rather than food writer, Fernandez-Armesto brings all of these qualities to the table as well as an almost staggering breadth of information. His aim, as stated in the preface: \\"to take a genuinely global perspective; to treat food history as a theme of world history, inseparable from all the other interactions of human beings with one another and with the rest of nature; to treat evenhandedly the ecological, cultural and culinary concepts of the subject; to combine a broad conspectus with selectively detailed excursions into particular cases; to trace connections at every stage, between the food of the past and the way we eat today; and to do all this briefly.\\" Whew. And does he succeed? Yes, although at times the flow of knowledge overwhelms the ability to process.<br />But that's fine. This is a book to savor and enjoy, to dip into and re-read, to pull out at dinner parties to settle arguments. For, besides liveliness and wit, Fernandez-Armesto's writing has another invaluable quality - authority. When he makes an unequivocal statement, you, the reader, do not doubt him. For instance, sugar, he writes, \\"is now the world's biggest food product, beating even wheat.\\" Startling perhaps, but not subject to debate. Unfortunately the reader's audience, those recipients of unrequested quotes, not being under the author's authoritative spell, sometimes require more convincing, which Fernandez-Armesto's notes, though copious, cannot always supply.  Reference to his credentials - Oxford University professor, author of 13 serious, popular and opinionated histories (\\"Millenium: A History of the Last Thousand Years,\\" \\"Civilizations: Culture, Ambition, and the Transformation of Nature,\\") - may do the trick.<br />The book is organized into eight \\"revolutions,\\" beginning with the advent of cooking, which not only sets us apart from other animals, but contributes to social cohesion. Food as ritual discusses, among other things, cannibalism (\\"Strangely, cannibals turn out to have a lot in common with vegans\\") health fads, and sacred and taboo foods. Next comes herding and farming animals, then agriculture, then food as status (which includes eye-popping menus of conspicuous consumption through the ages).<br />  Things begin to get more complicated with \\"The Edible Horizon\\" - long-range trade and food in cultural exchange - which ranges from cultural bias in food to the broadening of diet through war and imperialism, particularly Western empire building in the 17th to 19th centuries. \\"Challenging Evolution\\" explores the movement of food around the world, particularly between \\"Old\\" world and \\"New\\" world. The \\"Colombian Exchange\\" of the last 500 years has resulted in radical diet change. Imagine Italy without the tomato, Ireland without the potato, India or Thailand without chilies, our Midwest without wheat. The final chapter concerns the industrialization of the last two centuries, from the \\"Green Revolution\\" of world feeding through pesticides and mono-crops and factory farms and production to the giants of food industry (Hershey and Mars, the Quakers of England) and preserving from canning and freezing to irradiation.<br />No surprise, Fernandez-Armesto is not in favor of irradiation, fast food (\\"the closest thing to conveyor-belt eating the Industrial Revolution had yet produced.\\"), fusion cookery (\\"Lego cookery\\") or the microwave, which \\"is best suited to that public enemy, the solitary eater,\\" destroying the communal ritual of mealtime. His opinions, which crop up with refreshing acidity throughout the book, portray a man of keen and discerning appetite, whose love of food extends to this scholarly and entertaining professional treatment. Although the author himself does not take this work as seriously as his other books, calling it a \\"devoir de vacances,\\" with research spun-off from a previous work, \\"Civilizations: Culture, Ambition, and the Transformation of Nature,\\" it is enjoyably written, thought provoking, myth debunking and convincingly thorough.

If you are one of those people who thinks most of the books worth reading were written in the 19th century, by people like Dickens and Trollope and Hardy, you are in for a rare treat. Faber's sprawling, gritty, lush Victorian novel, reminiscent of the best of all three, brings to life the world of 1875 London, from the grimiest, rat-infested alleys to the overladen dining tables and \\"servant-infested passageways\\" of the rich. In the course of his 834 pages Faber takes the reader to factories and taverns, music halls and fashionable Season parties, grubby brothels and formal calls.<br />Faber (whose first novel, \\"Under the Skin,\\" is totally different) takes advantage of his 21st century perspective to discreetly drop the Victorian circomlocution and ornate flourishes when the action calls for brevity. Not that you'll notice as his eloquence and skill as stylist and storyteller fuse so perfectly. The modern perspective also allows for graphic detail. There's a lot of sex, though not much eroticism. His protagonist, Sugar, started life as a prostitute at age 13, and sex is a living to her, not a pleasure. There's a lot of dirt and degradation and the politics of class and sex are ugly and entrenched. Yet it's a story full of life and hope and real people.<br />An omniscient narrator begins by inviting the reader into the lowest slums to begin making the connections without which meeting the story's loftier characters would be impossible: \\"their servants wouldn't have let you in the door.\\" It's a cold, sleety November night. \\"The cobblestones beneath your feet are wet and mucky, the air is frigid and smells of sour spirits and slowly dissolving dung.\\" Caroline, an unlettered country girl, finding in prostitution a refuge from the numbing, slow starvation of factory work, meets a former colleague who has gone up a rung in the world, Sugar.<br />Tha narrator fades away (although returning to tell us, for instance, that Agnes Rackham has a brain tumor, which will never be found) after introducing William Rackham, reluctant perfumery heir and tormented would-be artist, and the story gathers steam.William's allowance has been drastically curtailed by his father, impatient to hand over the reins. Forced to buy a ready-made hat, to make do with one less maid, William is miserable, and hearing of a prostitute who will do \\"anything,\\" he resolves to be distracted.<br />But Sugar, as well-read as she is willing, captivates him. So obsessed does William become that he masters his father's hated business in order to restore his allowance and monopolise her. William discovers an interest in the arcana of perfume and soap and his fortunes ascend. As do Sugar's. She now has more time to read and to work on her novel - a pornagraphic opus of the violent death of heartless men.<br />She also has less freedom of movement. As point of view shifts between Sugar and the Rackham household, Faber contrasts Sugar's situation with Agnes Rackham's, William's sheltered, delicate and deranged wife. A virtual prisoner, alternately pampered and medically abused, Agnes' struggles to fit into the social world she was groomed for - her beautiful wardrobe, her total lack of biological knowledge, her constraints of behavior and speech - grow increasingly grotesque and heart-wrenching.<br />Sugar, transferred into a home of her own, given more money than she can spend, fights boredom with an obsession to learn everything about the Rackhams so as to secure her position. Distanced from her old life, she grows fastidious. The ugly violence of her novel repels, even embarrasses her. Agnes' delicacy attracts her. As Sugar's fortunes entwine more closely with the Rackhams,' Faber introduces a \\"Jane Eyre\\" element, underscoring the gulf between that novel and this.<br />There are a myriad of lesser characters who play crucial parts in breadth and development - William's older brother, Henry, a gentle religious zealot tormented by his own sexuality; Emmeline Fox, a consumptive, tart-tongued widow and the object of Henry's affection, who evangelizes among prostitutes; William's old school chums, a pair of repulsive but amusing dandies; the Rackham servants, Sugar's horrible mother, various prostitutes. Faber shifts point-of-view at will, giving human voice to various levels of society and Victorian thought. His characters are masterful. Even the worst of them arouse empathy (well, maybe not Sugar's mother), and the best - Sugar and Agnes - practically step off the page. And in the end, it's William, despite his worldly freedom and privilege (or because of it) who is the most constrained, his soul the most confined.<br />In an interview with his publisher, Faber comments on character: \\"One of the most absurd tragedies about us as a species is that each of us is convinced we're misunderstood, alone, a misfit. There doesn't seem to be anybody in the world who feels they're what a standard-issue human being ought to be. Literature reminds us of this paradox-our specialness and our commonality.\\" Faber's book is another paradox - a novel with perfect Victorian sensibilities, which could only have been written in our time.<br />I could go on and on, but I've run out of space. Suffice to say if this book was another 800 pages I'd be happy.ve, tart-tongued widow and the object of Henry's affection, who evangelizes among prostitutes; William's old school chums, a pair of repulsive but amusing dandies; the Rackham servants, Sugar's horrible mother, various prostitutes.

Angel Rock is a place where the kids still go barefoot to school and the protagonist, 13-year-old Tom, can still barter chores for his after-school ice pop.<br />As the book opens on a Friday afternoon in the first baking heat of summer, Tom, teetering on the brink between boy and man, revels in the growth of his maturing body, a fleeting joy quickly extinguished by his usual run-in with the town bully, Sonny Steele. His weekend anticipation is further dashed by his step-father, Henry's, demand that Tom help him finish a logging job. As his mother is also working, Tom's four-year-old half-brother, Flynn, also goes along. Henry works Tom hard, seemingly careless of his safety, an impression reinforced by talk of the other loggers.<br />\\" 'Henry's boy,' one said, as if Tom were hard of hearing.<br />'Doesn't treat him good,' said a second.<br />'Maybe it's not your business.'<br />'Maybe not, but he'll be six feet under, Henry doesn't watch out.' \\"<br />The man goes on to observe the crux of the matter: \\" 'Yep, he's a good boy. Not his boy though.' \\" Flynn is Henry's boy and he dotes on him, as does Tom. But Henry likes to drink and at the end of the day he sends the boys off with a man in a hurry who drops them at an unfamiliar junction and points the way to town. The boys are soon lost. \\"The road wound down through a stand of gnarled of swamp gum where the darkness was thickening, great drifts of it piling up in the undergrowth. They could hear rustling, whispering sounds coming from behind the roadside trees.\\"<br />Tom keeps his rising panic from Flynn, but when his attention is caught by a kangaroo lying by the side of the road, Flynn disappears into the bush. \\"[Tom] looked up and around, as if he might be up a tree, or hanging in the air, glowing, like a small moon, but he was gone, and there were only so many times you could look in the same places.\\"<br />Meanwhile, Grace, nubile daughter of the sheriff, Pop Mathers, idles away her afternoon with her best friend Darcy Steele, the bully's sister. Darcy is wild and mercurial, full of life and trouble, but the afternoon ends with her in desperate tears, refusing to tell her friend why. The next day Grace, still hurt by Darcy's rejection, goes along with the search party her father has organized for the lost boys. Exhausted by the bush and skittish from the predatory leers of Darcy's father, she glimpses a strange, unkempt tramp (who had earlier begged food from Tom's house), but says nothing to Pop.<br />Point of view shifts from the steady, sober sheriff and the search party to Tom, who finds Flynn, but not the way home. Both are growing weaker with hunger and fear, but Tom swears to Flynn he will get him home. Days pass and the search party is disbanded before Tom stumbles up to a farmhouse, alone, with no memory of what happened to Flynn. From Henry, Tom's homecoming gift is a severe beating.<br />The novel's second section opens in Sydney as Gibson, a hung-over, broken down detective, is called to the scene of a suicide - Darcy Steele. The case strikes a chord with Gibson whose own sister committed suicide years before, her note destroyed by the elements before her body was found. Darcy has left no note and Gibson follows the case to Angel Rock where Flynn is still missing and Tom, along with his shattered mother, has taken shelter with the sheriff's family. Gibson's questions probe at old wounds, and grubby secrets are dragged piecemeal from the murk of the past - religious fanaticism, obsessive love, angry rivalries, another young girl's long-ago death, old grudges.<br />Williams' gift for character is subtle and winning. He captures the doubts and indecision that go to the core of the most confident person. Everyone struggles, from sad, tormented Tom to thoughtful, kind Pop Mathers. The Steele family is almost too trashy to be believed, but their past makes their descent credible. Tom and Grace, becoming friends, feel their way, groping in the dark of a past kept hidden from them and the future of persons they have not yet become. Haunted Tom, desperate with guilt, knows moments of soaring joy, hope and affection.<br />Williams relies on atmospheric prose and emerging characterizations to create a human story fraught with tension. Shifting points of view heighten suspense, but it's the adult characters with their hard shells and undercurrents of menace, fear, and uncertainty, and the children with their promise and vulnerabilities that drive the narrative. For all its grim subject matter, \\"Angel Rock\\" is too human to be bleak.Everyone struggles, from sad, tormented Tom to thoughtful, kind Pop Mathers.

In &quot;The Men and the Girls&quot; it's an elderly spinster; in &quot;Next of Kin&quot; it's a young free spirit; in her latest, &quot;Girl from the South,&quot; it's a girl on one side of the intercontinental pond and a boy on the other.<br />Though her themes are familiar, English Trollope's focus on a traditional American family of the deep South is a definite departure and, mostly, an interesting, thought-provoking change.<br />Gillon Stokes, a daughter of the old South of Charleston, South Carolina, defies the expectations of her close-knit family in a series of ineffectual moves and new beginnings. She's not sure what she wants, just that it isn't what Charleston has to offer. As she explains to her boss in a small Charleston museum:<br />&quot; 'I want to know,' she said. 'I want to find something or someone that my mind just looks at and says, &quot;Yes.&quot; No messing.'....'Books used to do it. I thought I'd found the Holy Grail with almost anything I read. But it doesn't seem to work now. I question too much.'<br />'You know too much,' Paul said. 'That's what happens when you get older.'<br />Paul has arranged a job for Gillon in London. She goes reluctantly, but is soon taken up by Tilly, an arts magazine editor in a stalled relationship with Henry, a wildlife photographer unwilling to commit. Tilly and Henry's circle of young Londoners are footloose, adrift as Tilly sees it, fearful that they will all still be behaving as young singles in their dotage. But Gillon begins to gain a sense of belonging and happiness. &quot; 'It might be,' she told Tilly with some diffidence, 'because I don't feel I'm letting anyone down.' &quot;<br />But Gillon goes home to be with her sister for her first baby and, on a whim, invites disgruntled Henry (also looking for some undefined meaning in his life) to see South Carolina. To her surprise and discomfort, he turns up and is captivated by her family.<br />The first half of the novel explores the rootless, &quot;is that all there is?&quot; feeling of late youth with urbanity and wit. (&quot;He eyed Tilly up and down in the assessing way so peculiarly arrogant in plain men.&quot;) The second half delves more deeply into family dynamics and relationships in crisis with mixed results.<br />Oddly, Trollope contrasts the long tradition of family and community ties in Charleston with an unrooted, rather bohemian community in London. None of the young Londoners have close family though Gillon's preoccupations stir familial longings in Tilly and even Henry. Devastated by Henry's defection, Tilly turns to the aloof, near-stranger of a mother who left her and her father to go off with another man, a woman whose mistakes have made her wiser, though no different at the core.<br />But Trollope herself seems captivated by Southern ideas of family with its strong reliance on rules and expectations. Not that she romanticizes it, at least not much. Her eye is too sharp for that and her view of humanity too clear. All of Trollope's characters have flaws, from Gillon's warm and traditional Southern grandmother with her dark secret and regrets, to Gillon's psychologist mother, wise and understanding with her patients and defiantly undomestic and aloof at home, to Gillon herself, a mass of contradictions all bundled up in negativity and yearning.<br />These southerners sometimes fall into mildly disconcerting Briticisms but overall it's a refreshing exploration of American family and the Charleston attempt to absorb and subsume individual human flaws in a structure of expectation, manners and tradition. Reading it, you get a sense of Trollope, like Henry, bringing an outsider's fresh perspective to bear on a close study of human behavior as cultivated in Charleston.<br />Not that she neglects her London characters. The settings alternate as Tilly adjusts to abandonment, then (as she sees it) betrayal, by nurturing a new relationship with her mother - in parallel with three Charleston generations of mothers and daughters.<br />Trollope is, as ever, subtle, witty and perceptive. Gillon, however, is one of her more tiresome characters. As the protagonist she is likable enough, but too whiny. A character who gets just about everything she wants and is never satisfied. But American Trollope fans will enjoy her take on American family, and the writing is as observant, graceful and eloquent as always.cultivated in Charleston.<br />Not that she neglects her London characters.

As the book opens, two of her co-workers have been ambushed; one is dead, the other is in a coma. Authorities are calling it a robbery but Tempe knows their work is dangerous - many of those responsible for &quot;disappeareds&quot; are still in power.<br />Then Tempe's work is interrupted by a request to recover a girl's decomposed body found in a seedy motel septic tank. Four teenage girls - one of them the Canadian ambassador's daughter - are missing and Detective Bartolom&eacute; Galiano fears a serial killer.<br />The plot lines cross and re-cross. Tempe's new investigation is disrupted by a sinister official who confiscates the body. Parental secrets and the vagaries of teenage behavior complicate matters and the demands of the massacre site are heavy. Meanwhile Tempe's conflicted relationship with Montreal detective Andrew Ryan takes another hit from her growing attraction to Galiano.<br />Intricate, finely detailed scenes of forensic examination (particularly the septic tank recovery and study of skeleton detail) fuel the story, counterbalancing Tempe's sometimes mystifying penchant for thin-skinned irritability. The plot is almost confusingly complex, but Reichs (herself a forensic anthropologist) wraps it up nicely leaving a little teaser for her next book.	2002-08-19

Henry's diary reveals a cold man, occupied entirely with his work, but Martin's other researches - letters from his children, interviews with little known descendants - begin to turn up darker secrets.<br />Meanwhile, Martin deals with his own conflicted feelings over his wife's repeated miscarriages and anguish. Already in possession of a son, his marriage is enough for him and it bothers him that his wife wants a child so badly. His guilt and resentment mingle with the regret he feels over the bill which will erase hereditary seats form the House of Lords.<br />Following the family tree makes for some confusion at the outset, but Vine builds her story with plenty of uneasy menace and strong characters, pleasant and unpleasant.

You go back, even if it's only your first trip. Our brain is so full of American information that the country offers a never-ending sequence of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu sensations.&quot;<br />And yet, for us, the American reader, never has the familiar and everyday seemed so odd.<br />From shopping to dining out; from frequent flier miles to motels, from Independence Day to Christmas, from church services to yard sales, Severgnini plunges into America with gusto, noting our puzzling penchants for comfort (buying a recliner), air-conditioning (finally won over during a Washington heat wave), too many breakfast cereals and ice (resistant to the end). He moves from puzzled to enthusiastic, from appalled to amused and softens his criticisms with humor.<br />Shopping and bureaucracy get special attention. The mall: &quot;After one hour, Europeans are enjoying themselves like spoiled children. After two hours, they are scooping things up like refugees from the former Soviet bloc.&quot; The generous returns policy stimulates a heady urge to cheat (&quot;hand them back when the new model comes out),  disarmed by the amazingly helpful, cheerful and energetic service people vying with each other to offer the best deals and the friendliest service in the spirit of American competition. (This may surprise the average consumer, but in a postcript added in 2000 Severgnini notes that service has deteriorated.) American bureaucracy is even better: &quot;the greatest satisfaction....because, having trained on the Italian version, we feel like a matador faced with a milk cow.&quot;<br />Of course, he's not always so enthusiastic and while it's much more fun to be marveled at than criticized, or worse, ridiculed, (political correctness, euphemisms, an inability to spell), he keeps the tone light and clever and savages his own countrymen with equal enjoyment.<br />While the Washington setting is somewhat culturally limiting and it's amazing (and very American) how much has changed in seven years (this was the height of the Gingrich era and the beginning of the internet explosion), Severgnini's skewed European view (Spam?

There's the poverty, of course, but she knew about that. The average salary is $10 a month and Tattlin's packing list covers two pages and includes such things as 216 bars of soap and 48 liters of olive oil.<br />Partly Tattlin's fascination with Cuba is the feeling of being frozen in time; an industrial society stuck in the 1950s where cars and appliances slowly grind to a halt through rust and lack of parts and buildings crumble for want of maintenance. Partly it's the ingenuity of the Cuban people, bartering, scrounging, repairing and, of course, making the most of foreign tourists and residents. Workers in the tourist industry can earn two to three times the fixed government salaries of doctors, lawyers and professors. Partly it's the surreal feel of Castro's regime, liberalized during the mid-to-late '90s, but rife with uncertainty. A private, home-based restaurant, legal today, might be closed up tomorrow.<br />Tattlin lives in relative splendor, in a big house with plenty of servants. Her book takes its shape from the notes she took - short, often funny, often poignant, vignettes of daily living, from obtaining decent food (not at the state-run market), to Spanish lessons for the family and dancing lessons for her daughter and the servants' unwillingness to discipline her son or even tell her of infractions, like urinating in the library wastebasket. She describes the pleasures and hazards of travel in Cuba, hosting dinner parties for generals who know where the bodies are buried and, once, for Fidel - a frenzy of paranoid government prep with a curiously flat finale.<br />Most absorbing are Tattlin's connections with local people. She becomes involved in the lives of her servants, though she's near the end of her stay before she sees where several of them live.

A city created by waves of refugees and fortune seekers, vulnerable to attack, it has become a place focused on the energy of the moment, seducing newcomers with dreams of money and power, absorbing them in its push to the future.<br /> The book's primary narrator, English expatriate Tom Stewart, is first glimpsed in a brief prologue as an old man contemplating the South China Sea and a tranquil, if dubious, satisfaction: \\"Longevity can be a form of spite.\\"<br />The narration then shifts to the tart, sassy, modern viewpoint of Dawn Stone, looking back on her path to success from her arrival in Hong Kong in 1995 as a young journalist, fired with ambition and wide-eyed cynicism, to her involvement with the island's most powerful man, T.K. Wo.<br />For the longest section of the book, Stewart returns as a man of 22, embarking for Hong Kong in a spirit of adventure. The path of his life is set on that voyage when a loud-mouthed British businessman and an equally outspoken British nun make a bet that the nun's companion, a younger Chinese nun, Sister Maria, can teach Stewart Cantonese in the six weeks of their voyage.<br />An enduring friendship and unspoken passion is formed between the determined, idealistic Maria and the pliant, adventurous Tom. His newly acquired Cantonese lands him a hotel management job where he finds his niche in the teeming city and helps out Maria by hiring a boy  - Wo Ho-Yan - who has fallen into bad company in China.<br />But already war is in the air. Civil War between communists and nationalists in China and the Japanese invasion of China have sent waves of refugees to Hong Kong and Japanese invasion of the city seems inevitable. Rumors and pronouncements fly in panic and denial. From the Hong Kong perspective, the bombing of Pearl Harbor is \\"the good news\\" as it may deflect Japanese forces.<br />Stewart is recruited as a British spy and placed in a bank. When the Japanese invade the New Territories, where Maria has been sent, he impulsively goes to find her, and they spend two horrific weeks hiding from the Japanese and aiding refugees. Despite her pleading that Tom flee with her to China, he returns to Hong Kong and his duties to the British. Though  interned in a Japanese camp, the business of the bank must go on and Stewart is well placed to accept a radio from one of the city's gang leaders - brother of the boy he had tried and failed to help for Maria. When asked why he bothers to aid the British, Wo Man-Lee replies, \\"Maybe you win.\\"<br /><br />His old boss' health broken by the Japanese prison camp (where the author's grandparents were interned), Stewart takes over the hotel's management after the war as Hong Kong's fortunes rise again. Wo Man-Lee's gamble has paid off too and he is rapidly amassing a dynasty, aided by Hong Kong's appetite for debauchery and its easy corruption. Maria, however, has never forgiven him for corrupting his own brother. Stewart passes the years quietly and grows into old age on the sidelines as Hong Kong reels from the Chinese Cultural Revolution and panics over the coming 1997 handover from the British to the Chinese. Stewart's Quixotic and increasingly difficult adherence to a stubborn principle is a mystery to the narrator of the novel's final section, Matthew Ho, a businessman we met briefly through Dawn Stone, who is instrumental in the novel's conclusion.<br />In one of the books' many ironies, a place with so much history - colonization, invasion, waves of desperate immigrants, its volatile position between China and Britain - dwells only in the present, driven by the insatiable pursuit of money and commerce. Chance plays a major thematic part - if Dawn had missed any of her big breaks, if Stewart had embarked on a different ship, if Ho had missed his flight. And irony informs the structure of the novel, leading to a quiet, masterful, inevitable bombshell of an ending.<br />Lanchester's writing is assured, traditional. The story is sweeping and tumultuous yet told in a mannered, reflective, personal voice. And Lanchester's (\\"The Debt to Pleasure\\" and \\"Mr. Phillips,\\" both prize winners) Hong Kong is as vibrant, exotic and ruthless a city as ever seduced an immigrant.erent ship, if Ho had missed his flight.

But the real draw in this first novel by a health-care attorney is the inside view of fraud, greed, lousy doctors and covered-up mistakes in our healthcare industry.<br />When Shoreview Hospital's CFO dies on the operating table due to a series of equipment failures and medical judgment errors, Karen Hayes is hard pressed to keep the hospital out of the lawsuit. Especially when she uncovers evidence that the victim was on the verge of exposing a huge fraud involving a clinic affiliated with the hospital.<br />A variety of subplots involving surgeon arrogance, drug-addicted doctors, sexual assault of patients and greedy administrators serve to show the strange and narrow view of hospital liability as well as complicating the murder plot. There are some flaws in the resolution, but likable Karen and her professional conscientiousness bode well for future books.	2002-07-22

The FBI throws a fit at her mishandling of the crime scene - and they don't even know about the tobacco tin. Manuelito turned it over to Chee after finding some gold dust in with her seeds.<br />Chee goes to his old boss, retired Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn, whose interest is already piqued by the dead man's collection of papers relating to a mythical gold mine which harks back to an old case. Wealthy Wiley Denton, obsessed by that gold mine, shot a con man who tried to rob him when his con went bad. Open-and-shut save for one thing. Denton's young wife went missing the same day. People said she was in league with the dead con man, but to Leaphorn it never quite fit.<br />Manuelito figures prominently in Hillerman's well-constructed plot, as she, Chee and Leaphorn each follow separate threads. Especially elegant is the convergence of Manuelito's tribal sourcing and Chee's police work; their complementary methods dovetailing to further the plot,  their own complex individuality and their romantic attraction. But the case isn't solved until Leaphorn unravels the mystery of  the ghost wailing heard on the night of the original shooting by some kids trespassing on the spooky abandoned ordnance depot where it all builds to an atmospheric, suspenseful and chilling climax. This is award-winning Hillerman at his best.	2002-07-22

A tip from the missing boy's sister leads to the unraveling of a bleak, sordid family history.<br />Bosch's burgeoning romance with a rookie cop, the suicide of an early suspect and a dogged search through the wreck of the boy's family and the dead suspect's life move the story through numerous twists, dead ends and false leads, all of them bleak. Edgar award-winner Connelly leads the reader through little-known by-ways in Hollywood fringe work as well as the enclaves of the rich and the tucked away shanties of the down-and-out.<br />A devastating cop shooting with some decidedly weird aspects throws the reader - and Bosch - for a loop. But the mystery's unexpected solution is vintage Bosch - a sad, too human story, exposed by dogged perseverance and luck. As always, the writing is excellent; gritty and LA atmospheric with pitch perfect dialogue. Not Connelly's best, but still top-notch.	2002-07-22

And doesn't let go until the final, riveting scene in this dark, emotionally and politically charged thriller.<br />The trussed up woman is Orla McLeod, undercover cop, and the attempt to infiltrate crime boss Tord Svenson's operation ends disastrously with the torture death of her partner, Luke. Now, 9-year-old Jamie Buchanan is a target and Orla's tightly knit, specially trained team, takes him to her childhood home in the highlands. It's a magical place to the boy, a vision of snow and open space, but to tightly wound Orla it's a reminder of all she lost in the assassination of her father.<br />Sudden violence counterpoints the boy's shy awakening, moments of unspoken intimacy between the team members, the quiet wisdom of Orla's mother and the secrets buried in the past and concealed in the present. The tension works around the unpredictable and brutal attacks and the sense of mistrust - Svenson is getting inside information from someone, somewhere. The violence is highly sophisticated - Tord is no common criminal, but a wily phantom with access to the latest technology and trickery - and Orla's team are equally savvy, attuned, and equipped.<br />Scott's (her first novel \\"Hen's Teeth\\" was shortlisted for the Orange Prize) spare, nuanced writing (reminiscent of Denise Mina) complements her taciturn protagonist and gritty story, keeping it from seeming over-the-top despite the graphic ingenuity of the violence.	2002-07-22

The first scene is young Ugo's memory of his mother's death during a plague epidemic. Coughing up blood, boils under her arms, \\"Her eyes had sunk into her head, her teeth were rising up from her gums. Everything I loved about her was slipping away in front of my very eyes so I clasped her hand tightly so she would not vanish completely.\\" Rather than let the plague claim her, Maria DiFonte hangs herself from a tree while her young son watches in helpless horror.<br />A few years later there's famine and Ugo's unpleasant father gives the little food they can scrounge to his favorite older son, Vittore, a most unpleasant young man. Describing their shepherding duties, Ugo concludes, \\"Anyway, compared to Vittore I was a saint. Whenever the sheep saw him coming, they would run the other way.\\"<br />At 14, he left home to find work, fell in love and lost his beloved in childbirth. All this before the story even gets going. Surviving bandits, drought and more famine, Ugo is nearly struck down by the local duke for impeding his stag hunt, but his 11-year-old daughter Miranda's pleas for mercy help sway the duke to take Ugo on as his new food taster. Being of prodigious appetite in all things, the duke's table dazzles.<br />\\"The smells invaded my nose, they captured my brain, they seduced my stomach. Years of hunger which had become part of my flesh, pangs of starvation which had burned into my bones awakened with so great a cry that I had to clutch the wall or I would have thrown myself at a servant who was passing by carrying a leg of mutton.<br />Unfortunately, Ugo witnesses the fate of the previous food taster and the sudden plenty is ruined for him. Besides, the duke's paranoia and brutality have earned him so many enemies that poisoning is a real possibility. Enchanted by the delicacies that now form his livelihood, Ugo indulges in transports of poetry any food writer would envy. Alas, food remains dead to him.<br />Being a quick study, terrified Ugo is soon scheming and bargaining like everyone else to preserve his place, his life, and his daughter's safety. For a promise to protect Miranda, he secretly betroths her to a grubby, undersized kitchen boy, Tommaso, who was born in the palace and knows its ways. But the marriage is four years off and Ugo has numerous other possibilities in mind.<br />As time passes Ugo's fears do not lessen so much as fuel his survival skills, although his cleverness surpasses his judgment on several notable occasions. As Ugo careens from mishap to disaster to near-escape, caught half-wittingly in various palace intrigues, Elbling anchors his satire in the details of daily life, particularly the contrast between rich and poor.<br />Describing the servants' meals: \\"For every breast of quail or capon served at the banquet, we were given a beak or a talon. For every goat leg, we were given a hoof.\\" Peasants live at the duke's whim - their livelihood, happiness and life itself dependent on his moods. Cold, filth, hunger, superstition and disease are the peasant's milieu but even the nobles are subject to plague and lice and a modicum of constant discomfort in the midst of decadence and arrogance. Life is cheap and plenty of it is lost in the course of Ugo's memoir.<br />There is nothing particularly subtle about the characterizations, but they ring true to Ugo's viewpoint. The duke is coarse, rapacious and without redeeming features; Miranda is loving but spoiled, her headstrong defiance nearly their undoing, and Ugo is disarmingly honest, yearning for the father's love he will never have, falling prey to court habits of intrigue and willing to sacrifice his life for his (often ungrateful) daughter.<br />Screenwriter Elbling's (\\"Honey I Blew Up the Kids\\") debut is funny, fast, visual and gritty.<br />:tty.<br />:	2002-07-08
1491720:US	52774618	R2GDEX4FMGDRTP	1573929727	325985161	Into the Buzzsaw: Leading Journalists Expose the Myth of a Free Press	Books	5	26	27	N	N	Behind the big stories; news to scare us all	The eighteen essays in this book will dismay even those who have watched investigative journalism co-opted on TV by talking heads and road accidents or who look up from a newspaper story with more questions than answers. The contributors are distinguished career journalists, most of them award winners, most of them gung-ho about journalism - until their run-in with the buzzsaw of corporate or government displeasure. They may not persuade you (though most probably will) but they will make you think.<br />Taken individually the essays are emotionally charged, well-organized expos&eacute;s of  blunders, greed, incompetence and ruthlessness. Taken as a whole the book paints a depressing picture of the state of big, mainstream media. Expensive investigative journalism is the first to go in a corporate climate where profit stands above the public's right to know. Beholden first to the bottom line, media giants are also swayed by advertising dollars, government intimidation and fear of lawsuits. And the book paints a disturbing picture of the lengths our government and corporate giants are willing to go to quash negative stories.<br />Most of these stories are familiar: the investigation of TWA flight 800, the CIA and drug running/ assassinations/ incompetence, civilian Koreans massacred by US troops, MIAs in Vietnam, and the election of 2000. On the corporate side there's rapacious DuPont, bovine growth hormone, and the state of psychiatric hospital care.<br />Which story is the scariest? Well, everyone eats so Monsanto's push to get bovine growth hormone into all our milk comes to mind. Jane Akre details the process (i.e. the longest test for long-term human toxicity lasted 30 days on 30 rats - and although the FDA was told there were no adverse effects, one third of the rats suffered cysts and lesions) and then the demise of her story, orchestrated by Monsanto lawyers and abetted by her station's new owners, Rupert Murdoch.<br />Or how about Michael Levine's (former DEA undercover operative, turned author and journalist) surreal but all too believable piece on long-term CIA involvement with politically expedient drug runners and killers, which segues neatly with Gary Webb's piece on CIA collusion with Contra drug dealers who introduced vast amounts of crack to gangs in South LA who then spread it to the rest of the country. Remember that one? Discredited? Gary Webb tells how and why and he's very believable.<br />But the saddest, most chilling story of all is the case of returning Vietnam POW Bobby Garwood who was vilified and court-martialed in 1979 as an enemy collaborator because his story conflicted sharply with the government line that all POWs and MIAs had been accounted for. Writer Monika Jensen-Stevenson spent 20 years working to clear Garwood's name and her account of our government's deliberate, well-orchestrated destruction of a loyal, traumatized soldier would be hard to believe if it wasn't so well-documented. Memorial Day 1998 Garwood was embraced by three Medal of Honor winners and honored at the Vietnam Memorial but, though network cameras were present, the occasion never appeared on the news.<br />Kristina Borjesson offers a comprehensive piece on the investigation of TWA flight 800, the Paris-bound plane that exploded off Long Island in 1996. You don't have to agree with her conclusions to be convinced of an investigation thoroughly botched by FBI incompetence, turf wars, government spin and outright lies.<br />Some of these essays get a boost from the revelations about FBI and CIA bungling revealed since September 11. But why did it have to take an event so horrific to make news out of what so many already knew?<br />The essays are well-written and buttressed with loads of facts and sources, many of them checkable by interested readers. Names are named, which in itself is unusual for today's news stories. Each essay is prefaced with a short, impressive biography of the writers, many of whom have written books about the stories that consumed their careers. Many lost their jobs; some, like April Oliver, the CNN producer whose nerve gas story was famously retracted, had their reputations destroyed.<br />This is a book for anyone interested in what goes into a well-researched investigative story, for anyone who thinks it can't be true if it doesn't make the news, and if it does it is, for anyone who wonders why some stories never get legs (the state of our food, the state of our prisons), for anyone who wonders why some stories won't go away (OJ, Monica), for anyone who's noticed that soft interviews with government officials and elected representatives have apparently replaced hard digging, for anyone who would like to be better informed about the world.e stories that consumed their careers.

When a well-dressed Hawaiian man washes up dead on the beach at Honolulu, disrupting the women's morning fishing, Eva Hanson - the only white woman - is drafted to report the news to the police. Eva, on her own and far from her native Norway, living as a fortuneteller under the stolen name of a dead woman, agrees reluctantly and only because her roommate, Lehua, saw her slip a jade necklace off the dead man and into her pocket.<br />But the body is missing when Eva returns with the police and her worst fears are realized when the police - accompanied by a white political type - come knocking the next day, asking about her connection to the dead man. Upstairs a Royalist rebel hides, given shelter by Lehua. Though frightened and angry, Eva resists the police questions, shelters the fugitive. She is being drawn in despite herself.<br />Though her hard life has made her cynical, Hawaii seemed to offer a new start. \\"There was an orphanage for Hawaiian girls across the street, and old whalers next door with a pet rooster. There was the Widow, locally famous for outliving all her husbands and winning the orchid show every year for the last twenty-two years, and a shamisen player who made enough racket to drive away the living as well as the dead.

Sailors blame the missionaries, the missionaries blame the opium dealers, sugar cane planters blame the rulings of the legislature, and the legislators blame the end of the American Civil War; which poured Southern sugar back into the market.

The suits with the proposition seem like hopeless amateurs, but theft is Meehan's livelihood and theft is what they want.<br />Westlake's trademark caper humor takes on dirty-tricks politics as Meehan agrees to retrieve a video tape that could destroy the president's re-election hopes. With the help of his court-appointed lawyer - a sharp woman with none of Meehan's aversion to firearms - and a couple of colleagues, Meehan dodges the opposition and goes after the goods.<br />There are plenty of twists and turns along the way and plenty of laughs at the expense of Washington types. Meehan, a recidivist and autodidact (as his lawyer dubs him), is no Dortmunder, but he's a highly engaging fellow with his 10,000 rules and his odd patches of knowledge.

Insisting to the police that he hardly saw Sylvie that summer, he falls under increasing suspicion as the web of lies begins to unravel.<br />Between interrogations, frazzled conversations with his wife, brusque exchanges with his country doctor brother, sympathetic advice from the doctor's wife (and his former business partner's sister), and cut-throat buy-out negotiations for his family glass company, the reader learns that Hugh was obsessed by Sylvie, betrayed by her and without an alibi.<br />But Hugh's wife, Ginny, and his brother and sister-in-law cover up for him so thoroughly that Ginny is arrested instead. Unable to cope with his business reversals, Ginny has been tearful and touchy all summer, possibly unstable, even suicidal. Murder is not out of the question.<br />The betrayals mount as the psychological tension builds. Suspicion cripples intimacy and stifles communication, undermining a deeper core of strength and resiliency which adversity has uncovered in their marriage. Francis (\\"Deceit\\") ratchets up the suspense as the atmosphere grows more claustrophobic and the secrets crawl out of dark corners. Veteran mystery readers, however, will see the solution coming and may be a bit disappointed in Hugh.	2002-06-15

From the first moments of shock through the months of grinding frustration and grief, Diamond learns what it is to be on the receiving end of impersonal police professionalism.<br />Devastated as he is, Diamond knows they're right to take him off the case - he can't even bear the casual, distancing language of murder scenes and grief has made him numb and slow-witted and consumed by guilt that one of his collars killed her in revenge. Why else would anyone kill kind-hearted likeable Steph, the sunny antithesis to his mordant personality? But when the revenge theory fizzles, Diamond himself is fitted for the frame and he doesn't like it one bit.<br /><br />Lovesey does a superb job of portraying Diamond in extremis. The outrage as what he has done to countless others is done to him - the hard-nosed intrusion on private grief, the exposure of every tic and blemish and tiny secret, the shame and horror of suspicion - all mark him indelibly. The plot is equally well-constructed, replete with plausible dead-ends and red herrings and one big, awful question - why was Steph in the park at all and who is the \\"T\\" she went to meet? Operating outside the official investigation and hampered by the lack of official resources, Diamond reaches the devastating solution through a combination of sharp observation and intimate knowledge of the victim.<br />A bleak and masterful novel which leaves the reader wondering what repercussions will follow in future Diamond novels. The man is irrevocably changed - how will it affect his work? Will gruff, blunt Diamond become more sensitive to the feelings of suspects? And, of course, romance is now a possibility.	2002-06-15

The authors also bring back enigmatic FBI agent Pendergast to lead a team consisting of archaeologist Nora Kelly (from &quot;Thunderhead&quot;) and her boyfriend, borderline obnoxious news reporter Bill Smithback (&quot;Relic&quot; and &quot;Thunderhead&quot;).<br />But the horror originates outside the museum on a construction site where the bulldozers uncover a charnel house of bones, a 19th century basement where young workhouse residents were butchered most horribly. And things get curioser when the killings start up again - same m.o. but surely not the same killer?<br />Kelly's analysis of bones and clothing and some research in the museum's grand and musty stacks and archival storage suggests a motive for the serial killings that is as fantastic as it is horrible.

The authors also bring back enigmatic FBI agent Pendergast to lead a team consisting of archaeologist Nora Kelly (from \\"Thunderhead\\") and her boyfriend, borderline obnoxious news reporter Bill Smithback (\\"Relic\\" and \\"Thunderhead\\").<br />But the horror originates outside the museum on a construction site where the bulldozers uncover a charnel house of bones, a 19th century basement where young workhouse residents were butchered most horribly. And things get curioser when the killings start up again - same m.o. but surely not the same killer?<br />Kelly's analysis of bones and clothing and some research in the museum's grand and musty stacks and archival storage suggests a motive for the serial killings that is as fantastic as it is horrible. To say more would spoil the fun of getting there. The authors steep their story in the scientific curiosities and crackpots of the last century and the historic sites they occupied.

Meanwhile, a private collector has obtained a holy relic concealing a vial of  1st century blood, which he opens, unleashing a doomsday plague upon the world.<br />Swift, trying to save a remote Himalayan Neandertal discovery from Ochs' plundering, survives a murderous attack only to be cast in jail when he drags himself out of the mountains. When the guards abandon his Tibetan prison in the midst of the plague, Swift begins his odyssey back to his daughter in America, through emptied countryside, across Siberia and to Alaska. Meanwhile, new labs at Los Alamos hunt for a vaccine by cloning humans from Year Zero - crucifixion victims who may have antibodies for a less virulent form of the virus.<br />Searching for Ochs, Swift finds his way from the Smithsonian to Los Alamos with a collection of first-century relics. While nobody seems to have any great regard for the human rights of the crucified clones (whose memories of their past lives and death are intact) Swift joins forces with a 19-year-old compassionate genius against the Ochs faction and starts getting to know the clones.<br />It's all a bit more complicated, but the varying points of view keep the flow organized and easy enough to follow.

Casey Kight found his vocation the day of his parents' funeral when his only solace was the comfort of the Morton-Albright Funeral Home. Twelve years later, on his 21st birthday he's still eager.<br />The boss puts him in the embalming room to test his mettle and if you last with Casey through chapter two's graphic descriptions, chances are you'll stick with this funny, zany and, yes, heartwarming debut through to the end. Casey's ambition is whetted by the experience - he can't wait to try it himself and everyone agrees he's the perfect match for the boss' daughter, Natalie, whose highest compliment is \\"deathy.\\"<br />The unfocused plot is all over the place - the love story (which involves teaching embalming techniques to Natalie, barred from the business by her sex), a hostile takeover bid by an unscrupulous conglomerate, a wise ghostly presence and nasty human ambition. But Kight's naïve, well-meaning voice strikes just the right note and the core is the funeral industry itself - from the techniques, tricks and practical efficiencies of a job well done to grisly industry abuses certain to strike horror into any beating heart.	2002-05-30

Intent on proving that she, a young, single woman, can go anywhere she pleases, she keeps setting the bar higher.<br />In Africa, 1992, age 20, she decides to cross war-torn Mozambique on the lawless, mine-riddled road known as the Bone Yard Stretch. Natives and tourists alike point out the dangers, but Salak convinces a reluctant trucker to take her. A former runner with Olympic aspirations, when the inevitable happens Salak manages to escape her captors. &quot;No one knows where I am....If I died here no one would ever know.&quot; Guilt stricken, she realizes that her &quot;self-indulgent, foolish trip&quot; has probably cost the lives of the men whose need for money induced them to risk bringing her.<br />Several years later, Salak is bound for Papua New Guinea with a vague plan to &quot;get from the south to the north of the country via the major rivers.&quot; Or, as she explains to a fellow traveler, &quot;Actually, I have no idea what I'm going to be doing.

This unsentimental memoir of a white African childhood on various hardscrabble farms from 1972 to 1990, amidst periods of \\"unrest,\\" including Rhodesia's long struggle against white rule, captivates as it horrifies. With humor and unflinching honesty, Fuller immerses the reader in the welter of smells, searing heat, torrential rains and myriad dangers from man, animal and plantlife.<br />Her opening:<br />\\"Mum says, 'Don't come creeping into our room at night.'<br />They sleep with loaded guns beside them on the bedside rugs. She says, 'Don't startle us when we're sleeping.'<br />'Why not?'<br />'We might shoot you.'<br />'Oh.'<br />'By mistake.'<br />'Okay.' As it is, there seems a good enough chance of getting shot on purpose. 'Okay, I won't.' \\"<br />With these few lines, Fuller captures her tone - fluctuations of fear, bewilderment and humor. Her story is told primarily in present tense from her childhood point of view, though she skips around in chronology in order to follow theme threads: school, war, poverty, her mother's alcoholism and unpredictability. Her mother, Nicola, is ferocious, larger than life; a woman who can drag her daughter off without breakfast to spend the day on horseback rounding up wild cows or laze away a rainy day sprawled with both daughters on her bed reading. A woman whose manic-depressive tendencies were exacerbated by the heartbreaking deaths of three of her five children and exaggerated by alcohol. She's brave, unpredictable, loving and scary.<br />Racism in Fuller's world is a given, unquestioned by the child who sasses her nanny by threatening to fire her. Her parents are so poor they sell Nicola's rings each planting season and redeem them at harvest. Yet they have a houseful of servants and field hands. One day, her mother out, Fuller is bitten by something on her \\"downthere.\\" Despite her terrified wailing, her black nanny refuses to aid her. When Nicola finally arrives, she drags the child inside, exasperated, and warns her, \\" 'Never, ever pull down your shorts in front of an African again.\\"<br />Fuller concludes the incident: \\"That's how I remember Karoi. And the dust-stinging wind blowing through the mealies on a hot, dry September night....And the beginning of the army guys: men in camouflage, breaking like a ribbon out of the back of an army lorry and uncurling onto the road, heads shaved, faces fresh and blank. Men cradling guns. And the beginning of men not in camouflage anymore, looking blank-faced, limbs lost.\\"<br />There's a dark, manic hilarity to much of the book - the teenage Fuller crossing the border on her way to boarding school, her mother comatose from an all-night drunk. \\"Dad nods, smokes. I crush out my cigarette. We're both hoping Mum doesn't say anything to get us shot.\\" There are also gut-wrenching tragedies and moments of abject terror. The death of a sibling, her parents' grief-addled drunken driving, war. And there is Africa, a place of extremes, a place full of noises, smells and weather to make the rest of the world tame and drab in comparison, a place Fuller captures lovingly in her vivid, muscular, poetic prose.hild inside, exasperated, and warns her, \\" 'Never, ever pull down your shorts in front of an African again.\\"<br />Fuller concludes the incident: \\"That's how I remember Karoi.

Sweltering in his one good Yorkshire suit, Richard Field, newcomer to the special branch of Britain's Shanghai police force, is immediately plunged into the intricacies of political turf and criminal expediency when assigned to the vicious murder of a Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; prostitute.<br />Partnered by a seasoned, tough American cop, Field learns that the dead girl is one of a string of sexual slayings, all Russian prostitutes belonging to Chinese mob boss Lu Huang. Falling for another of Huang's Russian girls and bewildered by his department's complacency in accommodating the crime boss, Field ignores myriad warnings and plunges into Shanghai's underworld, determined to track the serial killer and bring down Huang.<br />Like a Russian nesting doll, the plot's layers split to reveal new layers. Cracks lead into every aspect of the city's ruling life, exposing the ruthless ascendancy of greed. Bradby packs in enough historical atmosphere to be dizzying - the rising communist sympathies, the frictions between British and French, exploited by the Chinese, the secret-harboring expatriates of colonial life and the flourishing lure of decadence, to name a few. Bradby occasionally grows overwrought melding his intricate plot with the intricate history, but both draw in the reader and the ending, while unlikely, is satisfying.	2002-05-06

When his medium-sized South Florida daily is bought out by a news-slashing, profit raking chain, Jack Tagger's ire, expressed at a stock holder's meeting, earns him a permanent spot on the obituary desk.<br />But I get ahead of myself. Hiaasen introduces his murder subject on the very first page - James Stomarti - aka Jimmy Stoma of Jimmy and the Slut Puppies, dead in a diving accident at age 39, seven years younger than Tagger. \\"It's an occupational hazard for obituary writers - memorizing the ages at which famous people have expired, and compulsively employing such trivia to track the arc of one's own life.\\"<br />Seeing a winding path to the front page, Tagger stealthily begins to probe, interviewing Stoma's young, ambitious widow, a singer cruising the latest trend and  looking for her second hit, Jimmy's sister, an internet stripper, and the surviving Slut Puppies. But when the Slut Puppies begin to die and Jimmy's sister vanishes, even his slime-ball publisher and fretful young editor can't derail Tagger's investigation.<br />Though more of a straight mystery than previous blackly madcap outings (\\"Sick Puppy,\\" \\"Strip Tease\\") and not all that mysterious, \\"Basket Case,\\" fueled by a highly likeable narrator, includes a few hilariously zany touches like assault by frozen lizard, and features a romance worthy of Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell. Morosely sardonic and self-deprecating and obsessed with death, Jack Tagger infuses the story with humor while working his way towards a particularly satisfying revenge.	2002-05-06

Protagonist Rosie, a freelance illustrator, longs for rural peace while her journalist boyfriend, Mark, loathes the very thought until opportunity - a witty column about country living - pushes him into it. Trophy wife Samantha hauls her hapless husband Guy off to the manor house in the same small village, mostly to escape the horror her radical decorator has made of her London home and make a trendy new splash in rural opulence.<br /> Sweet Rosie quickly makes friends among the eccentric villagers - the nosy postman, the broodingly handsome farmer, the cheerful pub owner - and begins gathering a collection of comical vignettes her blinkered and increasingly frustrated boyfriend dismisses out of hand. Meanwhile the horrible Samantha determines to throw a bash to top all bashes, with the village's reclusive rock star as her prize guest.<br />Holden has fun with arrogance of all kinds, particularly city provincialism and celebrity ego-mania and the rule of the trend. The satire takes center stage and the characters serve it well. Romance beckons and there's just enough surprise to make the predictable less so. A lighthearted romp, with a caustic touch.	2002-04-29

Books	5	8	8	N	N	Disquieting love story	In the final volume of his Canadian trilogy (\\"The Bird Artist,\\" \\"The Museum Guard\\"), Norman again uses the isolated wilds of winter Canada as catalyst and character in this atmospheric story of love, art and violence in 1926-27 Manitoba and Halifax.<br />The novel opens in the middle, with the narrator, young Peter Duvett, waking beside his lover, Kala Murie, to recall the previous night's dinner with her seething, menacing husband, Peter's employer, the photographer Vienna Linn. During dinner Kala had prodded her husband to produce a letter just received from a photography expert, engaged by wealthy British collector Radin Heur to pronounce on the authenticity of a \\"spirit photograph\\" Linn has offered for sale. The photograph shows the souls rising from three \\"Esquimaux\\" killed in a small-plane crash. A crash that Kala, we learn, only just survived. And believes her husband caused by sabotaging the plane in order to kill her.<br />In this first chapter, Norman plunges the reader into a tantalizing story of intrigue and adultery, made powerful by the subtle, vicious manipulations of husband and wife and the passive wariness of the narrator. \\"It all but made my skin crawl, the civility.\\"<br />Peter, though a photographer's assistant, is no photographer and has no ambition to be one. Instead, Peter makes up captions, obsessively. \\"So that, for instance, if I left my raincoat inside on a rainy day, I would immediately think, MAN WHO FORGOT RAINCOAT STANDING ON STREET.\\"<br />Peter is also aware that his situation is precarious, fluid, temporary. \\"The foretaste of regret. I was convinced that I was building up such an archive of memories - all these various views of Kala sleeping - that I could never get them out of my mind. And where would that leave me, should it happen that we didn't stay together? I'd suffer one of Miss Houghton's hauntings, except without any photographs involved.\\"<br />Miss Houghton is the author of Kala's favorite book, her professional Bible, \\"The Unclad Spirit,\\" devoted to the investigation of spirit photography and quoted frequently in the course of Peter's narration. \\"A spirit photograph is one in which someone whom Miss  Houghton called the 'uninvited guest' was present.\\" Uninvited, often unwanted, always dead: an estranged spouse, a debauched uncle, a secret lover. Kala lectures on spirit photography and Miss Houghton and it was in this capacity Peter first encountered her on his arrival at a rustic, nearly deserted hotel in Churchill, Manitoba. Her audience consisted of three Eskimos and her husband - or husband-to-be, as it was their wedding day.<br />The pair have an extended history, though, and Peter begins to learn about it on his very first night, as Kala celebrates her new marriage by coming to his bed. It is not long before he discovers that Vienna Linn is in hiding from the collector Radin Heur, who pays in advance for grisly accident photographs. Heur had, it seems, paid for a photographic record of a train wreck, but Linn botched the wreck and spent the money.<br />The spirit photograph of the airplane crash is Linn's inspired ticket out of  claustrophobic exile in Manitoba, where winter is one adversary who can never be bested. As his wife recuperates from her injuries with Peter by her side, Linn abandons all pretense of normal civility (the locals no longer worth the effort) and holes up in his dark room, preparing his masterpiece of spirit photography.<br />The understated tension builds as Linn establishes contact and the trio leave for Halifax to make the deal. Once in the city Linn re-exerts his social powers, charming the police and the landlady, while Peter sinks back into the grief and anger over his mother's tragic death which drove him to leave Halifax in the first place and events build to a discordant, crashing, crescendo.<br />Some readers may find Peter a too-passive narrator, intentional though it is. It is difficult to identify with a protagonist who makes you feel like shaking him from time to time. Yet Peter works his passivity like a weapon and Norman's unaffected simplicity, carefully crafted to heighten the chilled atmosphere, makes the whole thing work within the framework of the melodramatic plot.haking him from time to time.

There she was saved by pollution, for the river was already so laden with debris that nothing more could sink into it.\\" Fished out by a lamplighter who encourages her to regard the mystery of her birth as a special emancipation, and later raised in a convent where the nuns suspect a noble lineage, Madeleine's discovery of her actual parentage drives her to flee into \\"the cool, criminal indifference of the street.\\"<br />When she surfaces again, she has found refuge in the home (and arms) of M. de Fonce, the \\"demolition man\\" who has grown rich on the clean sweep of Haussmann's modernizing broom. De Fonce has schooled himself in the value and appreciation of  \\"the overlooked\\" and rich Parisians flock to his door for souvenirs of Paris' vanished buildings. And there, Haussmann meets Madeleine.<br />LaFarge's style is exuberantly Dickensian - full of painterly detail and droll quirks. The rounds of the lamplighter in old Paris are as vivid as the well-organized domicile of the Prefect or the subterranean warrens of the Paris library. Good natured ridicule is heaped equally high on the \\"celebrated decorum\\" of the court of the nervous Emperor Louis Napoleon and the flamboyantly artificial balls of the demi-monde. Much is made of hypocrisy, venality, greed and ambition. The serpentine plot winds through political and amorous intrigue, building to a frenzied crisis over Haussmann's grand plan to move the Paris cemeteries outside of the city and build a Railroad of the Dead.<br />His characters are richly and lovingly imagined, their foibles and fancies turned out with affectionate humor. Madeleine as a young convent girl fond of cats: \\"And Madeleine loved most of all that which was catlike in herself, in other words, that which achieved freedom without struggle and independence without loneliness, and for all that never had to go long without food.\\"<br />And De Fonce's approach to people: \\"Just as a building becomes rich in artifacts right before it is demolished, so de Fonce found that he was best able to exploit his connoisseurship of human character by imagining those he met as near their ends. The demolition man addressed himself to a banker as he would to a dying patriarch, and to a civil servant as to a soldier polishing his boots the night before a battle with the Turk....\\"<br />And Haussmann, so much the visionary civil servant, hastening to consult de Fonce on the question of multiple personalities upon reading of an ordinary shepherd who committed a grisly murder, then had no recollection of it: \\"The question, yes, of what Sorgel was, really? A shepherd? Or a foot chopper? Which is the main current and which the tributary? ...What would de Fonce think? Would the next century bring a science thatcould answer such questions, a sort of hydraulics of the mind?\\"<br />Impressively researched, beautifully written, humorous and wise, LaFarge's novel captivates the reader with love and loss and lingers over the mixed virtues of prudence, impulse, heritage and progress.could answer such questions, a sort of hydraulics of the mind?\\"<br />Impressively researched, beautifully written, humorous and wise, LaFarge's novel captivates the reader with love and loss and lingers over the mixed virtues of prudence, impulse, heritage and progress.	2002-04-15

There isn't a dud in the bunch. King chose the order of the stories by shuffling all the spades in a deck of cards plus the joker; and the serendipitous result, he says, created a nice balance between \\"the literary stories and the all-out screamers.\\" But these stories are already a nice balance in themselves: eerie and spare, chilling and vivid, full of strong voices and real characters getting a jolt of terror out of an ordinary day.<br />Like the horror writer in \\"The Road Virus Heads North,\\" who stops off at a yard sale on his way home.

Last year's Booker winner, Peter Carey's \\"The True History of the Kelly Gang\\" is a fine, entertaining, really good novel, but not a patch on \\"Atonement.\\" It's difficult to reign in the hyperbole in discussing this masterful, riveting, incisive book, but I'll try.<br />The story is told in four very different segments. The long first section is set on the Tallis family's comfortable country estate in 1935. At its center is Briony Tallis, 13 when the story opens, 77 at the novel's close. The second section jumps to 1940 for a graphic, heartrending depiction of the rout at Dunkirk from the viewpoint of Robbie, a family prot&eacute;g&eacute; and gardener's son, and the third returns to Briony, a trainee nurse in a London hospital, awaiting the Dunkirk evacuees. The last section, narrated by Briony, reflects on the past from the vantage point of old age.<br />As the story opens, Briony, the youngest of three children, and a prolific short story writer, has turned her hand to playwrighting to celebrate the coming visit of her older brother, Leon, and involve some cousins displaced by their parents' impending divorce. But complementing Briony's vivid imagination is a passion for precision and order and directing the recalcitrant, even manipulative cousins, into her meticulous vision proves an unwieldy challenge. \\"The self-contained world she had drawn with clear and perfect lines had been defaced with the vague scribble of other minds, other needs; and time itself, so easily sectioned on paper into acts and scenes, was even now dribbling uncontrollably away.\\"<br />While she is wrestling with this frustration, Briony views an incomprehensible scene from the window: her older sister Cecilia disrobing and jumping into the fountain while her old childhood friend, Robbie, looks on. The scene spurs Briony's imagination while the cousins rouse her ire and finally she abandons her play, ticket booth, posters and all and runs outdoors to take her frustrations out on the shrubbery. Wit and despair spark off one another in McEwan's acute portrayal of childhood intensity.<br />\\"It is hard to slash at nettles for long without a story imposing itself, and Briony was soon absorbed and grimly content, even though she appeared to the world like a girl in the grip of a terrible mood.\\"<br />But, tiring of her heroic fantasy with the nettles, Briony returns to herself, more freighted with melancholy than before. She decides to stand on a small bridge until something happens. With perfect irony, McEwan foreshadows disaster: \\"She would simply wait on the bridge, calm and obstinate, until events, real events, not her own fantasies, rose to her challenge, and dared to dispel her insignificance.\\"<br />The reader knows disaster is coming, but what, exactly, remains a mystery. Given Briony's dramatic capriciousness, it could be anything from murder to adolescent embarrassment. We know only that it reverberates down the years through Briony's life. And when at last it stands revealed in all its naked avoidability, McEwan jumps abruptly, jarringly, into the maelstrom of war and defeat.<br />Where the second section pins the reader in the horror and immediacy of Robbie's every intense moment, the first section roves from one viewpoint to another, riffling through the thoughts and feelings of each character and reflecting the characters in each other's eyes. There's competent, diplomatic Cecilia, flustered and preoccupied with Robbie's stiff behavior, and her mother, Emily, half bedridden, ineffectual and given to fusses but with a sense of herself as the matriarch with an internal finger on the pulse of the entire house, the cousins' bewilderment and insecurity, Leon's easygoing malleability, his tycoon friend's desire for a war to ensurethe success of his coated chocolate bar and ardent Robbie's class uncertainties and intellectual confidence.<br />Psychologically nuanced, there isn't a wasted word, though the writing is not spare. Every sentence furthers the reader's understanding while moving the characters forward in their own groping self-actualization and misapprehension. At the core it's a novel about atonement, about forgiveness and unforgivability, about how some things cannot be undone. It's also a novel about love and war, emotion and intellect, society and the often clueless world of one's own head, childhood and adulthood and the gulf between. It's a novel about the process of writing, of imagination, of misunderstanding. It's an ambitious beautiful book, which succeeds on every level.

Matthew's awakening - to take the place of a murdered ecologist - drops him in the midst of a roiling conflict between colonists and ship's crew. In the course of the journey, the crew's view of their mission has evolved and separated from that of their human cargo. They no longer wish to nurture a single colony but see themselves as explorers of the galaxy. The crew is insisting on the colony's success, despite misgivings from the colonists. Matthew, and a policeman awakened along with him, are expected to solve the murder and get the colony back on track.<br />The world itself is a strange place, it's flora and fauna based not on DNA but on a dual coding genome, which, as Stableford depicts it, changes evolutionary strategies and affects everything from feeding to reproduction. Animals with the ability to photosynthesize, for instance. Widespread chimeras.<br />Fleury, reserving judgment as he reviews all factions, explores the ruins of an alien city, beginning to piece together an overview of the ecology even before he and three other colonists set out on a river voyage of exploration, which introduces them to some of the planet's larger and more fearsome inhabitants. Along the way, Fleury also discovers the murderer's identity but it seems almost beside the point, as it is to the other colonists.<br />Fleury is a likable protagonist and the book easily stands alone, while the dual-coding biology is an entertaining brain teaser.	2002-03-25

Imagine a world in which you can send out clay copies of yourself, as many as required to handle life's demands. These \\"dittos\\" live only 24 hours, and are color coded for specializations: green for mundane household chores; black for intellectual concentration, gray for all-around versatility, white for serious partying. These are not robots; they are true copies, who inload their day's memories back into their original to achieve a ditto's only form of immortality, and allow their originals to lead lives of varied and risk-free experience.<br />Narrated by private detective Albert Morris and several of his dittos, Hugo and Nebula-award winner Brin's humorous and suspenseful story involves celebrity counterfeiting, battling business tycoons and murder. While Albert's dittos chase down various leads and blind alleys, getting themselves banged up, kidnapped, lost and abused, real Albert places his mortal body in interesting jeopardy by disguising himself as one of his own disposable dittos to pursue a lead into the mysterious disappearance of dittotech's founder. As the multi-layered plot proceeds apace from Albert's alternating multi-viewpoints, Brin builds a cohesive, thoughtful, playful picture of a dittotech society and its effect on work, behavior, risk, memory and ideas of individuality.	2002-03-25

But he's his own man as he proves once again in \\"Polar,\\" the story of Deputy Ray Tatum's (last seen in \\"Blue Ridge\\") search for a missing child. The novel begins with one man's mysterious transformation from slug to seer and proceeds through the odd and ornery collection of people that make up this small upland town in Virginia's Blue Ridge.<br />As is his usual habit, Clayton, the beer swilling slob, is passing his time in line at the local grocery mart regaling his captive audience with the particulars of last night's porno film, which \\"never seemed to work on Clayton in quite the way they were meant to as he was prone to get caught up in the stories\\". Suddenly, dumping his purchases before the cashier, Tiffany, (\\"saddled with a comprehensive ignorance of produce that qualifies her for duty in the express lane\\") Clayton ceases to be himself. \\" 'Please, sir, do call me Titus,' he said to Tiffany. 'Everyone does these days.' \\"<br />Clayton walks off without his change, which is strange enough, but then Ray Tatum notices Clayton's satellite dish is no longer pointed to the porno channel, stops to check on him and finds him babbling nonsensically. Until, that is, Ray touches his shoulder and Clayton makes a cryptic pronouncement about the missing little girl that almost everyone but Ray has given up on.<br />The child, Angela Denise, is the 3-year-old daughter of the book's most charmless character, Gloria Dunn, a self-absorbed Dayton, Ohio, sophisticate with a hapless would-be farmer husband. Gloria's disdain for all things rural and her instant celebrity after her daughter's disappearance catapult her into great success as a vitriolic talk-show host.<br />Long after the public has forgotten and Gloria Dunn has moved on, Ray continues to search. He's a quiet, melancholy, sensible man, haunted by the accidental death of his own small daughter and chiefly interesting to the town for his outspoken African-American girlfriend, Kit. Though he gets frustratingly little from Clayton, Ray continues to look in, ask about the child and, with his girlfriend's help, poke at the mystery of Clayton's transformation.<br />Meanwhile, Clayton's reputation grows when his new clairvoyance predicts a dog's demise - though only in retrospect. Citizens flock to his door with their questions and Clayton will often supply them with a nonsense phrase or two, which, more often than not, turn out - in hindsight - to be remarkably accurate predictions.<br />While Ray goes about his policing work, and drops in on Clayton to collect stray crumbs of cryptic information and view the progress of the image Clayton sporadically sketches on his chimney, a larger picture begins to emerge. It encompasses in serendipitous fashion the teenagers who grapple on lover's lane, the conscience-wracked husband on the verge of adultery and fatherhood, the septic tank con-man, the opinionated librarian and many, many more; full-blooded characters with quirks, foibles and plenty of relatives. Like Russell, the phone man, who carries around a kidney stone and shares the fabulous Clayton-inspired tale of its discharge with all and sundry until at last silenced by dire threats from Ray. \\"It seems Ray had scolded Russell into something like a vampire's ethics and standards in that Russell could say what he wished about his stone only once invited to speak.\\"<br />Pearson's language and his unblinkered affection for all but the most depraved of his characters drives the story.

Sam Train, a slow-witted gentle giant from the rural Deep South, rescues an Italian boy while under the liberating delusion that he is invisible. Carrying the boy, Train plunges deeper into the countryside, the head of a Florentine statue tied to his belt in a sack. Against their better judgment, the other three follow, unable to abandon Train to his fate.<br />Bishop Cummings, a cynical, self-styled preacher; Hector Negron, the Puerto Rican radioman and their only Italian speaker, and Lieutenant Aubrey Stamps, smart and ambitious and shakily in charge upon the death of their squad leader; all of them fail in their attempts to reason with Train. He's had enough of war.<br />\\" 'They gonna put you in jail, Train.'<br />'I hope so. If I could pay 'em to do it, I would.'\\"<br />And, as the boy clings to him, growing steadily weaker from internal injuries, Train grows more determined to save the child. A last effort to get back behind their own lines is thwarted by a German patrol and the men find themselves lost in the freezing rain and the harsh terrain of the Tuscan hills until at last they come to a tiny village, surmounted by a war-ravaged church, St. Anna's, where only a madman raves. The men are warily, grudgingly taken in by the remaining half-starved villagers.<br />Meanwhile the Germans' last massive effort is closing in around them. Though Hector succeeds in radioing headquarters, the men are instructed to remain where they are and try to capture a German for intelligence. The boy grows inexplicably better, but still clings to Train, speaking incomprehensible gibberish. The Italians' lives begin to intertwine with the soldiers', sparking friendship, love and distrust.<br />But the outside world cannot be kept at bay for long. The Americans learn of a massacre at St. Anna, brought about by betrayal and the Italian partisans arrive with a German prisoner, seeking the traitor among the villagers. The novel builds to an inevitably bloody climax, but remains true to its core of hope and the miracles, great and small, that fill every life.<br />McBride digresses freely, leading the reader into engrossing stories, some joyful, some tragic - the origin and history of Train's statue head; the bewitching of the old Italian villager, Ludovico, who long ago turned away from the adventure of love for the safety of domestic harmony; the ugly politics of race and the military; the making of a legendary Italian partisan. Each of his characters, including the secondary characters - the villagers, the partisan band, the black officers back at base and their white commanders - has a complex history.<br />McBride's dialogue is pitch perfect, and in it lives all the contradictions, fears, doubts and love that make up a person. His writing is rich with imagery and humor. There is ugliness aplenty, but this novel is more of a celebration of the men of the 92nd than an indictment of the white hierarchy.

As \\"Tishomingo Blues,\\" while funny, slick and sassy, is not. Leonard prefaces the book by expressing his intention, \\"to entertain myself: gather an odd assortment of characters, build a story as they bump heads, and see what happens.\\"<br />The characters include Dennis Lenahan, a traveling high-dive champion who sees his daredevil career coming to a close; Robert Taylor, a smooth-talking black man from Detroit who descends on Tishomingo, Mississippi, with a fancy car and a photo of a lynching; several thuggish, real dumb redneck crackers, and a scheming real estate developer, Walter Kirkbride, with an enthusiasm for Civil War re-enactments. Plus a couple of cops, straight and otherwise, a gangster, a scheming wife and a few henchmen.<br />As the novel opens, Dennis, readying his act at the Tishomingo Hotel and Casino, witnesses a murder from 80 feet up. So does Robert, perhaps, watching Dennis from his hotel window. The two, Dennis and Robert, strike up a liking and Dennis soon realizes Robert has plans for the Dixie Mafia (the redneck murderers) and they may include him. The plot makes its merry meandering way to the big re-enactment, with sidetracks to romance and star turns from secondary characters. The re-enactment, depicted with a verisimilitude which does nothing to lessen its strangeness, brings the whole big cast together with hilariously choreographed, if fairly predictable results.<br />The dialogue is snappy and quick and the characters practically step off the page. But after a while the repartee is wearing and the characters lack the heart to engage the reader. It's Leonard, so it's good, but not his best.	2002-03-03

And that inevitability is a central theme in George Pelecanos' warmhearted, gritty, streetwise series. While the music pounds, shouts and wails to fit his (and others') moods, Strange fights the ugly lure of street swagger by coaching a youth-league football team and instilling respect not only for teammates but the opposing team as well. Meanwhile he's wrestling his own demons and endangering his relationship with Janine (also his office manager) by massage parlor sorties.<br />Though the spotlight stays on Strange, Pelecanos switches viewpoints to include boys trifling with murder; Strange's young office helper, Lamar, a frightened kid trying to stay alive; Quinn, his life saved by the woman he's falling for, and others reflecting the streets that make up Strange's D.C. - pimps, broken drunks, young mothers, prostitutes.<br />The story, with its throbbing undercurrent of violence and wasted lives, generates plenty of suspense. Quinn ready to meet any insult with his fists, Strange working on a longer, slower, but perhaps more deadly fuse, work both sides of the color divide, mixing it up with dangerous, confident, soulless people, death an inflection away. Strange is an involvingly complex character, wise and impulsive, moral and angry, goodhearted, blunt, smart, sometimes annoyingly opaque. And Pelecanos brings D.C. alive as an edgy place of thriving, striving neighborhoods marred by drugs and easy money, hot cars and dead-eyed kids. A stand-out series.	2002-03-03

Hill's books are celebrated for sly and clever wordplay but this novel takes it further, making a word-puzzle central to the plot.<br />Two accidental deaths are proved murder by  \\"Dialogues\\" submitted to a local Yorkshire literary contest. The pieces contain clues, but the local police, including fat, crude, razor-sharp Supt. Andy Dalziel, and the refined and dependable Inspector Peter Pascoe, as well as several academic consultants, are baffled. Meanwhile young constable \\"Hat\\" Bowler begins to romance the attractive librarian Rye Pomona while finding numerous suspects among the sniping literati, except for one problem - they keep getting murdered.<br />Word mavens might follow clues to the solution, but Hill leaves the key hidden until the end. Intricately constructed, with well-drawn characters and diabolical murder scenes, this novel will dazzle puzzle fans. Those less in the know, like myself, may feel many of the sophisticated clues flying right over their heads.	2002-03-03

The timing of this latest Em Hansen mystery makes the novel already dated but no less enjoyable for that. When a moderate 5.2 earthquake hits Salt Lake City weeks before this year's Winter Olympic Games, the local geologists, including Hansen, get excited. But when the Utah State geologist is murdered, the FBI recruits Hansen to look into the geological state of things. Coping with chronic underemployment and a rocky romance with her Mormon cop boyfriend, Hansen jumps at the chance.<br />Reviewing maps and tramping the terrain, Hansen discovers that her newly adopted city is riddled with faults, which the city fathers have virtually ignored. Between complacency and corruption, numerous public venues - from housing developments and malls to the spanking new stadium where the Olympics' opening ceremonies are scheduled -  sit precariously on fault lines.<br />The murder investigation parallels Andrews' dire exploration of earthquake inevitability and its devastating effects on an unprepared populace. Greed, politics and religion wrestle with science in a story as much expos&eacute;  as mystery. An engaging and forthright protagonist, Hansen's narration is interspersed with other viewpoints - a corporate villain, his trained construction geologist and an ambitious newspaper reporter among others - which heightens the suspense and the novel's scope.	2002-02-24

Lawrence tells a crisp, fast-paced story, free of New Age philosophizing. Chase is a down-to-earth investigator who relies at least as much on her interviewing and research skills as on less tangible abilities.<br />The child, Matthew Fielding, is the son of a telecommunications mogul. There's money, of course, and business tensions, a relative who desperately wanted a child, some angry Eco-terrorists, a gung-ho sheriff's deputy who might be a firebug. Chase doesn't hesitate to seek help from the experts - police, arson investigators, even an obnoxious reporter - and her case proceeds along comfortably conventional lines with helpful boosts from energy auras, telepathic advice and fragmentary visions.<br />There are a few cliched characters (the brilliant and feisty female arson investigator, for one) but Chase is appealing and her talents believable. Fire ratchets up the suspense and the climax pulls out all the stops.	2002-02-24

Reuben, then, is sensitive to the miracles that serendipitously attend his father and nurses a sorrowful resentment that those wonders should be squandered on mending a torn saddle or healing a bad-tempered man when Reuben's lungs are still in need. A severe asthmatic, Reuben has never enjoyed the luxury of an unconscious breath.<br />Looking back from the vantage point of adulthood, Reuben narrates the momentous events of 1962-63 when he was eleven. His poetic, disarming voice, rich with the cadences of rural Minnesota, comes straight from the heart, captivating the reader from the first page. The middle child, Reuben admires his older brother Davy for his fearless confidence and skill and his younger sister, Swede, for her fearless intelligence and will. Reuben himself has numerous fears ( the creepiest being the dream gnome who steals his breath), but keeps most of them to himself. Their father, Jeremiah, is a man of scrupulous honesty, even temper and deep faith, whose wife left him when his faith undercut his worldly ambition. (This abandonment is one of the book's few flaws - the reasons are inadequate and, weirdly, the children seem to have no feelings about her whatsoever.)<br />  The story begins when Jeremiah, the school janitor,  rescues Davy's girlfriend from a locker room assault by two schoolyard bullies. The boys swear revenge and events escalate until the pair invade the Land home and Davy shoots them dead. The newspapers laud him as a hero defending his family, then later turn on him as a villain who murdered two underprivileged boys. When Reuben, puffed up for the audience and also mindful of his father's exhortation to be honest, presents evidence at trial which seals his brother's fate, Davy breaks out of jail.<br />Eluding the sheriff's posse, Davy becomes a hero again, the romantic outlaw of simpler days. Swede, steeped in the lore of the Old West, is beside herself with joy and begins to compose an epic poem of his exploits on the old typewriter she got for her ninth birthday. Only Jeremiah seems low, tormented by his love and fear for his son and his internal agonies over right and wrong. In the depths of winter a sign - an airstream trailer bequeathed to Jeremiah by a traveling salesman - sends them on a quest, a journey west to find Davy.<br />The kindness of strangers is offset by the dogged presence of the FBI agent who has sworn to track Davy, a man both sinister and friendly. But at last they seem to lose him in a blizzard where they find refuge with a rawboned woman who brings something to their lives they didn't know they were missing. As the story proceeds Jeremiah must weigh his chance for happiness against his duty. His torment and his joy, though only dimly understood by Reuben, provide a strong, unsettling undercurrent. For Reuben, too, is growing beyond pirates and storied outlaws, to learn the very real power of evil in the world and, in the end, to make his choice.<br />The story builds to a powerful, emotionally complex climax, but ends on a fantastical note, which feels more histrionic than satisfying. Despite this (not minor) disappointment, Enger's first novel is a thing of beauty. Enger's exceptional talent with language and character make this adventure, romance, and moral coming-of-age story one of the best novels I've read in a long time.e, Davy becomes a hero again, the romantic outlaw of simpler days.

A big Sherlock Holmes fan, Erzinclioglu shows how the life span and habits of blowflies, cheese skippers, scuttle flies and numerous other opportunistic insects help reconstruct events surrounding a suspicious death.<br />Like Holmes, the entomologist can examine a scene of chaos and decomposition and baffle the onlooker with his pronouncements. For the untrained witness, even the expert police detective, will not have noted the presence of one type of maggot and the absence of another, or the evidence of several generations activity or the accumulation of tiny pupae cases among the debris. \\"When one looks at a complex scene, with vast numbers of small objects in it, the human mind will notice only those things with which it is familiar. The rest will make no sense and will be ignored.\\"<br />Of course Erzinclioglu is not in the habit of making dramatic statements at the scene. He describes the painstaking gathering and labeling of specimens, the further examination of the body on the pathologist's table and the subsequent sorting and analysis of samples, which leads, most often, to a reasonably precise determination of time of death. As the pathologist cannot pinpoint time of death after about three days, this determination is the most important aspect of the entomologist's job.<br />Obviously this is not always easy - animal predation, weather, locality and other factors may complicate the scientist's work, and Erzinclioglu describes a few mistakes - his own as well as others, as he takes the reader through 25 years of criminal investigation. Mostly, however, his results concur with other evidence or provide essential leads, though not all cases are solved.<br />His anecdotal style takes us through case after case - the discovery of decomposed or even skeletal remains and the subsequent investigation of insect activity. Sometimes the body has been moved after death; occasionally insect evidence on a suspect may link him to the crime. Most often murder is not the intriguing mystery of fiction but the sordid story of the handyman bashing the old lady for her money, the husband disposing of the wife, the violent thief. But a few deaths are particularly haunting - the young suicide found four years afterwards in a filthy, rat-infested house used as storage for cloth bags, the air and floor filled with moths. The horrible image of the old man shown to have died of natural causes a week after the house he was lying in was boarded up.<br />Not every case concerns murder (or even death) and not every case belongs to Erzinclioglu. He describes the discovery of a skull in Tennessee in which a nest of paper wasps determined time of death. In New Zealand investigators pinpointed the origin of marijuana shipments from the types of insect remains found in the cannabis. He devotes a chapter to revisiting historical events in the light of insect evidence.<br />Erzinclioglu also muses on sociological lessons and observations from his long career - a chapter on mental pathologies involving insects, another on \\"broken lives,\\" another on the \\"ends and means\\" of investigation, exploring the sometimes overzealous tactics of police and prosecution.  He observes the stupidity of many criminals who seem to believe that the last place investigators will look is under their floorboards and opines that our times are more callously violent than even the days of public hangings and witch burnings.<br />Opinionated and enthusiastic, Erzinclioglu is informative and engaging, interspersing the grisly with the humorous, though there is more of the former than the latter. The sheer range of cases and types of insect evidence will fascinate anyone interested in crime and detection.activity.

1643390:US	52774618	R32N1RYUV1JIUT	0393020185	790320833	The Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry	Books	4	3	8	N	N	Sykes should stick to fact, not fancy	A celebrated geneticist who was in on the DNA analysis of the Alpine Ice Man and the remains of the Russian Romanovs (and the Anastasia pretenders), Sykes has written a provocative, enthusiastic history of mitochondrial DNA research and its importance in revealing the ancestry and movements of people.<br />Mitochondrial DNA, present in every cell in the body, is passed only from mother to daughter, unchanged except for random mutations. Though a woman passes mitochondrial DNA to all her children, only her daughters will pass it to the next generation. (Sykes briefly discusses newer research into Y chromosome DNA, which traces the male line).<br />The title of the book comes from its last section; Sykes' tracing of European lines back to seven \\"clan mothers\\" originating at different times and places during the last ice age. After a genetic discussion of how he arrived at these seven, the author devotes a chapter to each woman, describing the climate and terrain, then speculating on her life. Where his imaginings are based on archaeological research these chapters are fascinating; his fictional fights of fancy are less so.<br />The real meat of this book is in the first half, where Sykes discusses research leading up to the seven daughters. He begins with a great hook - his match of the 5,000-year-old iceman found in the Alps to a modern Dorset woman (of course he matches many others but since she is a friend, her sample has a name). He goes on to show how mitochondrial research traced the movement of Polynesian peoples (small mutations occur over thousands of years, providing a geographic timeline) outward from Asia, disproving theories which posited an American origin based on wind patterns and patronizing attitudes toward ancient sailing proficiencies. He uses mitochondrial DNA to prove the Asian origin of native Americans, and the African origin of Homo sapiens. And shows that Neanderthals are truly extinct, having left no trace of themselves in modern peoples.<br />Sykes' grandstanding and sharp little digs at rival scientists may annoy some readers, but they lend personality and gleeful human drama to the account. I found them highly entertaining and often illuminating in showing the effects of personality and personal challenge on science.<br />His work on European origins is a case in point, demolishing the theory that western moving farmers from the Near East supplanted the smaller population of native hunter-gatherers, becoming today's modern Europeans. Sykes' genetic research proved this not to be the case. Instead, the modern population can trace their ancestry back 20,000 to 50,000 years, back to the first Cro-Magnon, and Sykes has great fun discussing the resistance to his team's results and the hoops the scientific world required them to jump through.<br />But it's not just backbiting. Sykes shows how hostile questioning opens cracks in assumptions and forces scientists to back up their results with impeccable research. Scrutiny exposes a problem from all angles and sends researchers scurrying to create new testing methods to confirm findings. Sykes gets his digs in, but he does it by showing how science works.<br />The writing is anecdotal and full of infectious enthusiasm and Sykes has the gift of explaining science to the neophyte. Mitochondrial DNA may still make your head spin but you'll understand exactly how it works. Interested readers can check out Sykes' web site which even offers mitochondrial and Y-chromosome testing, for a fee./>Sykes' grandstanding and sharp little digs at rival scientists may annoy some readers, but they lend personality and gleeful human drama to the account.

As the country celebrates V-J Day and the end of the war, Roscoe finds himself weary of wheeling and dealing. Unmarried and still pining after his first love, who married his best friend, Elisha Fitzgibbon, Roscoe questions the meaning of it all.<br />\\"I have to change my life, do something that engages my soul before I die,\\" Roscoe tells Elisha, who observes that Roscoe has kept his discontent  hidden. Roscoe explains, \\"I have no choice. I have no choice in most things. All the repetitions, the goddamn investigations that never end, another election coming and now Patsy wants a third candidate to dilute the Republican vote. We'll humiliate the Governor. On top of that, Cutie LaRue told me this afternoon George Scully has increased his surveillance on me. They're probably doubling their watch on you, too. You'd make a handsome trophy.\\"<br />This statement establishes William Kennedy's mid-century Albany in the seventh book of his Albany cycle - a city run by a small, closed circle whose primary function is to maintain power, constantly besieged by similar cabals whose goal is to grab that power for themselves. The weapon of choice is the scandal, of which there are plenty to go around, real or manufactured. And the best defense is a ferocious boomerang of a spin, at which Roscoe excels. The reasons he wants to retire are the same reasons why he can't. Roscoe's life is inextricably entwined with the Democratic Albany machine and both Roscoe and his city are ailing.<br />Albany is run by a triumvirate of boyhood friends - Roscoe, Elisha Fitzgibbon and Patsy McCall, none of whom hold office. Hours after Roscoe announces his intent to retire, his friend Elisha commits suicide. Puzzled and shocked, Roscoe's political antenna tells him Elisha had a good reason, probably to do with protecting his family. He postpones his retirement to help Veronica stave off a nasty family scandal, his youthful hopes of romance rekindled.<br />As the Republicans position themselves for attack, and Roscoe plies his skills, Kennedy splices the teeming past into the melodramatic events of the present, history repeating itself with infinite variation. Roscoe's World War I experiences (and his first foray into \\"spin\\"), the numerous internecine battles among New York state's and Albany's democrats, the roles of big politicians like Al Smith and FDR and the big criminals like Legs Diamond, the opportunities of Prohibition and the ever-present dangers from muckrakers and power grabbers from outside the machine and feuds and jealousies within among the cops, judges, civil servants and vice purveyors who keep things volatile, all of it feeds the machine. The cast of characters is big and the novel's scope is vast but Kennedy engages the reader with his own fascination for history and ambitious, unscrupulous men.<br />Kennedy, an Albany native and winner of the Pulitzer for \\"Ironweed,\\" gives us a portrait of a man and a city, mirror images, both full of heart and wit and delight in clever scheming. Roscoe is Albany, his fate rooted deeply in the city's. His father before him was a cog in the machine and Roscoe's first steps were orchestrated by (and a tribute to) his father's ambitions. When Roscoe says he never had a choice, it's the truth. He can no more escape the clutches and drive of Albany than Albany can shed the machine that makes it run. As the reader recognizes this, Roscoe is driven to greater feats of political brilliance and sleight-of-hand. But no man can control the passions of others or the quirks of fate.<br />Kennedy's prose is as big and ebullient as his sprawling story. In Kennedy's hands Albany history has a legendary, mythic feel. Though the cast of characters and dizzying panorama of events sometimes taxes concentration, Kennedy's black humor, sharp irony and the perverse likability of rascally Roscoe continually enthralls, right up to the final irony of the perfect ending.ity of rascally Roscoe continually enthralls, right up to the final irony of the perfect ending.	2002-02-14

Frank's client, the high school principal and an old friend, has a married lover and Gus Marchand, the murdered man, had threatened to expose her. But Barbara's client, young Alex Feldman, despite scant evidence, is the prime suspect.<br />Born with a hideous facial deformity, he was denounced by Marchand, his neighbor, as the devil's spawn and a sexual predator. Alex's adolescent history of violent outbursts doesn't help. The son of shallow, beautiful people whose idea of sympathy was to hide him in his room, Alex is rescued after a teenage suicide attempt by Dr. Graham Minick, who takes him to live in rural Oregon. Now, 14 years later, (still with Minick) Alex is the successful author/artist of a pseudonymous satirical cartoon strip, a career which would be threatened if his identity was revealed.<br />Wilhelm frames a thoughtful, moderately suspenseful story of detection and legal maneuvering around a core of repression in the name of religion, bigotry, and instinctual aversion. Born with, basically, half a face, Alex inspires visceral hostility in everyone who sets eyes on him, a reaction Barbara, along with her co-workers and father, must overcome. With time and familiarity, the man emerges from behind the deformity. A sensitive \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" story, exploring the roots of violence in alienation and one man's lucky escape from a blighted life, Wilhelm's novel strikes a resonant chord. A credible plot, a smart, engaging protagonist and well-rounded secondary characters in this sixth Holloway novel add up to another success for the award-winning Wilhelm, author of the science fiction classic, \\"Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang\\" and \\"The Good Children.\\"	2002-02-04

But fun	Young San Antonio attorney David Owens wins a big divorce case and hopes it will attract some new business, though his wildest dreams didn't feature his next client, the First Lady - that's right, the wife of the President - who wants a divorce for the sake of her precocious young son.<br />Even Owens finds this preposterous and when his office is searched by sinister Secret Service agents who say the woman was an imposter, he's inclined to accept it. Until he gets a mysterious, plaintive email message, which brings him to Washington and into the White House. Intriguing? Outlandish? It gets better. Owens and a female Secret Service agent outwit various guards and technology to spirit the First Lady and her son out of captivity and off on a cross-country road trip. There's even a heavy-handed villain - a megalomaniac billionaire technology tycoon (a Darth Vader version of Bill Gates) with a direct line to the president, who he all but handed into office. Ridiculous? Certainly. But Jay Brandon keeps it all moving; juggling action, plot lines and characters for a rousing, suspension-of-disbelief entertainment.	2002-02-04

When the HMO's CEO, Tim Markham, dies after a hit-and-run accident and the autopsy determines it was a medical injection that killed him, his doctor, Eric Kensing, is the obvious suspect. Not only did Kensing vociferously protest the HMO's cost-cutting restrictions, the victim had also been having an affair with Kensing's wife. When the dead man's family is massacred and Kensing is placed at the scene, only Hardy continues to believe in his innocence.<br />Glitzky's determination to nail Hardy's client causes a rift between the friends, only partially healed when Hardy's fishing turns up a pattern of suspicious deaths at the hospital, which cannot all be laid at Kensing's feet. Lescroart's thorough research and skill in explaining the complex  tensions between HMO, hospital and patient keeps the story humming even as Hardy's increasingly cozy relationship with the mayor, prosecutor and police strains credibility. Though not one of his best, Lescroart's well-drawn characters - particularly the strong relationship between Glitzky and Hardy - and solid writing make this a fine read.	2002-02-04

His selections for the best travel pieces of 2000 (for this 2001 edition), reflect his seriousness of purpose, his sense of place and his eye for quality writing. &quot;It is not about vacations,&quot; he states in his introduction, and explains, &quot;travel writing at its best relates a journey of discovery that is frequently risky and sometimes grim and often pure horror, with a happy ending: to hell and back.&quot;<br />This book is not about places you want to go to. It's about the world, much of it remote, in its workaday, sometimes hostile, raiment. Taken from a wide variety of magazines and newspapers, presented in alphabetical order (with contributor notes in the back), these essays consider the reflective traveler's relation to unfamiliar places, people, and events.<br />There are contemplative journeys: Russell Banks' strange encounter at the top of the Andes; Scott Anderson's brotherly competition for dangerous destinations; Lawrence Millman's lighthearted sojourn on the Mediterranean island of Pantelleria; Janet Malcolm's search for Chekhov in the places he wrote about; Edward Said's grim &quot;Paradise Lost,&quot; recalling his idyllic childhood in the Lebanese hills, now buried in rubble.<br />There are anthropological adventures like Gretel Ehrlich's long dog-sled hunt with the Inuit in Greenland and there are adventures touched with politics and history, like Philip Caputo's travels among the man-eating lions of Kenya, Tim Cahill's trip to Ecuador's erupting volcanoes (and their villages) and David Quammen's winter search for the wolves in post-communist Romania.<br />Journalistic pieces tell us the things we don't know, the things we should know. Michael Finkel's &quot;Desperate Passage&quot; places him among a leaky boatload of desperate Haitians hoping for America, and Susan Minot relates a tangled, ugly history as she introduces us to children kidnapped by rebels in Uganda. Andrew Cockburn visits the &quot;new&quot; Iran, Patrick Symmes searches out the guerrillas in Columbia. There are portraits of places, politics and loneliness like Peter Hessler's story of the inept burglar on the China/Korea border and Susan Orlean's portrait of Khao San Road in Bangkok.<br />In a category all its own is Salman Rushdie's eloquent, emotionally nuanced &quot;A Dream of Glorious Return,&quot; the story of his first trip back to India since the publication of &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; twelve years before. His 20-year-old son, Zafar (who has never read his father's books) accompanies him and Rushdie, ebullient with homecoming rapture, attempts to see the country through Zafar's fresh (often appalled) perspective as well as his own. It's a piece full of joy and sadness and political tension, beautifully told.<br />There is humor in many of these pieces but hilarity is not Theroux's first interest. These essays will appeal to those looking for an armchair view of the world's niches, many of them ugly.

He number crunches all the words at the Republican convention into five sentences, explores the history and longevity of slang, the emotional power of words, the evolution of meanings.<br />Insightful and enjoyable, these soundbites help us see how language reflects us, as we are and as we prefer to see ourselves.	2001-12-30

One ends up dead, the other, Janet Taylor, finds herself facing possible murder charges. Detective Superintendent Alan Banks arrives at a scene of bloody carnage to find his serial murder case solved.<br /><br />The horrific, atmospheric opening scenes of Edgar award-winner Peter Robinson's &quot;Aftermath,&quot; set up the whole story - the themes of abuse and psychological damage, police accountability and politics and a host of nagging questions. How does a handsome, popular teacher like Terry Payne end up as serial killer of young girls and how did he lure them so easily? What did his beautiful, abused wife, Lucy, know about the atrocities in the basement of her own house?<br />The lines of the murder mystery interweave with the private lives of Banks and his team. Banks struggles with the news that his ex-wife is pregnant while Banks' on-again, off-again girlfriend, the ambitious Annie Cabot, is assigned to investigate Janet Taylor's culpability in the death of the serial killer and troubled psychologist Jenny Fuller profiles Lucy Payne, rekindling her attraction to Banks. Another victim of abuse, a neighbor, desperate to help Lucy, uses and is used by the media, garnering possibly dangerous attention. Meanwhile, one of the missing girls is not found in Payne's macabre basement graveyard.<br />Robinson draws the reader with his superb characterizations and thoughtful pacing. As always, his novel is as much about the world we live in - everyday realities and aberrant fringes - as it is about a particular murder. The tension builds to an explosive climax of split-second timing but the more leisurely twists, turns and missteps of the investigation and the investigators create a human drama that lingers in the mind.	2001-12-17

Jhan was forced to give up his own study of the illusionist's art when he came into his legacy - the guardianship of the tomb of Shah's great-great-great grandfather, a warlord  - a duty he had temporarily forsaken to save young Shah from a premonition of an early and undignified death.<br />Already this story of Shah's Indian sojourn and apprenticeship is fantastical, enchanting, exotic and hilarious and the rest of the book easily lives up to its stranger-than-fiction promise. Shah himself - the naïve foreigner, wide-eyed, sometimes arrogant, self-deprecating, tongue-in-cheek, observant but sometimes not observant enough, curious and determined - keeps us guessing. How much is real, how much is trickery?<br />The first of three sections of &quot;Sorcerer's Apprentice&quot; describes the background story and Shah's early travels in India visiting his ancestor's tomb and Hafiz Jhan and looking for Jhan's teacher, India's greatest conjuror, Hakim Feroze, in Calcutta. He is robbed by tricksters on the famously dangerous Farakka Express and interviews widows made outcast by a husband's demise, now clustered in the thousands by the sacred Ganges, waiting for their own death.<br />Finding Feroze by happenstance, Shah embarks on a grueling course for the second part of his story. He digs trenches with a teaspoon, sorts rice and lentils blindfolded, learns to regurgitate on command, reads voraciously. Feroze, dapper, aristocratic, diabolically demanding, wakes his student in the middle of the night to answer arcane questions while balanced, blindfolded, between two chairs.<br />Feroze also shows him the illusionist's tricks, exposing the secrets of spoon bending, plunging a hand into molten lead, stopping and restarting the pulse. He hands Shah a ball of tin foil and tells him it will soon become too hot to hold, which it does. Feroze explains the trick - a rubbing with mercuric nitrate.<br />&quot; 'Mercuric nitrate?'  I said. 'Isn't that incredibly poisonous?'<br />'Yes, as a matter of fact it is,' said Feroze coldly. 'It's lethal. The toxicity is the drawback of the trick. But that's irrelevant for now.'&quot; Somewhat worse is the trick of raising Shah's body temperature to 104 degrees.<br />At last the pupil is ready for his &quot;journey of observation,&quot; a trip across India observing godmen, healers and fortune-tellers; illusionists who pass their art off as miracle. Shah has already made smaller journeys around Calcutta. Guided by a resourceful rickshawalla, he has observed the workings of Calcutta's underclasses: the goldsmith shop sweepers who pay for the privilege, then sift the dirt for gold dust, selling the remains to a still-poorer class who sift again; beggars who pay to take care of another's cow so passers-by will pay to feed it; childless beggar women who rent babies; men who steal the corpses of paupers to sell their skeletons to Western medical schools.<br />For section three Shah is joined by a 12-year-old con man, an ingenious guide who knows all the scams. With the boy's aid, he saves an old woman from a witch's fate, discovers the secret of bloodless surgery, watches water turn to petrol, sees tulips nod as a godman passes, meets the world's richest man, learns how to stop not just a pulse but the heartbeat itself, witnesses a duel of miracles, and much more, exposing the secrets of venerated scam artists in their temples and tents, while maintaining a aura of surreal enchantment.<br />Shah reveals not only the tricks but the real marvels of Indian life - the amazing resourcefulness of poverty, where nothing goes to waste, everything is recycled and recycled again (Shah even visits a restaurant where all the dishes are made from discarded food), where practicality and ruthlessness coexist with mystical gullibility, and the ordinary Western reader is amazed, appalled and humbled.<br />Funny, illuminating and very different, Shah's first book-length account is itself a marvel., appalled and humbled.<br />Funny, illuminating and very different, Shah's first book-length account is itself a marvel.	2001-12-03

Spurning all overtures of friendliness while trying to get to the bottom of John's disappearance, Winnie presents her rude and prickly side and learns nothing. Is it her, or is John's office really evasive, his friends really mystified?<br />Meanwhile, the workmen in John's kitchen are making little progress. Loud knocking from inside the wall has stymied them. &quot; 'What have you done with John?' she said. She couldn't look toward the pantry as the raps began again, a sequence of five hollow ominous penetrating thumps.&quot;<br />Looking for John, trying to find some reasonable explanation for the knocks, Winnie calls on the neighbors, including John's sometime girlfriend, and a dotty old woman with too many cats, named Mrs. Maddingly. She muses on her situation through Wendy's eyes. Could the ghost in the wall be the remains of Jack the Ripper? Killed and walled up by a relative of his last almost-victim?<br />As the haunting proceeds, the mysteries mount. Is Winnie paranoid or is there some conspiracy against her, worldly or otherwise? Is John avoiding her or has something befallen him? Was Jack the Ripper ever in Hampstead? Events begin to move at alarming speed. One of the workmen is injured by the house, a psychic recoils from Winnie, a portly American blunders onto the scene, offering help, Wendy's story begins to hurtle beyond Winnie's control, bringing Winnie's own narration into question.<br />Maguire combines humor, mystery and menace adroitly. His prose is muscular, leading the reader down a twisting, doubling, circling path where reality shifts are the norm. Fans will not be disappointed and newcomers with be baffled and enchanted.br />Looking for John, trying to find some reasonable explanation for the knocks, Winnie calls on the neighbors, including John's sometime girlfriend, and a dotty old woman with too many cats, named Mrs. Maddingly.

Well organized, practical and very comprehensive, this paean to the lowly spud, by cookbook editor Roy Finamore and &quot;Fine Cooking&quot; contributing editor Molly Stevens, balances elegant and simple, fussy and fast, unusual and traditional. Prefacing the 300 recipes, a concise introduction explains waxy, starchy and &quot;all-purpose&quot; potatoes and provides advice on cooking, storing, and handling.<br />From appetizers (skins, crab puffs, potato porcini fritatta) to desserts (sweet potato chocolate cake, potato doughnuts) the recipes are invitingly clear. There's a chapter for every course and separate chapters for mashed (basic, French with cheese, sweet potatoes with balsamic), fried, baked and roasted, gratins and scalloped, braised and boiled.

The recipes, from little dishes through main courses and finishes, are enveloped in Italian ritual and custom and La Place's own experiences. She includes a chapter on wild foods and another brings together dishes for &quot;when you are not feeling well.&quot;  Ingredients are fresh and simple - though not always easy to obtain here; the leaves and stems of an Italian squash, for example.<br />But whether she's braising an artichoke, roasting an eggplant, or stewing beef, La Place explains how to choose the best and get it right. Rustic dishes include bread and wine-washed arugula, white bean and ditalini soup with wild fennel, dried fava bean puree with leeks and bitter greens. There are several tomato sauces, simple pasta dishes with wild herbs, or vegetables or seafood, risottos, fried squid, skewered lamb and roast pork.<br />This is a book for browsing and relaxing as much as cooking.	2001-11-12

The story begins with the 1923 death of President Warren G. Harding, hours after his participation in a Carter illusion in which the president is dismembered by scimitars. The luckless, humorless, but dogged Agent Jack Griffin of the Secret Service distinctly noticed that the president had shed years during his stage appearance; he was spry and athletic and no longer seemed to be carrying the weight of the world. Hmm.<br />Several misdirections, a housebroken lion and a few pages later, Carter has gotten the best of the Secret Service and the reader discovers that the scandal-plagued Harding had asked Carter: &quot;If you knew of a great and terrible secret, would you for the good of the country expose it or bury it?&quot;<br />The narrative then drops back to the origin of Carter's interest in magic tricks during the historic San Francisco blizzard of 1897 when he and his brother are left alone in the house for days. The wonder and uneasiness of the unaccustomed freedom and unprecedented abandonment create a heightened emotional milieu for the boys' distraction in a book of magic found in their father's study. Their anxious activity leads to a demonstation for the half-mad gardener nominally in charge of them. The disastrous performance - a clash of psyches encompassing a range of misunderstandings from adult/child to privileged/impoverished and sane/insane - culminates in a bizarre act of brutality. Carter accomplishes his first dramatic escape and the whole episode ends in an anticlimactic homecoming almost more shocking than the gardener's visciousness.<br />The emotional range of this chapter sets the stage for Carter's amazing ambition; his setbacks, self-doubt and luck, both good and bad. Gold's portrait is simultaneously intimate and larger than life. Nuance of feeling illuminates a life of grand gestures, tragedy, heroism, illusion and misdirection.<br />As the haplessly misdirected Agent Griffin, consumed with suspicion of murder, digs damningly into Carter's history, the story segues between past and present, illuminating the romantic figure of the real-life Carter in loss, loneliness, and love while encompassing gypsy prophesies, pirates, a black-hearted villain, the dawning of the technological revolution, a mysterious and beautiful blind woman, and, of course, Harding's shadowy secret. Historical figures, like the Great Houdini, television's inventor Philo T. Farnsworth and the borax tycoon, Francis Smith, make crucial appearances in this tumultuous era as the golden age of magic flourishes, then is slowly eclipsed by the the newer illusions of moving pictures.<br />Throughout, Carter's performances, always reaching for greater, more startling and astounding illusions, come to life on the page to amaze the reader. The illusionist's skill unfolds among the secrecy and jealousy of rivals and a tremendous amount of complicated equipment, depicted (so I'm told) with amazing accuracy. Emulating his protagonist, Gold develops his story with misdirection and sleight of hand, saving his best and most outlandish illusions for the grand finale.

He describes the opening of a 3,500-year-old grave and the variety of professional, decorative and personal items buried with the mummies, including Cowrie shells 2,000 miles from the sea, a thousand years before the Silk Road.<br />Journeying to various desert sites he observes the habits of the present day Mongol nomads, noting that the woolen ropes which bind their yurts together are identical to those found in the ancient tombs. In Kazakhstan, his visits with nomads whose ways have persisted for 3,000 years, throws light on the lives of 2,000-year-old &quot;ice mummies,&quot; buried in log houses adorned with felt wall hangings and illustrated woolen carpets, many of the bodies tattooed with mythical animals.<br />But the &quot;Bog People,&quot; of Northwestern Europe &quot;share one stark common characteristic: they all seem to have been deliberately put to death.&quot; Criminals? Sacrifices? Reid explores the possibilities, going back to the writings of Tacitus and the archaeological record, noting physical characteristics of the bodies which may indicate their status in life.<br />In Egypt - the only mummy-making culture with a written language - Reid concentrates on the religious beliefs and links with other cultures and from Egypt he moves on to the pyramids of the Canary Islands, where despite 1,000 years and the geographical distance, embalming techniques were amazingly similar to Egypt's, even to hairstyles and toenail bindings.<br />Exploring the possibility of trade links and echoes of commonality between these various cultures, Reid takes us to the New World where South Americans were preserving their dead 4,000 years before the Egyptians. Though many mummies were deliberately destroyed by the conquering Spanish, new discoveries have been made just in the last few years.<br />In Paracas, Peru, bodies were placed squatting upright (&quot;in the way most contemporary native South Americans sit to relax, chat, and eat or chew coca&quot;) and were wrapped in layer after layer of specially made clothing, &quot;some of the finest textiles ever found anywhere.&quot; One mummy bundle weighed 150 kilos. Further down the coast, the Chinchorro deconstructed and reconstructed their dead, making elaborate mummies, many of which show signs of repair, as if they were visited regularly. Mummy techniques in other areas include freeze drying and smoking. In some parts of Peru mummies were kept by their families (as recorded by shocked conquistadors), venerated, spoken to, even washed and changed frequently.<br />Reid's blend of personal and scholarly observation is highly readable and absorbing. His descriptions of mummies, tombs and artifacts is enthusiastic and visual, bringing these vanished cultures to life in all of their mystery. Sixteen pages of color photographs are a valuable supplement.<br />His anthropologist's view - Reid spent two years with the Maku, hunter gatherers of the Amazon rainforest, and visited other peoples whose cultures predate the Judeo-Christian tradition - informs his thinking, allowing him to fit clues from the archaeological record into a larger picture. His book is an excellent introduction to the world of mummies and, for those whose interest is piqued, Reid offers an extensive bibliography.e geographical distance, embalming techniques were amazingly similar to Egypt's, even to hairstyles and toenail bindings.<br />Exploring the possibility of trade links and echoes of commonality between these various cultures, Reid takes us to the New World where South Americans were preserving their dead 4,000 years before the Egyptians.

Motherhood paralyzes her with fear, her marriage has been destroyed, and she devotes her life to helping youth by studying how communication disorders contribute to delinquency. When her friend's daughter, Lucy, briefly goes missing, Suzanne falls apart, and, wandering, discovers the body of the child's sitter under an old water wheel in the park. She also destroys her own study project, perhaps her career, by blurting a subject's name to the police - she'd seen someone in the park who reminded her of this boy - but wasn't him.<br />The police set up a hue and cry for the boy, who disappears. Suzanne loses her job. Lucy draws incomprehensible pictures of monsters and talks of imaginary friends and villains in the park. Another girl turns up missing. The taciturn, lonely police detective, Steve McCarthy, finds himself attracted to prickly, vulnerable, evasive Suzanne while exploring the various ways families (or the lack of) can damage a child and blight a life.<br />Moody, atmospheric and unsettling, the novel's pacing is a little slow but thoroughly absorbing. It's difficult to make a flawed, neurotic protagonist like Suzanne appealing and sympathetic in such a dark story but Reah manages it, and even allows her a ray of hope to go on with.	2001-10-22

Drugrunners, counterfeiters and terrorists bring mayhem and murder to Isola's Christmas season as Steve Carella (still 40 after 45 years) catches the lead on the case of the lady in the lion's den.<br />Cass Ridley, Gulf War pilot, earns some quick cash flying in a few loads of she-asks-not-what from Mexico. When an ordinary burglar steals some of her hard-earned loot, feisty Cass tracks him down and grabs it back - most of it. Only to wind up at the zoo, in the lions' quarters, being eaten.<br />Grisly. At least she was dispatched by ice pick first. To make matters worse, Fat Ollie Weeks of the 88th precinct, shares the lead with Carella when a lion drags Cass' leg into the 88. Worse yet, in the course of the investigation, Fat Ollie, vulgarian misanthrope extraordinaire, a man to make your skin crawl, saves Carella's life - twice - leaving him beholden.<br />The plot is fast-paced and complex, the money trail branching off into various avenues of depravity and greed, involving double crosses, murders, and conspiracies, from street-level thugs to international terrorists and governments. McBain never misses a twist and his dialogue is trademark crisp. The terrorism aspect strikes a more visceral note than it would have when McBain was composing his plot and for this reason a bit of the humor falls flat, especially that having to do with the competence and cynicism of federal agents. Nonetheless, this is top-notch McBain; spare, baffling and deftly done.	2001-10-22
1823260:US	52774618	R3DRDDYJW86DWN	0618043705	876960131	The Best American Essays of the Century	Books	5	67	76	N	N	one woman's eloquent collection	Many would regard the task of selecting &quot;The Best American Essays of the Century&quot; as a most daunting honor, to be approached with much nail biting and trepidation. Whatever you choose, dissenters will howl. Oates, no shirker when it comes to hard work and firm opinions, offers her choices with confidence. &quot;My preference was always to essays that, springing from intense personal experience, are nonetheless significantly linked to larger issues.&quot;<br />Arranged chronologically, the essays lean heavily toward reflections on the human condition within American culture. The writing is, without exception, eloquent and insightful. Race is a pervasive theme and inspires the most powerful pieces. The best essay in the book is James Baldwin's &quot;Notes of a Native Son;&quot; visceral and intimate, full of pain, bewilderment and searing honesty, whole of heart and intellect. Pieces by Maya Angelou, Richard Wright, Martin Luther King, Zora Neale Hurston, Alice Walker, and Langston Hughes, no matter how familiar, still shiver the soul with the conjunction of powerful intellect, soul-searing experience and the intimacy of an articulate voice.<br />My second favorite essay could hardly be more different. John Muir's &quot;Stickeen,&quot; has it all: adventure, peril, pathos, the passion for nature and exploration, and the curious relationship between man and dog; a rousing good story.<br />Other themes place the writer in his contemporary culture; F. Scott Fitzgerald wrestling with despair, Jane Addams contemplating the downtrodden old women who comfort themselves with myths, Katherine Anne Porter internalizing the atom bomb, Tom Wolfe escorting a settled man to his rebellious son's slum apartment, Randolph Bourne exploring how his crippling disabilities have shaped his life, Mary McCarthy confronting anti-Semitism in a railroad club car.<br />Some find a kernel of sharp insight in a childhood memory: James Agee recalling his undefined place in the tableau of a summer night, Eudora Welty on her early reading habits, E.B. White facing mortality while revisiting a boyhood camp with his son, Edmund Wilson taking stock of the old stone house in the bleak Adirondacks only to discover he has carried it with him all his life, Cynthia Ozick devouring books in her parents' depression-era drug store, Vladimir Nabokov probing the awakening of consciousness in his Russian boyhood.<br />There are literary essays, but they are not the strongest: T.S. Eliot on tradition in literature, Robert Frost on sound and meaning, Susan Sontag defining &quot;camp.&quot; And there are gaps. Joan Didion's &quot;White Album&quot; explores the confusion of the 60s, but there are no real political essays. The women's movement, save for a didactic Adrienne Rich piece, might never have happened, ditto for Watergate and even World War I. There are only two war pieces: harrowing Vietnam reportage from Michael Herr and William Manchester's thoughtful response to the Okinawa War Memorial. The immigrant experience is represented by Richard Rodriguez' reflection on the pain and promise of becoming Americanized and Maxine Hong Kingston's poignant story of a shunned Chinese aunt, a long-ago suicide. Science is almost completely absent, save Stephen Jay Gould on the creation myth and Lewis Thomas' famous, brief  essay &quot;The Lives of a Cell.&quot; There's no political satire and no history, except as autobiography is history. But there are two essays dealing with suicide (William H. Gass, Edward Hoagland).<br />This is one person's careful collection of a century's important voices. All of the writers are well known, all have published at least one collection of essays, all of the pieces have been collected at least once before. Although there are a few humorous pieces (Mark Twain, S.J. Perelman, James Thurber), this is a sober and reflective collection, each essay the product of long thought.<br />The book would be a rich and valuable reading experience at any time, but is especially comforting during these somber, grieving days. This is paradoxical, since the best pieces are those that lay bare the country's worst injustice - racial prejudice. I expected to have trouble reading these painful essays, not wanting to feel angry or ashamed about my country right now, but it wasn't so. The unparalleled eloquence, the intimacy of these articulate voices, stand in such stark contrast to the vicious ignorance they've endured, that they hearten the reader by proving the strength and durability of the human heart.y time, but is especially comforting during these somber, grieving days.

Brenna Scott, with her dog, leads a volunteer team, called upon to search for missing people. In Seattle at a conference, she and her private-detective boss respond when a 4-year-old girl goes missing in the middle of the night. Brenna, breaking a number of her own rules, is alone when she surprises the kidnapper and he tosses the victim into a raging creek. Brenna saves the girl but loses her dog.<br />When another girl is kidnapped, a note is found addressed to Brenna, saying she has eight hours to find the child. But a tense, baffling, booby-trapped search ends in tragedy. The trickster killer, now fixated on Brenna, sends her coded, taunting email messages and stalks her, breaking into her house. Meanwhile the police, her boss and the FBI track down similar cases and hunt for a pattern. The climax, involving another kidnapped child and full-scale search, builds to a deadly struggle.<br />The killer is cleverly creepy and the mystery complex and well-paced but the true stars here are the working dogs. Alwyn, whose writing can be a little awkward, shines when she gets into the search, bringing humans and dogs to life, their work fascinating and suspenseful.	2001-09-24

While understandably leery when asked three months later to evaluate the same man, now suspected of a brutal murder, Kit agrees, partly to face those fears. But she baffles and infuriates the police with her conviction that Michael Doll, however twisted and repugnant he may be, is not the killer.<br />Spinning out a complex plot in which Kit finds herself drawn into the life of Lianne, the murdered homeless girl, French (actually a husband-and-wife writing team) delivers a suspenseful, ruminative exploration of loneliness, alienation and unspoken fears in this third novel. While probing the girl's short life, Kit begins an affair with the brooding, antisocial director of an ask-no-questions homeless shelter, Will Pavic. Still reeling from a recent painful break-up, Kit is cautious but full of longing. Michael Doll's desire is clumsier. He begins to stalk Kit, following her, waiting outside her house, making heart-wrenching and scary appeals for her attention. &quot;He was like my recurring nightmare, come to squat in the corner of my flat.&quot;<br />Another woman is murdered, an affluent, attractive, blond mother and Lianne is all but forgotten. Until Kit tenuously links the two murders. The police scoff, convinced Doll's attack scarred her wits as well as her face, but Kit doggedly pursues her &quot;feeling,&quot; trying to find a connection between the two disparate women. No surprise, the smug police get their comeuppance but not before considerable more harm is done.<br />French, reminiscent of Minette Walters or Frances Fyfield, creates rich characters, believable in a wide range of opacity, deceptiveness, derangement and anguish as well as more ordinary day-to-day behaviors. The plot is thoroughly perplexing and the ending caps the suspense nicely, with one last turn of the psychological knife.cely, with one last turn of the psychological knife.	2001-09-24

Established by an American entomologist in 1923, the station is considered the epitome of luxury for field workers: labs with modern equipment, hot water, staff-cooked meals, even a lounge with beer.<br />Diversity in the tropics is greater and more complex than anywhere else in the world and scientists have long asked why. Whether measuring water movement through the forest or calculating how far male frogs travel to sing in a group, each piece of knowledge raises a dozen new questions.<br />Acting as an unofficial field assistant, Royte accompanied many of the scientists on their forest rounds. Personalities emerge as she observes the forest with them, shares their frustrations and triumphs and joins in the evening social life.<br />Most are starting out in their fields; doctoral candidates or post-docs and their research is narrowly focused. Bret, trying to prove that his tent-making bats construct their temporary shelters in order to reduce feeding commutes, finds himself distracted by other cost-benefit examples and ponders an evolutionary theory of trade-offs which eventually extends to include a triangulation between youthful vigor, cancer and aging. Collecting vital statistics on spiny rats, Paul is a cog in a larger study of limitation factors on rodent population density. Chrissy collects spider monkey dung (for hormone analysis) in hopes of being the first scientist to correlate the sexual behavior of female spider monkeys with changes in ovarian cycle. The work is often tedious and physically demanding.<br />&quot;Bret's voice sang out through the dark. 'Do you have those little white flies up there? Taking small bites of your flesh?'<br />&quot; 'Yup,' I answered, examining two dots of blood on my arm. 'When you turn on your light do you get little cockroaches crashing into your face?' &quot;<br />Royte, sometimes as discouraged as her study animals (the people), asks why, when the rain forest itself is endangered, money and time should be spent on such arcane pursuits. As her time at the station grows, her answer expands.<br />Starting out, she sees each of these narrow studies as puzzle pieces in a larger picture, extending from the station's founding to well into the future and, in keeping with this view, she places current research projects in context with the people and discoveries that came before.

Helping her mother care for Dora's son, she discovers two of Dora's secrets, one of which leads back to the manor where the mistress lives with her hunchbacked son.<br />&quot;The Great House never fails to soothe me. I have always felt upon entering it that I could leave myself at the door, place it on a hook with the hats and scarves, and once inside I am lost behind the screens to other people's lives.&quot;  As maid to the bedridden mistress, she has learned to read and her duties, while demanding, are not arduous. But her obsession with Dora's life and death and secrets, and the coming of an itinerant painter with a secret agenda of his own, distracts her from her tasks and awakens thoughts which challenge unquestioned assumptions about class, passion and self-worth.<br />Tobin grounds her story in an atmosphere of grinding hardship where the rooms are always cold, the work hard, the filth ubiquitous and death never far. &quot;Bone House&quot; is an Elizabethan term for the body and its appetites and vulnerabilities are central themes. Secrets and superstitions weave through the narrative, provoking accusations of witchcraft and murder, building to a climax as poignant as it is shocking. Elegantly but sparely written, atmospheric and enigmatic, Tobin's first novel is engrossing and suspenseful.	2001-08-31

The novel opens in the plague's aftermath with the apples rotting on the ground for lack of pickers. Two thirds of this village of lead miners and shepherds have died. Roused from his bitter torpor by the return of the squire's family, Michael Mompellion, the rector, emerges to deliver a tirade of recriminations on the family which abandoned its people to their fate.<br />It all began with Anna's lodger, a tailor whose cheer and tales of travel enlivened her household. Her husband dead in the collapse of his lead mine, Anna supports two small children with her domestic work. A woman of no education but great natural gifts, life is looking up for Anna - Mrs. Mompellion has taught her to read and the tailor has proposed - when her young suitor is felled by a horrible disease. Anna cannot bring herself to heed his dying words and burn the new fabrics sent from London. Cloth is dear and the villagers' money has been spent.<br />Brooks (&quot;Nine Parts of Desire: The Hidden World of Islamic Women,&quot; &quot;Foreign Correspondence: A Penpal's Journey from Down Under to All Over&quot;) hauntingly imagines the creeping progress of contagion, the dawning terror and bewilderment of people who regard God as a daily presence. After a mob attacks an old woman as a witch, the rector calls upon the population to accept plague as a gift from God, an opportunity to shine with noble sacrifice and seal the village so as not to carry infection to the countryside. Arrangements are made for provisions to be left at the boundary and the villagers, who mostly have nowhere else to go anyway, hunker down. All except the squire's family, who slip out of the church during the sermon, turn off their servants, and flee.<br />Anna's growing role as midwife and nurse leads her through crises, illuminating the generous, the craven, the devious, the weak and the strong. Religious fanaticism (this is after the Restoration and the ousting of Puritanism) rises; crops rot in the fields; the young die and the old live on. Brooks' journalistic eye seamlessly integrates details of 17th century life - household furnishings, food, the labor of lead mining and husbandry, and the rural worldview of God and superstition - into the drama of tragedy. If Anna sometimes seems to good to be true, this is a story that benefits from a strong beacon. So many of the secondary characters are helpless, already too beaten by their hard lives to rise from another blow, that Anna's character leavens some of the bleakness.<br />Highly visual, with well-drawn characters, a vivid period sense and strong dramatic tension, Brooks' first novel is more than promising.nna's growing role as midwife and nurse leads her through crises, illuminating the generous, the craven, the devious, the weak and the strong.

An inscription commemorates the conquest of Thailand - 20 years in the future. Protagonist Scott Warden, a 21st-century American neglecting his wife and daughter for the life of an expatriate beach bum in Thailand, is one of the first on the spot. A second Chronolith destroys Bangkok but by then Scott is back in the US, working as a software designer, trying to regain his family.<br />As the march of Chronoliths continues across Asia, celebrating the future victories of the mysterious Kuin and causing widespread destruction, it triggers economic collapse, panic and the rise of fanatical groups. Scott joins up with his former teacher, Sue Chopra, an experimental physicist who believes the slim connections between Scott, herself and the Chronoliths are not coincidence but part of some temporal loop.<br />Scott is a somewhat annoying character, leaving the project to stay close to his daughter - who won't have much of a future if the Chronolith predictions cannot be changed. But as the paradoxes and connections mount, Wilson (&quot;Darwinia&quot;) paints a dark and vivid picture of a world society succumbing to the promise of future defeat, making this detailed disintegration a catalyst for the novel's action.	2001-08-20

Both sides use a little-understood series of space tunnels left by a vanished race.<br />The first in the series, &quot;Probability Moon&quot; introduced World, a planet of empaths whose &quot;shared reality&quot; makes lying impossible. While a team of anthropologists established relations with the Worlders, a military team studied the planet's artificial moon, another of the vanished race's artifacts, which they hoped would turn the tide in the war. The story ended in disaster, with the humans declared &quot;unreal&quot; and the moon destroyed.<br />The sequel, &quot;Probability Sun,&quot; neatly telescopes the earlier story as humans prepare for a new mission to study a second artifact hidden in World's sacred caves. The mission includes two characters from the first book, blunt, straightforward geologist Dieter Gruber and his thoughtful wife, xenobiologist Ann Sikorski as well as brilliant, eccentric physicist Tom Capelo, gene-engineered empath Marbet Grant and Major Lyle Kaufman, the mission's reluctant leader, a mild, politic man who doesn't recognize his own strengths.<br />While the scientists swarm over the artifact and re-establish relations with (and studies of) the Worlders, including Enli, whose previous experience gives her more insight into humans than she wants, the military secretly uses Marbet Grant to study the first Faller ever captured alive.<br />The character-driven action moves between the ship and the planet, the alien enemy and the enigmatic artifact, military ambitions and scientific goals, building to choices that may destroy Worlder civilization, tip the balance of the war or end the universe as we know it. Kress' story is well organized and well written and her characters multi-dimensional. The story is an engaging blend of military and psychological strategy, speculative science, moral dilemmas and suspense.

Dick Awards, McAuley (&quot;Confluence Trilogy&quot;) sets &quot;The Secret of Life&quot; in 2026, when global warming has submerged portions of the US coast, new viral infections menace humanity, and corporate greed reigns. The newest threat is a fast-growing slick in the Pacific, absorbing all nutrition in its path. Genetic examination suggests the slick is of Martian origin, probably brought back by the Chinese.<br />As life has never been found on Mars, this discovery excites scientists for numerous reasons, few of them altruistic. The protagonist, brilliant, bohemian, holistic biologist Mariella Anders, joins her nemesis, corporate-funded biologist Penn Brown and a NASA geologist, Anchee Ye, on an emergency Mars mission. Stalked by radical greens and shadowed by FBI, a rebellious impulse compromises Mariella's position, forcing her to leave for Mars under contract to Brown's employer, Cytex. Not wholly believable.<br />The Chinese have also mounted another mission and the tensions escalate as Brown, Mariella and Ye race across the desolate Mars landscape toward the pole and the rumor of life. Greed, accident and miscalculation leave the mission in perilous disarray and Mariella, trusting only herself, seizes the samples and flees.<br />There's plenty of action and speculative science on the origin of life but it's hard to believe even the most ruthless among us would risk sacrificing the entire human race for profit. If there's no people, where's the profit? An excellent writer, McAuley is at his best describing the eerie Martian terrain, truly evoking the strange, harsh, beauty of land without life.	2001-08-20
1906533:US	52774618	R1PBOHX4H8J51Q	1569472319	668873980	Beauty and the Beasts: Woman, Ape and Evolution	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Well-organized, with fascinating anecdotes	The great apes share more than 98 percent of our DNA and in the last 40 years women have come to dominate the study of our closest relatives. Today 62 percent of primatologists are women. British primatologist Jahme's anecdotal overview of primate research focuses on the women who have shaped the field since Jane Goodall (&quot;The Chimpanzees of Gombe,&quot; &quot;Reason for Hope&quot;) established her chimp site at Gombe in 1958.  Though women have made most of the startling discoveries about wild primate behavior, it was a man, Louis Leakey, who got it all started. Believing that the study of apes would enhance our knowledge of human evolution and convinced that women were more patient and observant than men, and therefore more suited to fieldwork, Leakey encouraged Jane Goodall's interest in wildlife and steered her to chimps. Inspired by Goodall's work, Leakey's other two &quot;trimates&quot;, Dian Fossey (&quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot;) and Birut&eacute; Galdikas (&quot;Reflections of Eden&quot;) achieved similarly impressive results studying gorillas and orangutans.<br />Jahme strikes a good balance between the work and the women, relating the dangers and controversies along with the triumphs. Jane Goodall left Gombe for two years after she was nearly abducted by terrorists in 1975 (four other workers were taken and later ransomed) and she has been criticized for influencing chimp behavior by using feeding stations (a practice she also now condemns). Dian Fossey was only in the Congo a few months when she was kidnapped and repeatedly raped by soldiers in 1967. She was the last white person to escape the Eastern Congo and all she wanted to do was get back to her gorillas, which she did, establishing a base on the Rwandan side of the mountain. Over the years her reputation for eccentricity grew as she risked her life and battled poachers and eco-tourism in an effort to save her beloved gorillas from extinction. Fossey was murdered in December 1985 and Jahme believes her sacrifice saved the gorillas, at least for now. Birute Galdikas has all but sacrificed her scientific reputation in her passion to save the rain forests and the orangutans of Borneo.<br />But Jahme moves far beyond the three leading ladies of primate study. She discusses Sarah Hrdy's discovery of the link between female promiscuity and male infanticide, Jo Thompson's study of the female-bonded bonobos, Sue Savage-Rumbaugh's work with apes and language, Thelma Rowell's successful challenge of male dominance theories among baboons, Barbara Smuts' work with chimps, dolphins and baboons. Just to name a few.<br />She explores how understanding of primate behavior has helped shape our understanding of human evolution and how field observation overturned the traditional male approaches and assumptions, until science came to embrace the idea that animals have emotions and are capable of love, murder and tool use.  She profiles the women who rehabilitate captive chimps into the wild, sacrificing years of their lives in an effort that, more often than not, seems to end in death and heartbreak. She explores the lives of captive chimps in showbusiness, in American Sign Language programs, in zoos and laboratories. Captive apes, we learn, love to watch TV. A universally favorite movie is &quot;Quest for Fire.&quot; Jiggs, star of the early Tarzan movies, and at 68, the oldest chimp in captivity, prefers his own performances above all.<br />The book's scope is tremendously ambitious and Jahme manages to interview almost everyone she mentions. It's a massive feat of organization, so well done it seems almost seamless. There is so much fascinating source material that the choice of what to leave out must have been daunting. In each chapter she presents biographical and research anecdotes that best illustrate the work and the people conducting it.<br />Her decision to include details of the personal and sexual lives of these prominent field researchers serves to underscore points of commonality with their animal subjects and to illustrate a pattern - an inability or unwillingness to commit to human relationships. With few exceptions, these women put non-human primates first.<br />While Jahme's prose is less than scintillating (nothing a good editor couldn't have fixed), her writing is clear, accessible and entertaining. It's an excellent introduction to the community of primate research and may spark interest in a broad audience. Her extensive (partial) bibliography will steer interested readers to more in-depth studies, particularly the many fascinating books of the field researchers Jahme profiles.ints of commonality with their animal subjects and to illustrate a pattern - an inability or unwillingness to commit to human relationships.

Mussels in Banana Leaves, for instance, requires a saffron reduction to be added to a softened butter, the banana leaves to be cut in a rectangle, dotted with saffron butter and thyme before being folded around the mussels, the packages then wrapped in foil and grilled. Follow this with Grilled Lobster with Coconut-Ginger Mojo or a classical Paella and you may be too tired to eat.<br />Simpler recipes abound though - Cornish Game Hen with Honey Mustard Garlic Cilantro Glaze is marinated in the glaze a day ahead; Ham Steak with Grilled Pineapple Tomatillo Salsa, Shrimp with Avocado Horseradish Salsa, Salmon with Dill Chimichurri.<br />Among the sides are a Spicy Radish Slaw, Yucca Hash Browns, Grilled Hearts of Palm and Cherry Tomato Salad.

Knowing why makes knowing how easier, from picking the best vegetables to creating a stable hollandaise sauce to cooking a tender roast.<br />From the first page, on which Parsons explains why onions make you cry  - a compound called sulfonic acid, lacking in Vidalias, which accounts for their raw sweetness - his book is full of fascinating, illuminating facts. He begins with deep-frying, and explains how to cook efficiently and healthfully, with fat. It's all a matter of getting oil temperature right so that the steam in the food repels the oil. And then there's the little details - why fresh oil fails to brown food, why batters should be firm.<br />The vegetable chapter - how to pick the freshest and tastiest - and how to keep them that way - is especially useful, explaining why mature vegetables are tougher, how the absence of green in a nectarine is more important than a rosy blush, which fruits can safely be purchased under ripe, why potatoes change color when exposed to air, why to cook green vegetables uncovered, why lemon preserves color.<br />Parsons explains emulsifying and the miracle properties of the invaluable egg; he explains how beans and grains go from toothbreaking hard in their raw state to tender soft in cooking and how this property can be used in a variety of ways from making perfect gravy to reheating rice; he deconstructs the mysteries of heat on meat and explains why treating piecrust tenderly produces tender piecrust.<br />Each chapter includes a summary list of tips and a selection of recipes demonstrating the properties and techniques discussed. An understanding of the science of cookery, Parsons says, enables the cook, freeing her or him from recipes. &quot;The only limit will be your creative ability.&quot; Armed with the science, the reader feels more in control, more expert, more willing to branch out.

She sometimes likes to throw an outsider into the mix: the self-possessed young mistress in &quot;Marrying the Mistress;&quot; the old lady struck by a protagonist's car in &quot;The Men and the Girls;&quot; and Zoe, the forthright, city-bred innocent of her current novel.<br />&quot;Next of Kin&quot; explores the aftermath of death and its effect on the survivors. The story opens with the funeral of Caro Meredith, California-born wife of English dairy farmer Robin Meredith, dead of a brain tumor in her forties. Robin's grief is complicated by his dead wife's long detachment from the farm and from himself. Caro, a rootless wanderer who always wanted to belong somewhere, to someone, could never embrace the land-bound farm life and left her husband's bed years earlier. Robin feels, sadly, bitterly, that she never tried.<br />The center of Caro's life was Judy, her and Robin's adopted daughter. Judy, so close to her mother, resents Robin as a remote, distant man who never loved Caro properly. Robin is awkward with Judy, so much Caro's daughter, and, truth be told, he never wanted to adopt and was devastated to learn Caro had married without telling him she could have no children.<br />Robin's brother, Joe, beset with private worries and longings, and a young, needy wife, mourns Caro as the emblem of freedom and otherness in his life. Joe runs the leased family farm after Robin left crop farming to establish his own dairy farm. Their parents, Dilys and Harry, too old now to run things on their own, see Joe, their favorite, as the repository of all their hopes and the productivity of their lives.<br />A few weeks after Caro's death, Judy brings her new flatmate home from London to her father's farm. Zoe grew up in the London projects. To her, meals are take-away food. She has never so much as peeled a potato or washed a dish. Robin's farm, with its animals, its broad acreage and seeming self-sufficiency, enthralls her, and, to Judy's outrage, she whimsically installs herself there, learning to run the tractor, cook and stack bales of hay.<br />Seen from the family's vantagepoint, Zoe seems self-possessed, independent, possibly dangerous. Not knowing the hidebound rules of community and family, she breaks them freely. When a second death shakes the family to the core, Zoe remains, unintrusive but available, infuriating some of the women who see her as a scheming wanton and Robin's acceptance of her as a betrayal. But she serves as a catalyst, forcing the family to look outward, to see themselves as an outsider does.<br />Trollope's characters are flawed human beings whose aspirations and failures ring true. There are no bad people or good people; their complexity resides in the minutiae of relationships, self-perception and innate personality. As a catalyst Zoe sparks small epiphanies leading to minor, possibly lasting change. These occur not so much because of Zoe herself but because, as an outsider making her way inside, she casts new light on unquestioned traditions. Convention plays a strong part in justifying people's actions; Zoe serves to make them confront the underlying selfishness or weakness or convenience or dependency. That Zoe may suffer when the family closes ranks again concerns no one, except, possibly, Zoe. To everyone else, her life outside their sphere of reference is a blank.<br />There's a lot going on in this novel, from explorations of farming realities in our time (mostly harsh) to the vicissitudes and accommodations of married life (a favorite theme of Trollope's) to the degrees of dependency and manipulation between parent and child. As the central theme, death affects each of these relationships, rippling outwards to draw in those on the periphery, calling into question the past and the future, people in the misery of grief&quot;shackled to their thoughts,&quot; but going on because &quot;while we're alive, we live.&quot;<br />Beautifully structured, gracefully written, full of difficult subtleties and unexpected strengths, &quot;Next of Kin&quot; is one of Trollope's finest novels.f &quot;shackled to their thoughts,&quot; but going on because &quot;while we're alive, we live.&quot;<br />Beautifully structured, gracefully written, full of difficult subtleties and unexpected strengths, &quot;Next of Kin&quot; is one of Trollope's finest novels.	2001-07-10

But what makes the book a standout is Le Carr&eacute;'s graceful, articulate prose and sharply drawn characters. Le Carr&eacute;'s trademark ability to invest the unspoken with as much meaning as the spoken, to flesh out dialogue with body language and cerebral maneuvering, is in top form here.<br />Although the crumbling of the Cold War sapped the spy novel of its urgency, the faceless, global enormity of corporate intrigue has a chilling power at least its equal and Le Carr&eacute; taps a rich vein of reader outrage in a novel which explores the complex plight of Africa and the predatory callousness of Western profiteering.<br />In a departure from convention, Le Carr&eacute; opens his story from the point of view of a secondary character, a high-level British diplomat of exceeding venality. Through Sandy Woodrow we hear of the rape and murder of a diplomatic wife, Tessa Quayle, in the wilds of northern Kenya's bush. Woodrow lusted after Tessa, and paints her as a loose woman, the flighty, much younger wife of a dull, upper-class twit. Her death is certain to inspire tabloid headlines, accompanied as she was by a charismatic, crusading black doctor who has disappeared from the scene. The official version: a scandalous lovers' tryst, tragically beset by bandits. Or, alternatively, the black lover killed the diplomat's wife in a fit of rage and fled.<br />In Woodrow's eyes, Justin Quayle is a hoodwinked, cuckolded, mediocre has-been, too consumed with his constant gardening to control his wife. But just when you're wondering why anyone would want to read about these tiresome, pathetic people, point-of-view shifts to Justin. In his grief, Justin is &quot;groomed and pensive and remote,&quot; a silent figure, willing to be misunderstood; despised by Woodrow, romanticized by Woodrow's wretched wife, suspected by the police. &quot;Lesley is accusing him of murder, yet all she gets is a small frown linking him to his inner world.&quot;<br />At last, grief getting the better of him, Justin does admit a terrible guilt, but not the husband's rage the police expect. Tessa chose to isolate him from the causes she espoused, he says, to avoid compromising his official position. &quot;She follows her conscience, I get on with my job. It was an immoral distinction. It should never have been made.&quot; Leaving Nairobi, Justin determines to shed his baggage and make peace with his wife's death by following in her footsteps, adopting her conscience as his own.<br />He sidesteps official questions about her activities and his knowledge of them, denies any knowledge of a report documenting a grave medical abuse in Kenya. &quot;But he has every idea. It is the terrible time. It is the time when he feared he might have lost her; when her young face grew harder by the day and her young eyes acquired a zealot's light; when she crouched, night after night, at her laptop in her little office, surrounded by heaps of papers flagged and cross-referenced like a lawyer's brief....&quot;<br />Woodrow has seen Tessa's document but Justin doesn't know what he did with it. Justin never saw it. He knows only that it has to do with a corporation called ThreeBees and a powerful new TB drug called Dypraxa; that the death of a village woman in the same slum hospital where Tessa lost her baby inspired Tessa's big crusade.<br />Justin's odyssey takes him to the places where they first met, courted, and loved, reliving their life together. A crusader, a lawyer, a woman of money and privilege, Tessa had strong convictions about love and about law. Calling on the spycraft that surrounded but never engaged him, Justin drops out of sight, covers his tracks, learns to suspect everyone.

Agreeing to help her best friend, Maureen looks in on Harris' harassed husband, one of life's ..., who is, however, touchingly devoted to his four &quot;weans.&quot; When Harris' body turns up in London, Jimmy goes to the top of the suspects list.<br />Partly to escape her own haunting problems - her sexually abusive father has returned to Glasgow and his proximity fills her with dread - Maureen goes to London when Ann's body surfaces there. She traces Ann's movements among the drug and alcohol addicted, and the violent traffickers in human weakness. The suspense builds as Maureen slowly gathers the pieces of Ann's messy life, crossing paths and swords with prey and predator.<br />The story is absorbing, gritty and well organized, the pace wonderfully irregular. But the heart of this novel is Mina's writing, her visceral evocations of people and place. Maureen is a complex knot of longings, intellect, fearlessness and terror. Nothing is simple.<br />Maureen's reaction to clueless, ... Jimmy: &quot;He tried to smile at her, sliding his lips back, but his face was too tired to pull it off. He had threateningly sharp teeth, which slanted backwards into his mouth. They looked like a vicious little carnivore's, naturally selected because they slid deeper into the flesh when the victim resisted.&quot;<br />And this is the man she decides to champion. Maureen is no trusting soul. But she does yearn. After a fight with her boyfriend: &quot;She wanted a nice boyfriend, she wanted kindness and respect and decency. She didn't want to spend her life with people she was suited to, she wanted to be with people like him.&quot;<br />Mina's prose is muscled, sometimes prickly and vulnerable, sometimes picturesquely hard-boiled: &quot;The morning dragged by like a stranger's funeral.&quot; And always painterly: &quot;The wind took on a shrill new viguor at the bus station, hurtling down the low streets, converging in the waiting area in front of the ticket building.&quot;<br />Though Mina's depiction of Glasgow is raw and dark, her heroine's rough edges protect a core of strength and her youthful vitality pumps out glimmers of hope.

1972197:US	52774618	R3B9EQX5R497IA	0316781142	704361388	The Last Time They Met: A Novel	Books	4	31	33	N	N	Surprise ending transforms novel	Anita Shreve's latest novel presents some problems for the reviewer. Reading it, I found certain elements of character, motivation and maturity baffling, even annoying, despite the beauty of the writing. The surprise ending, however, cast these apparent flaws in a new light, giving subtle, poignant meaning and transforming the story. But it's impossible to discuss any of this without giving away the ending.<br />A story of intense, enduring, but frustrated love, the novel begins with the two protagonists in their early fifties, meeting at a literary festival after an interlude of some years. Linda Fallon and Thomas Janes, both poets, are free now, for the first time since their high school romance ended over an automobile accident.<br />Widowed, Linda had a long, happy marriage while Thomas, twice divorced, never fully recovered from the death of his 6-year-old daughter, which occurred at the end of Shreve's &quot;Weight of Water.&quot; Thomas was the husband of that book's protagonist and there are numerous references to the shipboard events of that novel from Thomas' point of view. (I wondered: Did Shreve have this novel in mind even then; is that why she killed off the little girl, an abrupt shock which seemed pointless in that context?)<br />The first section is told from Linda's point of view - the reunion, her cautious renewal of this first love, reflections on her marriage, problems with her children. In sharp, anguished exchanges, they revisit the events that tore them apart. Linda, still harboring resentments, seems brooding, tentative, a little irritating.<br />&quot;He seemed taken aback by the contest. She knew what later she would mind this the most; that she'd become common in her anger. That in an instant, she'd reinvented herself as a shrew.&quot;<br />The second section jumps back more than 20 years to their affair in Africa, seen through Thomas' eyes. An accidental meeting, both married, snatched, torrid graplings, literary love letters, all of it ending badly in a cataclysmic clash of duty and jealousy.  Thomas, a more immediate, passionate presence, though no less conflicted, brings the heat and turmoil of Africa to bear on an illicit relationship which walls itself off from outside influence. &quot;Were there people, he wondered, who had genuine, more-or-less continuous fun when they fell in love? It didn't seem possible, the enterprise too fraught to sustain the lightheartedness fun required.&quot;<br />Thomas' wives - Regina, whose lack of confidence makes her ugly and desperate and Jean, mother of Billie, adulterer - both seem remote, unloved, and mildly repellant. Thomas himself seems to be drifting, fully engaged only in his writing. Thinking of Regina, he reflects: &quot;What she wouldn't forgive, he knew, was the pleasure the writing gave him: sensual and tactile, a jolt that ran through him when it worked. Always, he was writing in his head; at parties, he craved to be at a desk. He sometimes thought it was the only honest conduit he had to the world around him, all other endeavors, even his marriage (Jesus, especially his marriage), lost in the excessive caution of failed expectations and injured feelings.&quot;<br />The final section regresses in time again to the high school days of their first love. Told from Linda's viewpoint, this beginning has a spontaneous and organic feel, capturing the tentative, self-conscious forays of adolescent emotional and intellectual exploration, the blossoming of passion and respect, the surge of lustful love. Orphaned Linda is the poor, despised relation in a poor, overcrowded family. Thomas is the scion of privilege. A victim of sexual abuse, Linda struggles to overcome her fears; Thomas works hard to comprehend them. Together they are lovely, full of joy and fear. It's the best section of the book and I'm sure Shreve intended it to be.<br />This is a novel for book groups. Readers will enjoy discussing the ending with others, arguing about its meaning, its repercussions, how it colors everything that went before, the subtleties Shreve employs, her handling of obsession, loss and, well, you'll see.ercussions, how it colors everything that went before, the subtleties Shreve employs, her handling of obsession, loss and, well, you'll see.	2001-06-05

Already frustrated by the limitations of studying captive dolphins, her first visit to Monkey Mia was the beginning of a 15-year research project that illuminated many aspects of dolphin social life, including insights into communication and the controversial discovery of male sexual aggression.<br />&quot;To Touch a Wild Dolphin&quot; blends personal and scientific observations in a memoir of discovery. Off to a rocky start with no money and occasional run-ins with the locals, Smolker begins to cultivate a deep appreciation for the harsh beauty of Shark Bay while learning to recognize the regular visitors and the larger numbers of dolphins who disdain the shore.<br />Observing a fast, intelligent, streamlined animal that conducts its life in the sea presents special difficulties. Even in a boat, it's easy to lose the subject and from the surface it's impossible to see all interactions and body language. Smolker communicates her excitement as, over the years, she and her colleagues sort out social relationships, discover the intricate bonds formed between male pairs or trios and the flowing alliances that arise most often around sexual opportunism.<br />They cobble together refinements for recording dolphin communication, much of which occurs beyond our hearing range, catalog clicks and whistles, and discover the individual dolphin's &quot;signature.&quot; They discover tool-using behaviors passed down from mother to child - sponges worn over the face to protect against scorpion stings, for instance, and explore a theory that dolphin use sound to stun fish. Observing maternal bonds, they realize that dolphins have a very high infant and fetal mortality rate, but the reasons remain obscure.<br />For each question answered, a hundred more arise.<br />Smolker's approach is anecdotal and engaging, introducing the reader to many individuals and following their lives over years. There are births and deaths, hilarity and tragedy, triumph and disappointment. But most of all, Smolker arouses a sense of wonder and a strong curiosity to know more.ntroducing the reader to many individuals and following their lives over years.

His abduction and escape change everything.<br />Twenty-five years later Sean is a Boston homicide cop, Jimmy is a reformed ex-con who owns a neighborhood store and Dave Boyle is still a sad sack, haunted by the shame of his old trauma. The night Jimmy's 19-year-old daughter is murdered Dave commits a bloody crime and the subsequent news of the girl's murder leaves his wife in an increasing state of dread and suspicion. Did her husband murder Jimmy's daughter? Assigned to the murder, Sean finds himself mired in the intimate details of his old friends' lives and dwelling on the past they share.<br />The murder's aftermath frames the portrait of a close-knit (outsiders unwelcome) community in the throes of anguish. Driven by the expectations of family and friends and his own anger and grief, Jimmy seeks the murderer to mete out his own form of justice while Sean, under the auspices of the state, invades his friend's grief and his family's private moments and Dave, exulting in his cathartic act, tries to maintain a shell of normalcy.<br />Harsh, tender and painful, beautifully written, &quot;Mystic River&quot; explores the psyche of a neighborhood and how the individual is shaped by belonging, exclusion and class. Building to a dark, explosive, fateful climax, it's also an intense, insightful portrait of three men and the inner forces that drive them.	2001-05-16

Except for the mistake of agreeing to be constable, a job more properly described as dog officer, he's doing fine. Until his neighbors, an affluent summer couple, get themselves murdered.<br />Bredes' third novel gets off to a quick start and accelerates through events that threaten to destroy more than Bellevance's peace. Bluff and guarded but impulsive, Bellevance gets involved when the staties look likely to railroad his younger brother, who discovered the bodies - a day or two before he reported them.<br />As he bulls and finesses his way into the investigation, Bellevance takes up with a pretty young reporter and together they begin uncovering a secret network of greed and drugs under the town's placid exterior.<br />Breedes fleshes out his characters with hidden depths and unreliable surfaces. The normal pantheon of hardscrabble farmers and country people is augmented by the sorts that come to the country for its privacy, like survivalists and porn entrepreneurs. The plot is tight, the setting vivid and the hero is smarter than he is lucky.	2001-05-16

The Farm, as the family always called it, was purchased in 1848 and worked for almost a hundred years, until it was sold in 1946.<br />Philbrick opens with a brief history of the place and leads the reader on a child's eye tour, through the five barns, the springhouse, the chicken house, the corncrib and the forbidden territory of the ice house; greeting the animals, jumping in the hay, grinding corn for the poultry. The house too brings back memories of warmth and industry with its hand-hooked rugs, Turkey carpet and the big heart of the house - the kitchen.<br />Susie Kilburn not only cooked bountiful meals for family and hired help, she also put up her own vegetables and preserves, made real mince meat and served home-cured hams. Philbrick includes &quot;receipts&quot; for all of these delicacies as well as for pork headcheese and sweetbreads and beef tongue. Also included are receipts from other family members and friends  - Aunt Ida's Carrot Marmalade, Irene's Doughnuts, Aunt Bertha's Salad Dressing.<br />Beginning with spring (maple sugaring and Easter), each section opens with the author's lively remembrances, complemented with farm-life history and the memories of other family members - Philbrick's siblings, mother and aunt. The author also fleshes out the season with excerpts from her grandmother's diaries. Susie kept a diary most of her life but these terse passages reveal no innermost secrets. Instead they paint an intriguing, detailed portrait of farm routines from age 11 to 66, from farmer's daughter to farmer's wife and grandmother.<br />&quot;May 1 Wednesday, 1890 Ida put Ma's bedroom carpet back down. Rollo and Frank planted potatoes. Mr. Jones came here to borrow the buckboard to go to Fair Haven. Ida attended a meeting at the school house with Mrs. Jones. Eli Drake carried her home. Harry Northrup came here and staid all night.&quot;<br />&quot;October 6 Monday, 1941 Gladys washed in the A.M. The men finished filling the silo. Norm worked on the new shed. Ed sent his insurance on the buildings. In the afternoon Gladys varnished the dining room table. Ida came in the afternoon and Carrie Dean called. In the evening Ed took me for a ride up by the lake.&quot;<br />Then come the recipes - lamb and asparagus and fish and stewed greens in spring; new potatoes and peas, jelly making and canning in summer; apples and pickles and squash in the fall; venison, stews, and baked beans in the winter. And no lack of desserts at any season. &quot;Of course dessert was served at all meals - including breakfast at The Farm.&quot;<br />The dishes are just what you'd hope to find - hearty, rib-sticking country food. Gramma's Sunday Chicken is a fricassee with egg dumplings, there is a whole collection of doughnut recipes and a section devoted to puddings, including Indian, Rhubarb and Bread. &quot;I thank my lucky stars that I was a child during the time that puddings were still a part of our diet. Now, I am talking about home cooked puddings. There may be a place in our society today for instant puddings but not in this cookbook.&quot;<br />Within each season are sections focused on special activities - summer harvest, turkey drives, the Rutland Fair, butchering - and ordinary activities like housekeeping, shopping and, of course, cooking. Holidays get special treatment, with mouth-watering menus and recipes for every dish from Roast Turkey Dressed with Oysters to Plum Pudding.<br />I should probably mention that the author is my mother-in-law. This is no indication of prejudice. Rather, it means I have had the pleasure of enjoying many of the dishes, from holiday favorites like Cranberry Chutney and Parker House Rolls to year-round fare like Roast Pork, Bread and Butter Pickles, Potatoes au Gratin and Oyster Stew. I can attest that Aunt Ida's Famous Ginger Cookies deserve their fame and Aunt Ida's Swedish Meatballs really are &quot;the very best Swedish meatballs this side of Uppsala or Stockholm.&quot;<br />Full of memories, history and good food, Philbrick's book is a warm, fascinating and useful tribute to a bygone way of life.erve their fame and Aunt Ida's Swedish Meatballs really are &quot;the very best Swedish meatballs this side of Uppsala or Stockholm.&quot;<br />Full of memories, history and good food, Philbrick's book is a warm, fascinating and useful tribute to a bygone way of life.	2001-04-17

It's too cheerful, too heartwarming, too delightfully feel-good.<br />Not that life is smooth sailing for any of her characters - there are setbacks, tears and regrets for everyone. But the central characters, Cathy Scarlet and Tom Feather, the founders of Dublin's newest posh catering service, Scarlet Feather, are so full of irrepressible optimism, and relentless drive and determination that everyone - the other characters as well you, the reader - is rooting for them.<br />Cathy and Tom have been friends since cooking school. Once they were almost lovers but fate intervened; Cathy went off to Greece on a cooking job and fell in love with Neil Mitchell, an idealistic lawyer and soulmate, despite his upper-class background. Neil is the son of the wealthy, snobbish Hannah Mitchell and her golf-lazy husband Jock, who employed Cathy's mother, Lizzie, as a cleaner for many years. Everything about Hannah pushes Cathy's buttons; the woman terrifies and enrages her.<br />Almost immediately Scarlet Feather takes off - the food is terrific and the proprietors are tireless. Cathy's Neil and Tom's gorgeous girlfriend, would-be model Lucella, are wonderfully supportive and helpful. But Tom and Cathy haven't left room for anything to go wrong.  The book opens on New Year's eve. Tom, unhappy with Lucella's flirtatious behavior at a party, wanders off and discovers the prefect premises for Scarlet Feather. Two 9-year-old Mitchell twins are abandoned by their parents at Hannah's party, which Cathy is catering. These two events, the fulfillment of her dream and the shouldering of an obligation, change the course of Cathy's life.<br />The twins, social illiterates, ill-mannered, literal minded, endlessly curious and terrified of abandonment, arouse Cathy's sympathy and she takes them into her home before Hannah throws them into the street. Neil, on the verge of making a difference, and a name for himself, has no patience with the pair. Though Cathy points out the irony of sympathizing with homeless strangers and not homeless kin, she too would just as soon be shed of the twins, who end up with her parents, long suffering Lizzie (did she but see it) and her gentle gambler husband Muttie.<br />The kids almost steal the show but Cathy is up to the competition. Other fully engaging cast members include her self-made aunt, who's traded love for success; Cathy's sister, long emigrated to Chicago, now longing for a traditional Irish wedding, complete with corned beef and Leprechauns; a lonely dignified old man who lost his one chance of happiness through a misguided sense of duty; a venal, debt-ridden cousin and various denizens of the upper classes and betting shops.<br />The novel follows a traditional structure, with everything crashing to bits in the middle and the characters picking up the pieces thereafter to come out wiser at the end. The characters, every one of them, even Hannah Mitchell, are complex people who inspire affection and sympathy and the story grips and engages the reader from first page to last.

Making a few pennies recounting the tragedy, ten-year-old Augie Dubbins meets an impoverished young journalist, Edgar Allan Poe.<br />Together they discover the body of another young woman caught under the docks and embark on an investigation which takes them from the squalor of the Five Points slums to the glitter of Fifth Avenue, where Augie learns that ruthless depravity thrives at all levels of society.<br />Narrated by Augie many years later &quot;On Night's Shore&quot; seamlessly incorporates elements of Poe's later tales into the narrative - &quot;The Mystery of Marie Roget,&quot; &quot;The Cask of Amontillado,&quot; &quot;The Black Cat&quot; - without overreaching. Poe is a gloomy, driven man whose genius is beset by poverty, nagging self-doubt and bouts of drunkenness. Augie, brutalized, clever, and resourceful (&quot;in calamity, opportunity&quot;), attaches himself to Poe as a father figure, enchanted by his family circle of consumptive, gentle wife and strong, generous mother-in-law.<br />Despite occasional backsliding into, respectively, despair and opportunism, Poe and Augie bring out the best in one another and together they delve into Mary Rogers' working class life, shattering several official versions of the murder on their winding path into the bastions of city power. Atmospheric and suspenseful, Silvis' (&quot;An Occasional Hell,&quot; &quot;Excelsior&quot;) character-driven story brings the city to life in all its cruelty and grandeur and the writing - mannered, gritty and eloquent - evokes the voice and sensibility of the time.	2001-03-12

Cannell (&quot;King Con,&quot; &quot;The Devil's Workshop&quot;) builds his latest thriller around a brutal, far-reaching police conspiracy.<br />LAPD detective Shane Scully, awakened by his ex-partner's hysterical wife, races over to save her from a savage beating and ends up shooting her husband in self-defense. Though the husband is known for his brutality, he is also something of a hero in department circles. An IAD inquiry which should be open-and-shut turns into a prosecutorial vendetta, complete with Scully's longtime nemesis, ice-queen and ace prosecutor Alexa Hamilton (mid to late-thirties, Alexa must have been amazingly young when she prosecuted Scully 17 years earlier - just one of the novel's noticeable, if minor, holes).<br />Threats escalate to violence as Scully attempts to save himself by doing his own digging. Each unsavory secret he uncovers leads to another, encompassing bigger and bigger fish, ultimately threatening the life of a troubled, angry teen entrusted to Scully's care by his mother, a high-level call girl and police informant.<br />Cannell's writing is slick and easy, his protagonists deep enough to like and his villains more brutish and greedy than clever. He exposes the threads of conspiracy at a pace designed to keep the pages turning, building to an all-stops-pulled climax which manages to involve air, land and sea (okay it's a lake but why quibble?).<br />Like most conspiracies I found this one hard to swallow but the novel is great entertainment and, I must admit, I've read stranger stories of fact.	2001-03-12

More bodies are found but nothing is done until a white woman is murdered and rising hysteria leads to a cataclysm of violence, which sends Harry's father into a spiral of depression and defeat.<br />Fascinated by the crimes, his fears bolstered by folklore, Harry probes at the edges, eavesdropping and doing his own secret investigating, together with his younger sister Thomasina. Lansdale, author of numerous horror, suspense, and Western novels (&quot;Blood Dance,&quot; &quot;Rumble Tumble&quot;) heats up a cauldron of ugly racial tensions, country superstitions, casual brutality and ignorance in the bucolic Texas lowlands.<br />Dark and poignant, as much coming-of-age novel as mystery, the narrative explores a boy's relations with his adult family, particularly his father, and his grappling with a new understanding of the world's venality and depravity. Harry's rural voice rings true and the realistically halting pace accelerates to an explosive climax.	2001-03-12

A present-day American journalist in Russia records the inside story of the Soviet failure to be first on the moon, as told to him by Yuri Ribko, a young engineering student in 1964 when the book begins.<br />The story opens with the death, possibly the murder, of the head of one arm of the Russian space program. Yuri, with the help of his uncle, a high-ranking member of state security, lands a coveted job. In return all he has to do is spy on his fellows.<br />Yuri's enthusiasm and youthful naivete allows him to be manipulated by his military father as well as his KGB uncle, but also leads him into various arms of the Soviet program, including capsule recovery and the cosmonaut program.<br />Or one of the cosmonaut programs. Cassutt's portrait of the Soviet program depicts a fractured effort. Intense rivalries between military and civilian space programs duplicate efforts and mistakes, foster competing rocket designs, and encourage jealousy, internal secrecy and rushed decisions.  Over the book's five years Yuri is on hand for the triumph of the early lunar landing and the devastating failures of exploding launch vehicles and tragic landings. He nearly drowns falling through the ice on a recovery effort, narrowly misses being blown up, endures torturous medical testing and training and wonders if his successes are due to his own merit or his uncle's maneuvering. There are love affairs and family secrets and close details of daily Soviet life.<br />Cassutt (also a TV writer who has worked on &quot;Max Headroom&quot; and &quot;Beverly Hills 90210&quot;) knows his stuff, maybe too well. In his effort to include all the historical details, the passion of his fictional story falls flat. The intricacies will be fascinating for those looking for insight into what went wrong with the Soviet race to the moon but those looking for a page-turner would do better elsewhere.moon but those looking for a page-turner would do better elsewhere.	2001-02-28

The eerie, dramatic opening finds Eliska, a terrified young girl, drenched in blood not her own, taking refuge in an aristocratic country house. She discovers an infant girl in a dough trough under the kitchen table. Bread is rising on the table and a milk bottle has been warmed on the stove but no one answers the child's cries of hunger. Eliska takes up the baby and the bottle and ventures hesitantly to explore the house. The place is vast and glittering and grand. And empty. As is the surrounding village; everything left in haste. Eliska milks the cow, chops wood for the fire, bakes the bread, tends the baby.<br />Her precarious idyll ends when a shaken young man with a gun turns up. A country boy turned zealous communist, Jiri is soon followed by a thuggish gang of fellow partisans who arrive moments after the house's owner, Count Michael Blansky, home from the war. Blansky is forced to flee but another wealthy neighbor, factory owner Frantisek Konecny, neither an aristocrat nor a Nazi collaborator, chooses to stay.<br />Walsh picks up each of these lives - and those of the children who follow - in moments of crisis or change as the years pass. She finds Konecny in 1948 as the village attempts to reconcile the habits of country life with communist rule. His factory nationalized, denied university placement because of his background, Konecny becomes a lavatory cleaner until charges of corruption force him to flee. He leaves behind a fianc&eacute;e who may have been his betrayer and struggles to forge a new life in exile.<br />By 1967, Jiri, married to Eliska and adoptive father of the found baby, Nadezda, has become, in frustration, a dissident. Communism fired his inquiring mind with idealism, now that fire has made him discontent with the slow pace of classless liberation. Sticking to his ideals, Jiri attends a Marxist study group, which, one by one, is carted off to jail or fired or ruined or all three.<br />Count Michael's boy, Pavel, brought up in exile, marries an English woman and feels little connection to his walled-off homeland. He keeps his heritage alive by sending his daughter to spend summers with County Blansky and his sister near the border of their iron-curtained homeland. Kate, entering adolescence, feels only impatience for her relatives' mourning of a bygone birthright.<br />Walsh's compassionate characterizations illuminate the strains of individual lives and the sometimes senseless accommodations made under repression. Jiri, under government orders to produce grain unsuited to the land, purchases the crop to fulfill his quota.  The characters are passionate about ideas; even those who avoid politics for practical matters (the women) have strong ideas about heritage, personal loyalty and obligations. Discussions of philosophy and moral duty fire the men but these never become preachy, partly because of the impassioned quality of the writing and partly because these discussions take place in moments of drama - before or after being carted off to jail or escaping across international borders or fighting with a spouse.<br />Walsh's ideas are embedded in life, part of its fabric. She uses moments of crisis to move the story along, of course - the drama of the fleeing refugee, the excitement of Pavel's defiant, heroic assistance to dissidents in a homeland he barely remembers, Jiri's resistance to threats and intimidation and his final capitulation, Count Michael's journey on foot across the border upon the fall of communism.<br />But the incidental details of everyday life flesh out the narrative. The exiles in London who prefer to speak English among themselves, the grades of jail cells that wordlessly communicate status and prospects, chemotherapy pills packed in vitamin bottles, political prisoners despised by the real criminals in prison, the Rom who camp on the Count's land and know the best routes over the border, the gulf between parents and children who see them as hopelessly foreign.<br />The fall of communism provides fresh absurdities and some hardships and hard feelings but mostly the reopened border promotes healing and gives Walsh's book a satisfying, redemptive conclusion. A fine, thoughtful, moving novel by the author of the Booker Prize-shortlisted &quot;Knowledge of Angels&quot; and many other novels, detective stories and children's books.xiles in London who prefer to speak English among themselves, the grades of jail cells that wordlessly communicate status and prospects, chemotherapy pills packed in vitamin bottles, political prisoners despised by the real criminals in prison, the Rom who camp on the Count's land and know the best routes over the border, the gulf between parents and children who see them as hopelessly foreign.<br />The fall of communism provides fresh absurdities and some hardships and hard feelings but mostly the reopened border promotes healing and gives Walsh's book a satisfying, redemptive conclusion.

The second explores hereditary diseases, pain, and, in an informative piece on mad cow disease, external evolution, or human alteration of the environment.<br />Klawans pleasure at the elegance of evolution infuses each of his essays, many of which center around a 'eureka!' moment - an offhand comment or question leading to a breakthrough in understanding. For example, his daughter's quip that an authentic Arabic restaurant always plays &quot;the Song,&quot; meaning all Arabic music sounds the same to her, makes him realize the fundamental similarity between music and speech. Both exist in all cultures and culture determines comprehension.<br />Klawans particular interest is the plasticity of the human brain. Bipedalism changed the human pelvic structure, which forced an evolutionary choice - small chimplike brains or small immature brains that would require years of maternal nurturing. The beauty of the choice made by evolution is the unique abilities fostered by environmental interaction with a developing brain.<br />Speech is the greatest of these and the title essay concerns the case of a six-year-old girl found locked in a closet in an abandoned building. Undernourished and undersized, she was unable to speak. But her &quot;window of opportunity&quot; remained open and once exposed to language her progress was amazing. An adolescent, however, never exposed to speech, never develops the brain constructs and never speaks or comprehends.  It's the &quot;cavewoman,&quot; Klawans says, who made our unique cultural abilities possible, the cavewoman's nurturing and the cavewoman's mitochondrial DNA (brain diseases passed by mitochondrial DNA indicate a crucial role in brain development). Klawans' final essay, &quot;Whatever Happened to Baby Neanderthal?&quot; poses a stunning theory of extinction. Big Neanderthal brains were big at birth, thus lacking human plasticity, precluding language ability. Interbreeding would not have helped. Human men fathering Neanderthal babies could not pass on mitochondrial DNA (passed only through egg) and human woman did not have pelvises big enough to birth half-Neanderthal babies.<br />Klawans (&quot;Toscanini's Fumble,&quot; &quot;Why Michael Couldn't Hit&quot;), who died last year, was an engaging, clear-sighted, stimulating writer with an infectious enthusiasm. In making his way to evolutionary insights, he takes the reader through neurological diagnoses of real people with baffling problems and even lets us know how it turns out for them in the end.&quot; remained open and once exposed to language her progress was amazing.

Why does the moth fly to light? Something to do with navigating by moon, probably but then why is light lure stronger than sex? When is a cowbird egg in a cacique nest a good thing? Answer: when there are no bees and wasps nests around.<br />Then there's &quot;Consumed by Learning&quot; in which trained flatworms, chopped and fed to untrained flatworms, were able to pass on their knowledge. These results were greeted with such hoots of derision that the research was abandoned - leaving the question.<br />How about the sedentary British bird that learned to open milk containers and somehow spread this knowledge gradually northwards? In a Canadian experiment twenty-five percent of chickadees figured it out on their own and were able to tutor the less able. Strangely though, when tutor birds were placed in a cage with no milk container, the bird in the next cage figured out how to open its container. Telepathy? (This is not the conclusion the scientists arrived at.)<br />Ingram revisits the 1960s theory, popularized by Elaine Morgan, that human hairlessness, bipedalism, nose shape, tears, etc., indicate that &quot;Homo Aquaticus&quot; became a creature of the ocean shallows for a few million years. Pooh-poohed but not disproved.<br />He looks into Archimedes' war machines, the doomed quest for perpetual motion, the anatomy of laughter, a scary viral predator whose aggressive perfection is, thankfully, confined to bacteria. Presenting various theories with their pros and cons, he outlines a range of experiments and counter experiments and doesn't hesitate to digress when it's called for. He touches on the personalities and politics of science and keeps his quirky sense of humor at the fore.<br />Knowledge of science is not necessary but neither does it get in the way of enjoyment.

Except that &quot;Cause Celeb&quot; came first.<br />At first glance, it's easy to see why Fielding's first novel might have been a hard sell to American publishers in 1994. A Jane Austen-for-the-nineties comedy set in war-torn, famine-stricken Africa and the vainest, silliest aspect of London celebrity society, with a plot that centers on a coming famine of epic proportions, &quot;Cause Celeb&quot; doesn't have the lighthearted ring of the endearing, madcap diary of a single woman pining for love. But Fielding pulls it off.<br />Narrated by Rosie Richardson, London publicist turned refugee camp administrator, the novel opens in the camp, located in the fictional country of Nambula. Rumors of a locust plague across the border in Kefti worry the refugees and the aid workers although scary rumors are common and solid information hard to come by. As Rosie ruminates, brushing her teeth on a dusty hillside, her irreverent assistant Henry wanders by wearing his favorite t-shirt - &quot;a multiple choice questionnaire for relief workers: (a) Missionary? (b) Mercenary? (c) Misfit? (d) Broken Heart? ...I was a c/d hybrid and soft in the head to boot.&quot;<br />This reflection takes her back to London and the beginings of her self-destructive affair with the handsome, sophisticated, TV arts show host and producer, Oliver Marchant. A type Fielding seems to know all too well, Marchant has a lot in common with Daniel Cleaver of &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary.&quot; Professional success, wit and good looks make him popular with women who he treats as sexual conquests, devalued once won. His relationship with Rosie blows hot and cold; cold when she's hot, hot when she's cold.<br />In Marchant, Fielding creates a man with a Hindenburg-sized ego, easily bruised. His skill at manipulation is diabolical but transparent. Once, fed up with his habit of storming out in a fit of pique, she shrugs and lets him go instead of entreating him to stay. Ten minutes later he's back.<br />&quot;Oliver was holding the sort of bunch of pink and yellow flowers you get from petrol stations for 2.95 with imitation white lace on the edge of the cellophane. 'Plumpkin,' he said, holding them out to me.&quot;<br />But he's a celebrity and she'll put up with a lot for love and the envy of friends and coworkers. Most of Rosie's forays into the glittering celeb milieu are disastrous, though hilarious for the reader. And Fielding has a lot of fun skewering the wobbly celebrity psyche.<br />&quot;There was a commotion at the door and Terence Twinkle burst in. 'Hi, everyone,' he shouted across to our table. 'God it's a nightmare out there. Why can't anyone leave me alone?' He was wearing a floor-length white mink coat.&quot;<br /> Between ironical reminiscences, Rosie tends to her duties, attempting to track down rumors of disaster and overdue food shipments. Staff relationships, including her own, inspire moments of affectionate hilarity and once or twice erupt into zany farce. Obsessions with luxury foods and petty jealousies live side by side with homeless, undernourished refugees yet Fielding's deft touch makes it all work - funny and starkly realistic together.<br />When Rosie is late meeting a new staffer, her young assist diffuses the awkwardness with a dose of black humor. &quot; 'Sorry not to be here to give you the old welcoming committee - bit of an old blood bag crisis down the black hole of Calcutta.' &quot;The new doctor looked somewhat taken aback. He seemed pleasant, but dull. Pity.&quot;<br />Of course the new doctor is going to be anything but dull, igniting a new flame of romance in Rosie, with, naturally, numerous obstacles in its path.<br />Meanwhile the coming refugee crisis looms larger. Food shipments are delayed and starving people begin to trickle over the border. Rosie and the new doctor, against all the rules, cross the border on a fact-finding mission. But, even armed with pictures of ravaging locusts and fleeing people, Rosie is unable to move the powers that be.<br />So she decides to act on her own, organizing a celebrity benefit along the lines of Live Aid and BandAid. But four years is a long time in celebrity circles and Rosie has been forgotten by all but one - Oliver. Dastardly Marchant has a price for his cooperation and Fielding has a great time showing Rosie's maturation into a pretty good manipulator in her own right. She also has fun skewering celebrities, bureaucrats and reporters, with great good nature.<br />The climax brings them all together - starving refugees, egomaniacal celebrities, Rosie and her two beaux - in an all-stops-pulled ending that should have been either in bad taste or hopelessly depressing or both. But Fielding manages to pull it off, joining tears, laughter and heroics in a triumph of the human spirit despite war, inhumanity and hopeless vanity.ood shipments are delayed and starving people begin to trickle over the border.

McCaleb's immediate and intense focus on the case threatens his tranquil Catalina Island idyll as new father and husband. His wife, Graciela, views his work as inviting darkness into their lives, while McCaleb sees it as a crusade against darkness.<br />Bosch's attitude is more sardonic. Having once arrested the victim for the murder of a prostitute but unable to make the charge stick, Bosch would as soon congratulate the killer as arrest him, an attitude which reinforces the horrifying profile McCaleb is compiling. The artfully constructed murder scene points to Bosch himself, whose motive - vigilante justice - is plain.<br />The prime witness in another murder case - an arrogant Hollywood producer accused of the murder of an aspiring young actress and suspected of another - Bosch spends his time tracking down reluctant witnesses and shoring up the prosecution's shaky case. Alone and cynical, it's almost possible to believe he's crossed the line into darkness.<br />Though intricate and diabolical, the plot is ultimately incredible. But this takes little from the reader's enjoyment. Connelly's attention to forensic detail, character and setting, his well-developed portrait of depravity and his assured writing successfully drive the story, no doubt to Connelly's next stop on the bestseller list.	2001-01-30

The dead cop, Chris Wilson, an off-duty black man in plain clothes with a gun to the head of a white man in a tough neighborhood, was shot by a white cop while trying to identify himself. Sound familiar?<br />In Pelecanos' capable hands the story takes several quirky turns. Strange interviews the shooter, Terry Quinn, who subsequently joins his investigation, determined to prove himself colorblind. Although cleared, Quinn left the force and now works in a second-hand bookstore, passing his days reading Westerns. A cocky, impulsive young man, quick with his fists or whatever else comes to hand, Quinn makes an unlikely match for Strange, laconic and self-assured, who feels no need to defend every slight to his manhood.<br />But Quinn makes himself useful and a wary partnership develops as Strange delves into Wilson's life, seeking reasons for his presence with that white man on that dark street.<br />The D.C. streets, the ones our country's leaders never see, teem with simmering rage, wrecked lives, drug dealers, crumbling neighborhoods held intact with affection and traditions, good music, family restaurants, friends. Gritty, dangerous and lively, the city is home to a varied cast.<br />The narrative shifts among them from Strange to Quinn to the leaders of a black heroin operation and their vicious white-trash go-between suppliers, with cameos by various girlfriends, hangers-on, and junkies. Each character is placed firmly in their home setting - the abandoned-warehouse headquarters of the heroin operation, the rural fortress of beer-soaked Earl and his hopped-up son, Critter, a pair who make their city connections look wholesome.

O'Brian's approach - Jane Austen for men - kindled such enjoyment that I've been on the lookout for like-minded writers ever since. Now Allan Mallinson is no Patrick O'Brian. He's not as subtle or graceful a writer, his humor is less wry, his characters less nuanced.<br />But young cavalry officer Mathew Hervey is a hero to root for; principled, dashing and amazingly resourceful. The military details feel authentic and the Indian setting of Hervey's second adventure steams with heat and intrigue.<br />Promoted to captain after the Battle of Waterloo (&quot;A Close Run Thing&quot;) and named the Duke of Wellington's new aide-de-camp, Hervey is abruptly dispatched to India, a shining opportunity, save for two problems. The first is the ungraceful postponement of his wedding to his childhood sweetheart, Henrietta. The second is the clandestine, rather unsavory quality of his mission.<br />Subterfuge is foreign to the forthright soldier and the substance of his mission - squaring the Duke's political aspirations by disposing of some questionable Indian estates in the small independent (fictional) state of Chintal - makes him uncomfortable. Still, an order is an order and not to be questioned.<br />In addition, Hervey's cover is thin and he tends to babble a little when he informs people he is in India researching the use of the lance as a weapon of war. Did he but know it, Hervey is soon over his head among the machinations of the British East India Company and the maneuvering of Indian princes. Actually, considering the opportunities for blunders and treachery Hervey creates by his innocence and staunch British principles, Mallinson is rather easy on him. His curiosity, affability and lack of pretensions win him sympathetic friends and his bravery and ingenuity wins their respect.<br />Mallinson is at his best describing Hervey in action: chasing down a huge boar from a good horse, fighting bandits and mutineers, turning battles against stupendous odds. Having won the goodwill of the rajah of Chintal by saving his elephant from quicksand, Hervey is invited to Court - the very place he needs to be to expunge all records of the Duke's estates.<br />The rajah, besieged by bandits, treasonous subordinates, the British East India Company and the encroachments of the Muslim nizam of a neighboring state, appeals to Hervey for help. Befriending the rajah makes his treacherous mission all the more difficult. Then there's the rajah's beautiful, mistrustful, and powerful daughter. And the veiled plans of ambitious Europeans, as sneaky as the country's multitude of snakes.<br />Much of the political history and tangle is delivered through conversations - old hands expressing opinions or setting young Hervey straight. Readers whose knowledge of the period is sketchy will finish the book with their ignorance pretty much intact. But Mallinson's portrayal of the time - the vastness and variety of the country, the opulence of the rajah's court, the people and their passions, the elephants, snakes, horses, mud huts and palaces - is intensely visual. The country comes alive.<br />Hervey's good nature and humor balance his earnestness and ambition. He does his best thinking on the back of a horse and we meet some excellent horses along the way. The narrative is well-paced; suspenseful but also leisurely, involving the reader in the atmosphere of India - its religious mysticism and extremes of poverty and plenty - while cranking up the growing tensions to a pitch of war on several fronts. If Hervey's British ingenuity sometimes strains credulity, it also makes for greater excitement and dash. A thoroughly enjoyable yarn, from first page to last.bandits and mutineers, turning battles against stupendous odds.

But many regard him as the persecuted victim of powerful English landlords and their agents, the police.<br />Carey (winner of the Booker Prize for &quot;Oscar &amp; Lucinda&quot;) gives Kelly a powerful voice in this stirring, eloquent novel. Presented as a series of parcels handscrawled on assorted stained and tattered paper, including stolen bank stationary, Kelly puts his story on paper for his baby daughter and promises, it &quot;will contain no single lie may I burn in hell if I speak false.&quot;<br />Kelly's ungrammatical, heartfelt narrative contains not a single comma either but don't be alarmed. The writing is straightforward, conversational and impassioned. The wild Australian landscape comes alive. Events tumble after one another. Punctuation would only blunt the force of Kelly's voice.<br />At pains to justify his life and considerate of his reader, Kelly cleans up expletive-studded dialogue without changing a word. Besides the usual dashes between first and last letters (b-----d, b----r), Carey's charming and original solution is the word &quot;adjectival.&quot; &quot;His hair were wild his face smudged with charcoal it were adjectival this and adjectival that.&quot; The effect is endearing.<br />The eldest of a large brood, Kelly begins with his childhood and moves forward chronologically to reveal the events that led to his fugitive state and drove him to outlawry on a grand scale. The man that emerges is ambitious and protective of his family, if a trifle hotheaded. A would-be farmer, frustrated by poverty and the active contempt of those in power- the English - for those at the bottom - the Irish, crime is all but forced upon him and being framed to fit is his lot in life.<br />His first crime, at age 10, was the killing of a landowner's pampered cow to feed the desperate Kelly family. His father, who did terrible time for something in Ireland, is at pains to avoid the police, but, though Ned confesses, his father is hauled off to jail and it breaks him. At 12, Ned is the man of the family, his father dead.<br />Ned's mother, Ellen, eager to take advantage of new homesteading laws, packs up the family. But the land is poor and while Ned struggles to transform it into a farm, Ellen runs an illegal still and welcomes a lively succession of beaus.<br />One of Ellen's men is bushranger (Australian for bandit) Harry Power who, with Ellen's connivance, takes on young Ned as an apprentice. Ned's unprofitable adventures in the bush, holding up coaches and landlords and running from hideout to hideout, instill no love of the outlaw life. Its discomforts and humiliations only reinforce his bent for farming.<br />But, what with poor land, insufficient funds and the incessant hounding of the police, it's not to be. The Kelly family lurches from crisis to crisis, their existence precarious. Ned falls in love but even this joy is cut short when his mother is unjustly jailed and Ned and his brother take to the bush. Here Ned comes into his own, newly mindful of Harry Power's wisdom. The law may never deliver justice, but his own people can be swayed by his exploits or, failing that, bought.<br />It's only now we realize Ned's need to be understood extends beyond his baby daughter. He writes lengthy letters, even attempts to highjack a printer to publish a 58-page plea, but is never allowed a public voice. So, seeing the end come hurtling toward him, he writes for posterity.<br />Carey's Ned Kelly is a complicated, earnest man. Is he a hero? He certainly arouses the reader's sympathy and outrage. He makes us laugh and root for escape, although we already know it's hopeless. He makes poor choices, acts impulsively, suffers from pride. In Carey's hands, at least, he is the sort of man myths are made from.<br />Carey's bush, like our Wild West, is full of swaggering villains, cowards, blowhards and hotheads. Of Kelly's associates and family, the most vivid are the women. Ned may not understand them, but Carey does. Though Ellen Kelly comes across as a practical, fun-loving, broken-hearted and strong-willed woman, Ned can't see beyond her role as Mother. He is similarly near-sighted with his sisters and lover, while Carey's skills reveal them.<br />Carey has done a masterful job of portraying a hardscrabble time and place through the eyes of one singular man. With virtuoso writing, real characters and a landscape so rough you can taste the dust, Carey may have defined the Kelly legend.rt of man myths are made from.<br />Carey's bush, like our Wild West, is full of swaggering villains, cowards, blowhards and hotheads.

As the police seek the murderer of a young female student in his neighborhood, Hubertus van Bijl reflects on his comfortable life and what it has come to.<br />Van Bijl's long-respected family history in the flower business culminates with him, a well-educated, well-off, respectable sort of man disappointed with his daughters and, by extension, himself. The narrator, he slips into the third person, to describe &quot;Bert's&quot; inabilities to cope with age and the changes in stolid Dutch society.<br />&quot;Bert&quot; strikes up a friendship with a young girl. &quot;Stupid Bert. Susceptible Bert.&quot; Has a brief affair before he loses the ability entirely in an operation for prostate cancer. It's &quot;Bert&quot; who rages furtively, accosts the wife of a friend, befriends the dead girl. The &quot;I&quot; remains aloof, tasteful and intelligent, maintaining a staunch allegiance to his athletic, conventional wife, a mild disdain toward his daughters, an indulgent smile for the antics of &quot;Bert.&quot;<br />Freeling, whose many awards include the Edgar, fleshes out his narrator with a sharp knife. His staccato style reveals a complex, layered man. Unable to articulate his fears and insecurities and rages, he expresses his disappointments by draping them on others and keeps much of his character hidden even from himself.<br />A well done, thoughtful portrait but it's been done before and van Bijl arouses little sympathy	2001-01-03

This vanished race also seems to have seeded the galaxy with humans - planetary populations who differ solely because of evolutionary isolation.<br />The newest discovery is a flower loving race who commune in planet-wide &quot;shared reality,&quot; a universal inability to lie, even by omission. Although shared universal empathy hardly seems an evolutionary advantage to the visiting humans, deviation from shared reality causes unbearable head pain. Those who cannot share reality - the mentally impaired - are killed at an early age. Others are excluded from shared reality - shunned -as punishment for their crimes.<br />Enli, punished for her brother's death, is one of these. Assigned to spy on the human scientists to determine if they are &quot;real,&quot; she gets involved beyond her sorriest imaginings. Meanwhile, the real mission, unbeknownst to the scientists, is a military study of an ancient artifact masquerading as one of the planet's moons. The military, engaged in an escalating, mysterious war, hopes it's a doomsday weapon.<br />Naturally all this is moving toward an explosive climax which Kress resolves handily in this volume while leaving plenty of intriguing questions for a future novel or two. Her characters and the planetary setting are well developed and the story moves at a brisk, suspenseful pace.	2001-01-03

Assassination teams are dispatched with dispatch. A &quot;permanent solution,&quot; is desirable and becomes more urgent when the nuclear-armed Nimitz disappears from the Atlantic.<br />Meanwhile Dr. Wes Martin and social worker Elizabeth Fox (last seen in &quot;Fragments,&quot; along with retarded savant Ralph who also makes a crucial appearance) are trying to help a group of unrelated people with a recurrent and debilitating dream of being aboard an empty ship in a desert.<br />The action moves these two groups and opposing agendas closer. Elizabeth determines to enter the dream as the government assassins decide to invade the ship where all will meet in a prolonged, fast-paced chase to the end.<br />While the government thugs are typical of their fictional (we hope) ilk, Foxworth and Martin are appealing characters doing fascinating work with extrasensory phenomenon and Ralph is a thoroughly likeable hero. The pace never flags, although there might be one villainous group too many - a mesmerized cult aboard the old ship.	2001-01-03

James Lockwood, sole survivor of the Royal Navy's secret mission to the forbidding continent. The doctor, directed to break through Lockwood's suspect amnesia and uncover the results of his top-secret mission, sympathizes with his patient's obvious trauma and recommends he be left alone.<br />Later, the case haunts him. &quot;I am afraid that if Lockwood keeps his secrets (whatever they are) perpetually bottled up, they will become an incubus, like a dead albatross tied for the rest of his life round his neck.&quot;<br />The novel then drops back to the beginning of the mission, ostensibly a military weather station, but also an urgent, secret hunt to find uranium for Britain's nuclear bomb project. Meanwhile, a German U-boat, forced south by an Allied ship, discovers the station and destroys it, killing everyone but the commander, John Ede, who is badly wounded, and two men out fetching rock samples, Lockwood and Petty-Officer Ramsden.<br />Returning to the devastation, Lockwood and Ramsden realize their only hope is to reach the Antarctic Peninsula before it's iced in - 200 miles in two or three weeks. Carrying their helpless commander and the uranium rock samples will render their task even more hopeless. But Lockwood cannot abandon Ede and Ede will not abandon the uranium, so the two able-bodied men take turns dragging the heavy sledge.<br />Weather favors them, giving rise to hope. Each day Ede grows weaker but remains alive. Ramsden, more practical than Lockwood but accustomed to following orders, would abandon Ede to save themselves and their mission but Lockwood will not. Their streak of luck falters, fails, and the continent batters them.<br />Marshall slowly strips Lockwood of the accoutrements of civilization - bodily comfort, companionship, food, light. Isolated in the frozen dark, on a continent abandoned by all forms of life, Lockwood falls back on the primal instinct to survive. His mind becomes his only solace and his greatest peril.<br />The vast, majestic, terrifying beauty of Antarctica comes alive in this penetrating and sympathetic portrayal of a man thrown upon his deepest resources. Instinct and spiritual epiphany meet and mesh in a manner impossible in civilized society, a contradiction Lockwood must reconcile upon his return. But can he? And if he could, would anyone understand?<br />Marshall's plain, simple style, and attention to detail, reflective of Lockwood's mind, makes a perfect foil for the immensity of the landscape and the man's ordeal.

2171856:US	52774618	R1P70WFCMPLQ8U	0679463046	79158641	Ghostwritten: A Novel	Books	5	82	89	N	N	A fearless feast of a book	Ambitious, complex, and intriguing, Mitchell's first novel grapples with the paradox of a small, vast world. His nine interlocking chapters (plus a tenth which circles back to the first) are narrated by a disparate lot from around the globe, connected sometimes by only a glimpse and a fleeting thought, sometimes by more fateful encounters. As the book proceeds, more connections become apparent, most of them random.<br />It's an intriguing organization, best followed by reading the book in one sitting, so as to keep track of the various plot threads and people. However, at 426 pages, this is unlikely for most readers.<br />But Mitchell's novel is more than a philosophical play on fate and chance and the six degrees of separation that radiate from us in all directions. The novel is filled with real characters, some venal and pathetic, some appealing, a few remote, one repellant. The settings range from self-consciously contemporary Hong Kong and earnest, teeming Tokyo to a tight-knit island off the Irish coast, the Mongolian desert, a remote Chinese mountain, a late-night radio station in New York, the streets of London and the bleak underside of post-Soviet St. Petersburg.<br />One narrator is a bent lawyer haunted (literally) by the ghost of a little girl, a pawn to his own greed, trapped by his estranged wife, his rapacious Chinese maid and his high-powered, crooked employer. Another is a self-deluded Russian woman, trying to escape her life by a big score in stolen art. The book opens with the fervid ramblings of a Japanese cult fanatic, a terrorist who planted poison gas on a Tokyo subway, and closes with the same or similar narrator.<br />A young musician and writer in London, whose life is adrift, saves a stranger from being rundown by a taxi, drifts some more, then makes the big decision he's been wrestling with all along. A young jazz musician in Tokyo, also adrift, makes a leap for love. A brilliant physicist whose discoveries are used in the Gulf War flees home to Ireland but is forced to succumb to the strong arm of the American military.<br />Some chapters are more successful than others. Which these are, however, is a matter of taste. The writing soars energetically throughout but styles, moods, even genres vary. Mitchell employs ghosts, apocalyptic scenarios, sociopathic thugs both criminal and sanctioned, as well as ordinary longings, ambitions, loves and failures.<br />An old Chinese woman narrates my favorite chapter. Her long and eventful life is lived entirely around her tea shack on a rural mountain path leading to a Buddhist temple. Here she is raped by a warlord and abused and despised by her lazy father. The Japanese invasion comes to her mountain and then the Chinese Nationalists, the Communists and the cadres of the Cultural Revolution each in turn bring violence and destruction to her life and livelihood. And each time she rebuilds her shack. She finds solace and companionship in a speaking tree and grows wise in the ways of the world without ever venturing into it. Hers is a marvelous voice, sharp without being hard, sardonic but never jaded, full of life and wit and complexity.<br />Another favorite is the chapter that follows, in which a transmigrating spirit goes on a pilgrimage to discover its origin and meaning. The spirit moves from person to person by touch and crosses Mongolia in pursuit of a folktale, inhabiting a Western tourist, a suspicious old peasant woman, a shaman, a vicious killer and more. Exploring the human psyche, it struggles to do no harm but its own goal remains paramount. Delightfully strange.<br />As for flaws: some characters are less well developed than others and the apocalyptic elements are jarring and unconvincing. The penultimate chapter brings us to the brink of World War III which may have been brought on by a well-meaning artificial (possibly) intelligence with godlike access to our technology. The transition from explorations of human nature, connections and chanceto a sci-fi parable is unconvincing at best.<br />But Mitchell writes with the confidence of an artist with no fear. He will try anything, no matter how fantastic or mundane. His writing switches from displays of virtuosity to sober meditation, his point-of-view from intimate exchange to global conspiracy.<br />An excellent, engaging book, sure to attract as much criticism as praise, which is by no means a bad thing.to a sci-fi parable is unconvincing at best.<br />But Mitchell writes with the confidence of an artist with no fear.

Panicked and disoriented she runs, seeking shelter in the woods, and is found by her lover who persuades her home. Lindsay's memory returns abruptly, except for the key moments of her attack. Also lost is her memory of the men who came to claim her from the hospital.<br /> None of which seems connected to the troubles at the Colorado mountains dig she joins in this fifth outing, &quot;Airtight Case.&quot; The head of the crew excavating the 1830s farmhouse site is under suspicion of murder and tension is high due to an autocratic, inexperienced assistant who, but for Lindsay, would have missed the two 1700s coffins oddly buried there.<br />Author Beverly Connor, herself an archaeologist, provides plenty of professional detail as well as a steadily intensifying plot, involving ancient as well as modern murder and greed. Lindsay Chamberlain, while likable and professionally expert, is almost too talented. She rises effortlessly to every task, from peacemaker to detective, and is never wrong, which can get wearing.

His tour of the renovation is as dull as expected until their guide rips the boards off an old fireplace, exposing a skeleton dating from previous rebuilding in the late 70s.<br />This is only the first of three bodies. The second is a suicide, a homeless man with a substantial bank account, but the third is a scion of the prominent Grieve family, an up-and-coming politician. The first two are parceled out to underlings (and lively, well-drawn characters they are) but Rebus gets young Roddy Grieve, killed on the parliament grounds. Only trouble his, Rebus is seconded to a young department prot&eacute;g&eacute;, an earnest, desk-bound go-getter (and ultimately a marvelous, scary character). For loner Rebus, this is no way to work.<br />Gruff, direct (some would say confrontational), with a sardonic sense of humor, Rebus is as hard drinking and broody as ever. Educated hunches and police footwork takes him and his team into the roughest alleys and pubs as well as the highest echelons of the privileged. In the intrigues and intricacies of high finance and corruption, Rebus begins to spy a pattern. But the unexpected release of Rebus' nemesis, crime boss Gerald Cafferty, exacerbate his difficulties with authority, threatening both case and career.<br />Though longer than Rankin's previous novels, there is no padding in the twisting, turning plot. Rankin (&quot;Dead Souls,&quot; &quot;Black and Blue&quot;) draws the reader into damp, gritty Edinburgh and Rebus, a man of dark depths, is the personification of the city. Well up to Rankin's award-winning standards, his vivid style has a trenchant immediacy.	2000-12-11

Playing one friend off against another, sneering at them all, Kate works hard at her dark persona. But there are cracks; things she hides within herself, such as her missing mother, her badly burned leg, a frightening recurrent dream, her longing for the love of a mother like Lydia's. Even the disturbing stare of a classmate, large, moony Moira, rattles her hard-won self-possession. But Kate shores herself up with her mantra - special, lucky, happy, brushing off doubts: &quot;Every family has to have rules.&quot;<br />But then something changes. Lydia meets Kate's father and Kate suddenly wonders what would happen if he had someone to focus on besides her. Being perfect, she admits, is difficult and no one knows the corrections her failures are subject to.

His latest, &quot;The Business,&quot; takes on the comedy of corporate globalization.<br />Narrator Kathryn Telman is &quot;a senior executive officer, third level (counting from the top) in a commercial organization which has had many different names through the ages but which, these days, we usually just refer to as the Business.&quot; Urbane and ambitious, Kate is a girl on her way up. She has a flippant, ruthless wit and an outspoken weakness for the vital concerns of the less fortunate masses, which has never prevented her from advancing the interests of her employer. Kate herself was plucked from bleak Scottish poverty at age 8 and groomed for success. Now, with her mother and benefactor both dead, Kate regards the Business with gratitude, loyalty, admiration and a sharp, observant eye. She will need all of these qualities for the new task the Business has set her.<br />The Business dates back to the Roman Empire (which it actually owned for a disastrous 66 days) and has a finger in almost everything, from the latest technologies to a collection of Michelangelo's pornographic paintings. Internally democratic - promotions are advanced by a vote of one's peers - the Business requires an atheistic oath from its management levels. Its highest level executives indulge themselves in hobbies firing barrages of heavy artillery and running derelict tankers aground.<br />Notwithstanding their costly lesson in running an empire, the Business feels its lack of political clout in this increasingly borderless world and hankers after a nation, something small and manageable with a seat at the United Nations and that ingenious smuggling tool, the diplomatic pouch.<br />Kate believes, like everyone else, that negotiations with a tiny Pacific Island are advancing despite occasional obstacles thrown up by the US and other nervous nations. But in a top-level meeting at a rambling Scottish castle she is informed that the island is a diversion. The Business has actually chosen a tiny Himalayan monarchy to acquire. And they've selected Kate to take charge; to go to Thulahn and judge how the Business's interests will mesh with those of the Thulahnese people.<br />Initially terrified by its terrain (landing requires serious aerobatics), appalled by its lack of amenities (no TV!), vicious weather, cantankerous Queen mother and sticky children, she is slowly won over by attributes that have nothing to do with business, only to discover that the Business has not - surprise - been entirely frank with her.<br />The fun is in the details - the little subplots, the maneuvering and manipulation, the over-the-top excesses (echoes of Richard Condon abound). Kate, by virtue of her lively narration, comes across as a real person who lives primarily by her wits. She's opinionated and articulate, sympathetic and humanistic, but not introspective. She lives in the moment and advances socialistic arguments at the dinner table while reveling in the prospect of her own private jet and a home on several continents.<br />The other characters are defined mostly by their excesses and eccentricities. Kate's true-love interest is bland and blurry while the Thulahn prince, in pursuit of Kate, is amiably pathetic.<br />Banks' energetic, imaginative prose and sharp wit bring the multinational corporate behemoth, if not to its knees, at least to its bottom line.a tiny Pacific Island are advancing despite occasional obstacles thrown up by the US and other nervous nations.

While not seriously wounded, Fielding must rely on Jeremy to lead the case, quickly complicated by another robbery and an accusation by the powerful victim, who demands the arrest of a distinguished black teacher.<br />Jeremy's voice, a perfect blend of oversensitive youth and resourceful investigator, animates this well-plotted tale of social and racial distinctions and prejudices and 1700s police procedure. Earnest and likeable, with just the right amount of hot-headed initiative and youthful misapprehensions, Jeremy is clever, humorous and observant. Smart as Jeremy is, though, only Sir John can put together the big picture.<br />Effortless prose, lifelike characters, a fast-paced plot and street scenes teeming with rogues and toffs make this a standout.	2000-11-13

Trouble is, there's nothing damning on the disks. But his efforts attract the notice of the FBI, the CIA, National Security and the cabal of villains who may themselves be part of the alphabet soup.<br />There's more flash than substance here but Sandford keeps the story hopping with plenty of action and clever stunts, high tech and low. Kidd and LuEllen are a likeable, if standoffish, duo and the writing is as pared down and smooth as a speeding Ferrari.	2000-11-13

Walter, a non hunter, is on a grouse hunt in the West Virginia mountains with two of his childhood buddies and a fourth man, the owner of the land - who ends up dead. Walter sees nothing to doubt in his friend Cliff's version of the accidental shooting but the country sheriff raises questions that culminate in Cliff's arrest.<br />A mild, correct man with social hankerings and a lonely but comfortable routine, Walter begins probing when his legal maneuvers fail. The real hunter of the group, Drake, brushes off his questions and Walter is wounded to discover Cliff confides more confidently in Drake than his lawyer.<br />The town's lofty pretensions and grubby secrets unfold as Walter doggedly pursues his case. A man who has invested his high opinion unwisely, reserving a low opinion for himself, Walter finds unsuspected reserves of quiet determination. Atmospheric, written with perfect pitch, Hoffman's (&quot;Tidewater Blood&quot;) novel successfully combines literary themes with suspenseful pacing.	2000-11-13

Grounded in psychological suspense,&quot;The Deepest Water&quot; explores the process of fiction and the sometimes inexplicable bond between father and daughter.<br />Defying her husband's jealousy and disapproval, Kate probes the blurred line between fact and fiction in her father's work, uncovering long buried secrets, discovering insights into herself and others, gaining new understanding of her father and moving ever closer to a dangerous, watchful murderer.<br />The novel is well-paced and plotted and Kate's almost obsessive digging seems a natural consequence of grief. The relationship between husband and wife seems shallow, however, the husband sketchily drawn and Kate's interactions with him sometimes overwrought. Nonetheless, this is an absorbing and rewarding thriller.	2000-11-13

Meanwhile, brooding Marxist stoic Emil Karpo and his unassuming partner Arkady Zelach investigate murder in a lab for paranormal research and Elena Timofeyeva (recently affianced to Rostnikov's son Iosef) and Sasha Tkach, his habitual depression overlaid by a peculiar euphoria since his life has bottomed out, are sent to recover a a great Russian epic film being held for exorbitant ransom.<br />The character-driven narrative shifts from case to case, encompassing the points of view of each investigator as well as various witnesses, victims and villains. The tone is a cross between Ed McBain's 87th Precinct (a particular favorite of Rostnikov's) and the Zen practicality of Janwillem van de Wetering. Personal developments entwine with investigations and everything is complicated by the daily difficulties of Russian life and occasional political incursions.<br />Kaminsky, who also writes the Toby Peters and Abe Lieberman series, delivers another well-constructed, well-written entertainment.	2000-11-09

Her parents dead, Amanda's sister Mathilde lives there with her three-year-old daughter Ruth, waiting for her soldier husband Carl to come home from a French hospital. Over the summer, the sisters move to the house Carl built on the lake island Amanda has always thought of as hers. Then, shortly before Carl's return, Mattie dies, drowns in the lake under mysterious circumstances.<br />The child, Ruth, remembers that she drowned too, a claim Aunt Amanda dismisses as a dream. &quot;But Ruth maintained that she had drowned, insisted on it for years, even after she should have known better.&quot;<br />His leg badly wounded, Carl, bewildered and grieved, faces a difficult child who doesn't remember him and a sister-in-law who has everything well in hand and impatiently checks his questions about Mattie's drowning.<br />The story is told through various points of view, primarily Amanda's and Ruth's, but other characters as well, from Ruth's schoofriend to the wife of Amanda's former lover, Clement, a man the reader is unaware of until a chance meeting preceeds Amanda's second breakdown.<br />The details of the devastating affair emerge in bits, remembered very differently by Clement and Amanda, while Carl's memories of his marriage blur and give way to brooding suspicions and little Ruth excersizes a child's power over her world through willful stubborness.<br />Schwarz reveals her characters through flashback memories - Amanda and Mattie's childhood and Carl's fears of inadequacy, and through the guilt and love that shape and drive each of them. She examines the roles of shame and secrecy and the reverberations of these powerful motivators in the lives of innocents.<br />The innocent at the core, Ruth, exerts more control over her life as she grows and seizes a more central role in the novel. Torn between loyalty to Amanda and her own drive for independence, Ruth makes clandestine visits to the lake island where she last lived with her mother, seeking signs of her there. Moody and unsocial, she is ignored at school until one popular girl befriends her. Unwilling to return to her friendless state, Ruth endlessly entertains Imogene, who, she realizes, craves drama. &quot;It took a lot of effort, sometimes, to have Imogene for a friend.&quot;<br />Amanda struggles to contain herself, to allow Ruth her own life. But she has kept so much bottled up that a spark of disobedience can blow apart her carefully constructed normalcy - the everyday aspect of a woman without secrets. When Amanda loses control it's scary and dangerous, giving rise to questions: Have the events of her life unbalanced her? Or was she so precariously poised that all she needed was a nudge?

America begins to stir after the long Depression while Europe stands on the brink of devastating war. Sinister forces descend on Europe's Jews while comic book superheroes capture a generation of American boys. Funny, heartbreaking and delightfully intense, Michael Chabon's inventive eloquence gives voice to a big, broad, tumultuous world.<br />&quot;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay&quot; opens with a lookback, from the bully pulpit of comic book conventions, of Sam Clay boasting that his boyhood, &quot;sealed and hog-tied inside the airtight vessel known as Brooklyn, New York...had been haunted by dreams of Harry Houdini.&quot; This is not quite accurate, Chabon lets us know, and turns to that night in 1939 when the story begins. But these few paragraphs stick in the reader's mind, providing the comfort that Clay, at least, emerges from the turbulence of the novel's events to bask in nostalgic glory at some later date.<br />That 1939 night, Samuel Klayman's mother wakes him and orders him to make room for his newly arrived Czech cousin Josef Kavalier, a thin young man with a somber air. Josef, an academy trained artist and a magician, schooled in Houdini-style escapes, has escaped his crumbling Czech world in a coffin with the Golem of Prague. The Nazis derailed a more conventional exit, financed by his family's entire savings, and Josef is consumed with worry for those left behind, especially his younger brother, Thomas.<br />Sammy already thinks of himself as Sam Clay, a non-ethnic, American success. A generous, ambitious soul, hoping to break into the budding mania for comic books, Sam recognizes his cousin's greater artistic talent and presents him to his boss, together with a proposition for a new superhero. Fueled by coffee and cigarettes, and by Sammy's drive to achieve the American dream of riches and fame and Joe's determination to rescue his family, the pair creates a fabulously successful new hero, the Escapist, a Houdiniesque character crusading against Hitler's tyranny.<br />Sammy has an unexpected genius for comic book plots and characters while Joe's talent and fever to win the war, even if only on paper, lead him to new heights of invention and design, culminating in the daring Luna Moth, a female superhero inspired by Rosa Saks, Joe's love, herself a beautiful and eccentric artist. Fabulous characters and stories arise from their heroic fantasies, striking a chord with the youth of America, making them rich, though not as rich as their employers, who own the characters outright.<br />There's a lot going on here as the American romance with money and consumerism turns a blind eye to sinister developments in Europe. Chabon explores the ambivalence of American Jews at the war's outset - caught by their own worldly ambitions between American isolationism and the early rumors of Holocaust. The mechanics of Joe's daring escape from the Nazis reveal the sad, helpless docility of the Jews left behind. His life in New York is an exhilarating fantasy and a desperate wasteland. Hope lifts him again and again as new schemes for rescuing his family are set in motion and love expands his outlook and every week he wins the war on the comic pages.<br />Flashbacks and shifting points of view illuminate Joe's and Sammy's early life and evolution as well as private dreams and fears. Joe discovers that all his money can't pry his family out of Czechoslovakia. Sammy discovers that wealth won't cure loneliness.<br />As the joys of success give way to personal failures, the cousins deal with seminal crises in their very different ways. Joe chooses escape, Sammy rejects escape. And the story's barely half way through.<br />Before Chabon (&quot;Wonder Boys,&quot; &quot;Werewolves in Their Youth&quot;) is done, he explores most of the issues that preoccupied America through the fifties, takes his characters to their emotional limits and beyond, carries his readers from laughter to tears and back again. His writing is strong, lighthearted, brutal and breathtaking and there is much to engage the heart and the imagination in every corner of his broad, vibrant canvas.ing is strong, lighthearted, brutal and breathtaking and there is much to engage the heart and the imagination in every corner of his broad, vibrant canvas.	2000-10-30

Campbell is getting his life back together in the remote village of Newenham, breaking in his ambitious new subordinate Diana Prince and cementing his precarious relationship with bush pilot Wyanet Chouinard and her adopted son, when murder shatters the peace.<br />First it's the postmistress of an isolated outpost, then a gold prospector, his wife gone missing. But when a third body turns up on Wyanet's route, Campbell has to suspect a serial rampage. The narrative moves between Campbell's point of view and that of the murderer and his victims, keeping the reader a few steps ahead of the cop, establishing a pattern that Campbell must crack before more people die.<br />Plenty of suspense keeps the pace lively and numerous subplots concerning Wy's son's abusive birthmother, the beaten teenaged wife of a local politician, out-of-town visitors, and the hunting, trapping and drinking activities of the native population supply pathos and humor, hope, despair and a richly detailed background. Stabenow keeps getting better.	2000-10-22

The teen happens to be the daughter of Banks' hated nemesis, his stiffly ambitious superior, Chief Constable Riddle, who asks Banks to go to London, unofficially, and find her. This he does, and brings lively, bratty Emily back home too, cultivating a soft spot for a girl going the way his own daughter might have.<br />The murder of a low-life criminal diverts Banks' attention until a gruesome death in a local nightclub finds Banks seeking connections with London's organized crime and delving into his superior's personal life. The plot is fine although nothing new but the misunderstandings and non-communication between Banks and Cabot grow wearing and we are treated to far too much middle-aged soul searching. Not one of Robinson's best.	2000-10-22

In 1359 BC Egypt, a young, dedicated physician helps former Queen Nefertiti birth a girl, daughter of Ramose, a high priest.<br /> At a Denver museum, medical illustrator Kate McKinnon feels an odd affinity with a young Egyptian woman, whose mummified corpse presents a baffling host of questions. X-rays show broken ribs, a shattered hand and, most amazing of all, a man's severed head lying between her legs.<br />As radiologist Max Cavanaugh helps Kate with the latest imaging techniques and Kate combines her forensic skills with her knowledge of Egyptology, the parallel story explores Aset's life growing up in an atmosphere of palace intrigue and excess, the physician her friend, teacher and protector. Thurston weaves the machinations of history against a background filled with ancient medical technique and details of daily living.<br />The modern sections are equally substantial. Technology and academic knowledge combine to penetrate the mystery - the painstaking interpretation of hieroglyphs and scenes painted on the sarcophagus, cat-scan readings of the bones, computer imaging to rebuild the face, even flashes of inspired intuition.<br />An intriguing premise, filled with fascinating detail. Where the story runs into problems is in the relationships, ancient and modern, between the heroes and heroines. Stilted dialogue and over-labored internalizations threaten to mire the characters in fretful introspection rather than passion. But fans of Egyptology and forensic medicine will find much to applaud.	2000-10-22

But a new female chief with a bent for community relations and a nosy reporter with ambitions to detect soon complicate his straightforward investigation. Then a pesky American professor, hot on the trail of Mary Shelley's &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; energetically re-educating Bathians about their city, stumbles into Diamond's purview when a disappearance and a fresh corpse bring this hilarious subplot to the forefront.<br />With his preference for old-fashioned methods, his acerbic, ready wit and his low tolerance for fools and bores, Diamond drives Lovesey's narrative rather more easily than he steers a case burgeoning with schemers, haughty collectors and red herrings. Plot twists and complications keep the reader guessing but it's Diamond's big presence and dominant personality that makes this series (&quot;The Last Detective,&quot; &quot;The Summons&quot;), from the award-winning author of the Victorian Sergeant Cribb series (&quot;Wobble to Death&quot; &quot;Abracadaver&quot;), a standout.	2000-10-22

Derisively dubbed Scuffletown by its &quot;mack&quot; neighbors (Scottish farmers mostly), known as &quot;the settlement&quot; to its inhabitants, the area subsists on turpentine manufacture, which has come to a halt with the war.<br />Narrator Rhoda Strong recalls those days of upheaval, tragedy and love from the vantagepoint of her middle years. She was 16, daughter of a stalwart Scuffletown woman and an outsider, a Scot, weaned from drinking by his wife and subject to bouts of depression.<br />As the story opens, Rhoda's mother, Cee, keeps the family inside their one-room, windowless (&quot;because Cee said we're only inside at night and what good is a window then? Just one more thing to lock up.&quot;) cabin in the heat of summer to protect them, especially Rhoda's two brothers, from the Home Guard. The Home Guard is made up of  &quot;mack&quot; neighbors, determined to spare their own boys by conscripting Scuffletown youth for forced labor at the Confederate forts and salt works.<br />It's a lawless time in the backcountry and the sadistic head of the Home Guard rules with impunity. After he kills two boys who escaped from the work gangs, Scuffletown's young men take to the woods, under the leadership of Henry Berry Lowrie, a charismatic, focused young man admired by the whole community, secretly loved by Rhoda.<br />But Cee is adamantly against the match, though she believes Henry &quot;could turn out to be the best we've got. The best we've ever seen.&quot; This naturally confuses Rhoda, but her mother explains: &quot;You want an ordinary man with a little flaw. A hurt, a weakness somewhere. Then you can be a helpmeet, and you'll have a bond. That's a man who'll give you some security, in return for what you give him. But what could you do for a man like Henry? What does he need that only you could provide? Nothing.&quot;<br />Cee also worries that Henry's leadership, a boon when times are good, could tear apart the community if he meets the violence they suffer with violence of his own.

An artificial kidney makes him one of the &quot;young old&quot; facing a long, slow decline in a California where months of violent storms alternate with months of baking heat. A former radical environmentalist, he now runs a menagerie of endangered species for a pop star, a reservoir for zoo-cloning in a world where mammals - save burgeoning populations of rats and humans, are rapidly going extinct. Into this bleak, resigned existence comes a blast from the past - his ex-wife Andrea, a former star of the environmental movement, out of his life for 20 years.<br />&quot;I'm out feeding the hyena her kibble and chicken backs and doing what I can to clean up after the latest storm, when the call comes through.... there are trees down everywhere and the muck is tugging at my gum boots like a greedy sucking mouth, a mouth that's going to pull me all the way down eventually, but not yet.&quot;<br />They celebrate their reunion with the last can of extinct Alaskan crab. But Andrea, still sexy at 67, has an agenda. She wants Ty to help put a book together on his martyred daughter, Sierra. The memories flood back, beginning with the 1989 fiasco which introduced 13-year-old Sierra to radical environmentalism - the time he and Andrea and Sierra plunged their feet into wet cement at the top of a logging road to protest the cutting of old growth forests.<br />The story alternates between third person accounts of love and strife and frustration in the late 20th century and Ty's present-tense 2025 narration of shoring up against imminent collapse. This near-future narration is manic. Sentences tumble and run, the language flows vivid and tactile, the world impinges urgently and viciously on daily life.<br />The past emerges in a more conventional, anecdotal style. Bringing up Sierra, making his marriage work, miring himself deeper in a movement not really his own. Ty's remembrance of his life is anything but heroic. Ty came to environmentalism through his sexual attraction to Andrea. Lonely, his beloved first wife dead of a bee sting (all his loved ones, it seems, are felled by nature) Ty adopted Andrea's causes as his own. But when things go wrong, anger, helplessness, and desire for revenge fuel his increasingly radical actions. Clueless Ty, trying to make his mark in the world, longs to be a strong father, a good husband, a principled man, but anger and boredom and opportunistic, scheming Andrea, goad him.<br />Meanwhile, Sierra has the makings of a true idealist. As a child she starved herself for days rather than eat the meat her father placed in front of her. Energized by her father's predicaments, she stops wearing make-up (animal testing), becomes a vegan and wholly embraces non-violent activism, becoming, literally, a tree hugger.<br />In Ty's day environmentalism was a passion for such idealists, or a fashionable avocation for dilettantes. The dangers were distant, intellectual, the demands of suburban life more urgent. But now, in 2025, floods collapse the condos and the animals' pens. Mangy lions and hyenas and warthogs are herded desperately indoors to shelter in the pop star's mansion and feed on a freezer of prized meat, the last in the world.<br />Boyle spares no one in this savagely hilarious portrait. Not the BMW-driving, manipulative, well-dressed environmentalists (Ty and Andrea, as a publicity stunt, shed their clothes and plunge into the woods to live naked off the land for a month - you'll fall off your chair laughing). Not the sneering, smug sheriffs and deputies or the celebrities hyped on the latest cause or the baying packs of journalists. Even gentle, serious Sierra is not spared.<br />But amid the hilarity and savaging, there is genuine affection for his flawed characters who never give up hope no matter how black things get. Boyle gives us an imaginative, exuberant wake-up call which will make you shiver while you laugh.r give up hope no matter how black things get.

A graceful, deliberate writer, the shifting, elusive boundary between inner and outer reality and the power of self-delusion animates his unusual, character driven novels.<br />Cultural displacement and youthful trauma contribute to the character of Christopher Banks, the narrator of &quot;When We Were Orphans.&quot; An English boy born in Shanghai at the turn of the 19th century, Christopher lives a protected, idyllic life in the Foreign Settlement until first his father, then his mother vanish mysteriously when he is 10. Shipped off to the English &quot;home&quot; he has never seen, to live with an aunt he has never met, Christopher studies Englishness and works to fit in, guided by his single-minded vocation to become a &quot;great detective&quot; and eventually solve the mystery of his parents' disappearance.<br />The book opens in 1930, with Christopher satisfactorily established in his detective career, looking back on his post-Cambridge start. Correctly English, reserved and self-possessed, he notes with irritation the inaccurate memories of old schoolmates who remember him as an &quot;odd bird&quot; at school, &quot;since my own memory is that I blended perfectly into English school life.&quot; Indeed, he has always prided himself on his quick assimilation of mannerisms, turns of phrase and other trappings of Englishness. But the first cracks in the reliability of his narration have appeared.<br />Social advancement attests to his vocational success. He tells us of triumphant cases but we never see him at work or know what his cases are about. Instead the increasingly distinguished events he attends provide the proofs of his success. The most socially grasping socialite in London, a woman who routinely snubbed him in his early years, now seeks his society. In a quickly regretted moment of pride and vengeance, Christopher snubs her. Apologizing, he learns she, too, is an orphan and she explains that what he views as her ruthless social climbing is actually &quot;ambition.&quot;<br />&quot;When I marry, it will be to someone who'll really contribute. I mean to humanity, to a better world. Is that such an awful ambition? I don't come to places like this in search of famous men, Christopher. I come in search of distinguished ones.&quot;<br />All of this, inevitably, is leading to Christopher's return to Shanghai. It's 1937. The world is on the brink of war and the Japanese are invading China, which is already torn by civil strife between nationalists and communists. Christopher leaves behind the orphan girl he adopted and pursues his greatest triumph - the rescue of his parents from their 20-year imprisonment and the saving of the world from evil. Does he somehow think finding his parents will end the prospect of world war? And who is the odd English official who follows him around seeking Christopher's advice on where to hold the party celebrating his parents' return?<br />Like an opium dream (and opium is the scourge of relations between Europe and China), the boundaries between fantasy and reality become hopelessly blurred as Christopher plunges into the maelstrom of the Shanghai underworld, political factions and history. Between blunders, rages and mysterious meetings, Christopher recalls the world of his youth.<br />Even as a boy he understood that his comfortable, idyllic life was a thing apart from the reality of Shanghai. Warned against leaving the foreign compound, he catches glimpses of the misery of homeless, opium-addicted Chinese. In his own home, long periods of cold silence between his parents ripple the placid surface of his existence. Though his father earns a comfortable living with a company that supports the opium trade, his mother is an avid crusader against it.<br />In the recollections of his youth, Christopher seems on solid ground. His father remains a blurred, remote figure but his mother emerges as avibrant, fierce and gentle person. In the unsettled time between his father's and his mother's disappearance, Christopher plays detective with his best friend Akira, a Japanese boy whose brief brush with life in his native country leaves him in terror of being sent back. It's Akira who inspired Christopher to his life's pursuit yet his search for his boyhood friend is surprisingly desultory and haphazard.<br />Memories, though blurred by time or skewed by a child's perception, provide the rational background for an increasingly irrational present. Yet, what seems delusion is often unexpectedly confirmed by an outside source. The overall impression is a Kafka-like confusion. What is true, what delusion? We expect a book to tell us, to fit the big picture into a manageable frame, to leave us with a sense of wholeness and completion. Ishiguro leaves the reader wondering. Is he saying we are all products of a big picture no one can accurately see? Or of our own unreliable narration? You decide. The journey is worth the uncertainty.vibrant, fierce and gentle person.

Narrator Jack Flynn, reporter at  the Washington bureau of a large Boston newspaper, making queries about a  presidential pardon of a Massachusetts armed robber, is invited to play  golf with President Clayton Hutchins (who, like Gerald Ford, has become  president without a vote cast).<br />Jack takes it in stride when Hutchins,  confident of victory in the upcoming election, offers him the job of Press  Secretary. But minutes later shots are fired and he and the president are  both wounded, Jack more seriously than Hutchins. The shooter is killed on  the spot.<br />But a bullet wound isn't likely to deflect Jack from a story as  big as an assassination attempt, especially after an anonymous call warns  him to believe nothing he's told. As both witness and reporter, Jack has  personal access to the FBI investigation but further cryptic calls lead him  to believe the official investigation is a cover-up. Off-the-record hints  guide him to a militia stronghold in Idaho, the Boston underworld and  several more brushes with death.<br />Murder, mayhem and conspiracy keep the  plot moving between deadlines, journalistic ethics and moral expediency to  a solution which - after a story focusing on the glare of media attention -  seems downright unbelievable. Credibility aside, many readers will enjoy  the authentic, insider's view of investigative journalism and Jack, though  sometimes too full of himself (but I suppose a really ambitious reporter  would have to be), is a driven protagonist with a sad past and romantic  possibilities.	2000-09-18

After a long  run of deadends in his brief career, Brad seizes on this tidbit like a dog  on a bone and begins tracing his lead, with the help of septuagenarian  Myrna Rashevsky, a delightful CIA veteran who knows all the agency nooks  and crannies and computer passwords.<br />The pair set off alarm bells and  Brad is fed an unsatisfactory story and forcefully reassigned. But he's a  man on a mission who won't be stopped, despite his affection and loyalty  toward his boss, whose involvement in this long-ago affair is raising  uncomfortable questions about just how far the CIA will go to avoid a  political scandal.<br />Brad leaves behind his job and his girlfriend (Cabot's  niece) to chase his scraps and hints through the halls of the CIA, the  ranks of the Israeli Mossad and into the prison cell of Aldrich Ames, aided  and cautioned by the indomitable Myrna.<br />Meanwhile, Brad's girlfriend,  Cabot's niece, furious with Brad's bullheaded pursuit of an ancient rumor,  allies herself with a cutthroat New York Times investigative reporter who  sees a chance to pursue romance and an explosive story, while Cabot's  alcoholic wife's behavior and bitterness further derails his chances and a  couple of crazed Vietnam militiamen plot a terrorist attack.<br />The result  is a full-blown Washington circus bristling with manipulation, maneuvering,  lies, cover-ups and cynical ambition. It all rings surprisingly true. The  pace is more concerned with the intricate maneuverings of the participants  and the layers of obfuscation than with suspense. But the machinations of  the clever, ruthless, backstabbing people running the country generates its  own suspense.<br />Brad is a likable, believable protagonist whose dedication  to his idealistic mission is a breath of fresh air. The climax seems highly  farfetched but Powers writes with enough conviction to make it all, just  barely, credible. A fine read from a man who sounds like he knows what he's  talking about.of crazed Vietnam militiamen plot a terrorist attack.<br />The result  is a full-blown Washington circus bristling with manipulation, maneuvering,  lies, cover-ups and cynical ambition.

Then an old man who writes bird poetry is  impaled on sharpened bamboo stakes embedded in a ditch on his property  while the woman watches from his bird tower.<br />Wallander, just home from a  pleasant trip to Italy with his father, a rejuvenation of their taciturn  relationship, investigates a break-in at a flower shop from which nothing  was taken, receives reports of a growing vigilante militia movement and  eventually discovers the body of the bird poet. Meanwhile the reader learns  that the flower shop proprietor is a captive, slowly starving. He is  missing more than a week - supposedly on an orchid-buying trip - before  anyone realizes.<br />The grisly narrative builds slowly, in plain, unhurried  cadences. The fits, starts and frustrations of police procedure mingle with  Wallander's concerns for his father and plans for a future with his lover,  Baiba - all against a thrum of background tension - the bound, terrified  man, the woman ticking off plans on a meticulous schedule, selecting her  next victim.<br />As the murder count rises, Wallander and his team delve into  the background of the victims, uncovering dark secrets, making tenuous  connections, inching toward a solution that horrifies them all. Mankell's  (&quot;Fearless Killers,&quot; &quot;Sidetracked&quot;) plot organization  and pacing is masterful and his perplexing, atmospheric story is all the  more gripping delivered in measured, understated prose.	2000-09-05

Purcell's intimidated victim, a frightened, hard-mouthed pimp,  tells Robicheaux his mother was murdered by two cops, still on the job. But  the pimp is murdered before Robicheaux can find out more and his killer, a  clever, polite, psychopath, befriends Robicheaux's adopted  daughter.<br />Meanwhile, death-row convict Letty Labiche is scheduled for  execution. Robicheaux, convinced he could have saved her and her twin from  the sexual abuse they suffered as children, if he hadn't been such a  worthless drunk at the time, scrambles to find new evidence to save  her.<br />The emotional content of the two cases gives rise to such heights of  southern male brooding and violent impulses, heavily accompanied by  deep-south olfactory sensation, that the mood-laden prose gets in the way  of a complex, suspenseful story of childhood loss, class and race  arrogance, greed, murder, callousness, and death-row politics.	2000-09-05

Jumping at the chance to investigate the death of a physical  therapist at an alternative-medicine spa, her zealousness in seeing murder  where her superiors have determined suicide soon lands her in  trouble.<br />Taking the case to Brock, she is delighted when he agrees to  investigate unofficially, from the inside, as a patient. The narrative  switches to Brock's point-of-view as he enters a regimen of fasting and  acupuncture under the watchful eye of the charismatic, pretentious director  and his coldly efficient wife while asking nosy questions of suspicious and  vulnerable patients.<br />A second, horrific death, which points a bloody  finger at Brock, spins the narrative back to Kathy, who is abruptly  suspended and thrown onto the resources of her heretofore nonexistent  private life (introducing new characters who will certainly flesh out the  background of the next book). The pair teams up again for a spectacular and  surprising finale with plenty of fast footwork and bloody drama.<br />Likeable  protagonists, effective secondary characters, a wryly humorous style and a  well-paced plot make Maitland's (The Marx Sisters&quot;) series a growing  pleasure.	2000-09-05

Van Wagoner, struck by the coincidental death of the  victim's son in a plane crash the same night, takes that angle but he's  hampered by a terrible secret - unbeknownst to Reilly or anyone else, he  killed the man who murdered her husband.<br />Nicole and her hapless mother  are sympathetically drawn and the story is an absorbing one with a surprise  ending but the real meat here is the continuing development of Reilly, her  pubescent son and Van Wagoner. O'Shaughnessy gets better with every book  and this one will have you thinking about the next as you turn the last  satisfying page.	2000-09-05

With each new day and death he remembers more of his own life  and violent end.<br />Death's previous assistant, Hades, died in one of the  few ways available to immortals - a violent evisceration - and the  circumstances are shrouded in mystery, not that his replacement cares much  at first. Selected by lot, corpse 72 18 9 11 12 13 49 is a reluctant  zombie, longing for the quiet uneventfulness of his grave, then with  increasing alertness, for life. His own time ended at age 28, suddenly, in  a fall from a roof. He remembers the panic, the disbelief, the instant of  knowledge and not much more.<br />But each day, Death requires his assistance  in one fatal act. At the end of the week he can choose his own return to  the grave from one of these: a fall from a great height, poisoned candy, a  misfortunate series of accidents, death by machine, death by insects,  asphyxiation, skinning. Each one more gruesome than the one before, each  pointless, having the same end.<br />Death himself takes no pleasure in his  work but methodically follows directives from the Chief, a faceless,  possibly malicious, possibly nonexistent director whose files the narrator  peruses as the mishaps and failures of his life resolve in greater detail  in his mind, along with moments of love, sadness and waste. As his life -  and death - unfolds inside him, filling out his memories, he begins to have  opinions about the work. War and Pestilence enjoy their jobs, striving for  greater mayhem and inventive agony, respectively. Famine is merely  humorless and lugubrious, Death is bored.<br />Wacky, pointed, sinister and  satirical, Houghton's novel moves at a brisk, grisly pace. Yet, as the  zombie protagonist quickens, the narrative clings to hope and, well, life,  in all its imperfections. Though Houghton's first novel, &quot;The Dinner  Party,&quot; has not been published in the US, his sharp observations and  spare, colorful prose make him a writer to watch.cal, Houghton's novel moves at a brisk, grisly pace.

Embarrassed by his prosaic death (from cancer at age 50) and his  inconclusive final utterance, &quot;I wish,&quot; he initially fabricates a  more bloody and dramatic ending and, unmasked, storms off in a huff. His  life then passes before us in a series of vignettes, beginning with his  slow dying while the backyard birds make nests of his discarded hair and  ending with an innocent act of simple heroism at age 10.<br />Each chapter  reveals an emotionally pivotal moment in Ray's life - his wife's infidelity  and the near break-up of his marriage, the treehouse he built for his son  and used himself as a drinking refuge, his sexual confusion, early  relationships, one-night stands, childhood mysteries. The chapters are  complete stories; some brief and poignant, some more complex, revealing  harrowing secrets - jolting the reader and Ray too.<br />Williams' comic touch  is sometimes gentle, even sad, other times prickly and nightmarish. In one  incident Ray hits a dog with his car and rather than driving on, stops,  finds the dog's address from its tag and visits the animal's owners,  thereby embroiling himself in an ugly, absurd scene between a warring  couple.<br />Ray is no angel. Often clueless, he is occasionally cruel,  subject to the buffets of fate and capable of acts of spontaneous  generosity. Wallace's (&quot;Big Fish&quot;) rendering of him is sharp but  empathetic, making his story compelling and real. The completeness of the  vignettes sometimes leaves loose ends dangling, conveying the feeling that  Ray has compartmentalized his life to avoid the mysteries of his own  nature. The reverse structure reinforces this - showing how Ray got to  where he ended up - not from a progression of events so much as the  natural, halting, unknowable vicissitudes of one man's human nature.	2000-08-28

But when their father dies, Lotte, also  suffering from TB, is taken to Holland by Dutch relatives and Anna, the  stronger, is sent to her grandfather's pig farm in rural Germany. Lotte's  letters are kept from Anna, who is regarded as cheap labor on the farm,  and, while the two meet briefly as adults, they remain strangers until  thrown together at the spa in Belgium where both have gone for treatment of  arthritis.<br />Anna, always more boisterous and gregarious, pursues a  reconciliation with her quieter sister, who is embittered by the war and  resistant to all things German. Anna disliked Nazism but went along. When  she met and fell in love with a reluctant Austrian soldier, he accepted SS  officer training in order to be temporarily close to her. He eventually  died in a bombing attack. Lotte fell in love with a Jew who died in a  concentration camp. At great risk, her family hid Jews during the war.<br />But these are the broad outlines of their lives. As they tell each other  their stories, the color and shading emerges, painting a vivid, tumultuous,  sometimes horrific picture of lives shaped by war. Interwoven with the  moods and melancholy of old age, the sisters' narratives begin tentatively.  Anna gives hints of the privations she suffered at the pig farm, Lotte  recalls a better life with siblings and school and loving parents.<br />As  personal bitterness and long held grudges surface, the anecdotes become  pointed, fueled by anger or hurt, or more pensive, plaintive ruminations of  deprivation and what might have been. Anna's childhood is revealed as a  bleak, loveless time of backbreaking drudgery and humiliation. The local  priest offered the only hope and at last was instrumental in extracting her  from her relatives, providing an education and finding her work as a  servant. Lotte's childhood, while loving, was dominated by a monumentally  selfish uncle whose obsession with music inexplicably excluded his niece's  beautiful singing voice, which the war then crushed.<br />As the girls come of  age, the world explodes into war. Without hammering the point home, De Loo  explores the poignancy of this timing - their first forays into the wider  world, into love, independence and responsibility, are hesitant steps into  chaos and increasing ugliness.<br />Nor does De Loo allow the immense,  horrific backdrop of war subsume the girls' individuality. The war is all  consuming but Lotte and Anna struggle within its confines to grow and love.  War batters their youth and shapes their future but at their core, they  remain true to their natures.<br />Anna, yearning for reconciliation, but not  one to plead, batters at Lotte's defenses with honest, sometimes painful  revelations, charting her course from beaten slave to servant to the rich,  to widow, to Red Cross nurse and prisoner-of-war. Anna's exasperation takes  the form of scorn for Lotte's easier passage through life and war. Lotte,  after all, had parents, a husband, children. Anna, barren from a savage  beating in childhood, had only herself.<br />Lotte, wrapped in righteousness,  remains convinced she would have been more resistant to the Nazis. For her,  war was a time of bravery and terrible tension - fear of the occupiers,  fear of local betrayal, scrambles to hide the refugees whose capture would  mean death for them all. As the war went on, hunger loomed almost as large,  spurring breathtaking risks for a loaf of bread, a sack of grain.<br />Back  and forth, De Loo engages the emotions of the reader for both her  protagonists, involving us in their bickering andthe catharsis they both  crave. Her prose, beautifully translated from the Dutch by Ruth Levitt,  raises unanswerable questions and explores complex ambiguities of identity  and blood and choice.

Decker takes a back seat and Rina makes only brief  appearances as Peter's daughter Cynthia, an ambitious, impetuous rookie  cop, struggles to fit in and prove her independence from her illustrious  father.<br />Subtle disturbances, hostility at work and a feeling of being  stalked, initially put down to imagination, escalate into a savage  vandalization of her apartment and a dangerous chase on the freeway. Is it  some not-so-innocent rookie initiation or an attempt to warn her off the  investigation of the carjacking murder of a real-estate tycoon?<br />The plot,  riddled with mysteries and twists, involves intersecting investigations and  in-house suspicion. Well-paced action heightens as Cindy's life grows  increasingly tangled - a protective/romantic liaison with her father's  colleague, clandestine investigations of her co-workers and the murdered  man, a mounting log of secrets from her father and frictions at work. Quick  thinking but rash, Cindy makes lots of mistakes, leading to a careening,  breathtaking climax in the California hills.

The sixth  to be published here, &quot;The Unquiet Night&quot; focuses on a woman and  child in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br />A young man, Mart, strangles  a disrespectful pick-up date and dumps her body in the lake at a nature  reserve. Leaving, he spies a woman with a playing child. Their eyes  meet.<br />Putting the nervous fellow from her mind, Rachel Penghill takes her  niece home, her mind on her unhappy love life and her new business, unaware  she has panicked a killer who is now feverishly tracking her.<br />Point of  view shifts primarily between Rachel and her stalker but also encompasses  other players - the mother spooked by a strange man's phone call to her  nine-year-old daughter, the radio newsman determined to protect Rachel from  involvement in his uncertain prospects, the policeman jaded by human  nature. Tension mounts as luck, weather and circumstance form a suspenseful  counterpoint to the killer's cold-blooded deviousness, culminating in an  agonizing, protracted climax.<br />This is classic Carlon - a compact, sparely  written story with well-drawn characters. Rachel is appealing and  resourceful while the killer is deeply chilling yet pitiful.	2000-08-15

Oxford Professor  Tamar's gender (as well as height, complexion, build and every other  personal detail) remains a mystery in Caudwell's last, &quot;The Sibyl In  Her Grave,&quot; and the writing is as precise, elegant, urbane, witty and  polished as any fan could hope.<br />Introducing the story, Tamar addresses  the issue of personal appearance, admitting that some readers have  expressed an interest. &quot;I do not doubt, however, that these enquiries  are made purely as a matter of courtesy and to take them au pied de la  lettre would be as grave a solecism as to answer a polite 'How do you do,  Professor Tamar?' with a full account of the state of my  digestion.&quot;<br />Happily the narrator's reticence does not extend to the  team of four young London barristers whose personal, romantic and  professional doings enliven Caudwell's stories. Julia, tax expert, is  concerned for her Aunt Regina who has made a truly remarkable killing in  stocks and is now expected to pay tax on money already spent.

The news rippled through the country day by day  and did not reach London until the colonial version arrived on May 28,  beating General Gage's account by two weeks.<br />Hallahan opens with the  events in Massachusetts as British troops gather to march on Lexington to  confiscate illicit arms and quiet rebellion with a show of strength -  playing right into the grasping hands of Sam Adams who had been fomenting  rebellion for more than a decade. As the day proceeds, the author  introduces us to the post riders, militia leaders and strategists, the  brave, the lucky and the hapless.<br />He sketches personalities, histories  and circumstances, revealing the rebels as a mixed lot of thinkers,  smugglers, dandies, farmers and shopkeepers. Culling his information from  diaries, letters, documents and memoirs, Hallahan clearly and vividly  recreates a tumultuous time when, but for a vocal, ambitious minority, and  a recalcitrant, shortsighted Royal policy, America might have remained  British.<br />Had the compromisers prevailed, suggests Hallahan, &quot;There  might have been no American Revolution and no French Revolution, the United  States might still be part of the British Commonwealth, and consequently  both World War I and World War II might have been averted because Germany  would not have so brazenly gone on the offensive.&quot;<br />A breathtaking  statement, to be sure. But, while the book illuminates many thwarted  opportunities for peace, it also lays bare the total corruption of British  government at the time - the rule of the many by the aristocratic few, the  buying and selling of important offices and its selfish and ruinous  economic policies toward the colonies. Reading Hallahan's account, few will  conclude that compromise with Britain was ever sustainable or desirable in  the long run.<br />Lively, fascinating, informative and opinionated,  Hallahan's well-organized, readable narrative should spur new interest in  Revolutionary history among a general readership.f important offices and its selfish and ruinous  economic policies toward the colonies.

Nelson is now doing for the fledgling American navy during the Revolutionary War. Rousing plots, historical authenticity and seafaring  as vivid as a slap of salt spray or a whiff of the bilge will have readers  hoping Nelson can make the American Revolution last a long, long  time.<br />The fifth in the series featuring Captain Isaac Biddlecomb,  &quot;All the Brave Fellows,&quot; takes place during the fall of 1777.  With his wife and infant son aboard, Biddlecomb sails for Philadelphia to  take charge of the Falmouth, a 28-gun newly built frigate, and whisk it  away from the city before General Howe's invading army can seize it.<br />For  all Biddlecomb knows, he may already be too late. But trouble comes long  before Philadelphia. In an exciting, well-constructed scene of warring  strategies and over-eagerness, Biddlecomb, bolstered by the company of two  privateers, takes on a lone British sloop of war. But the undisciplined  privateers desert him at the first threat of British cannon and the enemy  forces his beloved brig Charlemagne aground, where Biddlecomb burns it  rather than let the ship fall into British hands.<br />Shaken by his  responsibility for the danger to his wife and child as well as the loss of  his ship, Biddlecomb is humbled, on foot, and stalked by his old nemesis  Smeaton, (a British naval officer aboard the victorious sloop) whose career  was earlier blighted by Biddlecomb and whose obsessive lust for revenge  occasionally seems over the top.<br />Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, the Falmouth  is endangered, with the British invasion proceeding and the Royal Navy  overwhelming the hobbled-together Pennsylvania Navy. Master shipwright  Malachi Foote desperately induces a band of Continental Army deserters to  help him try to save the ship.<br />Point of view shifts between Biddlecomb  and Foote with breathtaking suspense. But, while Nelson delivers plenty of  action, he places it squarely in the context of history and character,  involving the reader in the squabbles between factions of the former  colonials' military. State navies, for instance, a bizarre concept to the  modern mind, answering to an altogether different authority than the  stripling Continental Navy.<br />And Biddlecomb's wife is a brave, spirited  woman whose agenda is sometimes comically, sometimes wrenchingly different  from her husband's. His struggle to balance domestic life with naval  command is deftly done. &quot;The difference between the great cabin and  the quarterdeck was startling....It took genuine effort for Biddlecomb to  shift his concerns from Jack's need to be burped to his ship's need to be  driven into battle.&quot; And later, during an angry disagreement with his  wife: &quot;He longed to cross swords with Smeaton, or to plunge into the  thick of battle, where the emotions - terror, hatred, rage - were so pure  and uncomplicated.&quot;<br />Nelson's page-turner brings the Revolution to  life on the high seas - buffeted by weather, tide and human frailty.  &quot;All the Brave Fellows&quot; will please old fans and win new ones.action, he places it squarely in the context of history and character,  involving the reader in the squabbles between factions of the former  colonials' military.

The Haddan School was built on the banks of the muddy  Haddan River in 1858, the year of a horrific storm which flooded the town  and the new school worst of all so that: &quot;To this day, frogs can be  found in the plumbing; linens and clothes stored in closets have a  distinctly weedy odor, as if each article had been washed in river water  and never thoroughly dried.&quot;<br />Each five-mile trek to the nearest  public high school in &quot;weather so cold the badgers kept to their  dens&quot; increased the locals' animosity toward the boarding school,  &quot;a small bump on the skin of ill will ready to rupture at the  slightest contact.&quot; But over the years town and gown have reached an  accommodation. The school gives money and the town stays out of school  affairs.<br />Into this atmosphere come two new students, poor but strikingly  beautiful Carlin Leander, and quirky, brilliant misfit August Pierce. Long  desperate to escape her rural Florida home, Carlin has gained admittance on  a swimming scholarship and has high hopes that Haddan will be the start of  her new and better life. August has no such illusions. For him, this is  just the latest in a misery of schools, though he hopes to stick it out for  his father's sake.<br />But Carlin fits in no better than August who has been  admitted to the moldiest and most exclusive of the dorms by dint of his  on-paper accomplishments. While Carlin discovers that her clothes are  impossible and her roommates don't even speak the same language, August's  housemates band together against him. An unlikely duo, drawn together by  despair, the two become best friends until Carlin, flattered, begins dating  the most popular, most handsome boy on campus, August's chief enemy, a boy  of easy charm and loathsomeness.<br />Vaguely aware of the emotional maelstrom  ever brewing among their students are new teacher Betsy Chase, who  supervises Carlin's dorm, (St. Anne's, so called because a beautiful local  girl, who married an esteemed headmaster, hung herself in its attic) and  her fianc&eacute;, Eric Herman, an aloof, ambitious sort who supervises August's  dorm.<br />When a student drowns, the Haddan Police Department quickly accedes  to the school's wishes and closes the case. Except for one detective, Abel  Grey, whose brother committed suicide at about the same age and whose  lonely life has been haunted and emotionally arid ever since. Investigating  at the school, Abel meets Betsy and it's love at first sight, though Betsy  remains committed to her wedding plans.<br />As Abel's investigation gathers  momentum, the various characters are forced to take sides. Their decisions  and actions reveal inner cores of weakness or strength. The story moves  toward a mythic climax, but each decision is individual, quirky and human.  Hoffman's protagonists are appealing and real, complete with uncertainties,  selfishness, fears and courage.<br />The atmosphere, tinged with  otherworldliness, with ghostly presences wafting through the hallways and  lingering at the fringes, lends a timeless, bittersweet melancholy to an  affirming, enchanting story of love, personal integrity and hope.ating  the most popular, most handsome boy on campus, August's chief enemy, a boy  of easy charm and loathsomeness.<br />Vaguely aware of the emotional maelstrom  ever brewing among their students are new teacher Betsy Chase, who  supervises Carlin's dorm, (St. Anne's, so called because a beautiful local  girl, who married an esteemed headmaster, hung herself in its attic) and  her fiancé, Eric Herman, an aloof, ambitious sort who supervises August's  dorm.<br />When a student drowns, the Haddan Police Department quickly accedes  to the school's wishes and closes the case.

Approached by the gentle, dignified widow of a man who died painfully and inexplicably after a meal of chicken,  crusading London solicitor Geri Lander accepts the food-poisoning case and  finds herself pursuing a &quot;super bug&quot; which could bring down the  British poultry industry, to say nothing of decimating the population.  Caused by the overuse of illegal antibiotics in chickens, the super bug has  proved resistant to medical treatment and, unknown to Geri, cases are  proliferating.<br />Point of view shifts between Geri, the government  functionary who has just completed a report a report on the hazards of  antibiotic use in poultry and the agriculture minister who manipulates him  to suppress the report. While I can think of a few things Geri should have  done (like check hospitals for similar cases) the woman has a frantic life  - she's a widowed mother at the helm of a struggling firm, with financial  ruin lurking. There's also a bit of romance and a nice mother/son  relationship in addition to the carefully plotted, wholly engaging,  David-against-Goliath courtroom story.	2000-07-13

MacKenzie's, anti-marriage views.<br /> Though she doesn't  socialize with the group members, Amanda is surprised to realize how much  they've revealed of themselves discussing books. Helen, the deceased, for  instance, has voiced strong views against suicide. Others are fussy,  dictatorial, hypocritical or self-absorbed. What she's not prepared for are  the secrets which surface, exposed mostly by people eager to deflect her  from their own concerns. Extra-marital affairs, financial schemes, grudges;  the whole group seems to have motives in plenty. Meanwhile C.K. is  suspiciously supportive.<br />Cleverly written, classically plotted, Pepper's  latest lively adventure culminates in a confrontation both scary and  comical.

Rankin's unadorned,  complexly nuanced writing, his ability to breathe life into characters as  much with what is not said as what is, makes the series a particular  stand-out.<br />Since his novella &quot;Death Is Not the End,&quot; focuses on  a subplot in Rankin's 1999 novel &quot;Dead Souls,&quot; I expected a  sequel. But as Rankin explains in a note at the end, the novella was  written first. The story concerns a missing young man, 23 years old, the  son of an old highschool girlfriend. The narrative follows Rebus'  investigation over much the same time period as &quot;Dead Souls,&quot;  though Rankin extended his investigation in the novel. And there is a  different subplot featuring crooked casino operators.<br />New readers, or  those who missed &quot;Dead Souls&quot; will enjoy the journey into  Edinburgh's seamy side - the grim amorality of those who make their living  from &quot;punters&quot; - and Rebus' exploration of his own past and the  choices that have made him who he is.	2000-07-13

Cut to the seventh richest man in the world,  American businessman Palmer Lloyd, who throws his financial weight around  at a Christie's auction, much to the humbled participants' disgust and  admiration, then flies off to the Kalahari to buy a prominent meteorite  hunter.<br />Lloyd is building the world's greatest natural history museum and  the meteorite hunter, Sam McFarlane, is going to help him acquire his  centerpiece - the world's largest meteorite - found by Sam's former partner  on that Chilean Antarctic island. Lloyd also acquires an engineer to plan  the expedition, a humorless perfectionist who prides himself on his  flawless success record. Eli Glinn plans for every contingency, human  nature included.  The party sets out on a state-of-the-art tanker,  disguised as a rustbucket on an ore mining job. Like Glinn and McFarlane,  its dignified female captain has been made wiser by a career-blighting  error.<br />The expedition attracts the attention of a bitter and suspicious  Chilean destroyer captain, whose powerlessness is matched by his tenacity.  And then Glinn, who thinks of everything, allows Sam to bury his former  partner's body without inspecting it. Uh oh. But the initial digging of the  meteorite goes off without a hitch. Palmer Lloyd jumps down on the  surprisingly red rock and presses his cheek to it without ill  effect.<br />Still, the thing is strange. Its rich, ruby color is mesmerizing,  its weight is mind-boggling and it's so hard it burns out a big diamondhead  drill without giving up a fragment of itself. Its origins and properties  stir up Sam's old obsession - interstellar meteorites. All previous  meteorites have come from our own solar system and the possibility of an  interstellar rock is a statistical impossibility, or so the scientists  say.<br />And soon the problems begin. Though Glinn plans for everything, the  rock (the heaviest object ever moved by humans) seems to have ideas of its  own.<br />With increasing momentum, several suplots, budding romances, raging  storms and sinsiter mysteries clash, collide and hurtle towards an  explosive climax among the deadly ice islands of the Ice Limit surrounding  Antarctica.

Her job was to introduce four animals in need of homes; an unruly dog with an incontinence  problem, two feral kittens and one normal cat. Thomas adopted all four of  them.<br />Anthropologist, novelist, and animal lover, Elizabeth Marshall  Thomas writes of dog behavior with sympathy, insight and considerable  humor. Following her bestseller, &quot;The Hidden Life of Dogs&quot; (which  explored dog-with-dog culture), &quot;The Social Life of Dogs,&quot;  examines dog adaptation to human households, or, in the Thomas case, a  multiple-species household.<br />At the time the book opens, Thomas and her  husband, Steve, had three old dogs left from &quot;The Hidden Life of  Dogs&quot; pack and didn't want any more. Steve &quot;didn't want another  animal of any description&quot; and Elizabeth, while &quot;always open to  another dog,&quot; plans to wait until the old dogs died before getting an  adult dog she can learn from, an Indian dog from Northern Canada, say, or a  pariah dog from a Third World village. What she doesn't want is the white  dog who quietly appears and won't leave - an American purebred  cross.<br />Thomas does not approve of purebreds. &quot;The important features  of a dog are his brains and his persona,&quot; not looks. Still, unable to  find the dog's owners, after a few days Thomas begins to ask herself,  &quot;what, after all, is really so wrong with a few purebred  strains?&quot;<br />And so begins her relationship with Sundog, the animal  whose ashes will someday be mingled with her and Steve's. Her descriptions  of Sundog's adoption of human mannerisms (the three old dogs rejected him  totally) - his sharing of food, for instance, are touching and fascinating.  Although Sundog did not like popcorn, the ritual of sharing was important  to him - a kernel for Sundog, a kernel for Steve - until the bowl was  empty. One evening Steve wanted to read without interruption. When Sundog  took his usual chair at the table, Steve said &quot;no&quot; and put a  handful of popcorn on the floor. Sundog, hurt, left the room. Although they  swiftly followed him with the bowl, entreating him to return, Sundog never  touched popcorn again and never returned to the table to share.<br />The next  dog was a purebred (for what reason Marshall does not explain) purchased as  a companion for Sundog. Having spent her first year of life without  stimulation in a crate, the dog is a mess and Thomas buys her out of pity.  Sundog rejects her. Misty's difficulties teach Marshall a great deal about  the importance of early learning and Misty's insecurities about keeping  &quot;place two&quot; lead to behavioral difficulties with visitors (canine  or human), incoming cats and, especially, incoming dogs.<br />The third dog,  Pearl, came from Marshall's son in Colorado and furnishes much of the  book's hilarity and color. Protective, kindly and dignified, she disarms  aggressive Misty by respectfully ignoring her furious antics. Over a period  of four months she trains Marshall to rise at 4:30 am. She barks at  everything and on a trip to the city barks herself hoarse at the strange  cars until forced to take refuge on the floor. Distracted by the barking,  late for a book signing, Marshall parks on an unfamiliar street and dashes  to the bookstore, asking directions on the way. Only afterwards does she  realize she has no idea whatsoever where the car might be. Marshall's  description of Pearl's quick grasp of the situation and her take-charge  solution is second only to the story of Pearl's knocking her headlong down  a flight of stairs which ends, &quot;Who could resist such a  dog?&quot;<br />When Marshall uses radio collars to find out what the cats are  hunting (one is hurrying each morning to harrass a housebound cat through a  window), Pearl accompanies her. When a radio collar fails, Pearl somehowdeduces the problem and leads Marshall to the unappreciative feline.<br />The  fourth dog is the incontinent, cat-chasing, chicken-killing Ruby, rescued  from the Humane Society. Since her behavior is primarily unbearable to the  other animals, Rajah the alpha cat and Rima the macaw train her swiftly,  with none of Marshall's inexhuastible patience.<br />But Marshall delivers  more than a collection of fascinating, poignant, hilarious anecdotes  (though there is the rabbit who hunts squirrels with its dog companion, the  birds who scold the dogs and summon the cats in Marshall's voice). A  thoughtful, meticulous observor, she shares compelling insights into animal  behavior, the social workings of groups (her own menage breaks down into  smaller, multi-species units), and common difficulties with training.<br />So  who is this book for? Dog lovers, obviously. But even dog fascists (her  term) will appreciate the scope and grace of Marshall's writing, her  abundant personality and forceful, controversial opinions. While focused  primarily on dog behavior, the book is a delightful memoir of a very large,  multi-species family, complete with belly laughs and tears.deduces the problem and leads Marshall to the unappreciative feline.<br />The  fourth dog is the incontinent, cat-chasing, chicken-killing Ruby, rescued  from the Humane Society.

Arriving in Copenhagen in 1629 to join the Royal Orchestra of King  Christian IV, Claire is aghast to discover he will be playing in a cold,  dank wine cellar, open to the elements so the wine may breathe. The  orchestra's miserable confinement serves the king's ego and ideas of  beauty. Through an ingenious system of pipes, the music rises upward  without distortion so the disembodied sound appears ghostly or heaven-sent.  For Christian, enjoyment without human distraction; for his guests an  impressive marvel.<br />Point and counterpoint, other voices rise as Tremain  shifts the narrative among characters. Lusty, beautiful, adulterous young  Kirsten, the King's consort who will never be queen, trapped by Christian's  love for her, determines to drive him to indifference. Her favorite  handmaid, Emilia, thrust from her family by her father's lust for his new  wife, awakens to Peter's true love. The King, sunk in fear and melancholy  over a fortuneteller's prophecy and the collapse of his once lofty  ambitions, ruminates over his passion for perfection and the betrayal of  his childhood friend.<br />Captivated by Peter's angelic beauty, Christian  fastens on the lutenist. Likewise captivated by Emilia's melancholy  innocence, Kirsten will not be separated from Emilia. Both use their  minions without regard for their own wishes.<br />Peter plays for Christian  for the first time: &quot;When the song is over he glances at the King, but  the King doesn't move. His wide hands clutch the arms of the chair. From  the left side of his dark head falls a long, thin plait of hair, fastened  with a pearl. 'In Springtime,' Christian says suddenly, 'Copenhagen used to  smell of lilacs and of linden. I do not know where this heavenly scent has  gone.' &quot;<br />And in the next moment we meet his Kirsten: &quot;Well, for  my thirtieth birthday I have been given a new Looking-glass which I thought  I would adore. I thought I would dote upon this new Glass of mine. But  there is an error in it, an undoubted fault in its silvering, so that the  wicked object makes me look fat. I have sent for a hammer.&quot;<br />Lesser  characters pursue their own driving concerns. The Queen mother guards her  treasure from her son's grasping needs. A widowed Irish countess pines  after Peter and contrives to follow him to Denmark. Peter's family tries to  entice him home. Kirsten's mother hatches plots, which will not advance her  daughter. Emilia's stepmother's appetites consume her stepsons. A poor  town, buoyed by the King's mining plans, suffers, quite literally, from  their collapse.<br />As the thwarted desires of Peter and Emilia advance and  recede (both of them pawns of their selfishly loving employers) dramas and  intrigues swirl around them. Each of the interconnecting subplots are fully  developed, with histories, secrets and absorbing characters.<br />Tremain's  (&quot;Restoration,&quot; &quot;The Way I Found Her&quot;) characters, with  all their faults and aspirations, connect to the reader through their  complex emotional lives. Each (save for Peter and Emilia who are too young  and pure of heart) has a dark core. But none are purely villainous. Even  monumentally selfish Kirsten, ruled by her passions, occasionally succumbs  to momentary tenderness. Or a spontaneous tantrum.<br />At times the narrative  swells with the moral force of a fairy tale, other times it gallops along  like a classic romance. Always, the beauty of the author's language, its  quiet grace and crashing crescendos, draws the readerinto a 17th century  world alive with people whose human responses are timeless.into a 17th century  world alive with people whose human responses are timeless.	2000-06-20

Ireland, recently converted to Christianity, had a  highly evolved system of laws and education and an elected monarchy. Women  enjoyed personal and professional freedoms they would not see again for  more than 1200 years.<br />In this latest, Tremayne, pseudonym for Celtic  scholar Peter Berresford Ellis, sends Sister Fidelma to an isolated Druidic  outpost as an emissary for her brother, the King of Muman, to negotiate the  construction of a Christian church and school in the pagan village. But  near the village, Fidelma (who is also an advocate of the law courts, a  combination lawyer and investigator) and her series companion, the Saxon  Brother Eadulf, come upon a grisly sight. Thirty-three slaughtered men lie  naked in a sunwise circle, killed and arranged according to ancient pagan  ritual.<br />Before the mystery is solved, several more people will die and  Fidelma herself will stand accused of murder. Full of historical detail  about ancient law and life, with a quick-witted heroine, Tremayne's seventh  should please old fans and win new ones.	2000-06-06

With his  prot&eacute;g&eacute; and lover, Amelia Sachs, by his side and a couple days to spare  before surgery, Rhyme agrees to help a small town sheriff track down a  teenager who has kidnapped two young women and killed another boy.<br />The  sheriff's team, racing to save the victims' lives, distrusts the New  Yorkers' (rather Holmesian) methods and Sachs - Rhyme's legs - meets  resistance at every turn into the suspect's lair - a tangled swamp dotted  with ingenious booby-traps. Point-of-view shifts, particularly among Sachs,  Rhyme, the two victims and the suspect, a troubled 16-year-old orphan,  known as the Insect Boy for his obsession with insects. Members of the  sheriff's department also get a voice, including a couple of rogue officers  with an agenda of their own.<br />Though Sachs' team captures the boy, he  refuses to give up the location of his captive and, almost on a whim, Sachs  takes matters into her own hands, breaking the boy out of jail and taking  off into the swamp. In the ensuing battle of wits, Rhyme learns how well he  has taught his apprentice.<br />Full of twists, hairpin turns and reverses,  Deaver's plot races into crises from which it seems there can be no return.  The forensic detection is ingenious and the insect lore is fascinating and  cleverly applied. There are a few minor credibility issues - Sachs'  counterpart on the sheriff's team seems a mite eager to take deadly offense  and Sachs' worry that Rhyme's surgery will free him from her is repugnant.  But the keep-you-guessing character of the resourceful, pathetic,  sympathetic Insect Boy is wholly realistic, heightening the already  high-pitched suspense.	2000-06-06

His bimbo wife was sleeping with the  aforementioned cousin, his ill father furiously regretted turning over the  reins of his company, his uncle feared discovery of his embezzlements, the  uncle's clever wife and her lover, the yacht-yard supervisor, feared that  Roger was going to run the venerable company into the ground.<br />But with  all these great suspects to choose from, the police focus on a young Puerto  Rican ballet dancer from the New York slums. Though Connor is no criminal  lawyer, Quintana's daughter Angela begs her to take on the dancer, her  secret boyfriend. Connor tracks down the dancer's reluctant alibi witness  (a judicial candidate) and discovers Quintana is his lawyer.<br />The tension  of their recent, explosive break-up is exacerbated by Connor's pregnancy.  She has not told Quintana and is considering abortion. And the dancer is  seeing Angela against her father's express wishes. But Connor and Quintana  manage to team up to clear Connor's client and keep Quintana's out of it -  by presenting the police with a new suspect. All this sounds convoluted,  even contrived when I say it, but Parker makes it sound quite  reasonable.<br />The detective and legal work is clever and though the rich  family is typically corrupt and dysfunctional, the sparks between the two  likable protagonists keep things lively. Parker's  literate writing style  and thoughtful characterizations is highly satisfying.	2000-06-06

Croaker confronts her  own abused childhood in an interconnected subplot, which includes a  suitcase of money, a newly discovered sibling and a romance.<br />Bishop's  secondary characters, particularly Croaker's team, are skillfully drawn and  the quirky dynamic partnerships drive the police work.

It's also the exploration of a marriage and the changing, repressive culture of the city and relations  between the sexes.<br />Dora, the daughter of respectable people, was murdered  in a public park. In her stomach is the remains of a fresh fig, hastily  eaten, a fruit unavailable in Vienna in August. The unnamed inspector's  wife, Erszebet, a painter, is brought in to make up the corpse and becomes  obsessed with the dead girl. Erszebet, a passionate Hungarian, steeped in  gypsy lore and superstition, has just returned from an exhausting bout of  nursing a servant girl who died. &quot;...this was her patient, returned to  her. She was cold Lazarus.&quot;<br />Certain that the fig is the key, that  Dora knew her killer to eat a fig with him, Erszebet enlists the help of a  young English governess, Wally, to search for the tree, which must grow  locally and must be found before the first snow when it will be wrapped and  buried to keep it alive until spring. Meanwhile the inspector, an adherent  of &quot;rationalist criminology&quot; interviews family and friends,  exploring inconsistencies for &quot;what is unspoken remains most  powerful.&quot;<br />His wife's unspoken acitivities loom ever larger between  them. The inspector notes small details that warn of a secret in his wife's  life, details that would escape most men. Tensions build in the marriage  through silence.<br />It's all very intriguing but as the book progresses,  questions clamor in the reader's mind. The observant inspector completely  ignores the vital clue of the fig. Why? And how does a middle-aged,  syphilitic, autocratic burgher (Dora's father) get to be so attractive to  women? Why doesn't the inspector have a name? He is certainly an individual  and often more sympathetic than his prickly wife.<br />The book abounds with  sensuality and repugnance. As part of a vow, Erszebet starves herself and  feeds her husband sumptuous dishes. She forces Wally into role playing and  housebreaking. Though resentful, Wally remains in thrall to Erszebet and  discovers the liberation of passing as a boy. Shields explores the  oppression of women as a catalyst for male depravity and female hysteria.  Meanwhile the inspector becomes ever more morose while Erszebet grows more  powerfully mysterious.  Ultimately, the enigmatic second half does not  live up to the vitality of the first half and the ending is bizarre.bet starves herself and  feeds her husband sumptuous dishes.

Switching to the daughter, 16 and pregnant, we  learn that she has indeed killed her mother, in a drugged-out rage, with  the help or at least knowledge of her sleazy, drug-dealing  boyfriend.<br />Newlin hires inexperienced Mary DiNunzio who not only  recognizes his innocence but begins to develop a crush on her client.  Mary's close-knit Italian-Catholic family, though riddled with cliches,  serves as a warm contrast to the arid polarity of the Newlins.<br />The police  embrace Jack's confession wholeheartedly - all but one, a somber black  detective - and the overzealous DA decides to go for the death penalty.  It's up to Mary to save the man who wants to give his life for his sins as  a parent.<br />Obviously there are surprises or there wouldn't be a story. And  Mary's energy draws out vulnerabilities in the spoiled, gorgeous daughter  and the man whose life was on hold, apparently, during the whole of his  marriage.	2000-05-09

Cook's &quot;Places in the Dark&quot; pits the stoic against the romantic  and, between them, an enigmatic woman of mystery.<br />Cal Chase, the  narrator, a pragmatic, unemotional lawyer, mourns his murdered younger  brother, beloved, high-spirited Billy, and vows to track down the  mysterious Dora March, the love of Billy's life, who disappeared right  after the murder.<br />As Cal digs into the woman's past, he dredges up his  own - the childhood he and Billy shared with parents whose temperaments  were incomprehensible to each other and the more recent past, the days  since the appearance of Dora. Billy's mother encouraged him to follow his  heart, their father counseled Cal to adhere to the voice of reason.<br />As  the story unfolds the reader realizes that both ideologies have left the  boys too narrow to deal with the tangled forces of love. Cal's rigid,  tortured voice serves to emphasize the passions building within him,  building, inevitably as he see in hindsight, to tragedy. But there are more  shocks in store for Cal, devastating realizations about life and character  and crippling trauma.<br />A brooding excursion into the depths of the human  heart, full of surprises and dread, with a stunning ending.	2000-05-09

An offhand remark from his  failing father reinforces this speculation and prompts him to begin  inquiring into the circumstances of his birth.<br />But it's a top civil  servant's brief start of recognition on seeing him that points him toward  his aristocratic and possibly murderous antecedents. Pinnock's search  enlists the aid of a host of people, among them the girlfriend who left him  rather than play a poor second to his job.<br />As Pinnock ponders such things  as the importance of his happy childhood and the place of family in his  scheme of things, the anonymous prankster ratchets up the intimidation.  Postcards give way to phone calls, humiliating frame-ups and, finally,  escalating violence.<br />A thoughtful test of character rather than a  whodunit, &quot;A Murder in Mayfair&quot; offers atmospheric menace, a  pointed but still unclear picture of British parliamentary government and  an over-the-top conclusion.

She naturally  focuses on Iranian/U.S. relations, explaining the long-festering feeling  against the 1953 US/British-engineered coup that reinstalled the Shah's  repressive regime. She shows how Ayatollah Khomeini seized on the almost  whimsical takeover of the US embassy in 1979 to divert attention from  domestic troubles and unite his people in heightened revolutionary  fervor.<br />Iranians view the American people and their government separately  and always have, Wright claims. At a 1999 demonstration, an Islamic  clerical leader takes Wright aside. &quot;'We shout death to policies, not  to the scientists and thinkers of America,' he said, as if the difference  were obvious and I had to be daft not to understand.&quot; One of the more  outspoken of the original hostage takers addresses the crowd. &quot; 'Today  we invite all the hostages to return to Iran as our guests....Regarding  relations with America, we must look to the future and not to the past.'  &quot;<br />The skeptical reader is reminded of terrorist attacks against  ordinary civilians and the impossibility of American tourism in Iran, at  least during the '80s. But, as Wright points out, the population of Iran  has nearly doubled since the revolution, meaning nearly half of Iranians  were born during Islamic reign. Things are different for them.<br />Comparing  the classic stages of revolution to a fever - raging, convalescing and  recovery, Wright traces events leading to revolution and the formation of a  religious government (which even Khomeini did not originally intend)  through a clerical reign of terror which &quot;eliminated former partners -  leftists, nationalist and intellectuals - from any claim to  power.&quot;<br />Convalescence did not begin until the end of the Iran/Iraq  war and Khomeini's death in 1989. While the clergy tightened their hold on  power by opposing any relaxation of conservative Islamic strictures, people  began to chafe for more freedom and dissidents, many of them former  revolutionary heroes, clamored for more democracy. A joke making the rounds  in 1992 called on Ayatollah Khomeini to describe paradise, which he does in  terms of plenty of food, many pleasures, no tension. &quot; 'So how would  you characterize paradise?'... 'Well,' said Khomeini, 'it's very much like  the time of the shah.'&quot; But Wright is careful to make clear that  nostalgia is not for the shah himself but for a time of prosperity and  international importance.<br />The bulk of the book focuses on the  &quot;Islamic Reformation,&quot; epitomized by clerics like current  president Mohammed Khatami whose philosophical leanings tend toward  democracy. As government influences every aspect of daily life, Wright  interviews people across the spectrum to illuminate their religious way of  life and desire for more freedom.<br />One chapter focuses on the arts, the  movie industry especially. With virtually all outside cinema banned, and  with strict Islamic strictures in place, Iranian cinema flourished and  developed along imaginative and ingenious lines. Ironically, cultural  loosening threatens the burgeoning art form as American movies begin to  dominate the few theaters.<br />Women are the focus of another chapter; one of  the book's most interesting, as women try to reconcile Islamic piety with  individual freedom, even feminism. Women have had the vote since 1963 and  their literacy rate has increased greatly since the revolution. They have  become a force for change though they hardly speak with one voice. One  woman explains to Wright that education has become possible for religious  women only since the revolution,as the Shah did not allow traditional  dress in the classroom.<br />While rules about extra-marital sex remain rigid,  every marriage-bound couple is now required to attend explicit  sex-education classes where birth control is described in detail and as  strongly advocated as large families once were. Iran is dangerously  overpopulated and it's not until the book's end that Wright sheds her  customary optimism to reveal just how dangerous a situation that is.  Annually, 850,000 young people enter a job market which produces only  300,000 jobs. Iran's economy is in shambles and shows no signs of  improving. Drug use has become a serious problem, due at least in part to  boredom and a sense of hopelessness for the future. Many young people say  they will never be able to afford to marry. Seventy percent of Iran's  unemployed are its young.<br />Wright humanizes Iranians for her American  readers. She converses at length with intellectuals and ordinary people,  allowing their personalities and passions to emerge. Anecdotes are  humorous, quirky, reasoned and fanatical. She gives the revolution a human  face but at the same time exposes the ugly visage of the mob.<br />Though she  clearly loves the place and its people and communicates her understanding  well, the book's conclusion dashes much of its hope. It is difficult to see  how Iran can progress successfully in the face of volatile economic and  population pressures exacerbated by political divisiveness. It's not clear  what the US can do but ignoring Iran does not seem a viable option., as the Shah did not allow traditional  dress in the classroom.<br />While rules about extra-marital sex remain rigid,  every marriage-bound couple is now required to attend explicit  sex-education classes where birth control is described in detail and as  strongly advocated as large families once were.

Of course, such textbook confirmation also raises suspicions. And Laura claims her husband is still alive which is simply impossible. One thing is clear. Laura is terrified of something and it's not death.<br />Mild and tentative, Theo's determination is stoked by a savage beating. A tense and macabre rescue of Laura leads to love, mayhem and murder. But action and nail-biting suspense is as nothing compared to a revelation half way through the narrative that will leave the most jaded reader gasping in horror.<br />Theo's earnest narration underscores the eerie feel of this fast-paced and original novel, sure to send new readers on a hunt for his first, &quot;Resurrection,&quot; which was made into an HBO movie, &quot;Almost Dead.&quot;	2000-04-10

With their crew in cold sleep, interstellar ships travel for  decades to enter temporal wormholes which put them at their destinations  days after leaving. These timeshaft are vigilantly guarded against time  paradoxes by the Chronologic Patrol and the first  80-page action-packed  segment pits the Patrol against mysterious &quot;Intruders&quot; invading  the wormhole, attacking the patrol and threatening the inviolate chronology  of time.<br />Battered and stranded 80 years in the future, the ship's  captain, Anton Koffield, though decorated by his service for necessary  action in destroying the wormhole rather than allow the violation of the  past, is reviled as having doomed a newly terraformed world unable to  receive their relief supplies. His career at an end, Koffield accepts a  research offer and the next time we meet him he's a passenger waking from  cold sleep (an unpleasant experience) on a merchant ship inexplicably  marooned 127 more years into the future.<br />Mysteries pile upon mysteries  and Allen feeds us just enough answers to keep it all suspenseful rather  than hopelessly confusing. His exploration of the rigid rules necessary to  allow the use of time as a travel convenience and the elaborate strategems  required to terraform worlds in a galaxy sadly devoid of life-supporting  planets are intriguing. He has invested his imagined universe with detailed  technology and ecological problems, which naturally find parallels in our  own world.<br />Koffield, a lonely, burdened, man, is a tough, principled old  veteran with an appealingly vulnerable side and his young female pilot  assistant is resourceful if inexperienced. While this is clearly the first  of a series (Allen wrote the Star Wars Corellian Trilogy), the author does  not infuriate the reader by leaving the whole story hanging - just a few  sizable chunks. An entertaining and lively tale with lots of mind-bending  ideas.t a few  sizable chunks. An entertaining and lively tale with lots of mind-bending  ideas.	2000-02-29

The Tree regards the unimproved humans as a pool of genetic diversity in  case of unforseen catastrophe and keeps them closely monitored.<br />After  several setbacks partly engineered by the alien Taurans - formerly an enemy  group mind, now allied with the Tree - the plan goes forward. But, while  the highjack succeeds, the mission fails. Strange malfunctions, defying the  laws of physics, force them to abandon ship and return to Middle Finger 24  years after they left. But the place is in ruins and the people have  vanished . Lively, well-written and provocative, &quot;Forever Free&quot;  tantalizes with mystery and absorbs the reader into a detailed culture  complete with history, youthful rebellion (Mandella's son joins the Tree),  and a truly unpleasant habitat, clearly of artificial origin. Haldeman  avoids stereotyping his characters and integrates action into the narrative  rather than the other way 'round.	2000-02-29

Banks (&quot;Excession,&quot; &quot;Against a  Dark Background&quot;).<br />&quot;Inversions,&quot; while set on a planet  with two sons and six moons, is more of a medieval parable than sci-fi,  despite the mysterious properties surrounding Dr. Vosill, physician to the  king, and a female and foreigner in a realm which despises both.  Politically wise and humane as well as amazingly skillful medically, Vosill  dodges the hatreds and strategems of a conspiracy of jealous courtiers. Her  story is narrated by the spy Oelph, her apprentice, who also falls  hopelessly in love with her.<br />Meanwhile, related in alternating chapters  by a deliberately obscured narrator, violence is an ever present danger in  the events unfolding in a post revolutionary government palace in a distant  realm. Bodyguard DeWar frets over the new Protector's safety (a victorious  regicide) while falling chastely in love with the crippled concubine who  saved the Protector from his last assassin. As war breaks out in the  provinces, The Protector's beloved son falls seriously ill with a  mysterious malady. Distracted by worry, he ignores conspiring  factions.<br />Both leaders have enemies they are unaware of. While there are  parrallels in the narratives, the connections are subtle and unapparent  until late in the novel. Even then, questions remain. Well-written and  absorbing, &quot;Inversions&quot; draws the reader on but does not really  satisfy. The conclusion does not seem to warrant all the mystery, despite  the delicate interplay of viewpoints and sinister maneuvering.<br />Still, I'm  told old fans familiar with previous books will understand what he's done  here. Doesn't do us casual readers much good though, nor does it make me  want to immerse myself in his philosophical construct.	2000-02-29

When we meet protagonist Jim Hutchins he is 50, lugging a shotgun from his trailer, preparing to kill his brother-in-law Emory, his  &quot;sworn enemy,&quot; (a phrase we later learn is wryly borrowed from  his tormented eldest son) and ruminating how things got to this  pass.<br />&quot;Life makes you eat the thorns. Smell the roses if you can,  but don't forget, you're going to eat the thorns. Course I ain't so smart.  If I were smart, I'd have hunted up a pistol, then my elbow wouldn't hurt  so.&quot;<br />Born and bred in Penacook County, NH, Hutchins quit school in  the eighth grade, married his sweetheart, Pauline, and had four children.  Three of them seem to be making worse messes of their lives than their  parents and the fourth, the youngest, their shining hope, Elizabeth, died  two years before at age 11 in an inexplicable drowning accident which has  fragmented the family.<br />Bereft of hope, communication among them breaks  down and each falls prey to his or her core weakness. Slow, steady Gregory,  the oldest, becomes consumed by the voices in his head and the oddly  prescient voices coming over his radio. Lisa escapes her abusive marriage  after three children only to succumb to drugs and alcohol and prostitution.  Tommy, the smartest, seems bent on drinking himself to destruction. Pauline  clings mightily to each of her children, blaming others for their  troubles.<br />Jim's grief is internal and inarticulate. Helplessly he watches  Pauline turn to Emory for comfort and for money when she's spent all that  they have and owe to buy her children out of the holes they've dug  themselves. Dunned for back taxes by the IRS and the town, he seems unable  to act, except to keep things from falling completely apart. It's Jim who  fetches Lisa from her feckless, mean husband (&quot;He claims Fesmire for a  name, though I ain't uncertain that a while back in his family a turnip got  over the fence&quot;), Jim who keeps Tommy from dropping his hard-mouthed  girlfriend out a second-story window, and Jim who takes the gun away from  Gregory. But he is limited to reactions and when it comes to Pauline he's  helpless.<br />While Jim's is the main voice, Drown allows each of the  Hutchinses to speak. Characters who might otherwise seem people only a  parent could love come into their own with humor and passion. Tommy hides  his regrets under a breathless, edgy sass and more hell-bent energy than is  healthy. Gregory works things out with a meticulous if loony and  increasingly frightening earnestness. Lisa, the least comprehensible and  least sympathetic, combines self-loathing with bitterness and bursts of  rough independence and Pauline's grief and yearning for beauty infuse her  every deed.<br />Violence lurks at the edges. Suplots include a panty thief  and Emory's real estate maneuvering, impotence and police suspicions of  having murdered his wife (Jim's sister).<br />Told in the present tense, the  story unfurls the convoluted past while hurtling headlong into a ragged  future. Despite their bleak, strapped lives, each character's voice is  alive with wry humor and yearning. Drown's earthy, graceful, hilarious  prose explores love and marriage, friendship, the power of money and  poverty, middle-aged regret and other baggage of life. As funny as it is  poignant, with an explosive climax that supplies symmetry, hope and a last  laugh too, &quot;The Suburbs of Heaven,&quot; is as fine a piece of  literature as it is a provocative story.urnip got  over the fence&quot;), Jim who keeps Tommy from dropping his hard-mouthed  girlfriend out a second-story window, and Jim who takes the gun away from  Gregory.

Pete Golding is a security pro who specializes  in stalkers. Shooting one boosted his firm's reputation but spooked his  colleagues who find his brooding dedication obsessive - sort of like a  stalker's. While the police search for the cold trail of a killer, Ellen's  stalker manages to get into her house and leave a photo of a little girl, a  skater. Golding finds more than he lets on and the stalker's messages begin  to make an awful kind of sense to Ellen. The story's atmospheric creepiness  increases as the plot lines cross and multiply, particularly once Lynch  (&quot;Omega,&quot; &quot;Carriers&quot;) adds the element of medical chill  he's best known for.	2000-02-08

F. Freeman's  &quot;Above The Law.&quot; When an old friend asks him to investigate the  murder of a drug dealer during his escape from custody after a botched DEA  raid in rural northern California, Garrison is reluctant but his wife  convinces him it will banish his demons. While Garrison sympathizes with DA  Nora Ray, the old friend whose promising life has badly fizzled, her sexual  advances force him to shut her out of the progressing investigation.  Gathering evidence from high officials and ruthless gang leaders,  uncovering old secrets and new, Garrison puts together an explosive and  controversial case and tries to keep any surprises from developing in his  orchestrated prosecution. While at times overwritten, the story is  absorbing, sparking new interest with a succession of twists and turns.  Freedman (&quot;The Disappearance,&quot; &quot;Key Witness&quot;) also  explores legal ethics and conflicts between a lawyer's obligation and the  truth. Garrison, while sometimes overly self-righteous, demonstrates both  lawyerly zeal and conscience in an interesting mix.	2000-02-08

In &quot;Cover Story&quot; Jack's  nostalgic drink with boyhood chum and former cop Butch Casey ends with a  sad rant about a conspiracy involving the mayor. Casey's obsession stems  from the carjacking murder of his wife 10 years earlier and the  inexplicable release of her alleged killer. But the next morning, popular  anti-crime mayor John Fiore (who bears amazing similarity to Rudy Giuliani)  has been assassinated, Casey has been arrested for the crime and the cops  want to talk to Jack. Dazed, he tells them what he knows only to realize he  too is suspect. The story heats up as, dodging the rabid mob of reporters  at his hotel, Jack finds an envelope Casey left for him. Boyle jump-starts  the action early and keeps ratchetting up the tension with every new  development. Casey's conspiracy &quot;evidence&quot; seems to make no sense  at all but then why are so many people desperate to grab it and shut Jack  down, permanently? Overwhelmed by media onslaught and villification, Jack  bullies, cajoles and misprepresents himself to witnesses lower on the food  chain. Nice touches of irony and personal conflict (romantic, moral and  professional) dress up the almost non-stop action. Boyle's well-organized  plot is sufficiently murky and mystifying and his writing sharp,  straightforward and clean. Jack McMorrow is an appealing hero who manages  to be both sensitive and tough.	2000-02-08

Accompanying her dead husband's  father to fetch his niece from the troubled land, Ursula is asked by  Elizabeth to carry an offer of mediation to Catherine, Queen Mother and  Regent of France. Though she dislikes her father-in-law, Luke Blanchard,  who was against his son's marriage and has spurned his young granddaughter,  Ursula agrees to go partly in hopes of seeing her second husband, a leader  of the Catholic faction in France. Joined by love, separated by politics,  their relationship has several times landed them on opposite sides of armed  and clandestine engagements (in previous books). The tradition continues as  Ursula soon realizes she is immersed in treachery, murder at her heels.  Lively period intrigue supplies subplots as well as the main story; Ursula  is quick and brave but also a woman of her times, and the setting is vivid,  brutal and atmospheric even to the contrasting feel of the countryside  between France and England.	2000-02-08
