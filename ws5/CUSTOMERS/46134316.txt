I enjoyed Margaret Creighton's book.  From far off Yarmouth, Maine, she has thrown her nets far and wide and hauled in a lot of historical flotsam and jetsam that might have escaped other scholars, in service of putting together another of her finely tuned historical studies of the underserved in American history.  Here we find out more about the immigrant populations who comprised the Union Army, as well as the actual lives of the women of Gettysburg and the black citizens of the surrounding area.  These are the shadow puppets of history, the folks who you might never have learned about by visiting the national park nor studying your social studies book.<br /><br />You probably heard more about Mamie Eisenhower's residence at Gettysburg than you did about the women who were drafted into battle, whether they were forced to nurse, to cook, to slave, or to fight.  Why is this?  Partially, as Professor Creighton explains, these women were told, and they believed it, that their sacrifices did not matter.  And that, perhaps, there was even something a little bit shameful about what they did, particularly if they were required to assist the invading Confederate army.  Of the ravishment and rape that undoubtedly occurred, we know little but can surmise much, thanks to Creighton's research and the guarded testimony of forty Gettysburg women, mostly farmwives.  Creighton looks at the nuance behind every statement, searching out human reality wherever it crops it head.  \\"A middle-aged woman on a farm opened her door to a soldier on July second.  By the way he was dressed, she was sure that he was a Louisiana Tiger.  He told her that `General Lee had said that they should ask for food and if they would not give it they should demand it and that was what he was going to do.'  She fed him ham.  He ate some of it and then insulted her.  The bread, he complained, was not fit to eat,  `Madam,' he said, `I can go into any cabin in Virginia, poor and desolate as it is, from Winchester to Richmond, with not a fence standing, and get a better dinner than this.'\\"  Creighton returns to this anecdote to eke out perceptions on the nature of resistance, and the implacability of the bad ham (Gettysburg women had to be fine actresses, for otherwise the Tiger in question might have guessed that the farmwife had fine chickens hidden with their beaks taped.)<br /><br />As Creighton acknowledges, the presence of women on the Gettysburg battlefield is currently a contested site for scholars, particular feminist scholars, and she acknowledges that a host of others are trawling the same fields.  The material remains of interest, and does indeed widen our picture of what happened that summer long ago, but I wondered, after finishing the book, if perhaps she might have written three separate books, for there's a sense in which the struggles of the immigrant soldiers, the Gettysburg women, and the freed, escaped or citizen slaves are experiences of very different registers and don't mesh together especially well except under cloudy language of the deracinated and ignored, and although Creighton tries her best, she can only link them this vaguely for the first two hundred times, then after that her rhetoric grows tiresome.ter to Richmond, with not a fence standing, and get a better dinner than this.'\\"  Creighton returns to this anecdote to eke out perceptions on the nature of resistance, and the implacability of the bad ham (Gettysburg women had to be fine actresses, for otherwise the Tiger in question might have guessed that the farmwife had fine chickens hidden with their beaks taped.) <br /> <br />As Creighton acknowledges, the presence of women on the Gettysburg battlefield is currently a contested site for scholars, particular feminist scholars, and she acknowledges that a host of others are trawling the same fields.

The book relates the story of a young boy, Shadow, who has to deal with the trauma of losing a beloved older brother.  It reminds me very much of the famous S E Hinton book, Rumble Fish, and to a lesser degree, THE OUTSIDERS, for all three books are about what happens when your adored older brother turns out to have feet of clay?  in SHADOW OF A DOUBT (cute name), Shadow Thompson was just a tad when bro Daniel ran away from home, leaving his mom and dad desolate and depending on him for amusement, but being too grief-stricken really to attend to his needs, so he retreated into the wonderland of Goth, or maybe not retreated, perhaps \\"discovered his subject position\\" would be a better way to put it.  He wears dark glasses, even indoors, so nobody can see his eyes and guess what his feelings are.<br /><br />Daniel comes back at the beginning of the book-wanted for murder!  I thought this was a little bit of overkill.  Couldn't he have just come back period?  Nothing else in the book would have changed.  I notice that with the novels of Rottman.  She always tosses in more than the book can really handle, or more than they need.  There was the one book I remember about the girl who was in high school with her boyfriend who's more of a horndog than she can handle, and between that and her swimming career the book would have been quite full already, and then she had to have yet another plot about uncaring parents who saddle the poor girl with an older brother who has Downs syndrome (and still wants to swim).  Too much!<br /><br />But in SHADOW OF A DOUBT, young Shadow has to now cope with the law and wanting to protect his brother, rather like the Hinton novels.  My own nephew adores the book and even said that he would consider joining the debating team, after reading this book.  Well, he calls it the \\"forensics team\\" and it turns out he thought \\"forensics\\" is what it is on his favorite TV shows BONES and CSI, for his dearest wish is to grow up and have a job relating to dead bodies and murder, I think he'll be in for a surprise when he joins the debate team and there's no rotting flesh involved.<br /><br />I would give Rottman's novel an A Plus for trying, but in the end it's not very involving.  However I am over fifteen and perhaps young readers (its target audience) would ignore its lack of plausibility and instead groove on Shadow's fashion sense and growing love interest.  Perhaps it will also restore teenager's interests in debating teams.n said that he would consider joining the debating team, after reading this book.

It's a handbook of perversion, in a sense.  That's not a bad thing in and of itself, but how many nowadays have read the book?  No wonder there are incidents like Columbine every day in the papers.  Young boys (sadly, they are always boys) read THE STRANGER and decide, if Meursault could commit a murder in far off Algeria, why can't I do the same here in snowy Colorado (or wherever).<br /><br />We all suffer from existential angst, sad to say, and this book cleverly pins down the five points of fear, the points by which a good school psychologist should be able to recognize that a potential Columbine is likely to happen within a year's time.  The five points include-look at the way Meursault deals with Marie, his lovely and complaisant girlfriend.  Although he says he is attracted to her, he often leaves her for long stretches of time.  He is disaffected, as the psychologists say.  Camus isn't writing a medical textbook, more like a novel, so much of this ennui is a product of his own literary imagination.  A few years later Roland Barthes took pen to hand to compose WRITING DEGREE ZERO, in which he famously divided the author's tools into three broad sections-language (for we all must write in language), style (which individuates us from our peers), and what he called \\"ecriture\\" in response to Sartre, Camus and other existentialist novelist for whom modernism was a disastrous wrong turn in humanity's social progress toward the Good.<br /><br />Another of the five points of fear comes in Meursault's interaction with his neighbor, Raymond.  Is it me or do these guys seem more French than Algerian?  Today we would recognize THE STRANGER as an example of the colonial system gone berserk.  If you are living in occupied territory, you can't expect to feel very stable.  Spielberg and Tobe Hooper, telling the story of POLTERGEIST, picked up on some of Camus' themes when they set their poltergeist-rocked suburban home squarely on a forgotten Indian graveyard.  What is difficult for Meursault is to make a decision.  In this he reminds us of Hamlet, and as we know, the stature of Shakespeare's Hamlet was at an all-time high in the immediate postwar era, what with the Olivier film, etc.  His eternally questioning figure rang a bell with veterans and citizens weary of endless war.  For Meursault, to act or not to act are pretty much the same.  How to detect a difference?  Often we look for signs from the outside world, for example, watching a fly cross a table.  If it zigzags this way, we pull the trigger.  If it flies away, lives are spared.  Think of Sergio Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST as another cinematic analogue to Camus' STRANGER and its five points of fear.  Just the fly creeping around Jack Elam's face in the opening sequence gives you the creeps, for violence and terror depend on which way the fly falls.-rocked suburban home squarely on a forgotten Indian graveyard.

I can only think of one previous novel which so deftly explored the inner demons of someone losing their memory, and that was Peter Dickinson's thriller ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE, in which the detective hero found himself in an old age home and, although barely able to keep it together, made one more triumphant leap into deduction (and action) to keep one last crime at bay.<br /><br />Nick, the hero of OBLIVION, isn't a very nice guy, and only through losing something (his memories of a \\"lost weekend\\" during which he began investigating a case of a runaway girl) does he come to his senses morally speaking.  His difficult relationship with his estranged son, Dmitri, and his nagging love for a former wife who walked out on him when she found him cheating with a partner--these relationships change as Nick finds it within himself to change and to try imagining how others may feel for once.  This brings up all sorts of satisfying speculations on what is the nature of personality?  Is it something consistent, essentialist, that doesn't change, or is it entirely a mode of chemical behavior?<br /><br />One little side note, I loved the TV movie of the week that was made out of Nick's work on the Reasoner case.  Abrahams has the casting down pat--Armand Assante as himself, Kim Delaney (herself the troubled good girl for whom America still cherishes a soft spot) and Dennis Franz, Delaney's co-star on NYPD Blue, as the mad serial killer Gerald Reasoner.  I'd watch it, and hate myself in the morning!  But reading OBLIVION you just crawl out on some primitive branch of pleasure like an ocelot, and soak in the sun.<br /><br />Kudos also to the book designer, who uses numbers and capital letters with parts of them melted off, to parallel Nick's fading memories.	2005-10-12

We've been needing a poet like Palmer for as long as I can remember, and if he hadn't existed, it would have been necessary for one of us, or a committee, to invent him.  A poet who is comfortable with politics and sex as he is with Blanchot and Wittgenstein, and who seems to have diverted streams of Language-centered poetry into the spurting stream of spoken word and performance derived, oral-based, shamanic diagetics, Ronald Palmer has the real thing going on, and his book is the answer to a maiden's dream in more ways than one would have thought possible.<br /><br />Pages of dithyrambs, redolent of Blake, Hart Crane, Allen Ginsberg, storm up the edge of the page and tumble down the next.  There's a poem about sitting on a sizable sex toy that, like the intrusive rubber spear it celebrates, only hurts for the first four inches.  Best of all are Palmer's plays on words, which spring naturally everywhere; he sees the beauty even in the joins between, so that not only in line breaks but in syllable breaks does he find room to breathe and space to grow these astonishing vines of language, like kudzu, like sex kudzu, so intimate with your body it will make you cry out with a pleasure akin to pain.<br /><br />I wondered how the lyrics of this standout live performer would look written down and, while you miss some of his bellowing, whispering cathedral organ of voices, instead you have the time to stare these words in the face, and time to admire the firm construction and sleek lines of each poem.  It will take me awhile to understand Palmer's taxonomy of \\"logics,\\" out of which he has seemingly constructed a whole new architectronics of poetry.  But I've got time.  One final caveat: don't ask for this book thinking you're getting a MICHAEL Palmer book, for you're in for a whole different kettle of poisson.le of poisson.	2005-10-12

Tables were piled high with books, many signed by their authors, men and women who had donated them to a good cause.  Many were in Asian languages I couldn't even read, but one or two of these I bought for Asian friends.  This book, GUNGA DIN HIGHWAY, proved a delightful surprise.  In a way, the book it reminds me most of is an oldie, the BIG ROCK CANDY MOUNTAIN from the 1950s, by Wallace Stegner, with its multi-generational narrative and its expansive, troubling vision of the USA.  In other ways it has some of the zany hippie humor you find in something like Tom Robbins' JITTERBUG PERFUME or EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES.  Either way, it's a winner.  And especially if you have an interest in cultural issues, for Frank Chin, the author, is a topnotch commentator with a waspish wit who absolutely hates the Charlie Chan movies.<br /><br />Our hero is the Number Four Son, that is, he once upon a time played the eager son of the great Chinese detective Charlie Chan, at a time when (the fictional) white actor, Anlauf Loraine, played Chan, the fourth white actor to do so.  Oddly, our hero Longman Senior has an intense relationship with his peers, the other Asian American actors who didn't get to play the father, but were always relegated to playing the son, including the real-life stars Victor Sen Yung, Benson Fong and Keye Luke, all of whom are dissed in context of the character.  Longman and his wife, Hyacinth, name their first born American son, Ulysses, after the famous banned modernist novel by James Joyce, and thus it's no wonder that Ulysses grows up to be, well, as one of his girlfriends puts it, \\"oversexed.\\"<br /><br />Through the 1950s and 1960s, the novel shows us a panoramic view of the sexual and cultural awakenings of several families whose lives intertwine in New York, Oakland, Seattle, Honolulu, Portland and Frisco.  Pandora Toy is an alluring, freshly conceived and brilliant young writer, who hooks up with Ulysses, which distances him somewhat from his kinship with his \\"blood brother,\\" the actor Ben Mo.  Chin's pictures of bohemian living, young people too poor to buy a house, and almost too poor to sign a lease, yet thriving in big city energy, might have come out of the musical RENT.  It's a long book, but no longer than, say, THE GRAPES OF WRATH or THE MAN WITHOUT QUALITIES, two other 20th century novels that came to mind while I flipped through the pages of GUNGA DIN HIGHWAY.  You should be able to read it over and over again, for such is its quality, that no sooner are you done with the final chapter, then you'll be wanting to start it from the beginning, like some kind of Mobius strip of Asian American experience.eattle, Honolulu, Portland and Frisco.

Over the next four or five years, she makes as many visits as she can, her trips funded, or so it seems, by a steady series of freelance journalism gigs, travel articles, perhaps.  Then she meets a man who looks like an Italian Peter Sellers.  I have one friend, Alice, who read this book thinking until shortly before the end that indeed it was Peter Sellers.<br /><br />But no, it is an Italian who falls in love with her.  Very romantic, except she speaks little Italian, despite her heritage and her culinary tastes.  He's handsome, goodlooking, dresses sharply, if conservatively as befits a banker, but with a hint of a repressed sexuality (she finds out that underneath his well-cut suits he wears underwear of purple silk.)  And this begins a strange romance, one which will make you weep a little as you remember your own first love, and which will also make you scratch your head a bit, worrying about our heroine and what will happen to her once the clouds of love and foodie-based endorphins dissipate. I sometimes wondered if Fernando isn't bipolar or something, he seems sort of moody, such as quitting his job once he latches on to the wonderful Marlena, or if he is taking advantage of her, like Isabel Archer when she married Gilbert Osmond in Henry James' THE WINGS OF THE DOVE which similarly is set in a dark, mysterious Venice, and features a bunch of characters like Madame Merle who certainly don't mean well for Isabel.<br /><br />I wonder if they are still married?  Alice says that her book club is now reading the sequel, in which Fernando and Marlena move abruptly to Tuscany, where UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN takes place, and that things continue to be puzzling between the lovers, but they are still together.  It just shows that perhaps, after all, what Grandma said is true, and that there's someone for everyone, and that love is made in Venice every night, as the old Burt Bacharach song used to tell us.  You will enjoy the scenes of Marlena shopping in the obscure botteghe of the canals, picking up lettuces and bringing them close to her face, like Mrs. Dalloway shopping for her party, but Italian style, ringed by harsh-voiced crones and old male peasants who bark out strange commands to her as she inspects their turnips and pasta.aps, after all, what Grandma said is true, and that there's someone for everyone, and that love is made in Venice every night, as the old Burt Bacharach song used to tell us.

Books	4	2	3	N	N	Like a Bosnian Version of MY NAME IS EARL	I've been watching the new NBC TV comedy hit MY NAME IS EARL, created by Greg Garcia, and about halfway through last night's episode, I began flashing back on this old novel by the Serbian novelist Alex Tisma, and I started wondering if maybe, just maybe, Greg Garcia might have read this one too!  The premise of the show, and the premise of the book, are eerily similar, like trying to distinguish between a couple of Monets.<br /><br />MY NAME IS EARL features skateboarder/actor Jason Lee as Earl Hickey, a low life piece of trailer trash who decides to change his life after winning a $100,000 lottery ticket.  Flicking through TV channels, he watches a banal chat show in which TRL front man Carson Daly is interviewed about karma-what it is, and what it isn't.  Earl becomes electrified at hearing the concept and decides to write down all the bad deeds he's done in his life (\\"Stole a car from a one-legged girl.  I'm sorry\\") and then attempt to atone for each, confronting his own guilt of long ago.<br /><br />How similar to the remarkable KAPO by Tisma!  In KAPO, it's 1983 in Yugoslavia, and an elderly man is reading the paper when he stumbles across the memory of a young Jewish girl whom he raped and defiled when she was his prisoner at Auschwitz.  Vilko Lamian didn't start out as a bad boy; in flashbacks we see that, Jewish himself, he was forced into becoming a Kapo (prison guard) by the Nazi's internal power structure, which forced even the Jews to spy on other Jews and to torment their own brothers and sisters.  Like Earl, Lamian decides to try to make amends by tracking down Helena, the woman he abused.  One of countless women because he was actually a pig.  Back and forth the novel goes, between past and present, and slowly we begin to understand and appreciate Tisma's slow, merciless anatomization of a man who's hit rock bottom and who wants to make amends, just as we do Earl Hickey in MY NAME IS EARL.	2005-10-05

Who would have guessed that Bugle Ann was a dog?<br /><br />A fox terrier in fact.  I didn't realize till after I got home that this book was part of the Derrydale Press Foxhunters Library.  If you have delicate stomachs or believe in animal rights and you don't like fox hunting, you're not going to enjoy this book, so buyer beware.  Kantor, who wrote this sequel in 1953, might not have been aware of the nascent animal rights movement.  If so, he probably would have stuck to his guns so to speak, but otherwise it would be so easy to pretend that Bugle Ann, and her daughter, the adorable \\"Little Lady,\\" were not fox terriers; they could just be collies or even poodles, it doesn't really matter to the storyline.  In fact you could pretend they were kittens!  The important thing i both volumes is that some people are just mean, and the way you know this is by how they treat animals.<br /><br />In VOICE, the meanest man in town gets sent to prison for murder because people thought that he killed Bugle Ann.  But luckily for the dog, lovely Camden Terry smuggled the injured hound far away where she could recover from her wounds.  She allowed mean old man Jacob Terry to go to jail, but finally she relented and got the governor to pardon him.  Good thing, too, as Camden was passionately in love with his son, Benji.  This was the book that gave rise to naming your dog, \\"Benji,\\" even a mutt.  Benjy has \\"Indian eyes as well as Indian mannerisms (we always suspected that there was a swipe of the red-brush, somewhere in the family ancestry)\\" so he's extremely good looking and can hunt like a dog.  Camden has eyes the color of violets and she's fragile, like a handkerchief.  And yet she and Benjy love going to this one Ozark restaurant called, The Chili Chariot.<br /><br />In the movie Maureen O'Sullivan played the part of Camden, \\"and in the sequel, set immediately after the events in Book One, the character of Camden Terry is very much like a Mia Farrow waif type, except more of a hillbilly I guess--but very delicate.

Truly the fairies must have been out in full attendance at his birth, leaving behind in their wake so many of the important things one really needs to pull off a task of such magnitude.  One fairy must have left little Tom the ability to research not only deeply, but laterally, so that we see no event without its full context, both historically and culturally.  Another talent is the ability to summon up words andimages to bring whatever it is you're writing about to life, like a magic wand shedding light on its subject.  Here we find out about the unhappy author Kurban Said, famous for a single novel, the heartbreaking romance ALI AND NINO, through the evidence of the things he touched and the things and people he left behind.<br /><br />Reiss is a subjective writer, nearly a poet, as well as an objective one; he seems to have all of 20th century history at his fingertips.  He must have used many charts just to keep track of the shifting borders and names of nations that have changed in our crazy century.  Sometimes you feel that the thread of the narrative--Lev Nussimbaum himself--is not as important as the cultural movements he participated in, or those he fled.  Sometimes we lose sight of Lev, a disappearing subject, behind the immense project of discerning who is resisting Communism. who is succumbing to nationalism, who is promoting modernism.  But even in his ghostly manifestation, Kurban Said leaves his traces, and ALI AND NINO will always be one of those books that, once you've read it, you'll be wondering about the interior life of the man who wrote it.<br /><br />THE ORIENTALIST is the product of some amazing encounters Reiss had, and he presents these with the glee and the awareness of magic we associate with a biographer like Richard Holmes.  Reiss has erased Coleridge's distinction between \\"fancy\\" and \\"imagination\\" in this important work of cultural history.	2005-10-04

Her book, A BITTER BREW, has garnished controversy for its unalloyed rendering of small town bickering and animosity.  The locals in Stephen King novels are pretty unpleasant, but their real life counterparts are much worse.  That's if we believe Ms. Young, who must think of herself as Maine's answer to Grace Metalious.<br /><br />She makes people sound horrible in the community, smallminded, petty animals who couldn't possibly have a glimpse into what spiritual life is supposed to be.<br /><br />Every member of the congregation seems to hold at least one other member in contempt.  Plus they are too cheap, or so Young hints, to bother hiring a minister, so they just give their own services in a half-assed way, knowing that at least greed and lust for food will bring people to services if only to eat.<br /><br />It seems awfully hard on the innocent people of the town.  Living in California I have no way to judge the verities of her mindset, but I think here might be another side to the story.  I too, have my doubts that Bondeson poisoned all those people.  But I don't think his sister had a thing to do with it!  Another suspect looms up among the arge cast of characters, and I think in years to come this \\"Bitter Brew\\" case will share the destiny of the Lizzie Borden case in Fall River--it will be argued about in many books and by many true crime aficionados.  It's great that Ms. Young has done all this research now while so many of the victims and suspects are still alive.  Too bad she couldn't persuade more of them to give their side of the story.  She spoke mainly to the disgruntled and suspicious, not to the happy.<br /><br />I love one of the reviewers who says she's a member of Gustav Adolphus, claiming that the church is a friendly place and to come on down, the services are good and \\"so is the coffee.\\"  Er, um, I don't know if you gave me $10,000 would I drink a cup of GA coffee.

Sawyer-Laucanno for attempting to give us a full-scale new reading of the complete works, while trying to clear a space so we can understand his complicated life a bit better.<br /><br />I wound up seeing the life clearly, and noticing for the first time the extreme high reaches of class privilege that made Cummings' poetry possible.  I suppose I had been reading this through the screen of Cummings' novel, THE ENORMOUS ROOM, with its bleak descriptions of prison poverty and deprivation, so without really thinking about it I just assumed that EE Cummings was sort of our American Genet, born of poverty, a hero of the underclass, an outsider artist who just scraped by, like Darger.  Far from it, Sawyer-Laucanno reveals.  Everything he did seems to have been paid for by generous friends or family, and even in the French jail he was able to buy cartons of cigarettes, razors, books, and fruit from the concierge, because he had a huge trust fund.<br /><br />Later, during the 1920s when he was writing all his masterpieces, the discerning Scofield Thayer became his patron.  Thayer was a complicated case; as editor of THE DIAL his taste helped usher in a new American modernism.  He married a beautiful and refined heiress, Elaine, and when Cummings fathered her daughter through an adulterous union, he assumed paternity of little \\"Mopsy\\" in a an act of upper-class generosity.  A few years later, he granted Elaine a divorce and she married Cummings, although only for two months.  Thayer began a descent into madness that lasted until his death in 1982.  He had apparently been gay the entire time and nurtured a secret passion for underage boys which got him in hot water from time to time, and perhaps he was in love with Cummings himself.  Why not, everyone else was.  Cummings must have had something, erotically speaking, for many women were drawn to him and not a few men.  In any case we can see, bleakly, how spoiled and privileged Cummings was.  No matter what harm he did to others, or to himself, someone would come along with a large checkbook and clean up after him.  It's appalling the selfishness, and yet if great poems come in the wake of such self-love, what real harm and what real benefit?  It's a stumper.<br /><br />Sawyer-Laucanno argues that Cummings' play, HIM, is a major ignored work of the American theater.  Such is his conviction that it fairly sweeps the reader into feeling the same way, or at any rate wanting to see a first rate production.  My idea is that HIM might make a really good movie--by Lars Von Trier perhaps.  I can see it on the screen of my imagination, thanks to Sawyer-Laucanno's persuasive, always elegant argumentation.<br /><br />As for the reviewer in the Washington Post Book World, I honestly don't know what to make of someone whose idea of the three great American poets is Whitman, Frost and Cummings.  What kind of mind comes up with that combo?  It's like the boys who formed the \\"Troika\\" in the later episodes of BUFFY.ged Cummings was.

But that won't happen, because of \\"democracy,\\" in which people \\"like\\" Arnold Schwarzenegger the same way they are said to \\"like\\" Bush, for once we like someone, there's no point in trying to change our mind, we're vapid.  The book explores the rise of Arnold from movie star to governor, and the disingenuousness with which the populace has perceived this change.  You get everything in this volume, from Wendy Leigh, to the famous PREMIERE article, to the concerted attempts by the LA Times to ruin Arnold's candidacy in the final days of his campaign.  The Florida anthrax story is worthy of a book all by itself, and it is still puzzling, one of the few authentic mysteries of modern times.<br /><br />The book is comprehensive and written beautifully.  I don't think Indiana gives enough allowance to the way that Arnold's gubernatorial victory was a comeback for him over the crumbling of the box office beneath his feet.  Once the greatest star in Hollywood, his career had become a disaster area you couldn't look away from--BATMAN AND ROBIN, anyone?  Indiana gives sensible, and prescient analyses of several of Arnold's movies, both hits and flops, but I don't think exegesis of END OF DAYS and THE RUNNING MAN goes very far past the most obvious places, the way people used to watch Don Siegel's THE KILLERS to watch Reagan whomp Angie Dickinson across the kisser.  In this regard Indiana, one of America's greatest critics and thinkers, pinpoints Arnold's appearance in August 2003 to announce his candidacy as emblematic, for it occurred during a taping of THE JAY LENO SHOW.<br /><br />He further cites Richard Hawkins, the LA artist who has a vast appreciation of Arnold as a, well, as a force to be reckoned with; as part of Hawkins' conceptual art project he got Arnold to sign autographs on copies of Plato's SYMPOSIUM and Arthur Symons' LOVE'S CRUELTY.  That Arnold obliged Hawkins is a sign (as in END OF DAYS) of a sort of identification slipperiness that has facilitated his rise in politics.  Liberals were slow to pick up on his true nature because, well, not only are we vapid but he did pose nude for PLAYGIRL or whatever.<br /><br />If you enjoyed reading the social satire, combined with a novelistic appreciation for textures and shadings, of something like Joan Didion's WHITE ALBUM, I expect you'll enjoy this short book very much indeed.  While Indiana is pretty much a dyed-in-the-wool New Yorker, he has set several of his lively, penetrating novels in California, and obviously the state fascinates him, the way that Medusa is said to have exerted a hypnotic, horrified pull over all those who gazed naked on her face.  With such an enthralled gaze, he has seen things invisible to those of us who live among its rarefied airs, who walk blindly and blithely in its fogs.<br /><br />Occasionally the breadth of his thought pushes too far across the page, disappearing at the edges into a kind of mobius strip of contempt.  On  one page he is chastising media commentators for making scandals disappear by claiming that \\"it is nothing that hasn't happened before,\\" claiming a grasp of history they don't have; a hundred pages later he's mocking the propensity of the media to find \\"bellwethers\\" everywhere, particularly in California. To me these two tendencies are in opposition to each other, and if Gary Indiana doesn't think so, he could at least explain why.  But what a tiny fault, that won't distract, from the pleasure you'll get from this amazing book.  It opened my eyes that's for sure.M and Arthur Symons' LOVE'S CRUELTY.

I can picture a big montage of her kissing and hugging lots of guys with different scenery behind them (like the Leaning Tower of Pisa, or the Great Wall of China).  On the hot desert sands of Burning Man, Jennifer nearly meets her match, but she winds up going on nearly 60 dates before she meets Mr. Right.  If there were a contest going to find new movie roles for Colin Firth and Renee Zellweger, this is the book I would pick for them to star in, for it has everything their fans want, good looking backdrops, high class romance and chivalry, a bit of sex confusion, and most of all, two lovers doomed to spend the rest of their lives together, they just don't know it yet.<br /><br />Jennifer works for a travel publishing company and really knows how to travel light.  Her wardrobe disasters make for some funny reading, but what really hooks you in the book are the guys, most of whom she meets on line, or helpful friends hook her up.  I wondered why she doesn't date outside of her own color line, but maybe she (like Nellie Forbush in SOUTH PACIFIC) has a little bit of prejudice still clinging to her--if not prejudice per se, then let's just call it provincialism.  She should just have stayed at Burning Man the whole time if she just wanted to meet twenty and thirty something white boys.<br /><br />She is not much of a stylist, but when it comes to packing and letting her hair down, two tasks she's very gifted at.  And when she falls in love, like the song, \\"it will be forever.\\"  The whole Cox family sounds appealing and her husband is a lucky man.  Although why did she feel obliged to see all the remaining guys (out of the 80 dates) while in love with someone else?  You can't help but feel for those poor schnooks who were dating this American girl but they weren't going to get to first base even, not a chance.  Can't wait for the movie.	2005-09-29

Busby knew where all the bodies were buried in his capacity as top speechwriter for Johnson, extremely close to the man for twenty years or more, and inventor of the catchphrase, \\"The Great Society.\\"<br /><br />The book, while never less than elegantly written, is scattershot in its approach, and jumps back and forth in chronology like a human pinball machine, skimming the surfaces here and there, then coming down to dwell lovingly and cinematically on some unlikely venues, such as a trip with Johnson in November of 1963, to Brussels for a conference.  LBJ in Brussels, of all places, it's unreal!  Here Busby really goes to town, exploring the insecurities that fueled Johnson's drive to the top and which made him the most feared man in politics.<br /><br />And yet he had his charming side too, and Buzz was there for large chunks of it.  There's a long, fleshed out memoir of arriving with Johnson at Hyannisport in 1960, not knowing whether or not Kennedy would want him as his candidate for Vice President.  There's no denying that Johnson was the odd man out among the Kennedys; in one hilarious moment he can't understand JFK's accent, despite trying to read his lips.  You won't get this kind of intimate, novelistic detail anywhere else.<br /><br />But often \\"Buzz\\" seems overdiscreet, drawing a veil over the very things that the reader wants to know more about.  Buzz's son Scott, who introduces this posthumously published memoir, suggests that Buzz came to feel he had given all his \\"good Lyndon stories\\" to Caro in their many interviews, and that the book we now have represents perhaps the not-so-good stories which Caro didn't find interesting enough to include in any of the three volumes published so far.  And sometimes Buzz's speechwriting strength betray him as a memoirist; his highly praised alliteration for example, grows inane when it is employed to open a paragraph with \\"The prolonged procrastination was highly provocative . . . \\"<br /><br />What else is memorable about this all too brief book?  Well, I liked finding out more about Johnson's religious background as a \\"Digressive.\\"  I never even heard to term before, and now it seems utterly key to understanding the man.  Buzz' dad, a strict preacher type, hesitated before giving his boy his blessing to work for LBJ, fearing that the latter's \\"Digressive\\" qualities would corrupt Buzz.  Johnson's own father emerges as a salty old son of a gun, telling his son not to forget that \\"If a fella starts trying to climb a pole, he usually ends up showing his ass.\\"  It was a lesson Johnson was never to forget.<br /><br />In one touching chapter Busby, together with Interior Secretary Stewart Udall, travel to Gettysburg to represent the administration at the Eisenhower farm, as Ike and Mamie prepare to leave their home forever (they have deeded it to the National Park Service).  Both Eisenhowers come to life vividly, and their lives together for forty-five years touchingly adumbrated, in Busby's careful rendering of a moment in time.<br /><br />Busby provides lovely word portraits both of fragile, thoughtful Jackie Kennedy and the amazing Lady Bird.  Either of these would make the book worth reading all by themselves, but yet there is a whole lot more in THE THIRTY-FIRST OF MARCH.  Don't let this one slip under your radar.inane when it is employed to open a paragraph with \\"The prolonged procrastination was highly provocative . . . \\"    What else is memorable about this all too brief book?

He is still with us, I believe, but more or less a spent force.  Here, in CONTROL, he effortlessly turns out one of the more interesting thrillers of the 1980s, a book that feels like the best Stephen King book not written by King.  Parts of it are very much like King's FIRESTARTER, but ever since My Lai and Watergate many thrillers took as their underlying mise-en-scene a government corrupt on the inside with a specialty of bizarre military experiments that involved an absoulte disregard for human life.<br /><br />In this one--well, it isn't fair to say.  Goldman fans love his powers of invention and his grasp of all kinds of characters--an elementary grasp, but a powerful one, like Schwartzenegger's handshake.  Here he goes back to BUTCH CASSIDY form to re-stir yet another buddy-comedy plot, in this case a young cop and an old cop, who hate each other, then love each other, that is perhaps the best thing about the novel.  I don't think Goldman's true talents lie in trying to imagine the inner life of an ambitious female painter--no, that is beyond him.  The paintings that Edith Mazursky accomplishes are, we are told, great behemoths of something entirely new; her dealer swoons over them, the critics rave, but we never believe any of this for a minute.<br /><br />The savage killer, \\"Billy Boy,\\" is another laughable cliche, but perhaps time has supplied the laughs and back then in 1982 he wasn't such a carbon copy of every other sociopath.  I'm undecided about this and will give Goldman the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />Finally, the creation of the tutor, Theo, and the spoiled rich princess, Charlotte, is something new under the sun, and still, years and years after Goldman first wrote CONTROL, this subplot is still daring enough to take the reader's breath away.  I can't say why here, for it depends on a trick of perspective--the sort of \\"twist\\" that made THE SIXTH SENSE a surprise only if you didn't know there WAS a twist going in.  So forget I said anything, and I think you will get a big kick out of the mind of William Goldman and his awesome CONTROL.away.

The boy and girl who lives there grew up too fast, leaving behind their children's books and simple toys, and becoming crack addicts-or, to use the language of the animated feature SPIRIT, addicts of the crack.  Thus their abandoned toys seemed to speak of a childhood pushed away too quickly, like a spoiled child will push away the food on the table he secretly craves, in order to illustrate some point of self-esteem!  Sad the way we starve ourselves of the things that matter.<br /><br />But happily for me, little Benji had not done much coloring in this how-to guidebook.  Like I say, I always had trouble sketching in the faces and bodies of the CIMARRON crew-Spirit, Rain, Little Creek, the eagle.  Nothing worked, and I couldn't find anyone skilled enough at Dreamworks Animation Technique to help me at my office.  The faces of Rain, Spirit, Little Creek and others would haunt my dreams at night, and when the shadows of morning crawled in across the windowpane I would struggle for a pencil, trying to trace their faces on a pad of paper.  But the faces I loved grew misshapen, and the eraser at the end of the pencil was in for a beating.<br /><br />Now along comes a book which shows you exactly how to get the results you desire.  From the slightly square, trim face of plucky little Spirit, to the bold human planes of brave Little Creek, the whole range of anatomy is stripped bare.  I said to my dog, \\"You'd be able to make your own tattoo of these guys if you wanted to,\\" for as all animators know, once you know the secrets, a few brisk strokes in the right direction will bring recognizable faces to life, just as though we see them in our hearts.  I went through the whole course in a little under ten weeks, turning this into the \\"Summer of Spirit, Stallion of the Cimarron, and Friends.\\"marron, and Friends.\\"	2005-09-27

In the wake of the notorious Mepham High School football scandal, this book comes as a wake up call.  It would be fair to say that actually this novel is nothing more than the Mepham case with the names changed and the athletic action switched from the gridiron to the hoops; it's pretty transparent that way.  Well, Upton Sinclair wasn't subtle either.  Nor is any man on a crusade against sodomy.<br /><br />Old school print journalist Ben Mitchell gets interested in the death of a high school basketball player on Long Island, whose body has floated ashore.  With the help of student reporter Sam Perry, Ben quickly maps out the lay of the land in a perverted, though very starry, b-ball organization.  Its pecking order is maintained by a strict system of threats and balances, and a pivotal part of team control lies in systemic anal rape of fellow teammates.  In one genuinely creepy scene, the boy reporter is lured to a desolate park in the woods where he is assaulted and sat on, his pants and shorts removed.  From behind a broomstick, its handle coated in mineral ice to improve lubrication, enters his rectum as he squirms and cries, just an inch, that's all, enough to show him who's in control.  When he agrees to lay off his investigation, his attackers laugh sadistically and promise him that if he doesn't obey their threats to the letter, that broomstick gets shoved in all the way.<br /><br />It's no idle threat.  They've already made their will known by using a basketball summer camp as a rape staging area, pressing a pinecone up the ass of one outnumbered boy, whispering to him \\"You like to be close to nature, don't you?\\"  The trouble is that this campaign of intimidation can continue indefinitely, since each raped boy would (literally) rather die than have his assault reported, for fear that other boys would say he enjoyed it.  Sam is taunted with the nickname, \\"Broomstick Boy.\\"  Others try suicide.<br /><br />Lupica links this isolated case to a nationwide system of sexual abuse among teammates, citing dozens of real life cases.  He suggests provocatively that such abuse is built-in to teams with multiple \\"stars,\\" since such teams have a radical instability that implodes on itself.  Shag and Kobe, he says, dislike each other, because on any team there can be only \\"one f--ing man.\\"  These codes of masculinity may seem outdated, but to the guard with blood dripping out his butt, staining the radiant white of his uniform shorts, it's no laughing matter.ed it.

Everyone with an interest in movies knows that the divine Julie Christie emerged during a period of UK filmmaking in the early 1960s that marked a revival of world interest in British cinema, playing very much the contemporary, disaffected \\"chick\\" of so-called swinging London.  Her subsequent sppearance in Truffaut's FAHRENHEIT 451 was widely regarded as a mis-step, that science fiction wa snot her metier.  But as Mitton shows, Christie made her first big breakthrough in a BBC version of Hoyle's \\"The Nature of the Universe.\\"  This series was re-titled A FOR ANDROMEDA, and Hoyle personally selected Julie Christie from a number of pretty girls he viewed at RADA.  \\"That's her!\\" he exclaimed, and a star was born!  So for Christie, FAHRENHEIT 45` was not such an anomaly after all.  Mitton treats the matter of Hoyle's relations with film companies with the same cool accuracy with which he handles the more controversial aspects of Hoyle's life.<br /><br />It was a wonderful life in which he sought to bring back international interest in and prestige for British astronomy after a sorry period in the immediate postwar era.  CONFLICT IN THE COSMOS suffers from one fault, a nationalism which perhaps never even occurs to author Mitton, an underlying assumption that what's good for Britain is good for astrophysics and the two things to me don't seem that equivalent.<br /><br />We see Hoyle as a man with irrational bursts of confidence and indeed over-confidence, with sort of a big mouth that got him into trouble now and again.  Mitton carefully details the events of the scandal surrounding Hoyle's ill-timed remarks on the 1974 Nobel award for physics to Martin Ryle and Antony Hewish.  When Hoyle publicly stated that \\"the girl\\" Jocelyn Bell had been cheated of a third share in the Prize, the fat was really in the fire and an enormous hoopla ignited.  Hoyle himself might have lost his chance for a Nobel himself, and as Mitton hints he might very well have had a chance to win it in 1983, had not his intemperate remarks put his hopes in purdah.<br /><br />And yet he had courage, vision, a brilliance of mind and perception that come along (in astronomy) once every thirty or forty years, and he was unafraid to put his ass on the line when it came to speaking up for causes he believed in.  We won't see his like again, and the world is a sadder place since he folded up his telescope and disappeared into starlight.the fat was really in the fire and an enormous hoopla ignited.

As many other reviewers have noticed, the book is rife with anti-Mormon sympathies and it sort of does for members of the Latter Day Saints what BIRTH OF A NATION does for black people--i.e., no favors.  What will Mormons make of a story which casts one of them as the heroine and all the others as a bunch of low class, scurvy thieving swine with nothing better on their minds than \\"wiving\\" and basically swindling poor Jane out of her wonderful ranch in the Cottonwoods of Utah.<br /><br />Instead Jabe winds up crossing the line and falling for a \\"Gentile,\\" the cowboy Lassiter who wields a six shooter and rides like the wind.  She abdicates her place in respectable society to become \\"infamous, notorious,\\" as she sobs out on the purple plain, \\"a rustler's girl and nothing more.\\"<br /><br />The two of them share a common love for children and the West, which Lassiter tries to hide behind his mask of not caring a damn for any person, place, thing or religion.  His cold, hard impassivity becomes a screen on which Jane projects her romantic and sexual feelings, which are echoed daily and nightly in Grey's remarkable prose, a splashy palette of colors and earth tones.  It won't take you long to rip through this romantic thriller, but you too will be amazed by the sympathetic treatment Zane Grey gives to his heroine, even though she slips through the fingers of morality like a jet of clear sparkling water from the Cottonwood River.  Her life of sin is not total debauchery however, for she remains chaste, and lets the landscape, especially its canyons, reveal her pulsating desires.	2005-09-22

Mandel and his pilgrimage to America's greatest natural resource, the magical \\"Field of Dreams\\" built as a movie set in Dyersville, Iowa.<br /><br />Everyone wants to go, but few of us (comparatively speaking) can afford to get up from our lives and leave our jobs and do as Brett H. Mandel did, for he stepped out onto the plate and felt like a kid again.  You know how, in the movie, the famous line goes something like, \\"If you build it, they will come\\"?  That's what happens here.<br /><br />In our lives, friends come and go, lovers leave, children grow up and parents say goodbye, and we put our poor little cat to sleep, but baseball is forever.<br /><br />The book is half like a nonfiction account of the making of the Kinsella book and the Costner movie.  You will probably be surprised at how much passion all the actors put into filming the thing, not knowing at that time how much the movie would strike a responsive chord in the hearts of many who have seen it.  Not only men, and not only Americans either.  Yes, thousands of people travel from all over the world to see this imaginary field, and to have their photograph taken like the \\"children of the corn.\\"  And why?  Mandel explores some of the reasons in the other part of the book, which is sort of like a pop psychology guide the kind of this Dr. Joyce Brothers might give you if she were a guy.<br /><br />And then, Mandel gives you the other stories, the people who flock to Dyersville the way people flock to Lourdes in France, hoping for a cure, a cure not necessarily for disease but for a deeper angst, and they come away from Iowa feeling connected, part of the great hub of being.  If you're looking for a gift for Dad, look no further.  This is the jackpot.  This is hardcore.	2005-09-21

Escober's book THE GIVENCHY CODE AN HOMAGE AND A PARODY on the recommendation of a friend, who saw a copy of Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE in a store window, and who told me that he had recently laughed himself silly with this cheeky little parody.<br /><br />All of Dan Brown's affectations are affectionately skewered here.  In The DA VINCI CODE, we learned a lot of history that was sometimes not so subtly disguised as fiction.  Same thing occurs in GIVENCHY.  Chapter 55 alone, the history of sparkling wine, is worth the price of this cunning book.<br /><br />It should be a best seller, because Escober does for Dan Brown what Frederick Crews did for WINNIE THE POOH, i.e., totally tears him apart in a loving manner and providing the grateful reader with hours of thankful chuckles.  The riddles that Fr. Theo and Puca must solve are mind-numbingly funny, as well as being sort of difficult.  For example, What do Superman, Moses, and the Cabbage Patch Kids all have in common?<br /><br />Instead of THE LAST SUPPER, Escober lowers the boom this time on the famous MONA LISA.  She is smiling and you will be too.  Enjoy this excellent send up and remember: \\"The Holy Grail is not a cup!\\"	2005-09-21

Re-reading it again after many years, it seems to me to share some similarities to CURTAIN, Poirot's last case.  Both of them are sort of bloodless, intellectual thrillers that play with ideas in a modernist way.  BUCKLE is all about the cult of the superman, in this case the sacred financier Alistair Blunt, the Bernard Baruch type moneymind whom Britain \\"needs\\" and whose wellbeing is necessary to prevent the collapse of the UK economy.  The attitude of the police and the secret service is, He may have his peccadilloes, but by Jove we need him in this country.  In CURTAIN, which must have been written about the same time, the superman takes a darker turn, he is the man who can inspire others to commit murder for him, by the power of suggestion, but anyone who finishes ONE, TWO, BUCKLE MY SHOE will know why I linked these two books on this one point.<br /><br />I was surprised and shocked by the ending.  Only Poirot could have figured out all the ramifications of the case, as well as to pull out the identity of the killer's accomplice out of thin air.  I don't feel that Christie was using \\"fair play\\" in this novel, but it is so baffling that I don't even care!  I love reading about her tormented, independent young women who cab't stand their own lives and yearn for something better--in this case. Jane Oliveira, the financier's niece.  I wonder if elements of this novel didn't find their way into Ben Hecht's screenplay for Hitchcock's film NOTORIOUS.  It's all about how you live with yourself when you're doing something wrong if it is for the public good, or if you can persuade yourself that it is while you're committing the crime (or sin, to be moral about it).<br /><br />BUCKLE, like CURTAIN, is a little vague about--is there a war going on or not?  Maybe it is set in an alternate universe in which others are fighting the war so we don't have to talk about it.  In today's political climate, that kind of aesthetic amnesia rings a bell.

At the hospital the staff is a closeknit bunch of surgeons, who all stick up for each other--up to a point.  Will is an avid supporter of the Hippocrates Society, an ad hoc group of doctors and patients questioning the hegemony of managed care consortiums, while his love interest, Patty Moriarity, is a cop battling sexism and condescension from her our department, while try to solve a case of serial murder.  Seems as though the heads of HMOs are being dispatched brutally, and only one clue remains--each of the bodies comes tagged with two letters of the alphabet.  Patty's boss has a theory, that if you get enough of these alphabet letters, they'll start to spell something--a message, a clue.  In the meantime an anonymous voice is telling Dr. Grant that he is the messiah of the radical opposition to HMOs, and the reader instantrly thinks that the whispery voice on the phone is that of the killer.<br /><br />Despite working 80 hours a week just to make the nut for his child support, Will volunteers at a nearby soup kitchen, helping the indigent.<br /><br />This comes in handy later on when circumstances force him to penetrate shadowy Dennis Way, a drug and gang ridden alleyway in Roxbury, the black quarter of Boston, and Will must deal with some dangeroud gang members who speak in a variety of hip hop slang never heard before in fact or fiction.  Sorry, Michael Palmer, you're great and all, but son't try imitating the speech of black youth, because you're just not up to it!<br /><br />I won't give away any spoilers, but suffice it to say that Will is accused of a terrible crime and struck off the medical register, his privileges at Frederickston General suspended, and Patty is the officer assigned to interview him.  At first she thinks him guilty, but then one or two things persuade her sharp mind that he might be innocent; then Nature turns over and Patty and Will feel a strong sexual heat between them.  Palmer makes us feel their passion for each other, a passion which turns to admiration and finally to love.  It's a beautiful love story, even if the case itself is absurd to the nth degree.  You won't believe the final answer to the alphabet letters code, it's ridiculous.  And the army of professional assassins and torturers combine the worst of Ian Fleming and E. Phillips Oppenheim.

Fisher	Books	4	37	38	N	N	Not Always Pretty	I enjoyed Joan Reardon's intimate biography of the food writer MFK Fisher quite a lot but the pleasures of reading it deepened into dispiriting reflections on how intrusive biography can be.  Taking its title from an inane description of Fisher;s writing by John Updike, POET OF THE APPETITE peers almost literally into the abyss, the destruction and mixed feelings left behind by a talented, &#34;play-acting&#34; lady's sweep through life.  Reardon details the events of Fisher's three marriages almost as though she'd been there, and she brings to life some long affairs as well.  Before reading this book, I don't remember knowing that Fisher had often had to fight off members of her own sex, and occasionally she succumbed, bragging about it later.  In contrast to the three dimensionality imparted to Fisher's male lovers, it is perhaps unfortunate that Reardon seems unwilling to portray the estimable Marietta Voorhees as anything other than a quarrelsome, needy, aged and ugly pest, whose function in Fisher's life was to whine and to fret about her mother.<br /><br />Meanwhile a comparable affair with a man, her late in life hook up with Esuqire editor and Hemingway buddy Arnold Gingrich, a married man no less, is presented as kind of cute in that old-lovers Cocoon way.<br /><br />Most distasteful is Reardon's prompt, efficient way of laying out the whole sad story of Anna Parrish, Fisher's younger daughter.  After reading the facts of her life in this book, how could poor Anna ever raise her head high again?  Reardon eviscerates her as a hedonistic hippie who let her toddler walk across a six lane highway unattended, while she was having a manic episode on a commune.  I guess part of the point is that Fisher's karma finally caught up with her.<br /><br />And what about the food industry, which drove Fisher to restless spasms of having to produce a new book every year even when she was dying, or trying to?  Those late books are looking more and more grotesque, like the late De Koonings produced by &#34;the Master&#34; in the stages of Alzheimers Disease.  And yet, as Reardon shows, Fisher was complicit in their production.  Anything for a buck or so it seems.  I liked reading the book, its cool analysis, its thorough research, its sturdy construction, best of all for showing us, in more detail than entirely necessary, how a legend fights its way into being, and folks, it isn't always pretty.34;the Master&#34; in the stages of Alzheimers Disease.

Also there is Estelle, sort of an Estelle Winwood type, a shrewish spinster nobody likes--she is Pennington;s disapproving and acerbic sister.  But just because she is nasty in her manner doesn't mean she deserves to be killed.  And then there is Nick Barclay, the son of the black sheep who took off for American many years back.  Nick has made his own thudding pile of filthy lucre in the American magazine game, working for a magazine very much like TIME or LIFE.  Now he is returning to Greengrove to settle accounts with his timid uncle.<br /><br />Nick Barclay begs his best friend from school to accompany him on the journey back to Greengrove.  Our hero is the friend, a historian called Garret Anderson, once a humble schoolmaster but for a strange turn of events, his book on Macaulay has been turned into a big Broadway musical and now he is reaping pots of money, and never has to work again.  Garret himself is very much suffering, however, from an attachment that has gone sour.  It seems that some months before the action of the novel, he took a European trip and met an Englishwoman, Fay Wardour, with whom he fell in love, and she seemed to be in love with him, and yet at the conclusion of their romantic jounrey together, she upped and disappeared, and he has been unable to track her down.  (This is in the days before the internet, I assume nowadays he would have just googled her and thus cut out a long and somewhat tedious part of the book.)  The love story between Fay and Garret is unbelievable to the point where you think that John Dickson Carr has really lost it in this book.  The reason that Fay has withheld herself from Garret is, in a word, stupid.<br /><br />However, don't write off this insensately clever book!  It has a whale of a storyline and, even thought no murder is committed in this novel, it will have you scratching your head in puzzlement and rubbing your fists in suspense, for Dr. Fell has himself a truly unique problem to solve.

The story of Ray Bradbury is the story of Los Angeles, and the growth of both writer and city have many incisive parallels.  No wonder Bradbury found himself drawn into the world of Hollywood and screenwriting.  Perhaps no one but him would have the remarkable naivete to even attempt to write a screenplay out of MOBY DICK.<br /><br />Weller is sort of over the top when it comes to praising Bradbury, who really hadn't written anything all that good in thirty years or more, and yet oddly emough he fails to give proper credit to his last really great project, the screenplay for PICASSO SUMMER, one of the most underrated Hollywood movies of the 1960s.  When the film is finally re-released I think its time will come, and it will be recognized as a provocative, adult love story in the mode of TWO FOR THE ROAD or, more recently, Wong Kar Wai's IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE.  Odd--paradoxical even--that one of the screen's most adult achievememets was the brainchild of Weller's eternal \\"puer.\\"<br /><br />Weller himself is very much like the Sam Weller of THE PICKWICK PAPERS, always optimistic, energetic, a little over his own head, but likable and funny.  Could he be using a pseudonym--or did Charles Dickens predict his coming way back when in the 1830s?  Ray Bradbury, perhaps, can let us know.  \\"A Sound of Pickwick Thunder,\\" perhaps?	2005-09-20

They're so insulting to the reader, especially when the author doesn't even bother updating them.  Thus in this brand new book we find out (in an essay called \\"The Self-renewing Jane Austen\\") that Jane Austen is the hottest film property of the 1990s.  Fascinating back then, but we've moved on.  \\"Austenites will soon have a film of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, starring Emma Thompson.\\"  How much work would it have been for Brooke Allen to go back and put this essay into the past tense--or better yet, update the status of Austen's alleged trendiness?  Show your readers some respect, don't fob them off with these puff pieces you got paid for writing already by the magazines which commissioned them.  Reading a book like this is like being stuck in a dentist office with four year old copies of PEOPLE (or in this case, THE NEW CRITERION).  Could anything be more dire?<br /><br />That said, Brooke Allen is an amusing commentator and I can see why editors, hoping to provide a bit of a splash, hire her to write about books.  In one case (the last essay, a survey of Simon Raven's life and work) she actually writes something of consequence, something unexpected.  And even her rehashes of familiar material have a lightness about them, like Julia Child's pastry.  Her account of Henty, the celebrated English children's author of the Victorian Era, has a glowy shine, like the flush one gets while watching THE FOUR FEATHERS.  While she's no Fran Lebowitz she likes her jokes and verbal horseplay.  In short, she's amusing--laughing gas pumped into the dentist's office to make the wait less painful.<br /><br />Brooke Allen is the author of a previous book which used similar techniques while limiting herself, then, to the 20th century.  Here she goes back to Pepys, Austen, H.C. Andersen, etc., and the focus stutters and wobbles, maybe her talent is being stretched a bit too far.	2005-09-19

Stout's corpus depends on personality to a damaging extent and, granted, while the chemistry between Wolfe and Archie Goodwin is well done (especially in this book, where Archie makes a sizable number of funny wisecracks), it wears thin, now, finally, after seventy years or whatever it is.  I know that's sacrilegious to say, but I never got it and now it just seems lame.  Why is he so disagreeable?  Why is it so hard to pry him out of his apartment?  The orchids, the fat, the acerbic wit-are these the decorations an aspiring author hung on his creation to differentiate him from a mass of other sleuths (a la Ariadne Oliver's vegetarian Finn detective, Sven Hjerson) or do they amount to a recognizable personality?  For me, no; for millions of other Stout fans, yes indeed.<br /><br />Heterosexual horndog Archie Goodwin's always hot after the prettiest woman on every case, while Nero Wolfe looks on his progress with a ill-concealed leer.  He's into it, but he disguises his lust with a \\"Pfui!\\" exclamation.  BEFORE MIDNIGHT, from 1955, is the 18th Nero Wolfe novel and, incidentally, the first Wolfe novel that Stout wrote as a follow-up, or maybe a corrective, to his famous \\"origin story, \\" THE BLACK MOUNTAIN, in which we found out much more than ever before about Nero Wolfe's Serbian or Montenegro past.  The world of advertising into which Stout plunges us in BEFORE MIDNIGHT is almost ludicrously \\"contemporary,\\" Madison Avenue satire that was so popular in the 1950s, it's almost as though Stout was afraid he had offended his audience with his previous, brooding, \\"serious\\" revenge novel and then wanted to make amends by making BEFORE MIDNIGHT more lightweight or at any rate jokey than usual.  One million dollars in prizes is a pretty hefty sum, and what it must have been like in 1955 money I don't even like to think!  No wonder there are five major suspects and a short list of a few more.<br /><br />The fact that the victim had all the answers in his wallet, and only in his wallet, and everyone knew it, tweaks the plausibility meter but face it, if it wasn't for this far-fetched circumstance we wouldn't have much of a book now, would we?

She has always been one to look underneath the surface of things; as an actress her training was in the Poets Theater of Cambridge, and her mother was the famous Mary Manning of Dublin's Abbey Theater.  Thus there's a tendency to examine, sometimes at length, the underside of process, the thickness of what we do and especially what we say, when writing takes place, as the wind that reveals the silver underside of the leaves we'd otherwise never notice.<br /><br />THE MIDNIGHT is fairly shaking with sadness, regret, and the stern obligations of memory, as Howe again scans the marginalia of another.  This time it's her late uncle and the books he left behind in a seemingly otherwise blank (or pathetic) existence, specifically his copies of R L Stevenson-the novelist admired above all others by Howe's hero Henry James.  As she turns the pages of the novel, parts of her uncle's life (and family photographs) seem to pop out like something from a Nick Bantock novel, but it's all part of Howe's finely tuned poetry machine, the unexpected choice of word and quotation, the sizzle of disjunction and more than anything else, the shiver of anticipation that one is getting something from this poetry unavailable elsewhere, a direct pipeline into a strain of American experience that the past has otherwise denied us.  It's suspenseful, and fun too, like an Indiana Jones movie.  Don't let people tell you differently.	2005-09-09

John Hossack, whose head was split open with an axe as he lay sleeping in a farmhouse packed with people, wasn't a pleasant man, but he didn't deserve to be murdered so brutally.  His wife was arrested immediately after the funeral.<br /><br />Bryan and Thomas Wolf show us how the USA was still reeling from the Lizzie Borden case, in which similarly people were shocked at trying to imagine a respectable woman wielding an axe and killing another famly member.  They argue that Borden was acquitted solely to her gender, and that immediately afterwards people in Fall River, even the jurors, began to feel that they had been mistaken and that Lizzie was indeed guilty.  In Warren County, they were not about to make the same mistake.  Jurors had already sent to prison another woman who had killed her husband, the infamous, sexy Sarah Kuhn, who poisoned her impotent husband to make way for a new lover on the side.<br /><br />Bryan and Wolf have little direct testimony from Margaret Hossack, beyond her appearances before the grand jury and at her trials, but what they produce in its stead is a fine recap of another woman's diary, Emily Gillespie, whose life parallels Margaret Hossack and who kept a detailed diary of the awful life farmer's wives had to face in the period.  Unlike Margaret Hossack, Gillespie got out and managed to divorce her abusive husband before an act of violence could be enacted.<br /><br />There were some plausible suspects, and Bryan and Wolf add suspense to their story by dangling some of them in front of us like carrots to a donkey.  My pick is John Haines, the farmer neighbor who went mad after being questioned by the sheriff and was clapped into the insane asylum after raving mad, thus preventing his testimony at the first trial.  To me, he certainly seemed capable of killing John Hossack.  I think he was probably the son of either John or Margaret, and carried a grudge against them for giving him away.<br /><br />The prosecution pulled out all the stops, arguing that Margaret Hossack was the next thing to Satan.  Harry McNeil, the DA, stated, \\"Never since the crucifixion of Christ has there been a crime of more hideous nature than this.\\"  Whoa!<br /><br />The odd thing is that a great American writer was on the scene, working for the Des Moines News as a cub reporter.  And years later she, Susan Glaspell, wrote up her memories of the Margaret Hossack trial into a controversial play, \\"Trifles,\\" and a stunning short story, \\"A Jury of her Peers.\\"  These works of enduring genius are what first attracted Bryan's attention to the long ago case, and she and her husband have written a book that, while no masterpiece itself, is worthy of being placed on the same shelf as Glaspell's originals.  MIDNIGHT ASSASSIN is continually interesting, from page to page, chapter to chapter.  It is subtle and it is delving.  It doesn't take the easy way out, but continues asking the difficult questions.

Gone are the days when a career would be ruined if the gossip about, say, June Allyson's sex life had left the confines of Sunset Boulevard.<br /><br />I suppose there were always stars who played up their dark side, and made it a topic of unspoken agreement between themselves and their audience.  Robert Mitchum's pot bust back in 1948 didn't hurt his career because he could brazen it out so cheekily that we admire his gumption.  Simultaneously, no one ever mistook Lana Turner for a nun.  Pamela Anderson knows this territory better than anyone in America and she and her ghost writer Eric Shaw Quinn have combined the wilder sides of their own personalities and made Star just a little bit larger than life.  Take a cue from Jackie Susann, they make sure that the \\"roman a clef\\" portions of STAR STRUCK are never too difficult to solve.  People around America are wasting none of our valuable time wondering for long, \\"Gee, what show is LIFEGUARDS, INC\\"?<br /><br />If Pam wrote the book I'd be surprised, but when we saw her last year at the West Hollywood Book Fair promoting the first book, STAR, it seemed evident that she had at least read it.  This one has even more twists and turns, and Star's wonderful brother plays a large part in the plot; he should have a book of his own, he's dreamy.  Star and Jimi-the rock star boyfriend/husband with the oversized sex organ--get involved in a murder rap and a creepy stalker gets his ass handed to him-I thought that bit harsh.  Outside of that, STAR STRUCK is a book for those who love Pam, those who love cuddly animals, and people who just like to read about beautiful people having better sex than I do.

In person he could be rather abrasive, to the point of being ridiculous, like Ross Hunter in a caftan.  But on the pages of his book, he exhibits a warm, spiritual nature, almost like a priest.  Since the days of the Chekhov dynasty, the director has of course assumed near divine proportions in the theater and you get the feeling Ball enjoyed that role, but he is often very courteous towards his actors.  He even goes so far as to say that \\"one of the director's most important qualifications is knowing when NOT to interrupt his actors.\\"<br /><br />He was a professional director and the book covers every contingency from \\"first reading to opening night.\\"  Some of Ball's advice is not going to help you if you are an amateur.  He gives the advice that actors, like cattle, can't hold too many ideas in their heads at one time so he urges the director to come up with a shorthand of small verbs or nouns with which the actor might make himself aware at all times.  \\"Seduce,\\" for example, might be his direction to the actor playing Cleopatra.  Sounds elementary, but it works!  After all, he was the man who boasted that he discovered Annette Bening.<br /><br />He notes that often, for the first ten minutes of a play, the audience finds itself uncomfortable, with a marked realization of the artificiality of theater.  They are sitting in a dark room and watching a bunch of people all lit up pretending to be real.  As directors our job is to make those first ten minutes fly by so that the dream can swamp the audience and take them along with us on our journey.  In passages like this one, he writes beautifully.  Within a year or two after completing his book he was summarily fired from ACT and not long after that he had left this world for another, behind the curtains of life.  Sad ending for what was once a glorious if eccentric career.orld for another, behind the curtains of life.  Sad ending for what was once a glorious if eccentric career.	2005-08-31

Through some strange effect of physics, each of the children born at that time has something wrong with him-or right, some special spooky power they cannot figure out.  Some have extra special sensitivity, others super strength.  Some of the superpowers are funny, some quite poignant.  Like the X Men, Midnight's Children are (mostly) ashamed of their special gifts; and this becomes a metaphor for the admixture of Hindu and Muslim that made up India until the partition a year or so later and the birth of Pakistan.  And still the races and religions cavort in an eternal spectacle of high and low.  Saleem's own power is the ability to experience smells with more punch than ordinary citizens, and you can imagine in the pungent provinces of India he visits this is as much a curse as a blessing.<br /><br />The two babies, switched at birth, become each other's opposite number.  A Hindu boy, raised as a Muslim; a Muslim, raised Hindu.  As Shakespeare said, in ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL:  \\"For I the ballad will repeat/ Which men full true shall find:/ Your marriage comes by destiny,/ Your cuckoo sings by kind.\\"  As the servant Padma listens to this modern Scheherezade, the relations of master and servant also dissolve from within, a dark allegory of the postcolonial nexus of modern writing.  Rushdie seems to be hinting that we're none of us where we're meant to be, and that at this late date there's not much we can do but lump it.<br /><br />After 25 years MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN continues to sell happy numbers of copies for its author, the controversial and limelight-dwelling Salman Rushdie.  He lives comfortably off the many editions his masterpiece has gone through.  Every now and then you hear an imaginative screenwriter announce that he's \\"conquered\\" MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN, but in truth the pleasure of the book is very much in its intratextual details, and I can't imagine a successful movie version, though I said the same about MYSTERIOUS SKIN and look how wrong I was there.ails, and I can't imagine a successful movie version, though I said the same about MYSTERIOUS SKIN and look how wrong I was there.	2005-08-30

The entire population of the little town has become a race of guinea pigs that New Wave Technologies can play with like a puppeteer a bunch of puppets.  What's worse, they don't even know what's happening to them.<br /><br />Men at the top are covering up a rash of mysterious deaths that have been occurring all over the village, but the FBI is on the case and has sent in their top agent, a man with secrets of his own, to uncover who or what is behind the murders.  They suspect a serial killer, but the truth is far worse.  This man, Sam Booker, blends in easily with the lackluster villagers, and yet when night falls he finds that he is the prey, and they become predators.  It's all part of a scheme to advance human consciousness and to upgrade humanity to a new level, but inevitably there are drawbacks to any utopian scheme.  In this case, a certain percent of the lab \\"rats\\" become monsters!<br /><br />Others drawn into helping Sam include the lovely Tess Lackland, whose poor sister died in Moonlight Cove, and little Chrissy, whose parents have changed beyond recognition as a result of New Wave's consciousness altering drugs.  An appealing VietNam vet has a handicap but that doesn't stop him for entering the ultimate battle between good and evil.  Of course it all begins at . . . midnight!  Dean Koontz has written many skillful bestsellers and this is one of his signature titles.<br /><br />Recommended, especially if you want to lose a good night's sleep!	2005-08-26

While this book is just as good as any of the others in Van Reid's clever series, it seems as though the bottom has fallen out of the series and that people just aren't clamoring for these books any more.  Some bookstores aren't even carrying this latest volume, and that's a shame.  Maybe it's time for a boxed set.  If Van Reid had any thought of continuing for a sixth volume, the lack of attention to FIDDLERS GREEN might be giving him second or third thoughts.  One the public has had enough of a series, there's a law of diminishing returns.  Even the best series (like Maxo De La Roche's JALNA or the Charlie Chan movies) peter off in the face of public indifference.<br /><br />It's s shame too, because this story is one of Reid's better ones.  Even if Chairman Toby and Sundry Moss were not in it at all, and indeed they contribute to the hilarity in big ways, such as Toby's long-awaited wedding, it would still be a page turner due to the mystery of Robin Oig, the sailor who dreams of finding an earthly paradise at Fiddlers Green.<br /><br />Robin should have a series of his own, for he is a thoughtful, dreamy romantic figure who would fit in nicely with the famous Aubrey and Maturin novels of the late Patrick O'Brian.  If you liked Cornelia Underwood or Mollie Peer (by Reid) or THE PICKWICK PAPERS or MARTIN CHUZZLEWIT (by Dickens), you might like FIDDLERS GREEN.	2005-08-26

In these days of reality TV, I often think back to this pioneering biography of Joyce Maxtone Graham, written by her grandddaughter with an eye nicely balanced between the too fond and the too cold.  Today we see real people going on TV seemingly eager to give up all their identity just so long as they stay in the camera's eye.  What Joyce did was something rarer, particularly for the 1930s and 1940s.<br /><br />She started out life with a little girl's talent for drawing and writing little stories and poems.  Marriage occupied her for awhile, and motherhood, but eventually nothing could hold her back, once she began writing the \\"Diary\\" of Mrs. Miniver, an imaginary Englishwoman whose life had roots in her own, but which was considerably idealized and romanticized.  It started out small and then got big--too big to handle.  Ysenda Maxtone-Graham, the biographer, gets considerable mileage out of the juxtaposition of Joyce's enormous personal ambition with the developing chaos in Europe which would lead to England's valiant defense against Hitler in the 1930s, and how the two combined to give England a new (and fictional) heroine, Mrs. Miniver, the character everyone thought was real!<br /><br />Hollywood called, Joyce went, she sold an outlandish number of war bonds, but actually she was deserting her native land in time of need, driven mostly by an unseemly passion for a fellow anti-Fascist refugee.  Love knows many avenues, of course, but reading the book you just can't help but think that her paramous was probably the worst thing ever to happen to her!  However she would look on it differently, and that, perhaps, is the difference between living one's own life, no matter even if it's a muddle, and reading about it in the safety of your own library.<br /><br />Ysenda Maxtone Graham tells this sad story with an easy flair and a sympathy for all concerned, especially those bamboozled by Joyce's prison of lies.  I hope she continues to unearth more about her illustrious ancestor or, if the well is dry, to move on to another lonely soul.er even if it's a muddle, and reading about it in the safety of your own library. <br /> <br />Ysenda Maxtone Graham tells this sad story with an easy flair and a sympathy for all concerned, especially those bamboozled by Joyce's prison of lies.

Its beautiful cover and evocative opening sentences sucked me right in like a whirlpool in one of the many Highland lakes of Scotland; some of which are extremely dangerous to traverse.  Corrigan has a nice way with the language, and he sets up a lot of literary allusions to other works of the past, which resonate within the simple triangle story of a woman who has to confront her past once more.<br /><br />This would make a wonderful movie, I think, and I hope some film studio snaps it up and hires oh, what's his name who made LOCAL HERO to film this novel.  For if you've seen LOCAL HERO, then the heights and weirs of THE POET OF LOCH NESS will ring a distant bell.  In Loch Ness, of course, the mystical sea monster is said to dwell, and its canny natives make a pretty penny from exploiting the curiosity of tourists and wild-life seekers, and yet if you were to ask one of them upfront if he or she was a believer, you would not hear the answer you expect.  Corrigan's novel shows us Perdita (the \\"lost child\\" from Shakespeare's WINTERS TALE) re-imagined as an emigree, one who has left her native home in Scotland to marry an American, Perry (notice the similarities of their names, suggesting that they are two halves, yin and yang, of the same singular identity).  Years later Perry has become a marine biologist and Perdita receives the startling proposition that he will next be investigating \\"Nessie.\\"  This brings her into dangerous proximity with the man whose heart she broke long ago--the man who, in a way, broke her own heart too.  Like Adam Dalgliesh, the detective hero of PD James, Andrew Magruder is a poet, and Perdita encounters him in a humble bed and breakfast, still looking pretty good.  Anyone who's seen I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING will know what directions the story will take, but it's a classic tale old as the Highland hills, and bonny as Loch Ness itself.<br /><br />Author Corrigan seems like a man who has himself fallen passionately in love--with his own creations.  As Paulina says in THE WINTER'S TALE:<br /><br />Come,<br /><br />I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,<br /><br />Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him<br /><br />Dear life redeems you.t it's a classic tale old as the Highland hills, and bonny as Loch Ness itself. <br /> <br />Author Corrigan seems like a man who has himself fallen passionately in love--with his own creations.

I feel that I know Maisie's rather hectic back story, though maybe I would find it more believable if I read about it at length.  The way it is now, it's not.  So she was a maid, then a nurse, and also an empath, and now she's a private detective.  Right, and I'm Tallulah Bankhead.  Nevertheless I wound up saluting the author for her considerable talent at writing and making you care about her characters, even when they're made of cardboard she brings them to life.  Maisie's aide-de-camp, Billy, is convincingly created and contributes a strong subplot to the main affair of Charlotte Waite's disappearance.<br /><br />I would definitely be interested in picking up the new novel PARDONABLE LIES just to find out what's next for our 32 year old supersleuth.  I also respect Winspear's attempts to adapt into mystery terms the historical novel as redefined by Pat Barker, who wrote about the World War I era in similar ways, with a similar social vision, a humanist, liberal vision tinged with the radicalism of Virginia Woolf.  I don't think that Maisie Dobbs is as yet any threat to the primacy of Harriet Vane, who remains a more sophisticated, emotionally charged and fundamentally interesting creation than Winspear's--despite what you'll hear here in the Amazon.<br /><br />The real problem with the story is that the solution depends on an actual historical event, or movement, involving ways to encourage recruiting; if you have never heard of this scheme before you might be puzzled by the mystery, but if you have knowledge of it already, you will know the solution to the mystery here within the first chapters.  Why, even the title gives away what the victims have in common.  The \\"movement\\" isn't obscure at all, it was the basis of the famous novel and film \\"The Four Feathers.\\"  Winspear might have added a few twists and managed to make the ending a surprise, but she didn't, perhaps feeling that WWI was so long ago and cultural amnesia so prevalent, that nobody would have heard of the feathers thing.feeling that WWI was so long ago and cultural amnesia so prevalent, that nobody would have heard of the feathers thing.	2005-08-24

In them I first read about Isabella Bird and her remarkable life in the American West.  Beany's older brother, Johnny Malone, is a teenager when the series begins, a young Denver boy with a remarkable passion for unearthing the memoirs and daguerrotypes of Colorado pioneers and taking notes on the old-timers who settled the state.  Their colorful lives make his ordinary life seem rather pastel, so he often sinks into a nostalgia of the past, while his family members tease him about the dreamy look in his eyes.  He helps a veteran journalist, Emerson Worth, complete his magnum opus, OUR CITY HAS DEEP ROOTS.  And among the pioneers Johnny obsessed about was none other than Isabella Bird, so when I found this book on a recent trip to Boulder, I added it to my rucksack.<br /><br />If you are reading on horseback, as Isabella Bird did, this is perhaps the ideal book to carry with you.  She was a woman used to the English-style horse with its Ascot breeding and high carriage.  What she found in Colorado were, naturally, the horses of the West, more perfectly adapted to the mile-high atmospheres, but slung somewhat lower than anything she's been used to and slightly swaybacked.  Bird adapted quickly, and the fun of her autobiography is to see her taking in her stride a series of calamities and hardships that would have Job complaining bitterly!  No matter if it's an insect infestation or tumbling right through a sheet of ice into zero degree river chills, for Isabella Bird it's all part of a day's fun.  Travel writing in the 19th century was, of course, the leading genre of prose.  From no other source were English-speaking readers able to find out more about other people's lives, and the curiosity was immense.<br /><br />You'll like Isabella, and her crazy love affair with Colorado.  She remains very much a lady, but will challenge your preconceived notions of what a lady is and isn't.  Most of all you will thrill to follow the course of her journeys up and down the mountains through which, now, there are some better trails but still the same amazing sunrises which she describes with the thrill of one for whom every day's an adventure.of all you will thrill to follow the course of her journeys up and down the mountains through which, now, there are some better trails but still the same amazing sunrises which she describes with the thrill of one for whom every day's an adventure.	2005-08-24

She must be a scholar of note, for her grasp of social and romantic customs is as deep as it is wide.  We loved the first book, and we wondered how Ms. Mallory would be able to top the ultra-romantic and intriguing set up that she established.  For in the first book her heroine, spunky Camille Minton, worked undercover as a cartoonist or caricaturist for Regency gossip columns while pretending to be a dowdy chaperone!  For one thing, few books set in the Regency acknowledge the fact that, unpleasant or not, many women had to work to make a living.  Plus, Camille's cunning cartoons were a clever way for author Mallory to describe most of her characters without that tedious job of over-description.  The suspense came from asking ourselves when would the Marquess she loved find out she was a \\"working girl\\"?<br /><br />Here the heroine works as a thief--a dashing thief like the Scarlet Pimpernel!  Audrey is romantic, decent, hard-working and ultimately does the right thing, but we wince for her virtue and we worry about whether or not she will land the one man who will make her happy--which will it be?<br /><br />Not by choice but because of a blackmailer who plans to expose her to the \\"ton\\" (fashionable crowd of Beau Brummell) and to hurt her sister's reputation if she does not comply with his insane demands.  It's like Topkapi or Rififi or any number of suspenseful crime caper movies, blended in with the Regency love affairs we love to follow in Avon romances.  DARING THE DUKE ups the emotional ante of the first novel by Mallory, engaging us with her sympathetic characters while making us understand why they sometimes flirt with the law.<br /><br />I wonder what title will come up next for Anne Mallory?  ROMANCING THE REGENT?  PURSUING THE PRINCE?  VIOLATING THE VISCOUNT?  Only time will tell!	2005-08-22

Lancaster showed us that a man could handle a million problems all at once, if he had the right combination of grit and gray cells.  It wasn't only the glamor, it was the idea of helping people get through their day--even when the people in question were six or seven miles up in the air--that made me consider airport management as a major at school.<br /><br />Other factors prevented me from achieving my goal, but I continue to pick up textbooks and manuals to keep abreast of the way airports have changed over the last 35 years.  From a technical point of view, one of the best resources for the lay manager is the Alexander Wells book AIRPORT PLANNING & MANAGEMENT (AP & MANAGEMENT) co-authored with Seth Young, both of them prominent in the field--and the airfield--today.  This book brings you thoroughly up to date on the way the skies (and the terminals) have changed since the day of infamy, 9/11.  Their information is laid out with dispatch, not a wasted word between them.  In addition, they know their stuff, that's for sure.  Over five hundred pages and I could detect only a few minor inaccuracies.<br /><br />If you were assigned to develop your own airport in some understaffed part of the world, this would be the volume you would bring with you.  If you were limited to bringing one textbook with you.  Of course, the old joke among airport planning students is, what CD would you bring?  Why, Briano Eno's MUSIC FOR AIRPORTS of course.	2005-08-22

But Eliot errs when he says that Radio City has 3,200 seats.  There are far more, perhaps as many as 6,000.  Anyone who has been in the cavrenous auditorium could tell you that.<br /><br />It is one of the few outright errors of fact that I found in reading Marc Eliot's outstanding new biography.  In matters of facts and figures he has penetrated into realms, such as the FBI files on Grant and his second wife, Barbara Hutton, ignored by previous biographers.  Over questions of tone stems where most of the controversy about this book.  Did Grant have an 11-year, open relationship with the actor Randolph Scott?  Apparently so, and yet couldn't Eliot dig up confirmation other than the smudgy posthumous accounts of Boze Hadleigh, who never met a celebrity who wasn't gay after he died?<br /><br />Most compelling of all is Eliot's idea of Cary Grant as some sort of mentally broken monster, a bruised sociopath who could only imitate the behavior of average human beings, never fully understanding human relations because at bottom, he was mad.  Eliot's book on Walt Disney, likewise, called Disney the \\"Dark Prince,\\" and Cary Grant comes off even darker.  I started reading the book wondering how a man could be gay and straight at the same time, and i think now I know, it wa that Cary Grant was just trying on different sexualities, unsure of what fit him, unsure of what looked good on him.  This is the way sociopaths behave.  Although on the other hand there is such a thing as a happily adjusted bisexual, and yet Cary Grant never seemed happy a day of his life, save perhaps when his beloved Jennifer was born.<br /><br />I thought also that Eliot attached too great an importance to Alfred Hitchcock's role in Grant's life.  Yes, the movies they made together are great.  But I don't think the general shape of Grant's career would have changed had he never met Hitchcock.  As far as directors go, Stanley Donen, who made his worst films with Cary Grant, was a casualty of Grant's vanity, and Leo McCarey comes off best.  Eliot says that Grant understood early on that to maintain a long-range popularity in Hollywood, he must not let himself be cast in pictures in which he did the running; he would only allow himself to be the one whom the female co-stars ran after.  That way the attention of each movie would always be on him, as the desired one.<br /><br />That said, CARY GRANT: A BIOGRAPHY is distinctly a cut above other books on the mysterious suave matinee idol, and its analysis is more sensible and down to earth than that found in Pauline Kael's famous essay \\"The Man From Dream City.\\"  Kael lost her heart to Cary Grant, and some of her notorious acerbity dribbled away when she began writing it all out.  Eliot's still wavering on the threshold, keeping his cool at a price.  I thoroughly recommend reading both texts.  The truth is somewhere in between.e never met Hitchcock.

First we get the story (which she has called, \\"Funny Accent\\"), then we get to hear the repercussions of what happens to her once the story, with its revelations of her own personal life and that of her Lithuanian-American family, gets around.<br /><br />Anna is drawn to older men, some of them much much older than herself, and she attributes this to having been molested as a teen by a family friend called Misha.  While he worked slowly and thoroughly, seducing her gently, he drew the line at having physical sex with her, and finally she threw herself at him and was rejected.  By then she was twenty and too old for the creep, whom she now saw at family gatherings dancing with a young girl of thirteen, the same age she had been when she had become his prey.  \\"He leaned toward the girl and his profile disappeared into her hair.  He was whispering and she, her hand cupped over her mouth, was giggling.\\"<br /><br />The story gets complicated by Anna's other entanglements.  She is living with a playwright called Gregory who's not only a Dentile, but a drunk.  She is carrying on sort of a Madame de Stael flirtation with an internationally celebrated novelist from Chicago who will make readers think instantly of a thinly disguised Saul Bellow, pretentious, four times married, a perfectionist in his writing and a wild man in his personal life.<br /><br />In addition, once Anna's parents get a copy of the ATLANTIC, they are shocked and dismayed to find out that it is through this vehicle that their daughter is making what amounts to a cry for help.  Were they so self absorbed that they failed to see their dear Misha was making advances to Anna when she was a mere 13?  Anna's mom, Sonia, in fact, has had a flirtation going on with Misha herself.

Jenkins is an affable guide to the different bridges, his roguish voice straightforward and poetical, like the narrator of THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY.  You will find no covered bridges here, though.  The Sierras are harsh country.<br /><br />I took a few trips with Jenkins in my back pocket, walked around the majestic giant sequoias, and saw with my own eyes the reseeding and the replanting of the great forest.  Jenkins has it all down, even to the black flies that will make your life miserable unless you do what he says.  If you're tired of swatting, use this book instead.  Try tubing and canoeing the Jenkins way, and you'll have the Sierras forever, with a whole new perspective, as pioneered by this man and his late mother, who seems to have been a remarkably good sport.<br /><br />You'll also want to see the abandoned land mines, some of which are open to the public.  Pioneers pulled tons of silver and gold out of \\"them there hills,\\" and the romance of the Gold Rush is never too far away.  At any moment, you feel, there could be another wildcat strike that will shake up this sleepy old world.  Find out history and economics all within the covers of this invaluable guide.	2005-08-18
105258:US	46134316	RF9K6PMKIG4Z7	1932009159	492680885	The Adventure of the Murdered Moths: And Other Radio Mysteries	Books	5	18	19	N	N	Challenge to the Reader	The two cousins who wrote as \\"Ellery Queen\\" were born in 1905, and for their centennial the estimable specialty house Crippen & Landru have come out with a book of some radio plays they wrote in the late 30s and early 40s, the peak years for the great detective.  Crippen & Landru issued an outline for a final, unfinished novel (A TRAGEDY OF ERRORS) which is marvelous to have, but this volume is a quantum leap more satisfying and a fantastic addition to the Queen corpus.<br /><br />THE ADVENTURE OF THE LAST MAN CLUB.  A play involving a tontine underwritten by an industrial capitalist tycoon and whose members are mostly Navy veterans who served with the dead son of the tycoon.  One of the members is hit by a car while crossing the street, and Ellery's hot on the case.<br /><br />THE ADVENTURE OF NAPOLEON'S RAZOR will appeal to everyone who loves trains, especially guys with model railroading replicas in their basements.  Ellery and Nikki try to trap a cunning killer on a train completely sealed off from the outside world.<br /><br />THE ADVENTURE OF THE BAD BOY.  Did a little boy really poison his aunt's stew with arsenic?  Ellery and Nikki have to face down the possibility that even a young 10 year old may do evil in the name of love.  This one is extremely far-fetched, but persuasive.<br /><br />THE ADVENTURE OF THE MARCH OF DEATH.  When old man March gets bumped off he tries to leave a clue by carving it into his desk with the very knife that stabbed him!  Then the killer erases the dying message.  You won't feel a thing for any of these people, they're all despicable, but just try to figure out the solution!<br /><br />THE ADVENTURE OF THE HAUNTED CAVE.  Set high in the Adirondacks, HAUNTED CAVE has a spooky story to tell.  A ghost hunter is slain inside the wooden door of a cave.  The only footprints leading to his body are his own.  It seems almost sure that Montague is the victim of a hundred-year old ghost.  Almost a Henry Merrivale sort of crime for Ellery.<br /><br />THE ADVENTURE OF THE LOST CHILD.  This case will remind readers of several other well-covered but much more recent true crime stories (Susan Smith, Andrea Yates, etc).  The depravity of the murders in this radio play goes considerably beyond anything Queen was writing in his novels at the time.  I would have thought the ad agencies would have hesitated before sponsoring this one, it's awfully trenchant.<br /><br />THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLACK SECRET.  Some mystery lovers get all lovey dovey around mysteries set in bookstores with rare book dealers as victims or suspects.  This is one of those cases.  It isn't my favorite, but I like having Mike Callahan-a rival sleuth-feature in Ellery's cases, and the set-up when Ellery gets arrested on suspicion of shoplifting had me laughing my ass off.<br /><br />THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING SCARECROW.  I wonder which came first, this macabre play of the countryside's changing seasons and the chainsaw-crazy family who lives on the farm, or maybe Joel Townsley Rogers' novel THE RED RIGHT HAND?  Read this one and tell me you don't flash on the Townsley Rogers book.<br /><br />THE ADVENTURE OF THE WOMAN IN BLACK.  A British novelist with a family ghost has grown up believing that if the ghostly woman in black appears to him three times, then he will die.  Ellery tries to intervene, but the facts of the case baffle him.  Oscar Wilde plays a surprising part in this tale, and the story has atmosphere to burn.  This must be the last of the hourlong radio plays, because the remainder of the bunch are much shorter.<br /><br />THE ADVENTURE OF THE FORGOTTEN MEN.  This play takes up the theme of the homeless, but the characterization is pretty dismal.  I couldn't tell the difference between the five main characters, Manhattan, Dixie, Yank, Kansas and California.  They're all derelicts living in an abandoned lot in New York City.<br /><br />THE ADVENTURE OF THE MAN WHO COULD DOUBLE THE SIZE OF DIAMONDS.  Funny how many Ellery Queen plots depend on strip searching a guy (here, a phony inventor called Doctor Lazarus) and examining every body cavity no matter how indelicate.  Something a little kinky there, but that's fine by me.<br /><br />THE ADVENTURE OF THE DARK CLOUD.  The \\"Dark Cloud\\" is a yacht on which members of the Valentine family are hosting a swim party and a rousing round of charades.  Murder ensues and once again, literary texts function as the database of clues.  The dying message here wouldn't have stumped a dolphin.<br /><br />THE ADVENTURE OF MR. SHORT AND MR, LONG.  This is Ellery Queen's version of the famous Sherlock Holmes reference to \\"Mr. James Phillimore who stepped into his house for an umbrella and was never more seen in this world.\\"  Wonder if John Dickson Carr knew this play when he did his own version (with Adrian Conan Doyle) in their book of EXPLOITS?  For the two stories share some key points.<br /><br />THE ADVENTURE OF THE MURDERED MOTHS.  Ellery and the gang invade what seems to be some sort of Marjorie Main EGG AND I motel for hillbillies, and meet up with an eloping couple of youngsters.  Nikki offers to stand in as bridesmaid for the girl, but then it is discovered that she, Virginia Wender, is underage.  Virginia's father gets killed, but not for the reason you'd think!  The moths tell the tale . . .<br /><br />I hated to see this book come to an end.  Please, publishers, issue a sequel!  If there are 350 of these plays extant, you could do a book every year for the next ten or twenty years!  Don't leave us on such a teasing note!  These plays bring us the best of Ellery Queen-his wit, his inventiveness, his love of humanity, his spectral note, his innate American spirit, and most of all, the brain teasers that made his name famous for decades.  And Nikki Porter too, far less annoying here than in some of the books.  Now I realize I should have paid more for the hardcover edition, in which you get an extra play for your money!ow many Ellery Queen plots depend on strip searching a guy (here, a phony inventor called Doctor Lazarus) and examining every body cavity no matter how indelicate.

Peter Lawrence isn't a bad writer at all, and his colleagues who do different articles with him and help making up the questions and answers (many of them multiple choice, including some surprising zingers to see if you're awake) are also fairly competent at writing and know how to make a dry subject alive.<br /><br />HRecently, when I was in the hospital and my doctors were trying to figure out what kind of procedure I should be having (to correct a leaky heart), a friend brought me this book to read while I tried to make the leaden hours go by quicker.  Its attractive cover and easy-to-follow medical style convinced him that the more I knew about what might be happening to me, the better my mind would be able to cushion the shocks.  You know what?  My fingers quickly found themselves wrapped around the book's four corners and the hands of the clock fairly sped by as I acquainted myself with all sorts of interesting operations, from vacsular to gastric and even into plastic surgery, which by the way isn't as simple and brainless as you would think!  I'm impressed by how difficult this vanity procedure is.  However, surgery isn't child's play and the newbie to medical terms will probably get bogged down just trying to figure out what part of the body Dr. L is talking about from page to page. It will be a long time before I feel confident enough to pursue the next volume in this series, ESSENTIALS OF SURGICAL SPECIALTIES.<br /><br />It all turned out well, and with this book on my shelf when visitors come by they sometimes ask if at one time when I was young I trained as a surgeon, only to wash out.  The book's cover painting is of course by Thomas Eakins, it is his famous painting of THE GROSS CLINIC, painted at a time when surgery was undergoing rapid transformation, at a time right on the cusp of change.  Of course you can see that none of the surgeons working on the poor patient are wearing scrubs nor any kind of hygienic clothes.  They are all in street clothes and as you can tell, germs were still a vague concept to the Philadelphia surgeons of the day!<br /><br />In your library, this volume should be an essential!  Even if you have no interest in medicine, either personal or professional.nor any kind of hygienic clothes.

He has rescued Tallulah Bankhead from her fans.<br /><br />I can't understand the horrid reviews this book has gotten from others on the site.  I found his work utterly compelling and a vast improvement on every other book I've seen (all of which I've enjoyed by the way).  It's just that Lobenthal has done something no other biographer has attempted-he has gone back and attempted to recreate the actual performances that she gave, by various means, including locating fellow castmates, some of them of extreme age but all of them with amazing, never before heard memories and anecdotes.  They build up a picture of Bankhead as being the exact opposite of the coke-addled personality-driven dilettante we have been used to for a long, long time.<br /><br />And Lobenthal's research has deep roots!  He worked on this project for close to 30 years, and it shows.  He seems to know everything about Bankhead, but about American and British theater throughout the 20th century.  Plus, he has persuaded his witnesses to spill all the beans and you'll find things out in this book which you never imagined about all of your favorite actors, writers and directors.<br /><br />What a roller coaster ride Bankhead had for a career.  Things looked pretty bleak for her by the mid 1930s and then in rapid succession she landed a series of parts which put her once again in the thick of the theatrical action and even returned her to movies.  As Regina Giddens in Lillian Hellman's THE LITTLE FOXES, she brought her Southern gentility into play, and got out the claws.  As Lily Sabina in Thornton Wilder's THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH, she brought European expressionism onto the Broadway stage during World War II.  Philip Barry's FOOLISH NOTION, though not a commercial success, was an amazing dream play in which Bankhead's character imagined herself acting out alternative scenarios a la Pirandello.  She made a personal success out of Noel Coward's PRIVATE LIVES, eclipsing the memories of Gertrude Lawrence and replacing them with a raw wit that attracted many gay fans.<br /><br />These fans, who stuck with her thick and thin, responded to something about her-both her emotional fragility and her perdurability.  When she came to play Blanche in STREETCAR for Jean Dalrymple, in the 1950s, this claque dismayed her by hooting and carrying on as though they were watching Dame Edna.  Bankhead's attempts at shading Blanche with vulnerability founding purchase in the wall of knowing laughter that greeted her every speech.<br /><br />Soon we will have the first DVD of LIFEBOAT, a propitious moment for those of us who, intrigued by Lobenthal's account of her acting, want to see it first hand.  (We also have the late products FANATIC-a/k/a DIE!  DIE!  MY DARLING! and the animated THE DAYDREAMER, for which Bankhead provided a character voice.)  Let's get those early Paramount films available, and A ROYAL SCANDAL, and number one on my want list MAIN STREET TO BROADWAY, in which she apparently plays herself, advising a young playwright on breaking into the writing biz.<br /><br />He is a master biographer, the theatrical equivalent of a Robert Caro or a Leon Edel.

At one bookstore in the Bay Area I spotted lyricist Robert Hunter and I gathered together all my courage to approach him and to tell him how much his lyrics had meant to me and my kind.  Somewhat to my surprise he asked me to name one of his songs that I loved.  \\"Ship of Fools,\\" I said.  In the years since I have sometimes wondered why I didn't ask about \\"Row Jimmy\\" since that is even more puzzling.  But anyway Hunter couldn't have been more receptive and even charming.  I asked him where he found the inspiration to write \\"Ship of Fools\\" and he mentioned the Renaissance or medieval tradition of the ship of fools journeying out into the main without a solid plan and how it's a metaphor for the religious voyage of life.  He mentioned other works based on this legend including Lewis Carroll's \\"The Hunting of the Snark\\" and finally, Katherine Anne Porter's novel SHIP OF FOOLS, which he said he had read in the 1960s, close to when it came out originally.<br /><br />SHIP OF FOOLS tells the story of a group of German nationals on a boat from Bremen to the USA, and it is apparently based on a real life voyage.  Jews by the boatload were attempting to escape from an atrocious abd repressive regime, and what they did not realize is that the shipboard lifestyle was a microcosm for the pains of the rest of the world.  We meet dozens of characters, some more skillfully developed than others, including a young American couple through whose eyes we get to see the whole tragedy unfolding.<br /><br />There is a tragic romance between a middle-aged countess and the ship's doctor, and a sense of foreboding about the whole voyage.  The champagne and the crepe paper and the sparklers are out over the dark Atlantic, but we sense the lights going out all over the world.<br /><br />Porter worked over thirty years writing this, her only novel, and when it came out it was a commercial success and a Book of the Month Club selection, though in general the critics were disappointed that it did not hit the heights of the short stories that had made her name starting in the 1920s.  Some have criticized this book as too slow and too portentous.  To me it hits the right note over and over again.  There is a movie version of this novel, directed by earnest, plodding Stanley Kramer, but I think if I saw it, it could not begin to compare to my experience of either the novel nor the song.  \\"Now I cannot share thy laughter, ship of fools.\\"e world. <br /> <br />Porter worked over thirty years writing this, her only novel, and when it came out it was a commercial success and a Book of the Month Club selection, though in general the critics were disappointed that it did not hit the heights of the short stories that had made her name starting in the 1920s.

Remember the neo-realist movie with Anna Magnani claiming she had conceived immaculately and had never had sex?  Melissa Moody has a new twist on that.  She admits she had sex, once only, on her prom night, the way seniors are supposed to, and that's why she's pregnant.  The difficulty is that her boyfriend is dead and this all happened five years ago.<br /><br />She announces this to Charlene Chase, and to Charlene's surviving son Philip.  Both of them are flabbergasted.  How could this be true?<br /><br />Underlying their disbelief is their suspicion and resentment of each other.  Ever since Ronnie's tragic prom limo death, the Chase family has come asunder, the way that a violent death will sometimes fracture a whole family like a hammer blow to a glass figurine.  Philip has overheard his mother complaining that \\"the wrong son died,\\" and indeed Charlene resents Philip and his dreamy, poetical ways, and she hates herself for it, but she has to admit late at night, that she loved Ronnie more.<br /><br />Melissa, whom they had almost forgotten about, has demons of her own!  Here's one thriller that doesn't depend on high tech gimmickry, but on the sorrows of the human heart.<br /><br />Boy, was this a good book.  I recommend it to those of you who like John Sayles' movies for their quirkiness and their attention to detail and the lives of ordinary people in tightly knit regional communities.  Searles piles nuance upon nuance like a great builder, turning the screws in a edifice of suspense.  You won't be able to stop reading, and the journey there is just as terrific as the shock ending.	2005-08-15

I get enough of that in real life.  I go to books written by people whose intelligence shines through in every word.<br /><br />I started with the last novella, HAGIOGRAPHIES, sort of a creative anagram of HANGINGS, and found it to be a beautiful story of loss, lust and forbidden sexuality, which takes our modern day MTV world and shakes it up, like one of those little snow domes, and when the flakes settle we feel transported into the opalescent world of Anais Nin, where \\"sex magic\\" rules the lives and loves of a trio of impassioned adolescents, the \\"girl with the pixie haircut,\\" \\"the girl with the black eyes,\\" and a mysterious boy, dead at sixteen, who reaches out to them both.  Once immersed in Shope's language I found myself watching as these identities shift with the implacable narrative force of a native-grown Abbas Kiarostami, so that the humanity of these young people began to shine through their dilemmas like when you put a candle in a Jack O Lantern.<br /><br />I then read through HANGINGS itself.  This is the story of mortality encroaching on a young woman who has to sit there and watch her mother dying from cancer.  The two women, mother and daughter, share as through osmosis, some of the same physical habits.  \\"When they speak it is through silences metered out like music.  Mammogram.  Mother.  Mastectomy.\\"  She (the daughter) becomes obsessed with a certain painting by Joan Miro (the one pictured on the cover), of a man dangling from the ceiling by his feet, a large red moon hanging on the corner like a bullethole red with blood.  And she meets a cute guy who is always writing in a notebook, called Daniel.  His physicality arouses her, \\"the red hair on his knuckles, the thin moons of his nails wrapped round his notebook.\\"  She dreams about someday finding his book and reading all he has written.<br /><br />IN URBEM, the third novella, loses me a bit because this one is more futuristic and anti-human and, as you have probably gathered, I feel Shope's greatest strength to be her poetic connection with ordinary human beings.  However, those who admire Pascal Quignard's fictions about imperial Rome, or Alex Irvine's amazing science fiction remixes of 20th century life, will enjoy this interesting visit to a place unknown.  Perhaps she, the author, decided to intersperse her more personal style with a piece with a different tone.  Or maybe she feels that this middle novella is putting her best foot forward stylistically.  Don't get me wrong, I like it indeed, there's a lot to admire about IN URBEM, it's just not all about character.<br /><br />Inventive Starcherone Press has published another winner.  I realize books of novellas aren't necessarily surefire commercial hits, so I congratulate Starcherone for having the guts to go for the long run.  Nine Shope is in this game for good.  My congratulations to all concerned.hair on his knuckles, the thin moons of his nails wrapped round his notebook.\\"  She dreams about someday finding his book and reading all he has written. <br /> <br />IN URBEM, the third novella, loses me a bit because this one is more futuristic and anti-human and, as you have probably gathered, I feel Shope's greatest strength to be her poetic connection with ordinary human beings.

115366:US	46134316	R3730TDMVYD387	2253109347	836161234	Gigi (Le Livre De Poche) (French Edition)	Books	5	14	14	N	N	First Love	Gigi was the first novel I read in French, and at the time that I read it, probably it was the raciest book I ever read, I was a mere lad of I don't know, eleven or so.  I couldn't figure out exactly who was who.  I tried reading GONE WITH THE WIND in French but that was too long.  Gigi was perfect.  She was, after all, a young girl, though from a different world than mine.  She had several aunts who wanted to train her into the high level world of the Courtesan.  A good parallel would be the recent novel MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA by Arthur Golden.<br /><br />What distinguishes Colette from Golden is that the French writer built a legend around herself in terms of the beauty and poetry of her language.  Not only did she possess a stern and acute mind from which no nuance of regret or longing escaped her gaze, but she wielded a pen like an angel.  She was incapable of writing a phony sentence, and like the American modernist poet William Carlos Williams she found beauty in the ordinary and the commonplace.  A swatch of wildflowers growing in the graveyard where Gigi's mother lies becomes the palette of an artist with the dappled colors suggesting possibility.  Gigi's hopes, dreams and fantasies lie mingled, like sooty water, with the harsh realities of her existence.  Basically she must find a rich man to cling to, or lose all her status.<br /><br />For a young boy reading her story, and trying to puzzle through the evocative French, I found myself stumbling at times, but at the end I became convinced that I knew this girl, and I took pleasure in her small triumphs and her enemies became mine.<br /><br />Today many of Colette's works have been translated but she is still very much caviare to the general.  Another couple of books I can recommend to you are CHERI and its sequel, THE LAST OF CHERI.  (Cheri's a guy despite his name which to me seemed feminine before I got the drift of things.)	2005-08-12

I know Veronique Vial's work from many years of reading her glossy coffee table books about the Cirque du Soleil and her Hollywood friends, so I knew I was in good hands.<br /><br />They say a picture is worth a thousand words.  No matter if she takes you to the St. Germain des Pres or to the Eiffel Tower, Vial has a way of making everything look new for the very first time, even the age-old cobblestones of Paris.  She invents a surrogate for us to identify with, whom she calls, \\"The Cordial Traveller.\\"  Believe me, he is no Gene Kelly.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the model, the Cordial Traveller, doesn't have very much personality.  He observes things with a stoic look, as though his mind was somewhere else.  Many actors have that quality of repose, as they are always processing experience to use on the stage or on screen, but this guy goes too far.  He sees many interesting things but seems only interested in making sure the camera catches him displaying his better profile.<br /><br />Outside of that, this book is a worthy successor to Diane Johnson's novels about American emigres to Paris, or even a book like James Baldwin's GIOVANNI'S ROOM.  People who love Veronique Vial, of course, will hardly be disappointed. In a way, this book is a more private peek into what makes a fine photographer tick, like a map of her mind.  We loved her photos of the stars of Beverly Hills cavorting in their swimming pools, but these feel closer to home, more personal.	2005-08-11

Sometimes Schutt seems like a writer who begrudges evidence, who hands out each clue parsimoniously like a homeowner who doesn't believe much in Halloween and short shifts the Trick or Treater.<br /><br />But I believe, after reading some of her wonderful stories, that she is not ungenerous, just crafty.  She knows, like Browning's Andrea Del Sarto, that often \\"less is more.\\"  That sometimes the best way to hook a reader's attention is to tease and provoke.  And also that this minimal approach is actually a form of mimesis, that it mirrors the frustrating way we learn and apprehend things in real life, and so if it seems fanciful, it is actually a kind of social realism for our sad age.<br /><br />It seems that \\"approach\\" in the last sentence is a misnomer, and I should have used whatever word is the opposite of \\"approach.\\"  In \\"Do You Think I Am Who I Will Be?\\" for example, I still haven't figured out why our sad sack narrator can't get any water in his apartment.  Even at the end, when finally he gets enough water to fill up the rest of his glass of Scotch, I never managed to find out what had happened.  Was he living in a dry state?  Was he being punished in some future world in which water is rationed the way sugar used to be during World War II?<br /><br />I find Schutt very moving, like Virginia Woolf, in her treatment of the women in her stories.  I will never forget the young mother in \\"Darkest of All\\" who can't keep her hands off her kids, or the young wife in, well, \\"Young,\\" who realizes she has made a mistake early on in her marriage, and finds a novel way to work out her misgivings.<br /><br />I don't think she's so great at men.  They seem (I mean, \\"we\\" seem) like a species mysterious to her, like the elephant in the old fable of the blind men and the elephant.  But I'm sure that it's hardly noticeable because the mood of her stories is always both luscious and spare, and because we feel confident in her trajectory as a whole.  She is one author I would love to meet one day, so I could thank her for opening up a new world for me, a world of intrigue, made of ordinary things, like Ann Hamilton's vast sculptures created of discarded index cards from card catalogues.ies mysterious to her, like the elephant in the old fable of the blind men and the elephant.

First of all, the material is from an olf time New York daily newspaper, the SUN, a paper long vanished into the annals of journalism.  Thank goodness someone kept some old copies of this scandal-making series of articles by SUN reporter Malcolm Johnson, many of which took up the first page of the old SUN, and filled the paper with an expose on union activities along the piers and docks of old New York.  Johnson's son, nonfiction specialist Haynes Johnson, contributes context for his father's Pulitzer-Prize winning scoop.<br /><br />Budd Schulberg, who read these articles and worked with Elia Kazan on the screenplay of the film, pays tribute to Malcolm Johnson like one craftsman to another.  But he's no dummy, Schulberg.  The first thing you realize when reading these articles is what a great job Schulberg did bringing life to what is essentially a pretty dry tale of graft, without any real heroes or plot.  In presenting this old journalism, Schulberg insures that we appreciate his artistry.  There aren't any Terry Malloys in the pages of the SUN, and there are definitely no Eva Marie Saints looking on wistfully.<br /><br />What you'll take away from what was once the expose of the decade is now merely a case of mutatis mutandis.  I'm sure things along the docks have not changed an iota.  Prices have, though!  Johnson presented as a shocker the annual salary of the corrupt union head--$20,000!  That wouldn't get you very far in today's New York.  You might be able to buy a life buoy but I doubt it.  And yet to his readers, that salary must have repesented the equivalent of a million bucks today, and been instantly a suspicious red flag as though to scream out in 24 pt type, RYAN'S A CROOK.<br /><br />And what a prescient picture of the Mafia!  It was an organization only dimly visible through the underground fog, yet one that extended its tentacles into every arena of modern urban life.  Johnson must have been one of the first reporters to dig into it with any depth or understanding.  It's a surprise he lived!  I would have thought after three or four days of this serial, the boys would have put his shoes into concrete and sunk him under the pier.  Instead he lived for another 30 years, with the Pulitzer on his mantel and a grin across his face.rban life.

Only Williams could have gotten away with naming his hero \\"Brick,\\" as names were always his strong suit.  He found comfort in names, and a wild exotic beauty, and even in his last faltering years was usually able to pull a final name out of his hat, something perfect.  I remember seeing CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF on stage, with Elizabeth Ashley, some time before I read the play, so naturally my experience of the text is colored by Ashley's sizzling interpretation of Maggie the Cat, all hisses and feral screams.  She was so strong I can barely remember who played Brick or Big Daddy in that production.  I think it was Keir Dullea from DAVID AND LISA.  Maybe Big Daddy was the man from the MUNSTERS TV show.  What we, the audience, cared about was if Maggie was going to get her wway and triumph over all the mendacity and the \\"no neck monsters\\" that were swarming the plantation.<br /><br />Maggie gets angry, but mostly we value her for her tenderness.  Even when she knows her husband has lost his heart over a long-gone teammate, and that he's probably gay, she never gives up the ship.  She knows that without her in his corner 100 per cent, he'll give up, drown in his own sorrows.  He needs her to kick his ass and bring him back to the land of the awake.  She wasn't going to be an enabler, she would always discourage him from drinking from the time he got up in the morning till he passed out at night, his crutches tangled up in his boxer shorts.  For Brick, drinking is a way out of his tortured memories of Skipper, the boy he loved in high school and college.  Taking a drink is \\"like a switch, clickin' off in my head. Turns the hot light off and the cool one on and all of a sudden, there's peace.\\"  Secretly the family has a plan to ship his butt off to Rainbow Hill, sort of a Betty Ford Clinic without the mercy.<br /><br />We love Maggie trying to semaphor the truth into his thick skull by screaming, \\"Skipper is dead but I'm alive!  Maggie the Cat is alive!\\"	2005-08-10

It's easy to love sweet little Amos, the Mouse in Colonial American who befriended Ben Franklin and through him delivered the world its greatest inventions, including electricity.<br /><br />Walt Disney thought so too and he made \\"Ben and Me\\" right after Disneyland opened up.  So soon it will be the 50th anniversary of the cartoon.  I don't think the cartoon is a feature length film, but I know it's longer than the average Looney Tunes--probably around half an hour.  Charlie Ruggles played the dim-witted likable Ben, fussing with his glasses and kindly making Amos little treats.  As for Amos, his voice was that of Aterling Holloway whose voice was used in so many Disney movies he was practically an employee at the Mouse Factory.<br /><br />For Disney, the challenge of animating another mouse (besides Mickey, who had made Walt famous) was immense.  It is said that Disney really dug Lawson's story of a mouse who uses his power to make a human famous, for it was his own story in a way.<br /><br />The book is great for kids and if you like this one, check out MR REVERE AND I, sort of the same story except told by a horse--the horse Paul Revere used on his famous ride that starts out, \\"Hardly a man is still alive!\\"  Well, as you can imagine from BEN AND ME, that horse has a very different story to tell that Longfellow did!  Heartwarming and historic.	2005-08-10

Too bad Emmy was a conventional type who didn't understand her husband's drive for perfection, and too bad that Stieglitz wasn't the world's greatest father to his only child, poor Kitty.  It seems clear that for Stieglitz, he would not be happy with a conventional marriage and he became increasingly dependent on adulterous relations, including an affair with the wife of his protege Paul Strand.  Hoffman promises to reveal more about Stieglitz in a second volume, including his marriage to painter Georgia O'Keeffe, but for now the book ends with the dissolution in 1917 of his famous gallery \\"291.\\"<br /><br />As in her books on Georgia O'Keeffe, Hoffman's specialty is tracing the influence on the artist of various other plastic arts and music.  But this approach isn't especially illuminating.  With Stieglitz, the comparisons to Wagner fall short of being able to tell us anything about the work itself (where they do not indeed distort it nearly beyond recognition).  Hoffman is safer in analyzing individual photos by Stieglitz, but this analysis too often scratches only the surface, or even just the surface of the surface.  Take this comment on Stieglitz's many photos of the toddler Kitty:<br /><br />\\"The subtly colored images frequently show Kitty with her long wavy hair, often tied with a large ribbon, well dressed and holding flowers, leaves, or a plant.  Stieglitz's association of his daughter with blooming plant forms suggests the traditional analogy between the female and the life cycles of nature.\\"  And that's it.  You keep waiting for something more, but only the obvious ever seems to satisfy Dr. Hoffman.  Well, that's not entirely fair, because she's a careful writer who has done a great deal of research, and some of her conclusions, if arguable, are plainly stated.  Best of all is her ability to make connections, such as the kinship between Stieglitz and one of his gallery's artists, the Tarot goddess Pamela Colman Smith.  Had Hoffman not pointed up the similarities between their work I would never have thought it.great deal of research, and some of her conclusions, if arguable, are plainly stated.

Hayes	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Taking A Flyer	I picked up this book and remembered that I had taken a look at an earlier collection by this author, only to put it down because of its ludicrous beefcake cover.  This cover is more subdued--I wonder if the book will sell fewer copies being less garish?  If so that is sad indeed.  Anyhow I have heard some of my friends say good things about JG Hayes, so I took a chance and I'm glad I did.  In the introduction to his book says that the first book elicited admiring comments from Jamie O'Neill, author of the wonderful AT SWIM TWO BOYS.  Hayes isn't as ambitious, perhaps, as O'Neill, and a book of stories delivers less of an impact than a novel (generally speaking, and specifically thinking of the different betwen NOW BATTING FOR BOSTON and AT SWIM TWO BOYS), but they're working the same ballpark, and at least one of the stories in this book reaches quite delirious heights of feeling and execution.  I got sucked into it, and I don't think I'll ever be the same, that is the story called LUGHEAD.<br /><br />Some of the other pieces I thought were slight, or derived from cliches of \\"gay writing.\\"  LUGHEAD, like something by James Purdy, seems like it's written from a place where writing will be in fifty years from now.  It's a recognizable Boston cityscape, but there are prophetic touches, like the angels walking among us in Wenders' film WINGS OF DESIRE.  By the end I was just flabbergasted.  People have been looking for years for the hoped-for \\"gay Bruce Springsteen,\\" and this is him, but something more, something extra.  For this one tale alone I give the book five stars.  I wonder what he is like, J G Hayes, and if I would like him as a man.<br /><br />But again his publishers are letting him down.  Has Southern Tier ever put out a good looking book?  Do they all have to be so cheap and tasteless?  This one has no naked men on the cover, but what is with that subtitle, \\"NOW BATTING FOR BOSTON: MORE STORIES BY J G HAYES.\\"  Even Chekhov wouldn't have a book that said, \\"MORE STORIES BY CHEKHOV.\\"  It makes Hayes sounds like the vainest man on Planet Earth, and I'm sure he's no such thing.<br /><br />But that's just a peccadillo.  He could have published \\"Lughead\\" in smoke signals and it would still stand head and shoulders above most modern American stories.d, \\"MORE STORIES BY CHEKHOV.\\"  It makes Hayes sounds like the vainest man on Planet Earth, and I'm sure he's no such thing. <br /> <br />But that's just a peccadillo.

Previous editions of the dictionary have kept pace with the recognition, since the early 1970s, of women's importance to American culture.  But it has been awhile since the last update, and now here we are with what amounts to obituaries for hundreds of prominent women who died, say, between 1976 and 1999.<br /><br />They hail from many fields, including art, writing, science, acting, business, sport, psychology, the military, theory, aviation, religion, and humanitarianism.  Some worked with animals, like Dian Fossey.  And some come from no field at all.  Look at Jackie O, who is listed rather lamely as \\"First Lady, editor, reporter.\\"  (There's a whole category called \\"Socialite,\\" which includes such long running venerables as Pamela Harriman and Alice Longworth.)  And there are other unlikely articles such as the one on Valerie Solanas.  That is part of what makes the book such a rich stew.  There's something to read for just about everyone and I recommend reading a different letter every day, soon you will have caught yourself up with everyone.<br /><br />You'll find yourself reading about women you never heard of, as well as those you always wished you knew more about.  One weakness of the system is that practically everyone gets written about to the same extent, so that Martha Graham receives the same word count as (say) someone who lived for a much shorter time--for example, Gilda Radner.  This leads to a certain imbalance I think, but it's interesting nevertheless.<br /><br />In some cases editors Wake and Braukman have brought out the really big guns, hiring the biographers to digest their books into the length of a long column.  For example, Margot Peters writes about Lynn Fontanne; He;en Sheehy on Eva Le Gallienne.  It is spooky how many of these women died at age 79!  Surely this must be a dangerous age for the notable.<br /><br />I wonder also that some experts were able to write across genre; thus the same scholar completes a fine job on Ella Fitzgerald and another on the novelist Ann Petry.  You'd think you would need different muscles to do a good job on, but apparently not!  Pat Kirkham writes on Clare Potter, Vera Maxwell, AND Ray Eames!  I guess if you had enough time and chutzpah you could work up a listing for just about anybody, but in this case Pat Kirkham was hit each one out of the park--it's a trifecta!  For a reference book to  be a pleasure to read, that's a rarity.  Latch on to this volume, keep it by your bedside or rocker.

I would tell people, for example, that lambs and sheep are totally different species, and in citing Lorenz I now realize he said nothing of the sort.  One of the great things about KING SOLOMON'S RING is how many species it treats.  We also had to read an earlier book by Lorenz, in which he discussed only dogs and how to train them.  Did you know that Konrad Lorenz was the first scientist to discover that in every pacxk of dogs (even in any pair of two dogs) one dog will be the so-called \\"alpha male,\\" even when they are technically female?  Lorenz was a scientist, a trained observer, but he also had a big heart and this spills out into his books. <br /> <br />They are each of them veritable fountains of good writing and common sense, though sometimes he goes overboard in his enthusiasm. <br /> <br />Some of the animals hje observed in his heyday are acting differently nowadays!  I wonder if that is part of natural selection, or if they are being changed due to the ozone layer brteaking up and global warming.  Even the patterns of birds' migrations are no longer the same, and they seem to be no longer travelling the immense distances we once thought they did (from Tierra del Fuego to the Maritimes, for example). <br /> <br />In other ways, although dated, KSR remains one of Konrad Lorenz's great accomplishments. I remember meeting him around the time the United Nations honored him for his work with animals.

Ray's not a criminal, but he's definitely on the run, for a death in his immediate family still haunts him and has driven a wedge between himself and the woman he married twenty years before, Nancy, a former stripper, now an accountant for the famous Sally Rand dance company in San Francisco.  When Ray comes to the Bay Area to take up a gig of some standing at the tony Claremont Hotel, it's 1940 and the San Francisco World's Fair is holding sway at a newly constructed island halfway in the Bay between SF and Oakland.  It's an artifical paradise replete with manicured gardens and Babylonian temples--and girlie shows.  There's a veneer of culture, and a young student at UC Berkeley has won the \\"Pan Pacific Award\\" for her original musical composition \\"Swing Around The Sun,\\" which promotes peace between nations in a dangerous time of gathering clouds of war.<br /><br />This young student, Gail Prentice, becomes Ray's love interest.

It's a professional job, don't get me wrong, but you can almost see Dahl working overtime to make his stories more exciting and gripping than they probably really were.  The book begins with young Roald travelling to Tanzania on a boat under orders from Shell Oil, where he hopes to begin a career.  Almost instantly the war breaks out and Dahl is ordered to round up the war's first prisoners.  Then he's sent to flying school and taught to master a plane in a few months.  Were planes simpler to learn back then?  Well, for one thing, the RAF was educating its young men at assembly line pace, and the objective was to get up and come down; nothing fancier needed.<br /><br />It's sort of comical, especially because Roald felt himself to be abnormally tall (six and a half feet, a good foot taller than several of his instructors) so he really had to wedge his butt into the tiny Piper seat and fold his long legs like a heron to be able to play the pedals properly.  The book peters out after a terrible crash results in awful head injuries, wounds that impacted his whole life way down the pike and narrowed his Swiftian vision into the refined cruelty that sparked his great masterpieces for children.<br /><br />No, I would not say this book is for kids, but on the other hand children love reading about flying, and they enjoy identifying with the \\"fish out of water.\\"  Children feel a bond to outsiders of all descriptions, because everyone feels picked on.  For Dahl it was a feeling that never went away, no matter how close he came to the stars.	2005-08-03

Apparently Nixon spent most of the war amassing a small fortune in winning crap games and poker, gambling and the dog races, making a specialty of fleecing other members of his platoon on payday.  He came away from WWII with a substantial little campaign fund, more power to him, but not easy to bulk up into hero status.  LBJ too tried to re-cast his war years as his personal voyage into the danger zone but of course that was just so much hogwash.  Lance Morrow shows us JFK's war as being the only one really that had the oomph of legend, as witness his book PT-109, which had something Americans identified with, perhaps a willingness to push through even when things look darkest.<br /><br />And things seemed bleak in 1948, the year Morrow focuses on in his new, exciting psychobiography.  Unexpectedly bleak, for Americans had been longing for years for the war to end, when, it was said, they would find the answers and the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.  Instead what did they discover?  Only more uncertainty, and a nation once again divided among itself.  It was actually a great time to be a politician; as Morrow points out, pols thrive on misery and do their best work while energizing a demoralized public into action one way or another.  For Kennedy, the year involved accepting first the wild love life of his sister \\"Kick,\\" whose involvement with the Cavendish family would have assuredly led to a Profumo like scandal later in life, and then her tragic death, with its reverberations of his brother's earlier death in the War.  The shades of night were creeping in fast for Jack, who learned around the same time something of the dimension of his own Addison's disease, a psychic wound as well as a physical threat.  If he hadn't hitherto looked to sex for an escape, he certainly began to do so now.<br /><br />Nixon wasn't threatened by illness, but the way he jumped onto the Pumpkin Papers revealed a man with a certain mania on his brain.  Was it the urge, like all politicians, just to see his picture in the paper no matter what the context?  Or did he believe he was saving the country from those who had plunged us into war--a war which, he imagined, was really a liberal jihad unrelated to Americans' ordinary concerns?

He was the little man pulling down the big man, and the crowd roared in approval.<br /><br />Johnson's attack on Coke Stevenson is the weak link in Morrow's otherwise brilliant account.

American readers used to lap them up like candy, now we're a little tired of them: wonder why?  Probably too much real life Court TV.  After some of the celebrity trials we've had recently, can the [fictional]  killing of Madelyn Chapman raise even an eyebrow?<br /><br />Steve has done it again, given us a pulse pounding thriller that takes as its basis some of the hidden history of recent US operations overseas.  Paul Madriani, his legal eagle hero, is faced with taking over a case at short notice after a previous defense attorney (a flashy type totally 180 degrees removed from Paul's smooth understatement) quits, leaving the defendant in a velvet trap.  Emiliano Cruz served his country both in Kuwait and in Panama, now he's joined the private security force of a multimillion dollars software firm, and has promised to protect Madelyn Chapman--not sleep with her, but a little consensual sex seems to Sgt Cruz like a good side benefit to private security work.  No wonder he's the biggest suspect in her murder.<br /><br />The way she was shot through the head, in a double-barreled set of wounds that gives rise to the book's title, makes the police think that *someone* with a crack military background is responsible.  Because you don't see those wounds by accident!  Is it an execution style hit?  Is it the \\"farewell\\" of a rough man trying to shake off the embraces of a too-ardent lover?  Paul's got to figure all of this out and pronto.  When he questions his client, and scans his CV, he finds out that Cruz's record is fudged for seven crucial years.  Seven years!  That's a big hole in any man's resume, and for some reason, Cruz stubbornly refuses to fill Paul in on the details.<br /><br />What happened during those seven missing years?  How do they tie into Madelyn's murder?  Paul has to beat the clock, for if he doesn't get the right answers, his case goes belly-up.  And that's a place he doesn't want to go to . . .<br /><br />After seven books you'd think Martini might have run out of things to tell us about his charming alter ego.  But with DOUBLE TAP he pulls the rabbit out of his hat once again.  Putnam's has got to be thanking the Lord they signed up a winner when they gave Steve Martini a long-running publishing contract.

However fate is on their side. A fake newspaper story, planted to \\"smoke out\\" the individual they believe is their killer, instead \\"smokes out\\" the real killer who pretty much falls in their lap. Thus they solved the case but in an extremely slow-moving and ass-backward way.<br /><br />In the meantime Harry keeps making mistakes, offending Kiz (who has gotten a lot more touchy for some reason) and then having to apologize to her. I used to like her, but Connelly has made her a one-woman disapproval board. All she does is sniff and look upset. Connelly has got to give her more of a story, for here all she does is first bolster, then deflate Harry's wavering confidence. Never anything helpful to the case, just her own hurt feelings. And she's no better than Harry when it comes to figuring out the cold cases.<br /><br />Harry Bosch has done this kind of work before, so I don't agree with the reviewers who accuse Connelly of jumping on the bandwagon of the current vogue for the cold case. One of the suspects in fact works as a producer for the popular CBS TV show, so Connelly might be poking fun at our sick obsession with crime. However this particular suspect gets lost in the shuffle and never actually appears in the flesh. It's as though the author forgot all about this red herring! What's going on there? It's not like the story ever goes anywhere. Harry and Kiz just try to fit Roland Mackey into their grand theory of racism and rage, and even though he doesn't fit, they still try to cram him in, like a chimp forcing a piece of a jigsaw into the rest of the puzzle by mashing it with his fists. For three hundred pages we see them do this, with poetry added, the lame poetry of \\"We speak for the dead\\" that strikes me as particularly unconvincing when we never see the victim up close, we're just told over and over again that her death is a tragedy.<br /><br />I love Connelly's work but I'm beginning to think that, for some reason probably connected to money, he's writing far too much. A book or more a year means, each book is getting worse and worse.<br /><br />I give this one three stars because, well, despite everything he manages to deliver a surprise at the end, and well, Harry still is one of the great creations of the roman policier.d\\" that strikes me as particularly unconvincing when we never see the victim up close, we're just told over and over again that her death is a tragedy. <br /> <br />I love Connelly's work but I'm beginning to think that, for some reason probably connected to money, he's writing far too much.

Willemin,  Between this book and Morris West's SHOES OF THE FISHERMAN, two canny authors predicted the whole John Paul story before it actually occurred!<br /><br />If you ask me, of the two novels, Willemin's HOLD BACK THE DAWN has the edge, in terms of storytelling drive and political philosophy.<br /><br />It's a simple story of substitution, in which a Soviet Agent becomes a mole and plays a complicated game of identity.  Something like the old shell game, in which coconut shells are moved around a global landscape and the casual gamer doesn't know under which rough shell the soul lies trapped.<br /><br />Willemin creates some memorable characters, including Viktor Ignatyev, the man with two destinies-Catholic Monsignor, and Dedicated Bolshevik.  How simple it would be, thought his handlers, to raise a man into Catholicism and he could destroy the church from within!  Which is, as we all know, pretty much what happened, though I suspect ideological reasons were only one cause of a larger picture of Heaven wrestling with Hell.<br /><br />Once Viktor is \\"in place,\\" his focus shifts, but his controllers attempt to make him do their bidding by threatening his family.  It's an outrage, but wait till you see the checkmates and the gambits that lead to the thrilling conclusion of this Vatican story for the world.<br /><br />Warning, this book has nothing to do with the famous 1941 movie with Paulette Goddard, Charles Boyer and the young, ravishing Olivia De Havilland, Mitchell Leisen's sensitive romance of immigration and the nomadic search of today's modern people, being shoved out of their own land by Fascism and being forbidden to cross into the USA by this country's policy of isolation.	2005-07-28

It's the Second Empire and as Zola has foreseen, the rise of the steam railway has created enormous changes in the fabric of the social order.  To analyze this phenomenon more deeply, Zola hit on a lovely idea, to investigate the lives of those who work on the railroad and its linked industries.  What he didn't expect was what he came up with, a clear link between sex murder and high speed railways.  This link was to give rise within a few years of LA BETE HUMAINE's publication to the so-called \\"trunk murders.\\"  As Jacques realizes, trains make it possible to remove one of the awkward social reasons why men do not kill--because in general it was impossible to remove oneself from one's victim's body fast enough to avert suspicion.  You coukd bury the body, but it could still be traced back to you.  Now, in the 1880s, really all you had to do was put it on a train and science would steam it away from you at great rates of speed, putting infinite distances between you and your crime.<br /><br />Agatha Christie took some elements of LA BETE HUMAINE and modernized them a bit in her 1950s thriller THE 4:20 FROM PADDINGTON.  Both novels share the same surrealistic image--the murder seen framed in the window of a passing train that you see, so vividly, for one moment only, then it's gone as though it never happened.  (Freudians interpret this discomfiture as another version of the so-called \\"primal scene.\\")  Christie's murderer is a sort of updated Jacques, a man on whom the veneer of civilization is only as thick as his bank account and his convenience.<br /><br />But, in LA BETE HUMAINE, if you think Jacques is badm wait till you meet up with Severine, the \\"heroine\\" of the book, a woman so bad she makes other noir protagonists look like Pollyanna.  She is beautiful, selfish, conniving, self-absorbed and yet what makes her tick is her acute understanding of her social position and the way things get done, and undone, by forces we cannot control.  The negotiation of such tricky, slippery moral slopes is something that a sociopath can handle with ease.

I wonder if Mr. Ken Weber uses any pseudonyms.  The only problem is that the solutions are too hard.  I couldn't solve any of the first fifteen problems I tried, and I was really busting my balls to be frank, trying to work out the weaknesses in the witnesses' stories.  I think the answers depend on facts of the natural world that nobody knows, not even the experts.  And plus, well, how about the solution which proves that people couldn't have seen what they claimed to see because, if they had been out on their lawn the way they said, mosquitoes would have bitten them?  May I humbly add, WTF?  Mosquitoes don't bite everybody for one thing, and secondly, they never said mosquitoes didn't bite them, so where's the lie?<br /><br />However, I should be blaming myself, not Ken Weber, because he constructed the trap, I just fell into it.  He duped me good and isn't that why we buy these crazy puzzle books anyhow?<br /><br />A few other comments, I was surprised by how Canadian these puzzles were!  The very first one sort of assaults you with Canadianness.  It's all about a \\"police constable,\\" he's the hero who has to determine if a deaf woman is lying or not.  \\"Constable\\"?  That's not an American usage is it?  Thus we learn a little about our neighbors to the North every time we buy a Ken Weber book.  They must be awfully proud of him up there, I hope that he is properly respected in his native land.<br /><br />Other reviewers have said that this book is too easy for them!

This made me curious, because ordinarily my friend is quite voluble and will go on for hours about the books he enjoys, especially \\"experimental\\" fiction and why they are superior to the books he calls \\"middlebrow.\\"  I looked at the book, a lovely pink salmon colored cover, and noted the name of the author, \\"Elisabeth Sheffield,\\" certainly a genteel sounding name, and couldn't figure what had provoked such stunned silence.  Anyhow, to make a long story short, I began GONE and I'm here to tell you, this author is so talented it's scary!  She has written a book with not one, but two very strong female characters, each of them existing in a different time frame than the other, but linked by blood, and in fact they have the same last name.<br /><br />Stella is our contemporary, she is a college professor with a burning desire to somehow obtain a painting (by Winslow Homer) left to her by her grandfather, but yet she has no idea how to go about doing this.  She has a hapless, drugged out boyfriend (who used to be her student, another taboo) who's along to help her hunt; his name is \\"Skip,\\" as in \\"skip a beat.\\"  The difference between these two provides for some brilliant incidental comedy, as all mismatched lovers do.  Sheffield is equally strong at the small strokes and the big ones.  An ordinary conversation is revealed as swimming with meaning like a tank crammed with eels.<br /><br />She deftly counterpoints Stella's story with the correspondence of Stella's aunt, Judith, whose friends call her \\"Juju.\\"  In a way she is sort of witchy, as her nickname suggests.  She is a woman very much alive, much more so than the somewhat moribund, driven Stella.  In the very act of writing Juju has discovered a sovereignty of her own, and she speaks with the abundance and fecundity of, well, someone like Molly Bloom.  It is symptomatic of the difference between the two Vanderzee women that Stella's quest for the missing Winslow Homer painting is a futile one, while Juju is largely on target throughout (or at least in the right neighborhood).<br /><br />Reading the book I kept wishing I knew someone who knew the director Jame Campion, because I would forward this book to her and then she could make it into her next movie.  Far fetched?  Maybe, but to me GONE has many Campion touches and I think she might be sensitive to Sheffield's explorations of family, destiny, power relations, love and the lingering effect of silence on the human soul.  On the other hand, how could any movie, no matter how well made, convey anything of the complex intertextual interventions Sheffield makes throughout this lively and groundbreaking novel?  That's a stumper for you.<br /><br />I feel she is just scratching the surface of her powers and that we will hear more from Elisabeth Sheffield in the years to come.matic of the difference between the two Vanderzee women that Stella's quest for the missing Winslow Homer painting is a futile one, while Juju is largely on target throughout (or at least in the right neighborhood). <br /> <br />Reading the book I kept wishing I knew someone who knew the director Jame Campion, because I would forward this book to her and then she could make it into her next movie.

This one \\"can't keep it in his pants.\\"  That one \\" has to get his affairs into order.\\"  It would be interesting if the reader cared about any of the people, or again, knew who they were.  The author, Kessler, who wrote a fairy tale book about George Bush Jr's Presidential character, is obviously in great anxiety about his own social status, and he must feel that rubbing against these rich, spoiled people on vanity fair's bank account, is going to make him somehow less Jewish.<br /><br />As many readers have commented, the book is filled with photos of Kessler and his wife (\\"Pam\\") meeting rich people, trying to look happy and relaxed.  But their flop sweat is written all over them.  Whoever the photo editor was for THE SEASON should have discreetly taken the Kesslers aside and told them how tacky their photos are, save them for the panelled den in their suburban home, or their cabin cruiser.<br /><br />Kessler tries to imitate the highly worked novelistic shape of MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL by focussing on the dreary story of a male \\"walker,\\" a single presentable man who is available to escort society women to parties--this character is called Kirby and he indulges in a passion for a so-called straight man named Bill, a loser ex-con who's always up to some drug-inspired mischief.  Kirby would be pathetic, but at least he shows some emotion.  Unlike the other people Kessler tries to impress us with.<br /><br />As one woman says in THE SEASON, \\"There are a lot of floozies and fruits and nuts.  There are also a lot of beautiful men and women here..  But the ones who are straight are taken.  I live in a crazy town.  People try to contaminate me with their bizarreness.\\"  Well, hey, I live in a crazy town too, but I never felt contaminated until I read this impossible, heartbreaking book about trying to mingle with your betters.SEASON, \\"There are a lot of floozies and fruits and nuts.

The other day for example I saw a inconsequential Fox comedy of the 1950s written by Nunnally Johnson, Oh Men, Oh Women, and in it a spoiled white heiress played by Barbara Rush refuses to exit a New York cab until the driver finds her the correct change.  For the moment,the focus of the film is on the hassled driver, who has to contend with Miss Rush's airs, and also with the honks and screams of a dzoen other cabs jammed up behind him.  Finally he lets her out for free and he absorbs the cost of his mistake.  I didn't recognize the actor who played (briefly) the cabbie, then I waited for the credits.  It was Joel Fluellen.  A name which would have meant nothing to me, if I hadn't just finished reading Bogle.  Joel Fluellen!  The forgotten man of the movies dead, alas, too soon, and way before he could reveal his true sexuality.<br /><br />This performance, brief as it was, is totally calibrated and brings an energy into a movie which sadly needs some!  In a way this scene might be an allegory for Bogle's thesis, which is that, even if they were given insulting little to do, African American actors did it stunningly well and the shame of it is how very few of them managed to catch a break all the way to stardom.  A few of them did: Lena Horne, Dorothy Dandridge, Sidney Poitier.  Because the book basically breaks off circa 1960, we don't get to hear later success stories such as Will Smith or Denzel Washington.  This book is all about forebears.<br /><br />A few nights later I watched a picture of an earlier vintage, CRASH DIVE with Tyrone Power.  Oddly for its time, the movie gives a fair amount of screen time to a black actor calkled Ben Carter.  If you read BBBD, you will find out Carter's whole story, the way he parlayed his limited experience as a theatrical agent into representing some of Hollywood's biggest black names--and often enough stealing their parts from them, because he'd nab the script and secure the part first if he thought it worth his time!<br /><br />If you've got one film book to read this year make it Donald Bogle.

Well, duh.<br /><br />She is on firmer ground when she describes what happened to Shelley's heart, which was supposedly plucked from his burning body by a friend, Edward Trelawney, after the poet's drowning death in Italy in July, 1822, with a volume of Keats tucked into one pocket.  The witnesses to this burning scene all wrote very different accounts of it later, and Lee asks, sensibly enough, if any of them can be believed.  Perhaps the organ plucked from the body was not the heart at all, but Shelley's liver.<br /><br />The best piece might be her analysis (it's slight and inconsequential, but it is still analysis of a sort) of a number of differing interpretations by Jane Austen's biographer about an occasion on which she fainted when her mother told her that the family would be moving to Bath.  It is amusing seeing what different folk believe about this faint and about the move to Bath.  Biographers build up their cases like lawyers on the one hand, novelists on the other.<br /><br />She can be scathing about other biogaphers, especially poor Claire Tomalin, who gets it (twice!) for her admittingly annoying habit of extrapolating the pattern of any one person's life out of background information about the period.  Richard Holmes, the esteemed biographer of Shelley, won't be so happy reading this book if he thought he had a friend in Hermione Lee.  She poses as an author who has not only thought through all the problems of biography but as one who has licked them; there isn't a passage or sentence in which she describes any uncertainty about her own motives or results.  Pity.	2005-07-24

She has hit on the idea, the trope, of OVERLORD and managed to succeed at an unlikely target, a combination of historical detail like Stephen Ambrose, with her trademark exploration of consciousness, and a new attention to her long, long line which often reads as though thought itself was being examined and twisted along a wire, like a centipede on a tightrope, high above a crowd all of whose mouths hang gaping open.  Let's look at an example, shall we?<br /><br />In \\"EUROPE (Omaha Beach 2003),\\" Graham evokes the famous Norman landings by picking out the appropriate, sometimes surreal, nouns: \\"Boats, sirf, cries, miles, pool, bars, war.\\"  It is vivid, like the first reels of Steven Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  \\"No/ container, friend,\\" she adds.  \\"No basic building blocks \\"of/ matter.  No constituent particles from which everything/ is made.\\"  Then, quick as a wince, she corrects herself: \\"No made.\\"  (Note the hidden word \\"nomad\\" in the middle of this, crouching like a Bedouin.)<br /><br />Perhaps recent events in world history have keft US poets feeling nomadic, as though there were no real place for us any more on American soil,<br /><br />Where would she be without Peter Sacks?

The field is yellow, stained with age and water damage, like the shipborne invasion itself.<br /><br />With the double consciousness of a wound, Graham has made an interesting investment in reclaiming a crucial battle of World War II from the Tom Brokaws and the Gerald Fords who have claimed it as their own, and returned it to poetry where it belongs.ing investment in reclaiming a crucial battle of World War II from the Tom Brokaws and the Gerald Fords who have claimed it as their own, and returned it to poetry where it belongs.	2005-07-24

Over its length Barber becomes intimately familiar with Powell's idiosyncrasies, but he does not take into account how trying they will seem to the majority of his readers.

And indeed Powell (pronounced \\"Pole\\" as in fishing pole) did have his charms, especially when he wanted something from you.  As Barber shows us, he despised Graham Greene's writing, calling him a third-rate Joseph Conrad, who had the temerity to add \\"Roman Catholic propaganda\\" to an insipid stew, and yet he found it easier to pretend to like him to his face, even calling him \\"cher confrere,\\" --until Greene's death, and then he could pour out the venom he had secreted.<br /><br />Barber also discusses Powell's friendship with the doomed, damned composer Constant Lambert, who also figures in the recent Meredith Daneham biography of Margot Fonteyn (he was her lover and mentor early on).  Powell satirized Lambert as one of the characters in his novel, as indeed he did everyone who he met and knew well.  Daneham provides a more compassionate portrait of Lambert, Barber a colder one, following the lead of Powell, who seems to have had great satisfaction in outliving almost everyone else and then telling the world what he was not able (due to stringent libel laws) to hint at in fictional terms.<br /><br />We learn the origin of nearly every character and plot point in the DANCE, and that is the great use of this biography.  I can't imagine reading another biography of this dreary man, so I expect my final impression of him will be one who, like Evelyn Waugh, saw only the worst in mankind, and made money doing so.my final impression of him will be one who, like Evelyn Waugh, saw only the worst in mankind, and made money doing so.	2005-07-24

She reminds me of the character Diane Lane plays in UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN.  It's almost as though she had been reincarnated and a piece of her (perhaps her old soul) still wanted to cling to the heyday of the Gold Coast mansions of Long Island, which, when she was coming of age in the 1950s and 1960s, were all coming down, torn to pieces, their vast acreages sold to developers to put up ticky tacky development housing.  As Randall explains, the Second World War was a two edges sword.  Not only did it become impossible to find good help, because any servant could make better wages doing war work in defense plants and factories, but after the war many young men received the GI Bill which in turn created an overwhelming demand for family housing on a mass scale, and this is what led to the abandonment of most of these estates.<br /><br />She and her sister set out to save the elegant furnishings and electrical work, and thus she snagged many Tiffany lamps and other window-like decorations when she was still a teenager.  They were just in the rubbish, or in the way of an uncaring bulldozer, so she would just put them in her car.  I'd love to see her Tiffany collection, for example.  Perhaps she will make that the subject of her next book.<br /><br />In the meantime she has given us a tale of shivers and evil.  I grew tense reading about the one Gold Coast mansion with its parquet floors, each stone was actually, if you looked closely, a tombstone from a child's grave!  How depraved was the owner of such an evil house!  No wonder the sad voices of children and other victims of a predatory capitalism continue to speak as we visit what remains of the place of their shame and their abuse.<br /><br />It's not a consoling book, but it will keep you up all night, so try to read this one during the daytime, with the curtains wide open, to let in the sun, let it dapple the pages of this enchanting tour de force.is enchanting tour de force.	2005-07-23

I've been reading it for weeks and I never wanted it to end--not until the very sad last days after Fonteyn's retirement when everything just went from bad to worse.<br /><br />I was startled to find out number one, how poor she was most of her life, and how she had no pension, no savings, nothing!  It was just tragic, and if you ask me, marriage to Tito Arias was a huge mistake.  Loving him, or finding him lovable, was Fonteyn's tragic flaw, and I still can't figure it out (why she did it).  here Daneman isn't much help because underneath a posture of \\"no comment,\\" and the biographer's need to find something redeeming in all of her characters, you can tell she doesn't care for him any more than I do.<br /><br />Perhaps Fonteyn was drawn by his foreignness, but she must have met thousands and thousands of more attractive foreign people.<br /><br />Daneman also makes you think that Nureyev was a great dancer--only for about ten months, and then he turned into a parody of himself.  I don't think that's entirely true, but after going through \\"Rudimania\\" in the pages of the book, I did begin to question whether he ever had an unselfish thought in his entire life.  Margot makes one bad decision after another in this book and, otherwise an admirable character in so many ways, she does not seem to have ever felt regret.  Daneman seems to think that she might well have retired after the success of Ashton's Ondine, and left the field to Lynn Seymour, Antoinette Sibley, and the American ballerinas.  This is a trikcky proposition, but at any rate the remainser of Fonteyn's career shows her working pretty much out of the old-fashioned ballet theater conventions she had for so long been used to, and we see the fragmentation of Ninette de Valois' Sadler Wells/Royal Ballet in terms that feel very real to us, painful.  The whole business was predicated on having \\"stars,\\" just as in Hollywood, and yet when the stars got too powerful, and diva-esque, something of the \\"company\\" feeling went by the wayside.<br /><br />Daneman brings us as close as is humanly possible to being inside Margot Fonteyn's skin, both as a woman and as an artist.  Her decsriptions of dancing are impeccable, vivid.  She makes me feel I was there for the premiere of Ashton's WISE VIRGINS or LES SIRENES or the bizarre LUCIFER that Martha Graham concocted for Fonteyn and Nureyev.  How she does this is a mystery, but it involves large helpings of meticulous and cleverly edited interviews; a sense of drama and the ridiculous; an unabashed curiosity about sex and matters of the body (illness included) and most of all, she knows what she's talking about from a practical and musical perspective.<br /><br />This book has something I've never seen, and I'm not sure how I feel about it.  One passage had a footnote that I wanted to read, a passage purporting to give Ashton's account of Margot's sexual prowess in shockingly gynecological terms.  \\"My goodness, who told the author that?\\" I wondered.  Following the footnote, i read, to my surprise, \\"Frederick Ashton, source withheld.\\"<br /><br />Source withheld?  That's a new one to me!  is this common now in biography, to drop these bombshells and let everyone off the hook?<br /><br />Despite my qualms regarding this newstyle footnoting practice, this was the biography of the year.  I don't expect another book to touch it for a good long time.llywood, and yet when the stars got too powerful, and diva-esque, something of the \\"company\\" feeling went by the wayside.

As I opened the book my heart did sink a bit when the prologue and introduction to the book gave me the feeling that author Max Holland had some serious axes to grind against previous commentators on LBJ's tapes.<br /><br />And yet as soon as the introduction left off saying what those previous bad writers had failed to do, and began to explain what he himself planned to do--just like a campaign stump speech--for me, the book took off.  Now, nothing is going to replace the impact of hearing all these tapes oneself.  But seriously now, who is going to do that?  A well edited transcript, sensitive to nuance is for me the better choice.  And I think Holland has an amazing ear, and he is sensitive not only to LBJ's distinctive speech but to the regional dialects of dozens of other people, from Dallas policemen to the high-cultured fluty voice of Jackie Kennedy.  As a sidelight, one thing that's amazing is how, in the forty some years since the Kennedy assassination, television and mass media have almost eradicated regional accents from Americam so that we all talk more or less alike now.  Not back then!  No wonder standup comedians could make whole careers out of imitating the bizarre, almost 'private' accents of JFK or LBJ.<br /><br />The story itself, and the way it uplinked into phone conversations, is compelling, magnetizing.  The witnesses seem all universally to be trying to do the best thing in a time of terrible national anguish.  I was struck once again by how perceptive and genuine and giving a First Lady we had in Lady Bird Johnson, whose account of the assassination is one of the best documents of its kind in the world.  No way, after reading these transcripts, do I believe that either Johnson had anything to do with a conspiracy.  It just doesn't seem possible.  I look forward to Holland's next book--the book to which this one ws just a side project--a \\"narrative history of the Warren Commission.\\"  Now we'll see in full color how history was really made--made, and made up.st a side project--a \\"narrative history of the Warren Commission.\\"  Now we'll see in full color how history was really made--made, and made up.	2005-07-22

You'd think that she (Holt) would have changed the setting a wee bit though, I mean move it away from the cliffs of Cornwall, for heaven's sake, you're just asking for comparisons!<br /><br />And yet think of how different REBECCA would have been had Rebecca and Max de Winter had a little daughter!  Which is pretty much what happens here.  Little Alvean is sort of like Miles and Flora in Henry James' THE TURN OF THE SCREW, and Martha Leigh is a bit like the governess who worried about her charges so in James' 1890 novelette.  When \\"Marty\\" first meets her and tries to find out what her lessons should be, the little girl is rude, disrespectful, and totally spoiled by having been allowed to run free.  Plus her father's aristocratic snobbery towards the middle class has infected young Alvean so she feels no compunction about telling Martha that she doesn't have to listen to her.<br /><br />The whodunnit aspect comes towards the end of a long and suspenseful story.  The very last person in the world who you would suspect, turns out to be the killer, a mad monster whose actions seem incalculably cruel.  Only later do you begin to piece it together and to feel even a little sympathy for the murderer, who was coming from a very tough place which Victoria Holt sketches out pretty well.  Anyhow, I liked it, but I can see how if you read 50 of these books they would all start to seem the same.	2005-07-22

Though he doesn't know why, one day Max Trader wakes up and realizes that he's been transported into the body of a homeless derelict, Johnny Devlin, who's now all showered and shaved and living in Max's very nice lifestyle.  The two men are at a standstill, and Max realizes how tough it is to be homeless and yet, we all of us can do something to change our life, even if our \\"trading partner\\" (Johnny) isn't quite ready to give us back our own life yet.  TRADER shines with all of Charles De Lint's trademark magic and color.  His town is like one designed by Thomas Kinkade, the \\"painter of light,\\" if Kinkade had been a Canadian citizen; you will feel you're at home right away, even if your own life has been very different than that of the perplexed, bewitched characters of Ontario.<br /><br />Do you remember THE IVORY AND THE HORN?  In that book Coyote descsibres the mystic little flute player, the trickster, and he says, \\"He's a fertility symbol, now, very mythopoetic and all, but it wasn't always that way.  Used to be a trader, a travelling merchant, hup-two-three.  That hunched back was actually his pack of trading goods, the flute his way of approaching a settlement, tootle-toot-toot, it's only me, no danger, except if you were some nubile young thing.\\"  I think perhaps for De Lint the concept of the \\"trader\\" was percolating in his mind lo, these many years, and only now has he expanded it into novel length.  He has drunk deep from the wells of Northrop Frye and Lord Dunsany and he has fermented his own bubbly brew of identity and inspiration.<br /><br />If you are looking for a place of nature inside the city, come to the world of TRADER and lie back and see the stars through the neon.	2005-07-21

The cover said he was Alaska's legendary sled dog sprint champ.  Whuh?  I scoffed, thinking \\"legendary\\" was a word that is overused nowadays and should be reserved for people like Helen of Troy or George Washington.  However, one quick peek through the contents of this book made me think that for once, Lew Freedman is not overstating things, for George Attla has indeed all the attributes of a legendary figure.  Did you ever read Joseph Campbell's HERO OF A THOUSAND FACES?  That will come to mind when you sit down with a hot cup of cocoa and a copy of SPIRIT OF THE WIND.  For Attla is to ordinary mushers what Margot Fonteyn is to ballerinas--the gold standard to which all others have to kneel down.<br /><br />He is good with dogs, and Freedman spends a lot of time detailing the extraordinary bonds set up by a trainer like Attla with some very special beasts.  Freedman ascribes some of his magic to his First Peoples ancestry, for he is an Alaskan Indian with a kind of \\"horse whispering\\" background and a crippling childhood disease, one that would bring tears to your eyes, and when he conquers it the Northern Lights seem to glow a little brighter.  You'll be wiping away the tears with a chamois.<br /><br />He has achieved too many feats to mention, and nine gold medals.  When he left school, it was with a first grade education--no, I guess he made it into second grade.  At the end of our lives when we approach the Pearly Gates, St Peter will ask us what we did for other people while we were alive, and George Attla will shake his noble head and say, \\"I did it for the dogs.\\"	2005-07-21

The actor who was in the Our Gang movies and also IN COLD BLOOD is a different fellow (I assume)from the editor of this charming Victorian keepsake.  Disraeli however, as it turns out, shares much in common with the famous former child star: they both have quite a raucous sense of humor, they love birds (remember the cockatoo in BARETTA that sat on Blake's shoulder, always cracking wise?) and they believe in the rights of the little people.  Both of them are iconoclasts, and rather short.<br /><br />Among the grest quotations that will catch your eye is this one, which has been quoted so often many people think it was Churchill who said it, \\"There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.\\"<br /><br />He also said that you can get a man to listen for hours if you talk to him about--himself.<br /><br />In that vein, Disraeli had many quips about the aghe-old propensity of men to listen to themselves act smart.  Like Charlie Chan he said, \\"Wise men ask for reasons, the fool wonders.\\"  Rodgers and Hammerstein knew this quote, and turned it on its head for one of their most enduring song, \\"Some Enchanted Evening,\\" where Ezio Pinza advised, \\"Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.\\"<br /><br />Blake knows his stuff and has given us a bumper crop of Disraelisms that will have you pounding the floor with hilarity and shaking your head with rueful laughter.	2005-07-20

Anyhow I sat down with the book and breezed through the attractive pages looking for a cool weather poncho for the cold San Francisco summer nights.  There are plenty of outdoor events which take place late into the night, say, the recent fireworks at Crissy Field, and why not dress warmly with a newly knitted poncho?  Lucinda Williams came and gave a free concert in Golden Gate Park, and I wasn't the only guy there wearing a decorated poncho in honor of Barbazette and Stork's new guide.<br /><br />It was a great idea to hire David Verba to do the photos.  He's famous for his Western photos of desert stretches and big throbbing moon shots, no one since John Ford has made Monument Valley look so good.  But here in the knit department he does a good job, makes you look twice, expecting to see salamanders gliding across the model's boot.<br /><br />The real reason ponchos are so popular among knitters is, there's practically nothing you can do that will go wrong.  No amount of dropped stritches are going to make the poncho look deformed or like anything else but what it is, a sort of rhomboid shape with a hole for your head to poke through.  VIVA PONCHO has many of these, though some are clearly designed for women and few men, even in our liberated San Francisco, are going to wear some of the capelets in the book.  In fact one or two of them no one but a runway model could wear without looking like an idiot.  They're \\"too\\" stylish if  such a thing might be and you know it might for sure!<br /><br />No matter if you prefer mohair or alpaca, or just yarn from Marks and Spencer, you'll find something to make.  Now boys get out those needles and set off some sparks!	2005-07-20

For example, I was in an independent bookstore the other day near City Hall here in San Francisco, and a well-dressed little toddler was sitting there crying, on the floor, while his nanny was trying to interest him in reading this book.  \\"But I don't wanna!  I don't like Pook!\\" cried the little rich boy.  So it just shows you that there's no accounting for tastes.  Speaking for myself, I can't see how anyone, no matter how young, could despise such a cute story.  Zac the woodcarver is your ideal folk hero.  Not too handsome, in fact he looks a bit like Nate, the hero of HBO's SIX FEET UNDER, in other words, just adequate, but children will like the way he stands tall in the forest and cares about even the littlest of the forest creatures.  Even the wood he carves receives his loving attention.  In a way, he's like Gary Snyder but without the poetry.  Instead, what he has is an inquiring mind and a sweet dedication to the welfare of his little \\"doth\\" Pook.<br /><br />Yes, \\"doth\\" is correct.  Don't try looking it up in your Funk and Wagnalls, for you won't find it, but I predict that one day Pook will be just as famous an animal in children's literature as the immortal Wilbur the Pig, or Aslan, or Freddy the Pig, or Puss in Boots.  \\"Uff, uff,\\" says the little \\"doth.\\"  Yes, he's part dog and the rest--well, that's for your inner child to find out.  If Disney had any business sense they would secure the film right to Michael Stadther's haunting fable, and film it on the big screen with live action and combined CGI effects.  They could hire just about any big star, for all of them would want to make a family oriented film.  Look at Johnny Depp--he used to do edgy work, then came a family and now he's all Pirates of the Caribbean and Willy Wonka.<br /><br />When Zac and Pook get more involved in the mysteries of the Great Forest you will be on fire with suspense.  Yes, there's an ecological twist to this tale, and so I was not surprised to read in our local paper, the Chronicle, that the very first treasure was discovered in a national park!  Open to everyone, our national parks are indeed America's greatest treasure.  And this book ranks a close second.and so I was not surprised to read in our local paper, the Chronicle, that the very first treasure was discovered in a national park!

As usual, Lanham makes you curious and excited about the books he likes and, though he had some reservations about Ekirch's prose style and sometimes cumbrous way of writing, he still made the book sound great.  I have to agree, AT DAY'S CLOSE is one of those books which, once finished, you can't stop thinking about and which you want to tell all your friends about.  For anyone who has thought much about the world before the modern era, it has a particularly magical touch, for it asks us to re-imagine what life was like before the electric and gas light came to be, when once the sun fell people were plunged into mostly inpenetrable darkness.  No wonder they made such a cult of the moon!  It must have been a blessing to them.  \\"Ill met by moonlight\\" indeed.<br /><br />Ekirch reports that the ordinary householder spent more on his bed than on anything else in the house.  People must have been confined pretty much to bed.  It made me think of the way Shakespeare's will leaves his \\"second best bed\\" to his wife, a bequest biographers sometimes take to mean that they didn't have a very good marriage, but now that Ekirch's reportage is in, I think of it in a different way.  In A MIDSUMMER'S NIGHT DREAM, which takes place almost entirely during the night, the audience is allowed to \\"see\\" things it could never have seen even in moonlight and thus this must have contributed to the \\"magical\\" factor of the play for contemporary audience, a feeling we have long lost.<br /><br />For us moderns, day and night are pretty much the same.  Perhaps that's why our belief in elves, fairies, trolls, etc., has diminished.  Thanks to Freud even our dreams have become more understandable.  Imagine living back then and feeling that the dreams were part of a larger, evil force that took control once the sun was down and that dreams were forced on you!<br /><br />The book has something startling on every page.  How many other books can make that claim?  Besides that, it brings the past to us in a nearly visceral way.

After the hundreds of pages of Bo Friberg's regular PROFESSIONAL PASTRY CHEF, who would have thought there was anything more to say?  But yet this book is just about the equivalent in poundage.  Suffice it to say that most of the pastries in this book weigh less than the book itself.  Maybe one or two of the wedding cakes Friberg describes will weight more.<br /><br />If you want to know how to make a macaroon, French toast, or even salty pretzels, you can look them up in the first book.  Plus, you can learn how to make them professionally, including tips they don't bother teaching the ordinary home cook.  And also how to make in bulk and still maintain quality control.  How often do you have to multiply everything in your head, from flour to salt, while trying to cook for a party, and still you know that it won't come out right because of the increased volume of the pastry?  It happened to me just last Sunday, and all because I wasn't using either of Friberg's books.<br /><br />This book goes into great detail into what Friberg calls \\"Modernist\\" desserts.  It's a comical name for any student of Modernism, but you know what he means.  Those fancy desserts with little poles of pastry ringing together an odd batch of components, and trying to make the dessert higher than it is wide.  Remember the old days of the 1950s, when they showed French chefs in the movies or on TV shows, they were always trying to impress with Baked Alaska?  Here there are some recipes that put that to shame.<br /><br />Warning, it's a heavy book, and don't try to balance this up against a mixing bowl or your eggs could go skeetering right along the linoleum as happened to me three weeks ago.	2005-07-18

Opinions are divided as to whether or not John Michael Hayes (Hitchcock's scenarist) improved Woolrich's fairly bare bones tale, but I think most agree that he got at some important Woolrich themes, the importance of looking, the humiliation of being (if only temporarily) disabled, the amazing multiplicity of the world, where right next to you might be a victim--or a killer.  And Grace Kelly looked the way Cornell Woolrich wrote his women, like a gay man's idea of what a perfect woman should look like. <br /> <br />\\"I Won't Take a Minute\\" is really frightening, and imagine if you had never heard of the plot before, and it was still fresh in your mind!  I see that the new Jodie Foster thriller FLIGHT PLAN will be a re-telling of this old story once more, and while I respect Foster as an actress, I doubt if FLIGHT PLAN will top the chills of \\"I Won't Take a Minute.\\"	2005-07-15

Here in this book we find out what is the rationale behind some of their apparently nutty behavior.  What a lifesaver this has been, and I'm sure many misunderstood cats have literally had their lives spared because someone read this book and realized what was wrong.<br /><br />Did you ever read ANDROCLES AND THE LION?  The \\"King of the Cats,\\" brought down and humbled because of a thorn in the tender flesh of its paw.  And only one man, a buffoon, realized what was wrong and how to make things right.<br /><br />Pam Johnson-Bennett is like Androcles, and her tips on how to restore your pet's mental balance will put YOU at ease too.  Sometimes a cat gets a little crazy when his or her water doesn't taste right.  There's a delicate equilibrium in a cat's life, and think of the enormous insecurity and delicacy of a pet's life.  They are in bondage for all intents and purposes, and the life of a slave (even a pampered and petted slave) has its own rigors.  Sometimes these burst out into bad or destructive behavior, like a raisin in the sun.<br /><br />Outside of that the book is a lot of fun.  We've all been there, and now we'll find out why!	2005-07-15

So many times, authors plan for a trilogy but they really only have enough material to make two books.  I wonder why this is?  Think of the Godfather Saga and how Godfather III limped way behind the first two.<br /><br />Seadler doesn't suffer much in comparison to Francis Ford Coppola.  He is obviously one of the most brilliant men still alive (if he is still alive, he must be mighty old by now, for he was a name my Grandfather used to conjure up back in the 1960s).  He has hit upon a solution for preventing war that makes spy systems and sophisticated electronic satellites obsolete, or better, beyond the point.  He has realized what Wittgenstein sometimes said, that what we think in our minds, becomes true in the arena of real life, and that if war is a product of our minds, then to end it we must reprogram our minds.  More to the point, he advocates reprogramming Islam feeling about the Jihad.  Ambitious, but I suppose it is possible.  In the light of 9/11, Seadler develops some of the ideas he fostered in his groundbreaking, and equally opaque, Principia Ideologica way back when.  In addition, he trots out some of the useful aphorisms from his second book, ENDING THE BRONZE AGE, a fascinating read which some of us feel was rather unfair to the Bronze Age, which was a period of history not without virtues of its own.<br /><br />What makes him so unique is that, he is not a headbanging Howard Stern type showboat, but a quiet thoughtful man who has redeemed some of the oldest cliches in the book.  If TERROR WAR AND PEACE has a limited audience due to its mandarin style, that is a terrible shame, and really what he needs is a popularizer, the way that Da Vinci has Dan Brown, to make his ideas more appealing to the man or woman on the street.  His distinctions between TERROR and TERRORISM are always sharp and on the mark.	2005-07-14

Those were the 60s after all, a time when we still looked to our novels for the answers to the day's problems.  Cheever wasn't interested in solving problems.  As we now know, he was torn in a psychic split between different parts of his identity--the average family man, colorless and yet possessed by a love divine, vs. the bisexual swinger who lives for sensation and the authenticity of the gutter.<br /><br />BULLET PARK represents this conflict in allegorical terms, and now I can see that the two neighbors and antagonists, Nailles and Hammer, form two halves of the same person.  Well, that's a crude way of putting it, but at any rate reading back into the biography they perhaps represent two of Cheever's warring personalities, and in their conflict over the future of Tony Nailles, the appealing teenage son, they are going to war themselves.  At stake is nothing less than the future of American literature.<br /><br />I always thought this would have been a good movie--back in the day I wrote Cheever a note asking him to make sure that Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas would play Hammer and Nailles in the film version.  He was polite but non-committal.  And I don't know who would be good among today's actors.  I picked Lancaster and Douglas because those two, who of course made many pictures together, gave off the almost untangible sensation of somehow having been made for each other, like the way Plato wrote that we are all looking for the other half of the soul we were once part of.  Thus even when they were playing antagonists, Lancaster and Douglas still seemed to be seeking each other out, not in an erotic way especially, but in a search for meaning that would never end.	2005-07-12

Gore Browne led an exciting life, yet like the man portrayed in Werner Herzog's film FITZCARRALDO, who tried to bring garnd opera to a little town on the wrong side of a Peruvian mountain, his obsessions are hard to separate from his derangement.  In the case of Fitzcarraldo, he attempted to building a Western-style opera house in the jungles of Peru; Gore Browne had similar dreams of building an old fahsioned country manor a la Walter Scott's Waverley novels in the middle of what was then Rhodesia.  In both cases everythinghad to be imported for thousands of miles--in Gore-Browne's case that included a wife.  And what a wife!  It seems that he only married her because he had once been in love with her mother--surely a strange story, and one that you don't hear that much of any more.  You'd have to turn to the magnificent Snopes trilogy (by William Faulkner) to find this quasi-incestuous story told so delicately and with such perception.<br /><br />Christina Lamb did a lot of homework before writing this book, even going to the tumbledown mansion where, as she writes, she would pull a book from the library shelves and it would crumble in her hands (due to Rhodesian humidity and the family's neglect of the old estate).  Her descriptions of going to this haunted mansion are almost as romantic as the first pages of REBECCA by Daphne Du Maurier (\\"Last night I dreamed I went to Manderley again\\") and understanding Gore Browne's character in the light of British romantic novels will help us understand this odd old duffer, a man who championed the cause of black freedom and yet kept a cast of servant as though they were slaves.<br /><br />The bad thing about the book is Lamb's reliance on cliches and the fact that her writing resembles a Harlequin romance of the 1960s.  There is little or no attempt to understand the politics that shaped Gore Browne's career.  It is all about the inner man.960s.

Thus the three Godfather films are discussed back to back (to back), and even though this allows him a freedom to show the cross-connections among the different parts of the Godfather saga, I wonder if it doesn't screw up our understanding of the amazing ups and downs of Coppola's career.  Otherwise it is an amazing read and will be the standard book on the director for some time to come.<br /><br />It is a measure of the book's evenhandedness that, even when I disagree on Phillips' rankings of the different movies, I still respect his opinion.  He rates THE RAIN PEOPLE and FINIAN'S RAINBOW considerably lower than I do, while heaping plaudits on top of BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA and Winona Ryder's performance.  I was glad to see that Phillips has seen and likes RIP VAN WINKLE, the episode of that Shelley Duvall fairy tale TV series that Coppola directed at a low point (it was on RIP that Coppola first worked with Eiko Ishioka, the costume designer who later on made the fantastic DRACULA costumes so creepily memorable).<br /><br />Spelling the \\"best film of the 90s\\" as GoodFellows is a little odd, but Phillips is an old school journeyman film writer, with lots of research under his belt, and a level head to boot.  He makes us curious about all the footage said to have been cut by Warner from THE OUTSIDERS (1983) and how handy is it that from what I hear this footage has been restored by Coppola for the upcoming theatrical re-release and DVD of the film this fall!  I wonder if we will ever see another version of THE COTTON CLUB too--or if Coppola will ever work again with Diane Lane, on whose behalf he labored so long, like John Hughes did for Molly Ringwald or, if it comes to that, as Josef Von Sternberg did for Marlene Dietrich.	2005-07-10

But as we try to comprehend the news that Ed McBain died today, it is a staggering blow to anyone who loves the detective story in general and police procedurals in particular.<br /><br />ALICE IN JEOPARDY has received mixed reviews, and maybe some were disappointed by the book's disjionted structure.  Others read it as an ambitious experiment in combining several genres of crime writing.  Its heroine, Alice Glendinning, whose husband disappeared in a boating accident eight months ago, and whose children have just been kidnapped, is not your typical heroine and seems to ward off the readers' sympathies throughout.  The mysterious villain is unmasked in a late chapter but probably most of us knew who it was going to be, we just didn't know how that obliquity would be undone.  Thus ALICE turns into a novel of inverted suspense.  It would have been easy for McBain to make this a conventional novel of abduction and despair, but he was always after something different.  People point to Picasso and say that he could be so experimental because he coould draw like an angel.  Same was true of Ed McBain.  He knew so much about people that he realized he could write in clipped sentences, chapters that revolved like pieces of a kaleidoscope, and his readers would follow him anywhere, because we trusted his instincts.<br /><br />It is a sad day for mystery lovers.  This was a giant who has left us, and we shall not see his like again.  Farewell to the king.	2005-07-08

The play takes up the lives of four sisters, all in late middle age, and the men in their lives.  Cora has been married to Thor (real name Theodore, but the family calls him \\"Thor\\") for many years, but little by little she's feeling squeezed out of her own house due to the constant presence of younger sister Aaronetta, whom they call \\"Arry,\\" who lives with the two of them and asks like she owns the place.<br /><br />Another sister, Ida, has been married to the eccentric Carl.  She's the only one who has children--one boy, Homer Bolton, 40 years old and still a mama's boy who's been engaged to the same poor girl, Myrtle, for thirteen years.  Myrtle's uncomfortable, for she lives in the same town as Homer's family but he's never invited her to meet any of them.  He's not ashamed of her, he's just too involved with his own mother, not in a sexual way of course, but just, he knows that Myrtle will never make him as comfortable as Ida has.<br /><br />The last sister, Esther, is the most beautiful and in some ways the luckiest.  She married very well, to a man called David and they live in the nicest section of town in a beautifully appointed home.  Her problem is that David looks down on her family and won't allow her to visit with them.  To David, the Gibbs sisters are all white trash, low class dopes who will bring down Esther to their level if he lets them.<br /><br />The whole play takes place in the course of one weekend.  It's nicely done and very insightful into the darker corners of the human heart, as well as some amusing humor about small town life.  The girls quote a poem they remember from youth, their father used to recite: \\"Esty's smartest,/ Arry's wildest,/ Ida's slowest,/ Cora's mildest.\\"  Seems like a rotten thing to repeat about your own daughters but that's why some people just go crazy if they stay in the small towns.to recite: \\"Esty's smartest,/ Arry's wildest,/ Ida's slowest,/ Cora's mildest.\\"  Seems like a rotten thing to repeat about your own daughters but that's why some people just go crazy if they stay in the small towns.	2005-07-08

Antin is a master at talking, and these essays were apparently written first as improvisations, then polished over and over till they attain the shine of fine old silver.  He has a way of describing things that make them seem brand new.  His mind skips from one thing to another, exploring their connections, and yet he's light on his feet, like a stone skimming across the surface of a beautiful pond.  His \\"manifesto\\" on postmodern practice turns out to be an account, rather like Mark Twain in comic richness, of himself and his wife trying to buy a bed and not knowing how to select the best one, and the awkwardness of trying out a bed in a furniture store, even with salespeople encouraging you to lie down and get comfortable on their samples.  Never explicitly does he explain how this Jean Kerr type story might be an allegory for postmodernism, but Antin is wise enough to let the tale speak for itself.<br /><br />His memories of figures varied as John Baldesarri and Herbert Marcuse are quite amusing.  Best of all is Antin's line, without the benefit of capital letters, and sentences floating in scraps of phrases like comic book dialogue freed of balloon moorning.  he approximates the free-floating effect of talking to someone who has absolute authority over thinking, and how liberating it is to submit to such a man.  Reading the essays in this book, we long for more of such talk transcription.  Apparently there are many, many more talks waiting for publication, and of course Antin happily is still very much with us planning more.  He calls these talks \\"poems\\" and of course that is his right.<br /><br />My caveat is that he spends too many pages repeating himself on the zaniness and spiritual emptiness of California, and he seems to be patting himself (and his wife, performance artist Eleanor Antin) on the back for bringing culture to San Diego way back when -- in the 1970s.  This thrust seems short-sighted and an insult to San Diego.  However, this is a book for the ages and I expect will bring pleasure to anyone who can get into it.rust seems short-sighted and an insult to San Diego.

The two of tem developed a film production company together, along with Marlon Brando Senior, and this association with one of Hollywood's top stars catapulted Mr. Englund into the world of the big leagues, where he became a film director.  He was also married for a long time to the actress Cloris Leachman, who makes a few cameo appearances in the book but who doesn't seem to have half the affection for Brando that her husband did.  Inevitably rumors arose that Brando and Englund were lovers, and Englund addresses these rumors right away, as though to ward off further contagion.  He discusses an incident that took place when a cop began hassling Brando and Mr. Englund for sitting alone in a parked car off the side of the road.  Usually when men do that, claimed the cop, they are \\"two males having sex.\\"  After they get rid of the cop, they laugh at him on page 20 and then Marlon asks Mr. Englund, \\"Ever done fruity?\\"  Englund says he has nothing against it, just never wanted to do it.  Brando addresses the rumors about himself and Wally Cox, etc.  But Englund doesn't convince the reader that there was nothing sexual in their friendship.  He denies it too much.<br /><br />There's an amusing part where Englund and Leachman are chaperones on Brando's date with Anna Magnani.  Magnani's all over Brando and can't keep her hands off his crotch, and he is terrified of her.  \\"Cloris and I sat upright, like two Grant Wood figures.\\"  In this one instance Brando betrays a fear of women, elsewhere in the book he is the greatest Casanova in the 20th century, and Englund analyzes why in long, admiring paragraphs.  Both Englund and Brando had father problems.  Brando says that as a father, \\"he didn't care.  He was an absentee landlord.\\"<br /><br />Sadly, both men's father difficulties carried over into the next generation.  Brando's daughter Cheyenne killed herself, and his son turned out to be a killer.  In Englund's case, his rebel boy Bryan dies a crack addict after breaking his parents' heart over and over again, while little Max died, not even a teen, of a degenerative muscle disease.  Relating these terrible stories, Englund gives dimension to his portrait.  I found them all very moving.  Perhaps it is because Brando comes off as so selfish and self-absorbed that his fans don't care for this book.  He is so full of himself and throws around his own considerable weight so often you wonder how anyone could put up with him.  As for Englund, he comes off like a man who lived vicariously through the sex exploits of his famous chum, even if it meant kissing his ass for forty years.<br /><br />The most revealing chapter is the one in which Brando wants to raise money by writing a memoir, and he charges Mr Englund with peddling it for him to the big NY publishers.  Englund successfully sells the unwritten book to Harold Evans from Random House for $5,000,000.  The ethics of the situation seem totally out of whack.  Englund can't promise Evans that the book will be good or even written by Brando.  Evans seems star struck.  people wonder what's wrong with publishing, this is a good example of the catastrophic thinking of mainstream publishers.  By the way, Brando had nothing good to say about Evans' wife, Tina Brown, calling her \\"self-promoting\\" and \\"sinister.\\"<br /><br />By the way, Englund directed some great little movies, including one of my alltime favorites SIGNPOST TO MURDER (maybe Joanne Woodward's greatest part).

Other Christie mysteries used the idea of the anonymous letter (such as MURDER ON THE LINKS, one of the early Poirots.)  THE MOVING FINGER is the culmination of Christie's thinking about this topic.  Other Golden Age novels with this device include Carter Dickson's spooky NIGHT AT THE MOCKING WIDOW and, less successfully, Ellery Queen's THE SCARLET LETTERS.  Clouzot's film LE CORBEAU, written around the same time as THE MOVIGN FINGER, is a wonderfully atmospheric thriller, and it has an American remake too.  I suppose they're still making films about the anonymous letter, only now they're anonymous phone calls (like WHEN A STRANGER CALLS or even the \\"Scream\\" trilogy.)<br /><br />Jerry Burton's a bit of a headcsse after seeing action with the RAF and doctors have ordered him to seek surcease from war in sleepy little Lymstock, where nothing has been known to happen for years, and the War seems very far away.  With him as his nurse is his sister Joanna, a sophisticated young thing out of an Evelyn Waugh novel but a woman with a heart of gold and an eye for strays.  Together the Burtons meet up with their fair share of village characters, most of them very well bred.  The doctor, the lawyer, the minister, the banker and their wives and families.  One among them, however, is an insanely calculating killer, and many villagers are receiving obscene anonymous letters which puts the whole village on edge.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Jerry is seeing quite a bit of a young girl, Megan Hunter, who's quite a tomboy in manner, and seeing as though she just got out of school she's awfully young, but then again I suppose Jerry is pretty young too.  Otherwise when you read about the romance that develops between Jerry and Megan there is a bit of pedophilia creeping in, or so it seems to modern eyes.  Joanna finds her own romance with the town's kindly doctor, who hasn't seen a woman quite like Joanna, even up North.<br /><br />The mystery is a corker.  I've read the book several times and I can never guess who it is!  Another thing that always surprises me is the (very late) entrance of Miss Marple.

Murder,	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Murder On Shipboard	Wasn't this book one of those lauded by John Dickson Carr in his 1946 essay THE GRANDEST GAME IN THE WORLD?  Maybe he didn't rank it #1, but it was pretty high up there. I can see why it would appeal to Carr, the master of the locked room mystery.  It's not a locked room crime per se, but it has elements of the impossible about it which made me, a fifteen year old schoolboy when I first read, vow never to set foot on an ocean liner.  Quentin (who also wrote as \\"Patrick Quentin\\") tells the story of the maiden voyage of a liner called the \\"Moderna,\\" like the Titanic supposedly the last word in efficiency, luxury and comfort.  On its decks have gathered a typical lot of suspects, and the action begins when the ship sails into a storm, bound for South America, and some passengers decide to spend the evening playing bridge.<br /><br />The story is told by a young lady, Mary Llewellyn, an impressionable young journalist and newlywed who has left on this voyage without her bridegroom for reasons Patrick whips up out of whole cloth.  This device allows her to write long entries in a diary meant for her husband, Davy, and the conceit is that Q. Patrick is merely editing these letters for publication.<br /><br />By the end of the bridge game, a millionaire lies dead, poisoned, and all have seen the man who gave him the poisoned cocktail.  They know his name--Robinson.  But imagine their shock when it is discovered that no one by that name is registered on the manifest, and no passenger bears his description.  He is a phantom, or else a stowaway.  Mary Llewellyn musters up all her courage to find \\"Robinson,\\" but what she finds instead is the shock of her life.  By the end of the novel several more murders occur, in even scarier circumstances, and Mary's whole psyche is put to the test.  The revelation of Robinson's true identity is one of thpse shockers made popular by Carr, Queen and Chesterton, as all the impossibilities show themselves as indirections thrown up to confuse the passengers by an insanely cunning killer.<br /><br />It's a good novel but oh, so dated!<br /><br />Fans of Agatha Christie's LORD EDGWARE DIES will like this novel, as will fans of the late actress Ruth Draper, the monologuist on whom Christie based one of her most striking creations in LED, for in SS MURDER, Ruth Draper is also the imspiration for one of the suspects, a famed chameleon called \\"Marcia Manners.\\"se the passengers by an insanely cunning killer. <br /> <br />It's a good novel but oh, so dated! <br /> <br />Fans of Agatha Christie's LORD EDGWARE DIES will like this novel, as will fans of the late actress Ruth Draper, the monologuist on whom Christie based one of her most striking creations in LED, for in SS MURDER, Ruth Draper is also the imspiration for one of the suspects, a famed chameleon called \\"Marcia Manners.\\"	2005-07-04

As the subtitle says, these are the horse and the man \\"who changed the world.\\"  And the way they did so is by aligning themselves with the ASPCA and other organizations dedicated to changing the way we think about animals.<br /><br />It is hard to transport ourselves back into the middle of the 19th century and to see animals the way people back then did, but Eichler Rivas puts us there.  It is no accident that novels like BLACK BEAUTY and BEAUTIFUL JOE became best-sellers in the last quarter of the century--it is because they were sponsored, and even shoved down people's throats, by the big humane societies (as Eichler Rivas describes it, both books seem to have been written to order, to shock people out of their ordinary habits of cruelty to animals--horses in the one case, dogs in the other).  These books were the animal counterparts to the abolitionist best-seller UNCLE TOM'S CABIN, written as agitprop to convey social messages, and if they seem clumsy today (though actually all three are strong in construction and in detail) that is to be forgiven I suppose.  The whole \\"back story\\" of the way the novel was used by progressive organizations back then is fascinating, and it makes you wonder if such a feat could be duplicated today.<br /><br />This book, BEAUTIFUL JIM KEY, is filled with different \\"back stories\\" that sort of distract you from the essential unbelievability of the horse's great feats.  At the end of the day, I remain skeptical, not 100 % convinced that a horse COULD be taught all those things.  Because of this nagging doubt (get it--\\"nagging\\"?)

They called her the Fulton Flash because of her great speed, and her ability to sprint took her out of Missouri and catapulted her to the great stages of the world.  Like a comet streaking across the sky she represented the United States in the now legendary Berlin Olympics of 1936, where she appeared in front of Adolf Hitler and, no doubt, gave him a few ruminations about the power and speed of America.  The Olympics were actually far from a rout for Germany, as Kinney Hanson reminds us.  Nowadays we think that because of Jesse Owens and other great Amerucan performances, that Germany had its ass handed to it at the games, but far from it, they actually did very well and Hitler must have been quite proud!  In women's track events, Germany won seven medals, the US only two--both courtesy of Helen Stephens.  Conceivably she could have won more medals, but some events later open to women competitors in later Olympics were closed to them in 1936 (like shotput, at which Stephens was a great champ).<br /><br />Photos show she was an astonishing beauty, with great bones, perhaps a little Amazonian and androgynous.  Some people thought she was a man, and this irked her no end.  She sued LOOK magazine and the funny comeuppance for LOOK she went out on a date with one of LOOK's lawyers.  After several drinks things got hot and heavy.  As the author reports, \\"Helen told her friend Gertrude Webb, 'I had a sense he was trying to find something.  So this ole country girl let him roam around awhile 'til he found what he was lookin' for.  I just wanted to settle it then and there!\\"<br /><br />Nevertheless, Stephens was a lesbian in a homophobic society and stood her ground with dignity and courage.  It was hard for such a woman to 'come out' but inevitably she did, or almost did.  The whole tragedy of women's sports in the twentieth century is a story that Sharon Kinney Hanson tells with distinction and clarity.  She brings all her skills to her on-point account of the apparently intersex sprinter Stella Walsh, killed by a robber's gunfire in 1980, and because of the violent death was subject to an autopsy in Cleveland of all places, which revealed her ambiguous genitalia.  Stella Walsh, one of the greatest Olympic heroines, was one of the closest friends of the Fulton Flash, and her death apparently had great impact on Helen.  I won't reveal any more of the story, except to say, it is an amazing one, the kind that makes you put down the book and just say, \\"Holy Moly.\\"agedy of women's sports in the twentieth century is a story that Sharon Kinney Hanson tells with distinction and clarity.

I appreciate his industry in compiling this record, but he seems totally uncritical of Tucker, and paradoxically this makes me distrust his judgment.  Was she always perfect, always on?  The interesting part comes towards the end of the book when she sinks her money into an ill-fated 1963 Broadway musical version of her life (with music by talk show host and prolific composer Steve Allen), starring someone else as herself, and when the show flops, Fields reports, she is devastated, apparently seeing this as a rejection of herself by the show business she had served with such devotion for so many years.<br /><br />Fields has otherwise dug up a lot of rare material.  Among the most enjoyable items was reading the lyric of Irving Berlin's 1950s salute to her called \\"Song For Sophie.\\"  I don't believe I have ever heard this song and i wonder if it is recorded anywhere.  The lyric is one of Berlin's best and captures his bewildered fascination with the show business behemoth who, like himself, was never afraid to show off his Jewish heritage and to building considerable comedy out of the contrast between their humble roots and their exalted present circumstances.<br /><br />Tucker's movies are good ones, but I've only seen a few, and maybe others have her in larger parts, though I imagine she was hard to cast in the glamorous MGM of the 1930s.  Wish someone would release tthe British 1934 vaudeville backstager they had the foresight to call GAY LOVE--that sounds like a pip.  Until then, we can catch some of her act on DVD and in the US films THOROUGHBREDS DON'T CRY and BROADWAY MELODY OF 1938.	2005-07-02

The accent is on her younger years, and what is what like growing up in Hollywood and New York, the child of a broken home and the daughter of an accomplished, even famous screenwriter.  Quick, impressionistic sketches of a time long gone by intermingle with the author's private reflections on the events she lived through, and some of them she helped create.<br /><br />Fans of the lyricist Johnny Mercer are not going to like the way he comes across in this book, as a poisonous Buddha who apparently hates women and is drunkenly, insanely cruel to a young girl at a \\"sophisticated\\" party.  Talk about a mean drunk!  At the same party the girl is rescued by none other than Humphrey Bogart, who betrays the sensitivity and the thoughtfulness we always \\"knew\\" lurked behind his touch guy image.<br /><br />To me, the greatest disappointment was Johnson's chapter on poet Sylvia Plath, with whom she attended Smith College back in the day.  It's not that Johnson doesn't give a new angle on Plath, for she does (she, Nora, must have been one of those privileged, spoiled rich co-eds whom Sylvia envied, feared and adored), it's only that Plath still manages to elude description properly.  Of all the great Hollywood and Broadway legends whom young Nora knew, isn't it odd that the most provocative and charismatic turns out to be none other than our Sylvia?	2005-07-02

It's so different now that it might as well be a different city, but all of its denizens who are over thirty remember the old days well.  Jonathan Mahler's book goes over some of the same territory as Spike Lee's fantastic movie SUMMER OF SAM (1999) with Adrien Brody and John Leguizamo, and has some of the same feeling, but he adds baseball to the mix in a big way and of course, the piece de resistance, the inside scoop on the big mayoral contest between Koch and Cuomo.  If you like the second volume of Caro's life of LBJ, I think you'll like this book for it has some of the same down to the wire excitement.  However, unlike Caro, there are no real heroes in LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE BRONX IS BURNING, just real people who fight for their lives in real situations.<br /><br />In hindsight it's easy to see why David Berkowitz became the poster boy for everything that went wrong in New York, but back in the day, before we knew who he was, it was a scary time for all of us, not only the women with long hair who were said to be his primary targets.  (Women cut off their hair or wore it up in scarves or turbans, even in the shattering heat.)  Fear of Son of Sam was the other side of the disco experience that reached its glorious peak on the dancefloors of two dozen giant nightspots, of which Studio 54 was the most sought after.  Way up in the Bronx, the Yankees were enduring what seemed to be a giant power contest between ownership, management and a few cocksure players, and yet the string of wins they produced buoyed New Yorkers' feelings as had few other resurgences in baseball.  (Recent Red Sox World Series win is a parallel.)  The streak united a city which had been falling apart almost literally.  For, as Mahler shows, the infrastructure set into place of the physical locations of New York had been seriously neglected since the peak days of Robert Moses, and through the Wagner and Lindsay administrations had been allowed to crumble as though that were natural.  The whole city went Gothic, looked like the ruined abbey of Aleister Crowley's Thelema.<br /><br />Funny to think it took a baseball team to make a city regain its pride, and an ill-conceived and homophobic street slogan, \\"Vote for Cuomo, not the H---\\" to cause the tide to turn in favor of Koch, for once all of the gay activists heard this slur, we bound together and decided that whatever it took, despite our personal reservations about Koch, his politics, and his irritating personality, we would unseat Cuomo and adopt Koch as our boy.dsay administrations had been allowed to crumble as though that were natural.

It gives you confidence to stride out on stage if you know you've prepared something out of \\"VOCAL SELECTIONS FROM SWEET CHARITY BY CY COLEMAN.\\"  I don't know what it is, but it doesn't even matter, no matter what the show, if you can strut your stuff in SWEET CHARITY, you're in like Flynn.  When I was a boy I wore out my old Original Cast LP from the show, and it's a recording that oozes confidence and sass.  Though they used to say that if Jerome Robbins was directing, drop the \\"Sweet Charity\\" material because he hated the show and hated everyone involved with it and if he heard even a few notes of any of the tunes, he'd just have his assistant holler out \\"Next\\" and you were out on the street, pronto.  However for most directors, on the Stem or elsewhere, they most of them respond to the honest human appeal behind the celebrated Coleman-Fields tunes.  \\"Baby Dream Your Dream,\\" \\"I'm the Bravest Individual,\\" and \\"If My Friends Could See Me Now\\" are all examples of what Whitney Houston used to call the greatest love of all, loving oneself, and that's what people go to a show to see.  However, if you're in a more introspective mood, and you're auditioning for some Adam Guettel show or something equally cleak, you might try \\"Where am I going?\\"--it's a number everyone can relate to, because we've all been in those shoes, the time when you wake up in the morning and can't think of a reason to go on living.  In the theater we always say, \\"The Show Must Go On,\\" but the key to remembering how civilians feel is, sometimes the show doesn't have to go on.  That's when a tune like WAIG comes in handy.  Another fiery number, made famous in the original Broadway production by Helen Gallagher, is \\"There's Gotta Be Something Better Than This,\\" which might be the most rock-oriented of all the tunes in the VOCAL SELECTIONS book.  But no matter which one you choose, you're a winner.  The lesson of SWEET CHARITY is that, while you may be only a taxi dancer, and you sell yourself for a dime a dance (or whatever), if you still have belief in yourself and project the right attitude, somebody somewhere will be attracted to you.  It's this attitude which will take you far, for all you have to do is have faith.  When you open up a Playbill and go to the section that had bios of the actors in the show, you'll see that half of them thank God.  Why do you think that is?  With faith on your side you'll get applause on both sides of the footlights!  And from above too!  So don't look down and shout it out:<br /><br />If they could see me now,<br /><br />That little gang of mine,<br /><br />I'm eating fancy chow<br /><br />And drinking fancy wine.<br /><br />An essential item for all working actors, whether you can sing or not (though it helps)!ITY is that, while you may be only a taxi dancer, and you sell yourself for a dime a dance (or whatever), if you still have belief in yourself and project the right attitude, somebody somewhere will be attracted to you.

Young Tomi is living nearby on Oahu Island, the son of a fisherman and a maid to some wealthy white people.  His grandfather lives with them too.  All of them are Japanese and the grandfather especially ios very proud of the fact and hauls the flag up the pole every day.  The big white flag with the giant red dot becomes a symbol of fear and oppression to Tomi's neighbors after the attack, for indeed some of the Japanese planes were emblazoned with that logo.  Graham Salisbury's literary artistry is apparent when he compares the fastball that is Billy's specialty to the blood-red sun high in the sky on the morning of Pearl Harbor.  Billy is a blond friend of Tomi's, not biracial, who shows us that even if we are of different races we can still be pals with each other.<br /><br />The internment of the father and the grandfather is terrifying, and yet it could happen to anyone.  Suddenly, Tomi becomes the enemy, just because of his ancestry, and he is forced to make enough money to support everyone, even though he is only 12 or 13.  Luckily there are enough chickens to sell eggs.  But it is a harrowing time for him, and plus he is faced with the normal problems of being a boy, particularly being bullied by a pugnacious white teen called Keet Wilson--the very boy whose mother used to employ Tomi's mom as her maid.<br /><br />I would like to see this story told by one of Japanese descent as I expect such an author would have a very different perspective on the struggle of suspicion that set the groundwork for World War II and America's involvement in it.  Graham Salisbury is an artist of the pen, but I did not feel his heart in this book unlike some of his other modern masterpieces.  If there are any kids reading this review, I hope that you will also check out EMPIRE OF THE SUN to see what it was like for ordinary boys and girls who got caught up in the big war in the Pacific.N to see what it was like for ordinary boys and girls who got caught up in the big war in the Pacific.	2005-06-30

The Story of Oklahoma!: A Celebration of America's Most Beloved Musical (Applause Books)	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Oklahoma, Okay	This is the kind of book that used to excite me, books all about the Broadway musical.  Has there ever been a musical with as much to offer as OKLAHOMA?  It wasn't always a surefire hit, for before it began, people thought, oh well, this is a pretty slow show, no girls, no big numbers, and livestock on the stage.  The powerful imagination of Oscar Hammerstein II caught that cornsilk and lit it on fire with the poetry of his lyrics.  Who can ever forget \\"All the cattle are standing like statues.\\"  Mr Max Wilk evidently knows his OKLAHOMA and he has had great luck tracking down OKLAHOMA memorabilia.  There are ticket stubs, photos of people watching the show, and the memories of those who first went to Broadway's \\"St James Theater\\" in March 1943 and made theatrical history.<br /><br />Richard Rodgers had been a topnotch Broadway composer for twenty years or more before OKLAHOMA but for one reason or another his music never really got under the skin of the mass US public.  He had been partnered with the divinely talented Lorenz Hart for most of that time, and perhaps Hart had been caviare to the general?  At any rate it took Oscar Hammerstein to begin Rodgers' incredible parade of shows with a heart.  Rodgers wanted Charlotte Greenwood to play Aunt Eller but she was so busy she didn't get to play the part until the movie version many years later.  (And she was great at it, still doing her trademark kicks with her elastic legs.)  American soldiers in New York made the show a hit.  Those hard men would sit in the back rows of the St James and weep like babies for love of the great land.  In London, too, when OKLAHOMA travelled there, American soldiers sold out house after house, for when you're an American GI overseas there's nothing like a heaping dose of \\"We know we belong to the land\\" and the attending flagwaving.<br /><br />Wilk has it all on the ball, including the circumstances that led to the hiring of Agnes de Mille, top choreographer, to do the dances and ballets for this groundbreaking show.  She was a strange creature, half magnet, half steel, but she brought something original to the Broadway stage, and her best dances have a unique poetry distilled out of a particular time and space.

Beany learns not to be selfish by meditating on the predicament of her friend, brave, spunky Rosellen Kern, confined since childhood to a wheelchair by polio.<br /><br />The novel, by Denver's Lenora Mattingly Weber, has been loved by generations for its true-to-life portrayal of classic teenage situations: the desire to be special vs the desire to be part of the in crowd.  Beany is an endearing creation and in fact one of the greatest characters ever created by an American author.  At first you can't believe you're reading a book about a girl called \\"Beany,\\" it's sort of sickening.  But Weber's power as a writer is vast, and before long you're dying to find out what will happen next to Beany (born Catherine Cecilia Malone) and her extended family.  She is the motherless daughter of an important Denver columnist, Martie Malone, the champion of the little people, a man who raises hell all over the nation; a fond father, but one who's rather cavalier about his own four children who often need help at home, help they can't get from their \\"on-again, off-again, gone-again father.\\"  From Martie Beany learns many important lessons about being true to yourself, about the greatest love of all.  Her oldest sister Elizabeth waited for her man to come back from the war and when he did, it was with a shattered body, and Elizabeth and the rest of the Malones had to help Don mend his tattered spirit and face the long, hard grueling rehabilitation process.  Another sister is the psychology major Mary Fred, crazy about horses, free to spout advice to others but she can't seem to make sense of her own love life.  Beany's brother is the writer in the family, and the genius, with dark hair that always needs cutting.  He's the absent minded professor type, lost in dreams of Colorado history, but basically good at heart.  The Malones are the kind of family that America is made out of.  They have enormous hearts, love to give, and are quick to take in a stranger and make him or her feel at home.<br /><br />A BRIGHT STAR FALLS is one of the best books in Weber's long running series about the Malone family.

The myth of the lady is immense, but Bradford goes right to primary sources and does his best to correct our misapprehensions about her by pointing out that we know so little first hand about Cleopatra. Some dispute she existed.  Bradford makes no such claim, and he is in a position to know, having spent many years immersed in the lore of the Ptolemies.<br /><br />Cleopatra was the daughter of Ptolemy the XIIth, and I imagine now that I have read Bradford describing their relationship, that he, Ptolemy, was rather like Emma's father in the famous novel by Jane Austen.  He was a garrulous old fool in love with the sound of his own voice, rather pathetic if you looked at him the wrong way, and his daughter probably learned a lot about diplomacy just trying to stay on his good side, just like Emma 1700 years later.  And like Emma, part of her problem was that the tools she had used to deal with a difficult father were not as appropriate when it came time to deal with the adult men in her life.  Emma had Mr. Knightley, but Cleopatra had real rulers to deal with: first Caesar, the playboy prince of the Western world, a man so civilized that he was said to have been bisexual, and then Antony, who was more of a man's man, sort of an Ernest Borgnine type according to Ernle Bradford's clever summing up of the man.  Cleopatra had children by both of them, but neither of them could totally trust her, just as her father could not bring himself to be close to her, preferring to play merrily on his flute all day while slaves fanned him with ibis feathers.<br /><br />At eighteen she was already a queen, and as we know, her life was short, tragically short.  Many who knew her from afar judged her harshly, but those who came close to her were enchanted by her beauty and the elegance of her speech.  (Bradford reports that her verbal agility was high, and that she picked up languages with ease.)  We know she had a sense of humor, for who else would have thought about rolling herself up in a carpet to be delivered to Caesar?  So vividly does Bradford bring these movers and shakers to life that by book's end we forget they are not our own intimates.  As Shakespeare said, \\"Precious friend, hid in death's dateless night.\\"  And that's where she is now, hid in death's dateless night where she gains not in age nor loses a drop of her mortal beauty.had a sense of humor, for who else would have thought about rolling herself up in a carpet to be delivered to Caesar?

Bad, because it was the beginning of World War II and so many Americans, particularly in the midwest, had suffered enough in the first world war that they bitterly opposed US entry into the War until the day that Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and isolationism became a thing of the past.  Still that change from opposition to the war to a full-scale call for vengeance must have been a bewildering one for the little people of the midwest, and they showed it in the incidents that led to establishing the North Platte Canteen.<br /><br />Bob Greene has always had a soft spot for the little person, and he has two sets of them here--the GI boys who passed through North Platte on their way to God knows where, some of them never to return to our shores.  The kindness done to these boys at the station might have been the last friendly voices they heard before death.  And on the other side, a gallant band of townspeople and farmers--traditional enemies--put aside their differences and started carving up pheasant to make sandwiches the likes of which most of these soldiers never tasted before.  Greene underplays the generosity of these Nebraskans, for my grandmother, who lived in the town during the war, always maintained that the food and coffee wasn't just for soldiers, but for anyone who they felt like giving it out to.  She was present at the station when one cup of coffee, given to a pregnant lady passing through Nebraska, triggered her labor there on the north side of the station, and she gave birth to a baby an hour afterwards.  The sad thing, grandma said, is that the baby was born without a father, for he had died in the Leyte Gulf and the mother was travelling to go live with his folks in Denver.<br /><br />Those were the good old, bad old days all right, and Greene's book, while repetitious, is nevertheless valuable.  A few more years and most of the first person participants of the \\"Miracle of the Pheasants\\" will be stilled forever.

The two animals are drawn with verve and their adventures transpire in a blaze of green and pink 50's inspired decor, though they have a hip-hop twist to their vocabulary speak which appeals to the young.  I tried this book out with four kids of different races and all enjoyed watching the sock monkeys cavort to their own party; even the one little girl who spoke no English at all, laughed out loud at the two monkeys, Rocko and Spanky, hugging each other as tightly as they could, perhaps reminding the little girl of her childhood in Cambodia.<br /><br />Kara LaReau should receive the Newbery Award for her work on this book.  Farfetched?  Not when you consider she was instrumental in securing a Newbery award for BECAUSE OF WINN-DIXIE.  Her little creations have all the appeal of Curious George PLUS the animals of BABAR, lacking only the unique charm of the first and the majesty of the second.  The Newbery, in case we forget, went to Hugh Lofting the Dr Doolittle author, so it is not out of the range of possibility to suggest that Rocko and Spanky deserve it too.  And if the author gets an award, I vote also that we give one to sister Jenna, whose illustrations prove one more time the truth of the old adage, that you can throw everything but the kitchen sink into your drawings, but if there isn't heart there, than you have nothing.  And she has heart to burn!<br /><br />Check out the drawings of Rocko on skates or behind the wheel of his miniature Vespa.  He's an excitable boy!  Stand clear, here comes Rocko.

194766:US	46134316	R3ANBVKTT6H8VP	0306808404	635715063	The Complete Tales Of Washington Irving	Books	5	31	37	N	N	A Spicy Brew	Some give the sheaf to Charles Brockden Brown but I far prefer the mellow stylings of Washington Irving, the sage of Tarrytown.  When I was a boy I was introduced to this splendid body of work by one of my grade school teachers, a collateral relative of Washington Irving, a man who hailed from upstate New York and who carried in his bloodlines some of the authentically spooky platelets of colonial America.  During the Napoleonic period the US was not necessarily a pretty place to live in, and Irving's famous story THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN shows us some of the dark underbelly of American life.  You really weren't safe out of your own good, and at night travel was even more dangerous.  Plus, as anyone who's read the story of Ichabod Crane knows, people were just as prone to jeer and mock the funny-looking as they are today.  The story is heartbreaking on two levels, the naturalistic and the symbolic.  We all know someone like Ichabod Crane, and many of us find ourselves mirrored in his lonely gaze and terrifying gallop through Hessian country.  Irving, like Hawthorne, wrote out many of his tales swearing they were as \\"his grandfather told him,\\" and thus they are set in a period before his own, a misty place of the past that he knew how to make terrifyingly real and relevant.<br /><br />My teacher also reminded us that Washington Irving was a very cultured man who believed, like Johnny Appleseed, in planting America with the fruits of other, older lands, so that among his stories you will find some from Europe, re-told to make them apropos and socially relevant for the rawness of a new world.<br /><br />For horror and fright Washington Irving has few rivals, and the bonus is an added richness as of old apples carpeting a winter meadow, and thus this book, edited by a Twain expert, smells like spicy cider on New Years Eve; lots of good cheer along with your ghosts.	2005-06-22
196825:US	46134316	R36E6Q2Z38GK99	0758206607	404331519	The Gold Digger's Guide: How To Marry The Man And The Money	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Spicy and Entertaining	I like the way Rich makes herself into some kind of paragon of good taste, drawing the curtains of wealth over a shady past.  \\"Ivana B. Rich\\" is a cute pun for a gold-digger's name, but it shows that she (if it is a \\"she\\") is slightly ashamed of having written this book and feels pressure to use a pseudonym.  Hmmm, I wonder where the pressure comes from.  Possibly from her soul within?<br /><br />However it is not for us to judge why people write the books they do.  I have found this book useful myself, even though I am neither a woman nor an African-American.  Nor do I have the sort of money it would take for readers of THE GOLD DIGGER'S GUIDE to identify me as a suitable target for their campaign.  And yet, when all is said and done, it is a fabulously entertaining read with real thought for the community.  For example, Rich advocates spending your husband's money on social projects--not just \\"socialite projects\\"--but things that will help improve the living standard of all, not just you.<br /><br />It's a book that advocates having respect for yourself, and yet the author gives herself not even the respect of using her real name for this spicy read.  You wouldn't want to have this book lying open on the coffee table when your date comes up in his town car to pick you up, nor would you want it to fall out of your bag accidentally during intimate moments.  Not even exposed on your bookshelf, for it would betray your mercenary nature to the one man you're trying to fool.  Even if he is one whom you love.	2005-06-21

It was absolute heaven.\\"  Moffat wrote his memoirs out by hand in a series of notebooks, and one of them has disappeared, so the book takes an awfully big jump right at an exciting part, and we land down again ten years later.  Gavin Lambert, the novelist and biographer, fills in the gaps in his own way.  Lambert knew Moffat himself, and also interviewed many of the survivors: people who had known him from all walks of life.<br /><br />If you have recently read THE OTHER CHEKHOV, the biography of acting coach Michael Chekhov, and you've been curious about Darlington Hall, the experimental British art and drama school at which Chekhov worked, you will find a lot more of it in ABSOLUTE HEAVEN, for Ivan Moffat was a student there, and very close to Beatrice Straight and her family (the patrons of the hall).  I found Moffat's late in life passion for Caroline Blackwood very touching, and the realization at the end of his life that he was actually the father of Caroline's daughter Ivana is wonderfully told and imagined.  Another fine section details his work with the Hollywood director George Stevens on the US Army filmmaking unit that travelled and filmed everything they could from D-Day to Auschwitz to Stalingrad.  Talk about high adventure!<br /><br />The mystery that remains is the unevenness of Moffat's artistic production.  After the war, his work with Stevens on the scripts of GIANT, SHANE, and A PLACE IN THE SUN is exemplary, and Lambert mounts a welcome defense of THEY CAME TO CORDURA and the ill-fated BHOWANI JUNCTION that makes you want to see these pictures once again.  And yet, at the end of the day, Moffat remains fairly opaque, as though his life had been led at such a clip there was no time for him really to make any sense out of it, especially in the painted bungalows of Hollywood and the traffic lights of the Sunset Strip.  This isn't Gavin Lambert's masterpiece (that would probably be THE GOODBY PEOPLE) but in some ways it feels closer to autobiography than Lambert's own memoir pieces do.  He is always a writer worth reading and one of the only living writers whose hand I would like to shake.sense out of it, especially in the painted bungalows of Hollywood and the traffic lights of the Sunset Strip.

197534:US	46134316	R2AI9YFWT7T37Y	0375501339	242686917	Too Brief a Treat: The Letters of Truman Capote	Books	4	13	14	N	N	Too Much Of A Good Thing	I always loved Truman Capote's writing and looked forward to this book oh, so much, especiallywhen I saw it was edited by the estimable Gerald Clarke, who has written so brilliantly on Capote in his biography (and who also wrote GET HAPPY, a terrific life of Judy Garland).  (Hmmm, he must specialize in the tiny.)<br /><br />But alas Capote's letters just aren't as good as his fiction.  They seem hurried, scattered, as though he were writing too fast to revise, everything exactly the opposite of what one likes about the stories and filmscripts.  I will say you do get a different side of him, and the outlines of his social world become clearer, so view this compilation as an addendum to the biography, and you won't go far wrong.<br /><br />I was surprised to see him make so much of (i.e. flatter) Cecil Beaton, it sounded phony.  It seems that he treated Newton Arvin pretty well all things put together.  Some have said that he \\"used\\" Arvin to get ahead and then dumped him once he had found a measure of his own success.  But Arvin can't have been an easy guy to live with IMHO.  Another interesting correspondent is William Goyen.  I think the best letter in all of TOO BRIEF A TREAT is Capote's letter congratulating Goyen on the achievement of THE HOUSE OF BREATH.  That letter, in the perfection of its phrases and the conviction of its rapture, is alone worth the price of the book.  It's a shame that Goyen later turned on Capote and treated him so shabbily.  Good for Gerald Clarke for pointing this out.<br /><br />Meanwhile the good news for Capote fans is that his novel SUMMER CROSSING, about which many of the letters to Bob Linscott are devoted, has been recovered and now, fifty-plus years later, it might be seeing the light of day.  In the interim we will re-read these letters, hoping to scan in more data on the terrific catastrophe that was Truman Capote's life.	2005-06-20

Take Twain's Connecticut Yankee--a bold storyline that reinforced Gilded Age stereotypes while ostensibly criticizing them as being inferior to the medieval faith that gave King Arthur's Court its reason for being.  Barth takes Twain's message and stands it on his head.  His protagonist, Simon Behler, approaches Sri Lanka but, like the man in the old joke, the closer he gets to it the further away it seems, and instead he winds up stuck in what appears to be his own \\"Orientalist\\" fantasy of Baghdad and its environs six hundred years ago, when Sinbad and the other so-called Arabian Nights were being composed from the scraps and orts of court and peasant life.<br /><br />Behler finds this world to be a disorderly screen for his memories of ordinary life.  No longer a young man, the whole progress of his life back home comes back to him in perfectly realized fragments, almost worthy of Sherwood Anderson, and we begin to realize that the novel is being staged around the age-old questioning of, what is more valuable--\\"home\\" or \\"away,\\" the comfort of the familiar versus the thrill of the unseen.<br /><br />The female characters leave a lot to be desired, but at this stage in the game, Barth is not even trying to pretend he has any feminist sympathies.  His day in the sun happened years ago, but this testament of a man's \\"last voyage\\" has a bittersweet texture, like taking chocolate from an Iraqi baby.  If you are enjoying the new bestseller by Umberto Eco, THE MYSTERIOUS FLAME OF QUEEN LOANA, you owe it to yourself to check out this predecessor, which employs many of the same devices although more clumsily.	2005-06-20

Just listing the books of Mackenzie, who wrotes dozens and dozens, would tire me out, and Dooley shows every sign of having read many of them and being able to see their merits and demerits in a fair, equable, and inviting way.<br /><br />He makes a case for THE FOUR WINDS OF LOVE, Mackenzie's epic million-word \\"roman fleuve\\" in seven parts, suggesting that we overlook this huge period piece to our diminishment, and it certainly made me want to read all seven volumes for the first time.  The old chestnuts like SYLVIA SCARLETT, CARNIVAL and SINISTER STREET get their share of criticism, and I love the part where Dooley reprimands Mackenzie for having taken so much from Thomas Hardy--the wrong parts.<br /><br />As he reminds us, Mackenzie was also a funny writer and some of his stories, like WHISKY GALORE, seem as though they will outlive his more heavy-handed psychological studies.  Very little of Mackenzie's work is available in the USA today, and Dooley acknowledges this, suggesting that a revival might happen at any moment.  I don't think so, although the UK TV show MONARCH OF THE GLEN is loosely based on one of Mackenzie's \\"Scottish novels.\\"	2005-06-20

It all seems so unimportant, as the beautiful doctor Eva says, who killed Pasha Ivanov, or indeed any one person, when thousands of lives are being destroyed by the radiation of the meltdown.  The book begins on a high note, on a picture as evovative as bygone crime stories by Ellery Queen or GK Chesterton--the closet door that opens up onto a small mountain of salt--some echoes there as well of THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE?  It  wouldn't be an Arkady Renko novel without our hero feeling completely rejected and dumped on and trying to find a reason for living.  In this book the chief prosecutor hates him and he gets reassigned to Chernobyl for his pains.<br /><br />The simple classicism of the opening \\"salt\\" gambit changes into a  weird, misshapen, and rambling narrative that has analogues to the way radiation poisoning has changed the lives of everyone in the \\"Zone of Exclusion.\\"  Renko stumbles into a love triangle, and the divorced couple Alex and Eva become the most important characters of the book, their sexual sparks still flying even though they have been estranged, and even though Eva is obviously intrigued by Renko's thoroughness.<br /><br />Though Bobby Hoffman, an American grifter, has a large part to play in the story, I skipped just about everything to do with him.  Think of Philip Seymour Hoffman when you read about this character: his mopiness and his eccentricity are written in letters large enough for all to see.  Often enough Cruz Smith seemed to be straining for effects, but I realize he was taking on a challenge bigger than any he had faced in the previous four Renko books, for the scope of the nuclear disaster seems almost to paralyze his storytelling skills.  By the book's end a new family has coalesced, and instead of being pleased that some of the book's characters have achieved a kind of redemption, this reader turns away, a little unsatisfied, feeling that the author has cheated by pulling punches so that Renko can come away from the Ukraine with a new purpose in life.eling that the author has cheated by pulling punches so that Renko can come away from the Ukraine with a new purpose in life.	2005-06-20

But after reading this book I don't think this dude is the same man who wrote SHIRTS AND SKINS and other gay performance scripts.  This book is a good one too, and I read it through from cover to cover, pausing to admire the many mint photographs.  The book is lavishly illustrated with a lot of wire photos and close ups of important moments in stock car history.  They have access to computer databases and can thus list the exact dollar amount won by their profiled drivers through all of recorded history (extra money is earned, of course, through private endorsements and these do not appear in the \\"career earnings\\")<br /><br />Tim Miller and Steve Milton do a great job outlining the history of NASCAR and how it grew from a tiny, low class racing circuit to the largest business in the world today.  The cover says it all, three top drivers covered from head to waist with advertising logos of all kinds of companies.  Bud, Champion, Home Depot, it's a sport in which men dress up as billboards then climb into cars with even more ads on them.  On every page is an ad, but that's just part of the colorful history of NASCAR.  Milton and Miller go into the way NASCAR used to have competitors, but they have since squashed all competition by the power of branding.  Thus such famous drivers of the past as Mario Andretti and AJ Foyt didn't really align themselves with NASCAR at all, though you can bet your bottom dollar they'd do so today.  In the past, Richard Petty held up the NASCAR tradition and singlehandedly made Americans aware of NASCAR as a reputable outfit.  One section of NASCAR NOW profiles the up and coming drivers of tomorrow--the Dale Earnhardts of the future.  LOL, it will be greart sport to keep this book around a few years and see how accurate Milton and Miller are at predicting who will be on top in, say, the year 2005 or 2010.  For all we know, the great driver of the next generation is someone whose name we have not yet heard.<br /><br />Another cool section profiles the NASCAR masters of the past thirty years.  Those were the days befor NEXTEL took over and instead the tobacco industry controlled the advertising, so the big prize was called the WINSTON CUP.  Miller and Milton are sympathetic sportswriters and each has a flair for the winning phrase.  Of Kyle Petty, they write, \\"Petty.  the name resonates around stock car tracks like thunder through a canyon.\\"  Everyone loves a winner and this book has 'em on every page, and the photography is outstanding.

He is the narrator of this short novel, an early work by the famous sea writer Nicholas Monsarrat.  He tells the whole story in the second person, addressing his wife as \\"you,\\" such as, \\"You were wearing a white dress as you made your way through the crowded restaurant where I had booked a table for you and me.\\"  A whole book of this is so tedious.<br /><br />Neither of the characters has a name, an affectation Monserrat must have felt would help his readers imagine themselves as the boy and girl in the story.  They meet, he tells her his two week leave has been cancelled, and instead he has only 24 hours off, and so they decide to basically take things slow and postpone having sex until later in the evening.  Through internal evidence you can sort of figure out that this story is supposed to be taking place in the spring of 1943.<br /><br />They go to see a play, the classic Restoration comedy LOVE FOR LOVE with the inimitable John Gielgud in the lead.  It's a randy sort of play and they are feeling pretty sexed up.  She's wearing a red dress (the first time he's ever seen her in something other than her uniform) and he's in drab khaki.  He's got an erection the size of Big Ben.  She's not a sweater girl like Lana Turner, she's supposedly classy.<br /><br />The songs in the book really take you back: \\"But In The Morning, No\\" . . . \\"It Could Happen To You\\" . . . \\"I'll Be Seeing You.\\"<br /><br />There's a lot of euphemistic sex talk in the book, most of which is pretty unappealing.  The narrator imparts a lot of instructions to his 19-year old bride.  He tells her that although men like to tell smutty jokes, they do not care for women who do the same.  \\"To most men, in fact, nothing is more embarrassing than for a woman to volunteer an indecent joke, as a matter of casual conversation, or to show herself ready to initiate that kind of session.  Her ability to express herself, if necessary, as coarsely and succinctly as a man, is occasionally attractive; it can, at the right moment of exhilaration, be amusing, but she should await his lead all the time.\\"  The book has an attractive pink dust jacket with Cupid on it, but the designer has shot the cover full of holes stamped in with a punch die, so it looks as though Cupid has been shot to pieces.  It's an attractive looking book, but totally condescending within.

That's because there must be more than 20,000 pages, some of them quite dense and technical, and most of it is out of date.  But I will say that anyone interested in probing the mysterious death of Pat Tillman has got to read the 2002 COMPLETE GUIDE TO OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM.  Did you know that they were going to call this revenge mission Operation Infinite Justice?  That would have been a laugh.  As it is, it's not a name that will go down in history for euphony or realism.  The 2002 guide packs a punch, showing how George Bush rammed the proposal through Congress in October 2001 while Americans were too shell shocked to know what had really happened, and the truth is, as these documents reveal, we still don't really know what happened, and we never will, either.  Operation Enduring Freedom was supposed to promote the cessation of terrorist activities in Afghanistan, and it included dropping lots of leaflets across the high deserts and mountains of that far away land.  Many of these leaflets are reproduced in this handy guide, however, the context is missing so it's hard to gauge what kind of reaction General Franks expected to elicit from the ordinary Afghan man on the street with these bizarre flyers.<br /><br />My hat is off to the brave men and woman soldiers who went there and met their deaths through danger.  It now seems clear that Pat Tillman died not through enemy fire nor the operations of Al Qaeda, but he died of fratricide which the Army tried to cover up.  In a way I don't blame them, but still it's discouraging when your own country lies to you and I expect his family are still in a state of shock, especially his brother Kevin who is still in Afghanistan last I heard.  Though this 2002 COMPLETE GUIDE is out of date, and runs out of steam long before the timeline in which Tillman left football and joined the Armed Services, you don't have to read between the lines to see that \\"friendly fire\\" has been a huge problem in Operation Enduring Freedom.  When will it end?  Though the Taliban was removed from power by March 2002, anti-American forces still contend with our troops on a daily basis.

Alas, what they have done is to suggest that the book has more of a fun quotient than it actually does.  I was looking forward to lounging back in the hammock and reading it, but soon it became apparent that this was going to be a book of rigorous scholarship and highly defined parameters.  On that level, it succeeds, and I learned a lot about summer stock that I never knew.  I found out the back stories of upwards of two dozen American summer stock theaters in the 1920 period.  I found out the economics of summer stock and why other countries with a theatrical traditin have never developed such a system.<br /><br />Martha Schmoyer LoMonaco is good at describing how and why an entire theatrical phenomenon started all across the USA at roughly the same time.  I know now that summer stock existed to entertain the newly minted upper middle class families who could for the first time afford an extended summer vacation.  It was like reading a treatise by Marx come to life and wearing the giddy costumes of a Bert Lahr.  We find out that some stars were guaranteed as much as $10,000 a week to appear at provincial locations and that some stars were known for their drawing power (Ethel Barrymore, Helen Hayes, Edward Everett Horton).  I had never before realized what a super box office draw E. E. Horton must have been in his day.  Schmoyer LoMonaco awards him the title of \\"godfather of the summer stock movement.\\"<br /><br />She shows how different the real thing was than the Gene Kelly-Judy Garland movie of the same name.  An exhausted professionalism, not a breathless amateurism, was the hallmark of this movement.  Few original musicals were actually developed, and the summering masses were fed a steady diet of light comedies, romances and thrillers.  She outlines the changes that went into effect once the actors became unionized, and what happened when a star travelled with his or her own company of repertory players, perhaps adding one or two locals to fill in, badly rehearsed if rehearsed at all, with the visiting actors.  After all, they were usually changing their productions once weekly.  Some actors wound up having to milk cows and clean manure, but it was all for the sake of the theater.  The illustrations are superb, with several nice photos of the Jitney Players famous portable truck stage, which could be parked, then taken apart, then extended into a multilevel stage with curtains and lighting, in about an hour.  The problem with the book is not that it's inaccurate, but it's dry.  Maybe the author had too much information to impart.  Marian Seldes contributes a foreword that suggests the book you are about to read is a treasure trove of sparklers.  It's not.  But it's not bad and you will learn plenty.nes the changes that went into effect once the actors became unionized, and what happened when a star travelled with his or her own company of repertory players, perhaps adding one or two locals to fill in, badly rehearsed if rehearsed at all, with the visiting actors.

Until I opened the book the name of Brian Desmond Hurst would have rung only the dimmest of bells, but apparently he was a figure of renown in the British film world of the 1940s and 1950s, and had a hand in dozens of films, most of them unreleased this side of the Atlantic, and you get the picture he was no Carol Reed over there.  (He did discover Roger Moore.)  But he was the funniest raconteur you'll ever read about, and we are lucky that young Christopher Robbins was right there catching all the quips and the bonhomie, and that he wasn't too shocked by the older man's rapacious homosexuality to write it all down for posterity.  I haven't laughed out loud reading a book all year, and this one had me doubled over, nearly in pain.  On every page you'll find something to cherish, and something to remember.<br /><br />Some parts have the glory of utter bad taste.  Teasing Michael Redgrave about his penchant for bondage (of a particularly painful sort), Desmond Hurst explains to Christopher, \\"There are a few in jokes about Sir Michael in our circle.  'Sir Michael Redgrave, I'll be bound!' and 'Sir Michael is unable to come to the phone now, he's all tied up.'  Do you understand?\\"  Christopher though straight-identified shares his patron's love of gossip and scandal.  Besides naming names, Robbins also plays discreet and shrouds some of his best stories as blind items.  He doesn't reveal the identity of the popular star with a drug problem that made him impossible to work with, but he gives you lots of clues.  The name \\"Richard Dreyfuss\\" springs to mind.<br /><br />Beyond the fun and the frivolity, there's a lot of heart in the book.  Hurst's memories went way back, to childhood in Belfast, the city where much of the Titanic was built.  \\"Brian's father proudly took him to see the great ship launched.  'When the news came back of the ship's sinking, a tidal wave of grief struck Belfast.

It made me wonder why, why leave out the enchanting figure of Marina, the only one in Zhivago's world who was as faithful to him as a dog is to his master, one who was there at the beginning<br /><br />Maybe they thought that audiences were already being asked to swallow too much.  Yurii Andreievich had married Tonia already, and had Sasha with her, and then the good doctor had found himself madly in love with Lara.  That tragic romance ended badly and then Yuri finds himself completely without friends or family and he stumbles, like a bum, back into the life of Marina.  I guess the filmmakers thought that they were painting Lara and Uri to have the greatest love of all time, so where did Marina fit in?  Anyone who's read the book knows that Marina's love for Yuri was stronger by far than the crazy, tender, adulterous love of Lara.  Zhivago is such a good poet that Tonia, Lara and Marina are all aquiver when he draws near them.<br /><br />Marina is more mature (when she re-encounters Yuri) and it's hard to imaghine what actress of the mid-60s would have best been able to essay her character--had Lean and Bolt been more faithful to the novel and included the Marina-Yuri story in it.  She is a woman whom time has touched, but lightly, and she has seen the ravages of the Revolution first-hand, while still remaining touched and open to the possibilities of new love.  If they could have gotten her, Audrey Hepburn would have been a good choice, sort of the Audrey Hepburn of ROBIN AND MARIAN and TWO FOR THE ROAD.  Another performance that comes to mind is Claudia Cardinale in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST--women who have lived and suffered and whose spirit still flames and seeks the higher ground.  But perhaps Hepburn and Cardinale were too beautiful (or glamorous) and Pasternak wanted us to find the beauty in a plainer woman.<br /><br />The book is a very different experience than the movie; structured as a poem, the novel moves laterally from time period to time period, while individual associations link disparate stories.  We remember that Pasternak was writing about characters of another generation than his own, and that he had already seen the death of Stalin and the public demolition of the dictator's relationship, when he published his novel at last.  As a boy he had dreamed of becoming a musician, and it is said that he aped Scriabin in his earliest works.  Certainly some of Scriabin's theories of synaesthesia carry over into the marvelously sensual passages of ZHIVAGO, where everything--smells, tastes, the pressures of flesh and flesh--all blend into image.ind the beauty in a plainer woman. <br /> <br />The book is a very different experience than the movie; structured as a poem, the novel moves laterally from time period to time period, while individual associations link disparate stories.

Perhaps the work was too local or difficult?  As though in reparation, Hughes delivers here her most accessible book yet and takes a direction that proves a violent swerve into the heated-up roleplaying games pioneered by Anne Sexton, the Boston poet of the 1960s and 1970s who was, as it happens, one of Sylvia Plath's friends and competitors.  In WAXWORKS, Hughes imagines a gallery filled with wax versions of mythological, fictional and real people (and a few animals!) whose very names have become bywords: Sisyphus, for example, and Sweeney Todd.  Some of them you may not have heard of: Honos, for example, was a new one to me, as was Sawney Beane, the Scots cannibal bandit.  (Honos was \\"the Roman personification of morality, truth, and virtue,\\" according to Frieda's careful notes.  Say, maybe that where we got the word \\"honest\\" from!)  The poems that accompany these tags vary in quality, unfortunately some of them are very lackluster, while even the most successful ones suffer from Ms. Hughes' lack of imagination.<br /><br />There are obvious analogues not only to Anne Sexton but to Robert Browning as well, his monologues collected in such classic volumes as MEN AND WOMEN and DRAMATIS PERSONAE.  Hughes is vigorous and has cast her net wide, drawing in such figures as Houdini, Cinderella, Salome, Vlad the Impaler, and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse--enough characters to populate a whole new saga by Anne Rice--but somehow the essences of these figures get left behind, and she comes up empty handed.  That said, some of the verse is singularly lovely, such as these lines, from \\"Loki\\":<br /><br />There is nothing like a little sin<br /><br />To encourage the welcome of converts.<br /><br />I imagine this book is a necessary step that Ms. Hughes had to take to free herself from what must be the stifling influences of her famous mom and dad.  It is another milestone in the story of a very good writer whom we all feel we have, in some sense, known since she was a very young and very innocent and endangered child.It is another milestone in the story of a very good writer whom we all feel we have, in some sense, known since she was a very young and very innocent and endangered child.	2005-06-08

Either that, or they aren't doing a very good job letting the people know about her new release.  It has been five years since Thalia Field's first book and the mob has gotten hungry since then.  Like the little boy said to his grandma in the movie theater, \\"Look Grandma, there's one poor lion up there hasn't got a Christian!\\"<br /><br />That's how I have felt ever since Point and Line came out and momentarily quashed my hunger for more of Thalia Field's innovative fictions.  It has been a long hungry haul since 2000, but intermittently, here and there, if you kept your eyes peeled to the little magazines, you might have stumbled on a piece by her.  There was one in the Chicago Review, another in Fence.  Influential places like that.  Now finally a whole book and it's been available for awhile.  Well you could have knocked me over with a feather.  Luckily a friend of mine who works with Ms. Field sent me this book to celebrate an important life occasion.  Otherwise I'd still be hungry.  The book begins with one of her best stories so far, the life of her name, with a clever pun on \\"Field,\\" as though it were some of Charles Olson's Field research, based on (what seems like) some painstaking research into different sites in the USA called \\"Thalia.\\"  It's a challenging tour de force and it comes to an end at the perfect place, more of an achievement than that sounds in this age where everything goes on for a beat too long.  Field has what amounts to a perfect ear when it comes to laying down the ground rules for her piece (whatever it is at the moment) and then breaking them slightly when she needs to, and then letting the inner form of the story dictate its conclusion.  Similarly, another important \\"autocartography\\" story, one called \\"Feeling Into Motion\\" takes up the knotty issue of the USA's relation to Alaska: signed, sealed, and delivered, who were the plotters who delivered this vast Indian land into our hands?  Field shows us in little steps, what happens to a nation when its leaders secede.  She is half a poet, half a seer, and huge chunks of her mind belong to history and to the commission of mercy.<br /><br />I have one bone to pick and that is with her publisher.  I address my concluding remarks to New Directions press.<br /><br />New Directions, you were the people who went whole hog for Robert Duncan when he had the looney idea to print big chunks of GROUND WORK exactly as they looked coming off his Olivetti.  You went the extra mile for him, and yet for Thalia Field you force her to print her important poem, STORY MATERIAL, *sideways* just because its lines are too long to accommodate your miniature size page widths.  Boy, does that look cheap.  New Directions, you were once the estimable press people longed to publish with, now you're making them look silly amateurs.  And what is up with continuing to print, on the copyright page, the words, \\"New Directions Books are published for James Laughlin.\\"  Didn't he die, like, a long long time ago?  Oh well, they're still printing \\"Dear Abby\\" and \\"Ann Landers too,\\" it's just branding I suppose.  Thanks anyhow for publishing such a fine book!ivered this vast Indian land into our hands?

Books	4	1	1	N	N	Good Training Tool	EXCUSES, EXCUSES, EXCUSES may be one of the most important training tools for all of your employees.  They don't have to be the ones on the \\"front lines,\\" people manning the phones or e-mail contacts for customer service.  Doane and his partner, Rose Sloat, have diagnosed the problem of faulty customer service and they accurately see it as a pandemic that proceeds from the top down.  Let's face it, if your CEO could care less about customer service, none of your customers are going to find you have made it a priority.  That's why this book may actually turn the tide in a beleaguered industry.<br /><br />Everyone wants to be shown a little respect.  We've all been through situations in which, for one reason or another, we have been treated badly and we would like redress.  As Doane and Sloat point out, this happens in our personal lives as well.  Customers return to sites of commerce where they have been recognized as human, interpellated and really \\"seen,\\" sometimes for the first time.  However we all have our excuses for why we really didn't go the whole nine yards for our customers.  And one of them might well be, \\"It is not our company policy to please our customers.\\"  Let's face it, there are many organizations, even service organizations, in which customers are not as important as, say, overhead or bottom-line profitability.  And the short-sighted cost-cutters often argue that \\"we don't really need customer service because they're going to buy from us anyhow.\\"<br /><br />Wrong!  That's just another excuse, in the finely tuned analysis of Canton, Ohio-based educators Darryl Doane and Rose D. Sloat.  Their book is by turns hard-hitting and sort of humorous, with many a doleful anecdote.  It reads very easily.  It could have been a bit longer I think.  But hopefully they will have a sequel of sorts coming out through their innovative \\"Learning Service\\" family of experiences.  Listen to these two.  They have been there, on both sides of the fence, and they know of whereof they speak.of whereof they speak.	2005-06-08

He wound up with a chestful of medals (27) and a burnt-out shell of a man, returning to the US, a girl spat on him.  One thing led to another and Thomas began questioning his own claims to his life.  It wasn't until he met the famous Vietnamese sage, Thich Nhat Hanh, that he began to get a clue as to his spiritual path.  Through mindfulness he became aware that he was a victim of Vietnam just as we all were, and just as generations unborn during the war continue to suffer from its political and cultural fallout.  Today he is a Zen priest and has written an interesting memoir.<br /><br />Like Claude AnShin Thomas, when we saw Thich Nhat Hanh we burst into tears on the spot.  And not because of any identification with his pain.  I think I was just feeling emotional that day.  Thomas has an amazing story to tell, but it is not all that well written, and has many Buddhist cliches that spoil the thrust of the tale for me.<br /><br />And could they have picked a scarier looking portrait of Claude AnShin Thomas for the cover?  I've seen him in person, he isn't that bad looking, he has sort of the look of Nelson Rockefeller, you know, not a matinee idol, but not a face from Creature Features either.  I think Shambhala was definitelyu trying to go for the macho market here, making Thomas look like he was a serial killer come out of the shadows to slit your throat then creep away.  We know that Buddhism can sometimes be a dangerous practice, for you're standing in the middle of the fire trying to confront the real, but enough is enough, and this is a kind of visual crime if you ask me.	2005-06-07

We would trudge back and forth with this green book, heavy, knocking at our kneecaps through our bookbags.  Between its covers we learned from Klinck and Watters the main four periods of Canadian literature: the eighteenth century, the pre-Cofederation period, the \\"New Nation\\" and the 20th century.  Perhaps today the editors would include more First Nations people among the writers.  For me, as a schoolboy, the book didn't really start hopping till I read some of Bliss Carman and Archibald Lampman.  And then it moved into high gear with the modernist writers of Canada, including Morley Callaghan, F.R. Scott, A. M. Klein and Dorothy Livesay.  I cried my eyes out over David, a poem by Earle Birney in which two very close male friends go mountain climbing for sport, and the narrator loves David enough to give him the ultimate gift.  I alwaus wished I had a friend who would do for me, what he did for Dave.<br /><br />Robertson Davies seems like a dud stuck in the middle of some cool writers.  He's in love with himself, it's plain to see.  I much prferred Malcolm Lowry, and the Canadian Anthology does not stint in giving a huge chunk of his masterwork UNDER THE VOLCANO.  I also liked George Johnston, the famous Air Force ace of Canada who served in World War II, and his slightly ribald poem called, \\"Elaine in a Bikini.\\"  That mdae the boys sit up a bit it did.<br /><br />Irving Layton, Margaret Avison, Leonard Cohen brought us right up to the present time and it wasn't long before we were identifying with a new, rebellious generation of Canadian poets such as Gwen MacEwen, Jay Macpherson, and D.G.Jones.  It's a shame this book after had to end!  I don't know about the rest of my peers but this book gave me an appreciation for the vastness and breadth of Canada that put me in good stead much later, when finally I crossed the frontier and took my first steps on Canadian soil.

Shallow reasoning eh?  But anyhow a very good friend gave me a copy of Gibson's book for my birthday and so I felt I had to read it.  Well let that be a lesson to me, from now on I will scour the New Yorker looking at all its ads, for this particular book, a cross between a memoir and a novel, turned out to be very good.  I could not put it down, even though I had a zillion other things to do.  I just kept reading as the day wore on and the sun went down and I had to fumble with the lamp to switch it on without diverting my attention from the page.<br /><br />I felt I had to know what was happening with John, and what was up with Alan, and what was going to happen to Wesley once the full dimensions of John's illness became obvious.  It isn't that the plot is so strong, indeed, hardly anything happens, so don't come to this book looking for Clive Cussler style action.  No, it is Gibson's wonderful insight into all the little crazy things we humans do, that make the book so compelling.  I feel not so much as that after reading his book I know Wesley Gibson, but rather that through some magical gift of X-ray vision into the heart, he knows me.<br /><br />I used to live in New York so I'm familiar with the rat race of trying to find somewhere decent to rent.  And who hasn't lived through the misery of having someone die on you; even if you aren't in love with them, it still knocks you on your ass.  With his love of language and his discernment and humility, Wesley Gibson brings all these things right to the surface, the place where the reader and writer extend hands and touch fingertips.	2005-06-06

It was a time for debuts and this film had great casting, Janet as Justice and Tupac as Lucky.  And don't forget the strong showing of Regina King, then a very young lady, now an actress respected by all the world, especially for her more recent parts such as the spurned backup singer in RAY, the Ray Charles Story and she was Will Smith's wife in ENEMY OF THE STATE.  She shines in Poetic Justice as Iesha, the concerned friend of Justice with a boyfriend who can't get it up and boy is she annoyed!  But the best debut of all was made by the young writer Veronica Chambers who wrote this backstage, warts and all gossip bok full of the inspirational activities of young John Singleton, the director of POETIC JUSTICE.<br /><br />Chambers had access where no others dared to go.  She was an editor at PREMIERE magazine and I guess as one of the few black editors in 1992 she got picked to go to the shoot and hang out with Singleton, Tupac, Janet and even august old Maya Angelou (who wrote the poems that Janet's character is supposed to be writing and reciting).  Chambers later, of course, became one of our best loved writers of children's books, young adult novels, and even books for adults, but this must have been one of her favorites because, well, it was like her first baby.  When you read this book now it's sad of course, for Tupac is dead, Janet is in entertainment limbo thanks to white America's outrage over her Super Bowl Show, and Singleton, well, some say he has wasted away his talent making inferior movies.  As Veronica Chambers reminds us, he was the youngest director (not just the youngest black director, the youngest director of any race) ever to be nominated for an Oscar.<br /><br />Spike Lee writes an affectionate foreword to Chambers' book and as a kind of bonus you get the whole screenplay Singleton wrote.  He was trying to balance out the \\"male world\\" of his previous effort BOYZ N THE HOOD with a \\"female-centered\\" movie that would revolve all around a young woman who has lost everything but her will to live again.o balance out the \\"male world\\" of his previous effort BOYZ N THE HOOD with a \\"female-centered\\" movie that would revolve all around a young woman who has lost everything but her will to live again.	2005-06-06

(She wrote two memoirs during her lifetime, both sadly out of print.)  Historian Milly S. Barranger has written a magnificent biography of a woman whose very life seems to be slipping away from us year by year, as memories of her productions dim, and those who knew her vanish from the world stage.  (Webster died in 1972 at age 67.)<br /><br />She was the daughter of a British matinee idol, Ben Webster, and his wife, the celebrated May Whitty, who became a star late in life in Hollywood playing an elderly harridan in the Robert Montgomery starrer NIGHT MUST FALL.  By that time Margaret Webster had established herself in New York, with a long-running collaboration with the actor Maurice Evans.  The two of them mounted quite a few productions of Shakespeare, on Broadway, though in the 1950s his star had waned and the magic wasn't there and it became apparent he was no Olivier or Gielgud.<br /><br />This book would be worth reading just to outline her work with Maurice Evans, but there is so much more!  Each chapter is meaty enough to be its own volume, particularly the chapter about Webster's historic work with black superstar Paul Robeson in a Broadway Othello of 1943, with Uta Hagen and Jose Ferrer in support.  Barranger guides us through this controversial production step by step, suggesting that Webster's British background perhaps allowed her to cast more color-blind than her USA counterparts, if \\"color-blind\\" is the proper word for casting Othello as a black man indeed.  The inner ins and outs of the show, with Hagen and Robeson having an open affair with the complaisance of Ferrer, all of them eventually turning on Webster, is enough to stand your hair on end, but you'll have your hat off to them all.  It is truly one of the great Broadway stories, on a par with the opening of THE CRADLE WILL ROCK.<br /><br />So too is the story of Tennessee Williams' first Broadway production, with BATTLE OF ANGELS, an early version of ORPHEUS DESCENDING, for which the Theater Guild hired Webster to direct a temperamental Miriam Hopkins in the leading role.  The play fell victim to tyrannical Boston censors and never made it to New York.<br /><br />Margaret Webster also worked with, and loved, the tragic actress Mady Christians, and the imperious and more or less \\"out\\" diva Eva Le Gallienne.  Perhaps her greatest love was the novelist Pamela Frankau, who made her middle years a joy.  Sadly she lost Frankau to an invidious cancer.<br /><br />Her lesbianism and her association with anti-racist and Leftist causes made her a natural victim of Joe McCarthy, and Barranger deftly sketches in the ways in which her career was badly damaged by right wing accusations that she was a Communist in RED CHANNELS.  Crazy but true, the blacklist existed not only in Hollywood but to a certain degree on Broadway as well.  Barranger is a graceful writer, though the book is marred by a number of bizarre typos which will detract from your enjoyment.  In one, A critic wrote that Martita Hunt's Portia \\"shown\\" like a candle in a dark world.  What's with \\"shown\\"?  Or \\"Aaron Copeland\\"?<br /><br />As a biographer, Milly Barranger's biggest mistake, perhaps, is her failure to read properly the novels of Pamela Frankau, Webster's great love, particularly the so-called \\"Weston trilogy\\" CLOTHES FOR A KING'S SON.  As I read more and more about Margaret Webster, I realized that the outlines of her tempestuous life were ringing a bell in my head.  Having read the Farbkau books years ago, I could see clearly that Webster must have confided in Frankau many, many details of her life unavailable elsewhere, and Frankau really mined her lover's past for her fiction.  Reading SING FOR YOUR SUPPER, SLAVES OF THE LAMP, OVER THE MOUNTAINS, Barranger will discover how Webster really felt about her famous parents,about acting, about her sexual identity, about being a nomad in a spotty if glamorous profession.  It's all there and it's all beautifully told.  But this is only a minor cavil; MARGARET WEBSTER: A LIFE IN THE THEATER is a spellbinder.about acting, about her sexual identity, about being a nomad in a spotty if glamorous profession.

As we know, Oprah has so much street cred she could propel a shopping list to the top of the best seller list, so let's see what she can do for Faulkner, a writer who has sometimes been criticized for relying on stereotyped depictions of black characters.  And at least two of these three novels face that explosive issue head on.  In THE SOUND AND THE FURY, the multiple neuroses of the (white) Compson family are always being counterposed to the nurturing and loving family of (black) Dilsey and the rest of the servants.  No matter what awful thing happens to one of the Compsons, Dilsey will always be hugging them to her bosom and singing plantations spirituals to cheer them up, ignoring her own systemic arthritis the better to give them the love and affection their own parents don't know how to dish up.<br /><br />In LIGHT IN AUGUST, the racial identity of its protagonist, Joe Christmas, is a contested site, for no one knows if he's black, white, or what.  Commentators have often associated Joe with Jesus Christ (right down to the same initials) and his posture of martyrdom can still bring your heart into your throat, it's a very harsh look at Southern life at the beginning of the last century and Faulkner doesn't shy away from cruelty.  He does show that patience and love do overcome almost any obstacles, or at any rate they wear down the obstacles to the degree that they transmogrify into something else.  But was he counselling patience for black people, telling them to go slow in their struggle for civil rights?  Like any modernist text, LIGHT IN AUGUST is ambiguous and does not give up its answers very clearly.<br /><br />AS I LAY DYING, which takes the narrative form of THE SOUND AND THE FURY and explodes it further, is not as direct as the other two books in terms of its navigation of black and white relations in the US.  AS I LAY DYING is more private, less social, more of a lyric meditation on family and the great cavern of death.  No one yet has bettered Faulkner in his ability to enter into the heads of so many disparate characters and this book might be the tour de force of all time.

And my second thought was that the good people at New Directions are really milking his posthumous fame to try to sell this puzzling \\"keepsake,\\" as they call it, for $22.95, when it is so manifestly inferior to his other books.  But luckily I kept the book on top of my desk for awhile and presently found myself returning to it again and again, trying to puzzle out what made it different than other books of poetry I had read.  These \\"micropoems,\\" as the translator calls them, do creep under your skin.<br /><br />Here's one:<br /><br />The house<br /><br />in the night<br /><br />through the windows<br /><br />the flickering light of<br /><br />flames<br /><br />That's it!  As New Directions lays them out, these lines are all centered a la Michael McClure (it's hard to tell if Sebald planned this effect.)  By the way the translator (Michael Hamburger) must be British and I wonder what a good US translator could have done with the German of these poems which the editor has supplied as an appendix for our eluctation at the back of the book.  They are so short you could copy them all out on your lunch hour, but they gain weight and resonance by their placement next to the lithographs that inspired them-33 portraits by Sebald's best friend Jan-Peter Tripp) of people's eyes.  (A lot of the poetry is about questions of seeing, perception, realization, etc)  I thought I recognized some of the faces and I was right in one case only.  The eyes are mostly those of famous artists (Francis Bacon, rembrandt, Jasper Johns, Barnett Newman) and writers (Capote, Borges, Burroughs) and some of the juxtapositions attain a transparency as luminous as ice water.  But you don't find out whose eyes they are until the end, so the volume has the aspect of a parlor game to it.  By the way, check out page 74.  It says those are the eyes of Proust, but they look like Rex Harrison to me!<br /><br />So you're reading these haiku and puzzling over whose eyes are whose and before you know it, you are swept away into the land of the Unerzahlt for the ride of a lifetime./> <br />So you're reading these haiku and puzzling over whose eyes are whose and before you know it, you are swept away into the land of the Unerzahlt for the ride of a lifetime.	2005-06-02

This was long before Susan Fletcher's birth of course, but she has a poetic habit of mind that comes from long familiarity with English verse.<br /><br />The story line Eve precipitates is a good one, even though she does seem too young to do half the things Fletcher has her do.  It's a book about motherhood, impending and refusing, the things that a mother must do, and the things she hopes she never has to face.  Billy, the bizarre friend she meets in the little Welsh village, is the first one who helps Eve lift up out of the depression and trauma caused by her Mom's sudden exit from her life.  He's sort of a freak, but Cae Tresanit is the sort of village that wouldn't have its charm had it fewer freaks and twee people.  It's a cozy village, is Cae Tresanit, an anagram in fact for \\"Tea Canister.\\"<br /><br />If you, like I, enjoyed the 30s novels of Rosamund Lehmann, with their intense, poetic concentration on broken families and children struggling to understand the lessons of the past, then you will join me in applauding Susan Fletcher.  She will do better next time, I'm sure.	2005-06-02

This is the kind of book that shows fatherhood for what it really is.<br /><br />In Chris' case the experience of being James Dickey's son was pretty painful, and one feels that he has never gotten out of his dad's shadow.  Chris' mother, Maxine, was more beautiful than Elizabeth Taylor, and yet Jim Dickey treated her shabbily, calling her \\"Miss Chubby of 1956\\" and other high camp names.  Chris ascribes her drinking problem to the rough treatment Jim meted out.  Hard to say, but Jim wins no prizes as husband of the year.  The funny thing is trying to recall back to a time when James Dickey was popular--not only popular but critically acclaimed and, as Chris, points out, the critic Peter Davison published an article in Atlantic Monthly that posited that either Dickey or Robert Lowell was then (1970?) poised to assume the throne as greatest American poet.  Oh, what a long time ago it seems.  Chris' defense of his father's poetic legacy is a strong one, and his selection of quotes from his father's poems drove me back to the big Wesleyan collected poems which I hadn't visited in a hound's age.  I'm getting to like Dickey all over again and I can see that some of his poetic devices eerily forecast ones that are popular right now.  He must have been a spellbinder on stage; one of the best sections of SUMMER OF DELIVERANCE is all about Chris fuming in the audience while Jim launches into a self-important poem called \\"Adultery\\" in which he boasts about cheating on Maxine with Robin Jarecki (a young woman with whom Dickey became involved in the 1960s).<br /><br />Dickey's second marriage was even more troubled than the first, and issues of elder abuse, the latchkey children phenomenon, and crack cocaine addiction reared their heads in this one.  The full-length biography of Dickey that came out after this book told more of the story, but what Chris has to say is pretty bad.<br /><br />The title of the book I didn't care for.  It sets you up thinking that the whole book will be about the \\"summer\\" in which John Boorman made the film of DELIVERANCE.  Far from it, that account occupies only a sliver of the book.

Ken Van Vechten has written a book that tells us everything we would want to know about how to get arried in Las Vegasand what kind of experience it would be.  The book is thoroughly up to date and even has the new 1 billion dollars WYNN Hotel erected by Steve Wynn.  The author says this is his first book but his writing style is so slick and stylish that immediately it clicks, makes you want to go there and share in the fun and who knows, propose?  He goes to every wedding chapel on the strip and beyond, and rates them for their various amenities, including if there is a dressing room available for the bride (and//or the groom)-something that will come in extremely useful.  Along the way he tells funny stories, some scandalous, about the different celebrity weddings held in these chapels over the years.  Remember when Britney Spears got married the first time-to a \\"friend\\"?  You'll hear the inside scoop here.<br /><br />But it's not just about weddings.  Through the magic of Van Vechten's prose you'll feel like you're driving in an open convertible right through the heart of the world's most improbable real estate.  He even suggests free things you might like to do if you're there on a budget.  He tells you the best ways to book rooms at the hotels, and he discusses why the square foot rate of the average Vegas hotel room is so different than the general rate prevalent in all of America.  (It's bizarre!)  The little sidebars along are worth the price of this book.  And there's more about weddings themselves than most people know: did you realize that every flower in the bride's bouquet has some arcane significance?  Ken Van Vechten does and he provides a list to help you deconstruct the arrangement!	2005-06-02

When his third wife, Gilda Radner, was diagnosed with cancer he let his career slip away and he devoted himself to nursing her, thus winning the hearts of America, although in the long run his agent probably was ready to kill him.  And when he came back, there were very few parts for him, sadly enough.  That bitterness he pours into his new memoir, which is one of the worst show-bix memoirs I've ever read, and I've read hundreds.  Why is it so bad?  Well, I'm not really sure.  Few in Hollywood are exempt from the sin of self-absorption, but you can be self-absorbed and still write an entertaining book (cf Tallulah Bankhead's autobiography).  Mostly it is the feeling that he hated Gilda Radner and clearly resented her in every way imaginable.  At times he says she was \\"basically good,\\" but that it too little too late.  I wasn't her greatest fan but even I liked her more than Gene Wilder seems to have.  In his telling of the story, she comes across as a monster.  His track record with women isn't that great.  He seems happy with his current wife, Karen, but I have some advice for Karen, and that is, maybe you should see someone else on the side for Wilder falls out of love as often as other men change their underwear.<br /><br />Some interesting tidbits emerge out of the debris.  I had no idea that Jean Renoir was considering directing a Gene Wilder film!  Is it true?  Who knows.  I was also intrigued by the possibility that BLAZING SADDLES was written for Dan Dailey and that Wilder stepped into the role at the last minute, after Gig Young started filming and had to be replaced pronto.  Dan Dailey, imagine that!  Such a part might have reinvigorated his career no end, at least have provided Mr. Dailey with a Last Hurrah worth remembering.  I also enjoyed reading Wilder's account of working with Carol Channing and suffering through her temper tantrums, and then her pathetic attempt to get him to like her while wearing panties and a bra.  Believable?  No.  But at least it was juicy.<br /><br />As others have said, the device of writing the book as though you were talking to your shrink is hackneyed and lame.  It's a shame Gene Wilder can't get any movies made, but after reading this book I'm sick of him.  Sorry Gene fans.suffering through her temper tantrums, and then her pathetic attempt to get him to like her while wearing panties and a bra.  Believable?

Books	5	62	69	N	N	High Flying Cookbook A Winner	Susan Purdy, \\"America's Julia Child,\\" has come up with her best idea yet.  I'm sure everyone knows that baking at high altitudes sometimes leads to embarrassing and tasteless flops in the oven.  Nobody except the top physicists knows why this is true, but it's one of those things many home bakers try to compensate for.  Finally, a recipe book which tells you exactly what to do, no matter if you're cooking at sea level, or ten thousand feet, or five thousand feet or two.<br /><br />Even experienced chefs sometimes come a cropper when trying to calculate how much or how little baking soda or sugar to include in a new oven.  Purdy quotes Ross Parsons, LA Times food columnist, to the amusing effect that so frequent were his culinary screwups in Albuquerque (New Mexico--5,000 feet above sea level) that he pretty much swore off baking.  \\"Early trauma made me a reluctant baker.  I'm still afraid to bake and hardly ever try, even though I have moved to sea level in Long Beach, California.\\"  Ross, I'm sure you will be the first to purchase a copy of PIE IN THE SKY, but you won't be the only one.<br /><br />Susan Purdy and her staff have cooked every one of one hundred dishes at all four altitudes and have provided a flaw-proof recipe for each one.  Handy charts show you the way.  At last, no matter where you live in the USA (and remember, there are 37 states which have high altutude locations), you can cook the Susan Purdy way--without a glitch or a fallen souffle.  And oh, the recipes themselves!  All our favorite pies, cakes and brownies, and more!<br /><br />Anna's Butter Cake--a traditional Swedish favorite.  All the butterfied goodness of Scandinavia in one cake.<br /><br />Colorado Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Forsting--two ways to go wrong and Susan deftly avoids each one!  And she even tells you the best way to fly with this cake in your lap!  For when sending desserts UPS it's often not the jostling that spoils the surprise it's the altitudes of the cargo planes they send to ship your sweets with!<br /><br />Susan's own favorite out of all the recipes here is her version of Flourless Chocolate Espresso Trufffle Cake.  \\"I love it warm from the ooven,\\" writes Piurdy, \\"when it is soft as a just-set pudding, and I like it even better chilled--or straight from the freezer--when it has the consistency of a velvety truffle.\\"  She reminds us all that the quality of the chocolate is essential to the success of the dessert.<br /><br />And finally, if you're into biscotti, and want to make perfect biscotti every time, even though you live in Boulder or Aspen, just step this way.

Pfaff has a trenchant, aphoristic style, filled with the thunder of Herman Melville, always sweeping argument off the table with his fist, and I admire the way he brings back the spirit of Mencken into his newspaper writing when he goes about his business writing op ed pieces and the like for the International Herald Trib.  This book, however, is something with a little more scope, a biographical study of six influential authors who sought to improve the world with advanced political views, and who, in general, made a mishmash of things without even trying.  Many Americans will read this book and see a tragic reflection of our own nation's current political nightmare, like looking into the dark hand mirror of Snow White's wicked stepmother.<br /><br />Many of us will know Lawrence of Arabia at least from the movie, but the lives of some of the other adventurer-authors will be fairly obscure, like Junger, or once notorious, now obscure as history turns a spade onto their graves (like Andre Malraux, whose books my father loved).  Sometimes they simply collapse under Pfaff's cool scorn.  And sometimes they snap back, like saplings in spring after the snow melts, and whip back in our faces with unexpected force.  You might feel that Pfaff has taken his old copy of \\"The God That Failed\\" and carved up the pages and presented it as a new book, but he has actually done a fair amount of original research and the stew is tasty.<br /><br />I wish that Pfaff had included at least one American in his study of six men.  The implication as it stands is that men of many nations have gone mad through devotion to extreme politics, but Americans are immune.  (As are women I guess.)  We know from Pfaff's previous books that he does not feel this way at all.  He might have written in depth about the strange case of Ezra Pound, who likewise felt himself to be a progressive on every level, but who judged from the outside died insane, as he had lived.to be a progressive on every level, but who judged from the outside died insane, as he had lived.	2005-06-01

I wound up going back to the desk clerk and asking if I could extend my stay. Kemmons Wilson, the man who invented the idea of the \\"Holiday Inn\\" (or at any rate bought the rights from famed songwriter Irving Berlin), has written a book which rivals THE EDUCATION OF HENRY ADAMS for sheer insight and business acumen. Why are we drawn to the combination of green and yellow that makes up the HOLIDAY INN logo? You'll never guess! But that duotone color flash, with its \\"Vacancy\\" sign blinking underneath, lures travellers in the way flypaper lures a fly.<br /><br />He was a wealthy man even before he coined the phrase (I mean leased it), \\"Holiday Inn,\\" and making a lot of money hasn't changed his basic character. If people teased him about being called, \\"Kemmons,\\" he did not take it personally but stored up the energy he might have devoted to getting even, and turned it around into a way to get rich. Okay, so the Holiday Inn isn't the Trump Plaza, still, it's a way for the ordinary person to experience a little bit of the comfort of home when they're out on the road or just looking to get lucky. Kemmons Wilson knows all these facts and lays them out in his now-famous \\"Twenty Tips\\" to prosperity.<br /><br />Never underestimate the other fellow's taste. If you had thought of the green and yellow sign you too might be raking in the chips and clipping your coupons. He made it onto the cover of TIME magazine in 1972.  What Milton Hershey did for chocolate, I think you will find, Kemmons did for the motel business. Thought of the customers first. Selling his life story is just part II. They were going like hot cakes in the revolving rack in the gift shop, the two clerks could barely keep them on the shelf. Well, 79 cents is quite a bargain even if the book was bad.	2005-05-31

They were a varied lot and quite talented, with more quirks than you'd expect! ANDY is even more upfront about its eccentricity. In the Bible there are not very many crows, whereas there are ravens galore, perhaps because the weather conditions of the Middle East prevented crows from thriving whereas it was good for ravens? Most of the time you find \\"crow\\" in the Bible, it's as a verb: for example, \\"Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The `rooster' shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.\\"<br /><br />Whitney Dough is a religious man and the story of his life with Andy is an amusing one, for all its sadness. There's something about living with a bird that makes you seem kooky to others, but those of us who have had this experience from the inside know that there's something sacred about it. Not for nothing is the Holy Father continually compared to a pet owner, nor we the sinners a flock of birds. Remember Bede's story of human life as a bird darting into one window of a lighted house, on a dark night, then flying back out again into the darkness?<br /><br />I don't know why the other reviewer gave this book only a few stars; maybe because it was too personal and revealing, and not enough ornithology. But there are many books about crow life, and hardly any about spending two decades of one's life with one, and so this is a cherishable book in which you will find tools and tips for appreciating your own pet in (and finding your spiritual side as well).	2005-05-31

Lipton had a radiance and a natural glow about her that made her stand out, and she wasn't a bad actress, though THE MOD SQUAD didn't give her that much to do.  She was sulky and bold, as though she were trying to play James Dean's part in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, and like Dean in REBEL, her character, Julie, had to bond in a convincing way with other misfits.  \\"With Michael and Clarence, I had an intuitive, wordless connection,\\" she writes.  The three of them could be lounging around a hippe pad together, or riding their big Harleys down Sunset Boulevard, and that connection remained.  She was a star in her day (40 years ago), and she accomplished all this almost by accident,while wearing the coolest clothes ever seen on TV, and fighting crime, and reconciling the values of a drug and street culture to the strict law and order regime of a Quinn Martin production.<br /><br />Behind the scenes Peggy was much gossiped about and as her revealing memoir tells us, it turns out to have been all true.  Her affair with Paul McCartney is beautifully told.  As she describes it, she was kind of squeezed in between Jane Asher and Linda Eastman, and I for one can see how Asher, Eastman, and Heather Mills are all variations on the Peggy Lipton type.  She lived with Lou Adler and so she was right at the center of the LA \\"youthquake\\" with the Monterey Pop Festival, the Mamas and the Papas, etc.  She even made an LP which I wish was included as a CD in the back of this book but alas no.  She survived a close encounter with Sammy Davis Jr., and she \\"ended up spending three long weekends\\" with the one and only Elvis Presley.  I'm just scratching the surface here.  She got around in a serious way--she was \\"rapaciously romantic,\\" she admits.<br /><br />When she married Quincy Jones, she sort of withdrew from acting, and then David Lynch and TWIN PEAKS put her back on the map again.  Her accounts of working with both men are equally satisfying.  Most of all her readers will grow genuinely fond of her by the time the book comes to a close.TWIN PEAKS put her back on the map again.

When she says that, as a girl, she thought Rossini's \\"William Tell Overture\\" was written just for her, you have to smile.  The nostalgia she conveys is as inviting as a stack of pancackes on a Sunday morning, and as warm as the hearts of Midlanders Up Main and Down Main.<br /><br />Though I have never been to Michigan, I have some good friends who sent me this book for my birthday, knowing how I like books without a lot of unnecessary words in them.  They must have picked it up at a fine book-store, for it is beautifully designed and printed.  When I opened the package it came in, I muist confess that I frowned a little, because for a long time they have been trying to persuade me to leave what they consider to be a dangerous, immoral city (San Francisco) and to join them at Dow Chemical--headquartered in Midland.  I remember protesting against Dow when it was revealed that they were marketers of napalm during the Viet Nam war, but that was before I saw how cute their factories are and according to the evidence in this book, the two rivers (the Chippewa, named after the Indian tribe, and the Tittabwassee, which I think means, \\"Good Country\\" in the Chippewa dialect) that border Midland are still filled with fresh trout so they can't be all that unhealthy, though very icy of course in winter.<br /><br />Anyway I put aside my preconceptions about Midland, and had myself a good read looking at all the \\"vintage pictures\\" in the book, looking at a way of life that never really existed except in photographs and except, perhaps, in that little corner of Heaven its natives call Home--Midland, Michigan.  My friends also put in an arrowhead they said they found while planting zinnias in their backyard.  Could be Chippewa manufacture?  Anyway it is a delightful souvenir of a fine reading experience, one which I have bookmarked heavily.marked heavily.	2005-05-26

While the plays themselves are not very well written, it provides an interesting look on what people during the so called \\"Golden Age of Television\\" were actually writing and producing.  ARMOUR OF LIGHT has only five characters, Father, Mother, Boy, Girl, and Paul.  Paul who?  Paul the Apostle, who shows up at the outskirts of a provincial American town much like Peyton Place on a huge pile of rocks that overlooks the town, a place where the Boy (none of the characters are given real names, which accentuates their universality) goes to try to escape his horrible father and enabling mother.<br /><br />His girlfriend, the GIRL, doesn't understand why the BOY is so averse towards going to Church, the church of which his father is a deacon.  The GIRL finds comfort in church, she lets it all wash over her, not trying to understand it in an intellectual way.  In fact Father, Mother, and Girl all are regular churchgoers but the message of the miniseries is that none of them are going to church for the right reason.  As Paul the Apostle quizzes the modern-day people, he becomes horrified to realize that all his apostolic work in building the Church has come down to this, a bourgeous self-satisfied bunch of hypocrites who pat themselves on the back but who are all sorely lacking faith.<br /><br />He becomes tight with the BOY, and manages to get in a few wisecracks about Vatican Council II while encouraging the BOY to express his doubts freely.  Paul is played by an elderly man, while the BOY is a teen.  They make an odd couple, and you'd think Paul would be all over Boy's ass for skipping out on church so much, but no, in fact he admires BOY for having the balls to stand up to his tyrannical Dad.  Part One, \\"On the Rocks,\\" sets up the debate, and Part II, \\"The Peddler\\" intensifies it, as MOTHER makes a stand against Paul which must have been hot stuff in 1962, when this series was first aired.

He claims to be, and yet there are a number of fans and other authorities who feel he has claimed this intimate title without the back story to back it up.  He knew the tragic star for eleven years, the last years before his death from AIDS, and he even became kind of a nurse to him, so there were elements of Freddie's life he had an eyewitness view of, and saw things no other mortal was ever privileged to see.<br /><br />The music, the madness, the mirth, all are aspects that Peter isn't so hip on, but I dare any reader to go through this book right to the end and fail to shed a tear as the implications of Freddie's diagnosis begin to take root, and people begin to realize what this will mean to Freddie himself and to all those who loved Queen and rock music too.  Peter F. was there, amd he writes sensitively about a difficult issue.  Elsewhere his writing is humorous and sparkly, with a bit of an outsider edge, when he describes the ingenious ways he thought of to protect Freddie from the punters and paparazzi, but at the end you will feel your heart in your throat.	2005-05-26

His first book got a lot of reviews, and the author won the coveted Whiting Award for young writers.  The next book got a handful of respectable notices, but you could tell the tide wasn't coming in for young McManus.  Now there is BITTER MILK, sort of a cross between Freaks and Geeks and the Appalachian legend stle of the late David Grubb (of NIGHT OF THE HUNTER fame).  The \\"old. weird America\\" in which little Loren lives with his hippie mother in Eastern Tennessee.  He's fat as a boy can be and his chubby stature in some ways mimics the strange androgyny of his mother, who keeps her breasts bound to ward off evil and who goes by a man's name.  White trash and violent teens drive all over this mountain ridge, menacing young Loren with their shotgun antics.  There's some magic realism, some mystic insights into grownup nature.  No wonder he has a littler friend inside of his head-a twin called \\"Luther\\" who whispers wisdom to him, in a literary device old as modernism itself.  We saw this device handled exquisitely just last year with Tom House's hilariously bent novel THE BEGINNING OF CALAMITIES, and McManus in comparison is a little rough, careless.<br /><br />It may be that Picador might be able to sell this one on the back of Jonathan Safran Foer's recent novel EXTREMELY LOUD ETC which likewise features an improbably bright nine-year old telling you this sophisticated story, but on the other hand people who've read the Foer book first probably won't want a second helping of the same kind of whiz kid precociousness.	2005-05-25

But nothing beats STRIKES AGAIN for hilarity.  Though often compared to the Harry Potter books, Jill Murphy's series about a young witch is very different and plays up the laughs and jokes much more than the Rowling tales, which include elements of horror and suspense noticeably, and happily, absent from Murphy.  THE WORST WITCH was written when the author was fresh from school herself, at age eighteen, and she published it long before she even thought of having any children herself.  It has some of the freshness and high spirits of other books written by teens and young children (say, THE YOUNG VISITERS).  You feel that anything could happen in these books.<br /><br />In STRIKES AGAIN Mildred is once more embarrassed by being so bad at everything she does, and constantly put to shame by girls who are more together.  And yet she learns not to doubt herself, and her self-esteem rises like a magic potion.  Mildred learns that adults and teachers aren't always right, and sometimes you have to learn to lead with your heart.  The scenes at school are priceless.  The movie version isn't bad either and it stars the divine Fairuze Balk from RETURN TO OZ and THE CRAFT.	2005-05-25

Books	4	15	17	N	N	Scary Case, Scary People	DEATH IN A FISH POND begins late one night in a pleasant neighborhood in Salt Lake City, with a call to the emergency police line, neighbors calling when they heard David Mead screaming, incoherent, in his back yard, pointing to the drowned body of his wife, Pam, whom he had just pulled out of the newly installed fish pond, where, he claimed, their big dog had knocked her into the water and she was weak from a recent operation and she just drowned while he had a solid alibi.<br /><br />Police arrived at the scene. but found David Mead--a white man who made a living cleaning out airplanes between flights--too incoherent to talk to, so they let him go.  A serious miscalculation but one which the author, Howard Lemcke, a Utah prosceuotr who presumably doesn't want to criticize the men and women of the police force too harshly, lets them off lightly for.  But I think it was misguided indeed.  No wonder it took the DA's office four years to bring Mead to trial for the murder of his beautiful, sensitive, intelligent wife Pam--a black woman in a largely white city and state.<br /><br />She came from a middle class family of upwardly mobile black Americans, but she fell for the lies of a sociopath.  He, David Mead, had a thing for young black women, and behind Pam's back he was dating another young girl whose head he was filling with wild fantasies about how wonderful their life would be if only he could get rid of the former Pam Stokes.  This young petite woman, Winnetka Walls, wasn't my favorite character of all time, and neither is another prominent and shady witness in the story, Jack, the \\"ex-con, cocaine addict, and multiply convicted felon\\" who went to the police telling him that David committed the murder and now wanted his suspicious in-laws \\"off my ass.\\"<br /><br />It's a gritty story with a whole trial thrown in, told by the man on the inside, Utah's finest prosecutor Howard Lemcke.  For those who couldn't tear themselves away from the Scott Peterson trial, this is like Scott and Laci, except with the \\"race card\\" added.

He never has had a day without reliving the traumas of his difficult youth, particularly standing in the shadow of an abusive Dad, whose beatings he endured on a regular basis.  Sometimes the father seems so wound up he's unreal, but through the eyes of a child, evil often wears a human face, and all too often, as Mr. Rivas demonstrates, that evil is in the father.<br /><br />I liked all the Cuban stuff, an area I know little about.  The family left Cuba when Castro came to power, because his father's family occupied important positions in the cabinet of the corrupt dictator Bautista (still fondly remembered, it seems, by many anti-Communist Cuban Americans).  When you read A PRIVATE FAMILY MATTER perhaps you, like I, flashed back to the great novel by Reinaldo Arenas, BEFORE NIGHT FALLS, with its odd mixture of a longing for indigenous culture and a fleeing from its misogynist and anti-child aspects.  The smells and sounds come out at you in waves of sensuous description.<br /><br />Most of all, however, you feel the boy's pain.  His father was truly a monster, and his mother was completely cowed by what amounts to the abuse he meted out to whoever got in the way of his anger and machismo.  Beyond that, Victor reveals what it took to get him to become a productive adult.  There had to be a lot of repair work done on this man.  Next time you see him in the movies, think of how much his acting talent comes from the resources it took for him to find the light in a dark world of abuse.  And now he helps others who have suffered some of the same syndromic abuse.  Highly recommended.	2005-05-25

Still there's a hollow at the center of his life.  When he meets Bob, a grown man who works as a Catholic youth counselor, his twelve-year old nature reaches out to him and he accepts Bob's sexualy advances without a fight, almost greedily.<br /><br />He becomes part of Bob's life, a necessary part, or so it seems, but really only an accessory.  He meets other boys who are also tangled up sexually with Bob, and perhaps strangest of all, in Wyoming he meets \\"Karen,\\" the fiancee of Bob, and with Bob's connivance gets to go to bed with her, have sex with them both.  \\"It all strikes me as weirdly inventive, that such a configuration could exist.  This is something, I think, he's been angling for all along.  Attention from all sides, mastermind in the middle.  How did he become this being, this thing--like a daddy longlegs weaving a big, sticky web?  And how did we get here, tangled in it, like hungry prey, groping in the dark for food, for escape?\\"<br /><br />The \\"hungry prey\\" bit is exactly right because as the book reveals, the saddest thing of all is the way Bob uses Martin's need for him, his nascent sexuality, his forbidden feelings.  Everyone needs to feel loved, and men like Bob are past masters at manipulating this terrifying need to fit their own fashions.  As he grows older and stops seeing Bob he finds himself, eerily enough, replicating Bob's behavior patterns--not molesting kids, but developing an addiction to anonymous sex he can't seem to shake despite the love of a dedicated partner.<br /><br />I haven't seen the play that this book is based on, but the writing here (bar a few little purple patches) is almost always right--streamlined, vivid, responsive, able to bring in both the damage to the soul and the claims of the body.  Consciousness is really Martin Moran's subject, the way we learn things and the way knowledge forces itself upon us when we least expect it.

The new one has more information and less of the risible Anglicisms that peppered the text of the previous edition.<br /><br />Nick Papillon, an Englishman with a French name (meaning \\"butterfly,\\" hilarious for someone so involved in model helicopters) has a finely developed sense of what we hobbyists want from a book like this one, and he knows what to leave out, too.  Here in San Francisco we have a club, the Flying Goobers, that meets monthly--and in the summer, weekly--at Baker Beach and I would say about forty per cent of our members already own one or both of Nick's handbooks.  Sometimes the air is awash with the sound of seagulls and the hovering buzz of our RCs.  Indeed sometimes we adjourn somewhere else when the air is too filled with static, etc., too many speedboats patrolling the Bay seem to such the energy right out of the controls.  Feels like earthquake weather.<br /><br />If you want to know about aerobatics, beyond your simple push-pull, up-down \\"flight patterns,\\" he's got it all down in language that is fairly easy to understand even for the tyro.  His chapter, \\"After the Crash,\\" while sobering enough, is one of those classic, stop feeling sorry for yourself and get out there and do it again sort of pep talks.  When I started I didn't know the difference between a transmitter and a receiver, they'd call me the \\"late great Johnny Ace\\" with a sneer.  Now the shoe is on the other foot as I explain to the newbies why lithium is cheaper in the long run, et cetera, all knowledge I got either from fellow Goobers or from pal Nick's rc handbook.	2005-05-19

Benchley provides a lot of background on many of the characters, and there is a whole plot between Ellen Brody and Matt Hooper that (in my opinion) remains totally absorbing.  This is the \\"affair\\" story derided by so many people as unbelievable or awkwardly written.  The consensus is that it's a good thing the movie left out this storyline and concentrated on the shark plot.<br /><br />Could it be that Spielberg, then very young and geeky, didn't feel himself equipped to direct a movie that had an adult (and adulterous) affair at the heart of it?  He's no Neil Jordan--not even today, so many years later, when he still evades stories with sexual love in them as much as possible.  Not that I'm knocking him for he's great, but even his biggest fans know that his contemporary films are by and large made for the 14 year old audience in mind, and the historicals skewed to a slightly older crowd.  But in Benchley's novel there was the sort of sexual realism that was attuned to the so-called \\"New American Cinema\\" of the 1970s, the sort of adult movie that ironically enough was killed off by Spielberg and the whole \\"blockbuster phenomenon\\" ushered in by the sensational success of JAWS.	2005-05-19

The madcap life of the theater has not so well been written about since the heyday of Moss Hart and his 1948 comedy-drama Light Up The Sky.  In McNally's play, a Manhattan producer is celebrating the first night of a new play by throwing a wild party to which Lauren Bacall and Lena Horne are only two of the celebrity guests to show up.  (There's also the whole cast of Singin' In The Rain, in yellow slickers.)  We see none of this, however, for the action of the play is confined to the top floor bedroom in the swank apartment of Julia, whose dog, the ferocious Torch, is locked up in the bathroom barking furiously.  The dog is said to have mauled the face off of poor Arlene Francis, from TV's \\"What's My Line?\\" -- Yes, the play is very much set in its own time (the 1980s) and many of the celebrities said to be attending Julia's party below are now, alas, no longer with us (Mary Martin, Helen Hayes, etc).<br /><br />Meanwhile the theater's meanest critic, Ira Drew, is circulating, wondering why people don't appreciate his bon mots.  The drugged up leading lady, Virginia, is so high she can rarely recognize the people she's speaking to.  And the poor author, Peter, is waiting biting his nails, hoping for a favorable New York Times review from Frank Rich for that, after all, is what determines if any particular play closes or stays afloat.  There's a wannabe actor, Gus, whose job is to haul all the mink coats upstairs and plop them on the bed.  The funniest bit of business he has is dragging in an enormously elongated full-length mink that prompts another character to guess (correctly) that Tommy Tune is in the house!  James Coco starred in this play and I assume that people just didn't buy him in the part.  Christine Baranski, at the beginning of her career, played the adorable Julia, and Joanna Gleason the stoner actress.<br /><br />Buy this book, or better yet, if this play is revived anytime, go and see it.  It is a moody suspense comedy that, should the roller coaster at Coney Island ever disappear, thrill seekers could mount in its place.ristine Baranski, at the beginning of her career, played the adorable Julia, and Joanna Gleason the stoner actress. <br /> <br />Buy this book, or better yet, if this play is revived anytime, go and see it.

Fans are divided as to whether the \\"Dark Knight\\" noir side of the Batman is the only acceptable face to the comic, and in general the lighthearted camp approach of the 1960s TV show is mocked and derided today.  Everyone's looking for angst, particularly in their cartoon super-heroes.  And so the Joker, with his chalk-white face and his manic grin, is no longer in, though even the zaniest of the late 1950s strips portrayed him as a man mentally torn between madness and street smarts.  Fans of the dark approach like the way in which, by the 1970s, the Joker was actually killing people, often in horrible ways, in place of the surprise \\"laughing gas\\" tricks and comic crimes he resorted to back in the day.  Both tribes of fans will find plenty to like in this book.<br /><br />It's interesting to note how literate they must have assumed their audience to be back in the 40s and 50s.  One story has the Joker adopting disguises--the costumes of famous characters of comedy--to commit his crimes in.  I'm not talking Lucy and Ricky here, but Mr. Micawber from David Copperfield, Pagliacci, Pickwick, and Falstaff (who invades a performance of HAMLET and makes a spectacle of himself with his lines from Henry V.)  Try that one out on today's comic readers!<br /><br />The most negligible story here is \\"Crime-of-the-Month Club\\" from 1957, in which The Joker tries to sell thugs his own \\"brilliantly conceived\\" caper plans for crimes, each one for some reason obviously tied in with particular months (April fools, June brides), in an auction pyramid scheme with some foreshadowing of the EBay of the present day.  It's fluff, and it's not even good fluff.  On the other end of the spectrum is the epic, Sergio Leone inspired \\"The Joker's Five-Way Revenge\\" from 1973, in which the Joker dispatches, one by one, five of his goons with terrifying power and real dementia, while the Batman runs always a step or two behind.  It's grim, and some like them grim.  I myself prefer the stories which pair the Joker with the blonde sex bomb \\"Sparrow,\\" and the spooky transformations of \\"Clay-Face\\" from earlier on in the Joker's long career.  One story that didn't make it into the book, though the editors were tempted, is the one that paired Batman and the Joker with none other than Jerry Lewis.  Seems to me he would have been a great movie Joker, probably better than Jack Nicholson.  Nicholson has his famous \\"killer smile,\\" but Jerry had the real killer mind....<br /><br />Mike Gold and Mark Wald supply notes that are pretty informative and the comics look good (except for their color registers).

Anyone who's ever had a pet and who has had to write one of these posters will be blinking back tears of sympathy, even if you acknowledge the ugliness of other people's pets, for some here are real lollapoloozas.  Mostly you take your hat off to the eternal virtue of hope, for some of these people have faith deeper than rivers if they believe that you'd be able to recognize their cat or dog from the miserably scanned old photo of the animal, sometimes off in a corner of a photo looking completely anonymous or so dark you can't tell what you're supposed to be looking at.  The texts Phillips collects are as heartbreaking as the photos, and again for every clearcut description of an animal, there's quite a few in which it's like the old parable of the blind man and the elephant<br /><br />As you pore through this book you can only hope all of these owners found their pets in this world and if not in this world, maybe in the next.

Rushin nacechecks Martin Amis' London Fields, which he praises as the \\"epic darts novel\\" but for my money he (Rushin) can say just as much in 4,000 words as Amis can say in 90,000.  He's funnier too, asserting that \\"sometimes the healthiest thing a body can do is get out of the sunshine, off the green grassm out of the fresh air and breathe in the opposite--air that is equal parts smoke, tension, and BO.

He calls it \\"Bad Beyond Belief\\" and reading through the shocking details once again you rest a little bit easy, knowing that no team, anywhere, will ever play as badly as our beloved Mets that year.  His profiles of Roone Arledgfe and Jim Brown are razor sharp, and his visit to the Topps Factory plays out the dream of every little boy.<br /><br />You might have read some of these stories before in SPORTS ILLUSTRATED.

I expect this child's biography to win the Newberry Award for book of the year.  One proviso, of course the story ends rather sadly.  Some young children are not ready to take in a whole book which winds up with the main character dying a terrible, lurid death.  But most of today's kids will be able to take it, and before long they will be rocking out to RAVE ON, PEGGY SUE, and TRUE LOVE WAYS right in front of your eyes.  I expect this book will be a big hit in Lubbock, Texas, center of the Buddy industry and eye of the Holly hurricane.  Remember--\\"it's so easy to fall in love.\\"	2005-05-11

Did you know he used to clean the lion cages at New York's Bronx Zoo?  Frank Capra told Sly that ROCKY was a movie he wished he (Capra) had made!  Now, that's a compliment.  Elvis invited him to Graceland.  Charlie Chaplin asked him to visit Switzerland!  His dreams had all come true. SLY MOVES reprints the poem Muhammad Ali wrote in praise of Sly:<br /><br />\\"You fought and you worked<br />You're a determined guy.<br />Rocky is great<br />And we all love you, Sly.\\"<br /><br />His tips include frequent napping.  \\"I'm not suggesting you sleep the afternoons away.  That will make you even groggier.  Ten minutes max is usually all you need to feel energized and to restore a sense of peace.\\"  Lie on the floor with your feet above your heart, he says--resting your ankles on a chair.  \\"Just do it when the boss isn't looking,\\" he advises tongue in cheek.  As for eating, Sly opens the refrigerator door and lists all the food he sees there.  \\"2 dozen large organic eggs, a bowl of grapes, 1 small bottle of cinnamon flax seed oil, 1 jar of olives, 1 jar gourmet mustard, 1 six-pack of Diet Pepsi,\\" etc.  It's a private peek into the innermost life of a great fitness buff and superstar.  I expect that this book will be a big best seller, because everyone wants to look good and few look as good as Stallone even on his worst day!	2005-05-11

Even graduation from a good school like USC might not be enough in and of itself to help you, particularly with a newly resurgent homophobia rampant throughout America.  The Lavender Road to Success may have an embarrassing title, but the money you pay for this may be the best 15 dollars you'll ever spend.  And of course with Amazon it's only $12.17 or whatever.<br /><br />Kirk Snyder's done a lot of research.  Is there anyone he hasn't talked to?  The anecdotes and life experiences of others are sometimes tedious, like being forced to watch hours of other people's home movies of their vacations, but Snyder brings these stories to life, and we feel that we are not alone in our struggles for validation and also, of course, for more money and success in the marketplace.  Do you remember the old movie \\"Gypsy,\\" with Rosalind Russell playing Mama Rose, and how she kept herself and her girls going by moving from town to town always seeking our former lodge brothers of her late husband?  She'd give the \\"secret handshake\\" and she'd be in like Flynn.  Snyder's program involves this kind of \\"secret brotherhood\\" but in addition he presages a sort of gay meritocracy where each rises on his (or her) own merits and on what we have that's unique to us which we can bring to the table.  Even if you have your own successful career you might still be interested in this book (you could always develop noblesse oblige and give it as a Christmas gift to your less-succesful exes over whom you're triumphing at the moment).  As Snyder reminds us, we meet the same people going up as we did going down.	2005-05-10

The two of them wind up in Oakland-not the famous city, some other Oakland, where Noah helps his mom restore the many-roomed house the two of them share.  He's a smart, acidulous, sarcastic young buck with real issues about his sexuality.  As the novel begins, he doesn't know if he's gay or not, but matters clear up when he falls violently in love with a classmate at the local high school, J.D., a straight jock with a steady girlfriend.<br /><br />The Yorks discover many Mason jars in the crevices behind the walls and ceilings of their house, and soon they are caught up in the maelstrom of history as both of them, but particularly the mother, flighty, impulsive Virginia York, grow more and more obsessed with the previous owners of the house to whom something mysterious happened way back in the early 1950s.<br /><br />Meanwhile J.D. isn't as straight as he seemed at first and before long Noah is taking JD in his mouth and then grappling with coming out issues.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel, and the story of Noah and J.D. brought me right back to the days when I was seventeen and intensely aware of how gorgeous some of the other guys in school were.  When the story sticks with their attraction to each other, and its inevitable consequences in provincial \\"Oakland,\\" the narrative arc is streamlined and crackles with energy.  When the book goes Gothic and Twin Peaks, it's not so good.  It's one thing to have these weird Mason jars all over the house, but then to find out that one's own mother has her buried secret too, and then on top of that to find out one's boyfriend's mother has a secret which, at bottom, is only a variation on Mom's secret, why it all starts seeming \\"overdone.\\"  Both secrets are easily discovered, laughably so, all Noah has to do is ask and two extremely unlikely informants spill everything in a way that would never happen in what we otherwise call; \\"real life.\\"  But so great is the power of Bart Yates' writing that we hardly even notice these little improbabilities.

Her writing is smooth and always compelling, and she knows how to tell a story so that you can't wait to turn the page to find out what happened.  Sometimes the book feels a little self-aggrandizing, as though there were really an alternate universe in which Cheryl Ladd sang the National Anthem at the Super Bowl, in which she was the #1 recording artist in Japan, and also she starred on Broadway in ANNIE GET YOUR GUN!  Maybe these things happened, but the truth is that it is unlikely Cheryl will ever live down her starring role on the famous Aaron Spelling series, Charlie's Angels.  She has some awfully good stories about golfing with male chauvinist pigs, including the late Burt Lancaster, whom she credits with turning his attitude completely around once he knew she was serious about her game.  An unnamed Olympian gets the royal treatment however, as Cheryl reveals what a talentless braggart he really is and how he was even too cheap to pay her 20 dollars once she beat him at his own game and how her husband had to shame him into giving her the twenty at a later club round.  This hilarious chapter is called: \\"BBB--Boys Behaving Badly.\\"<br /><br />Cheryl also gets off a plug for CHILDHELP USA, apparently her pet charity, but she doesn't really say what it is and i found her vagueness about this sort of sinister.<br /><br />Some stars get two thumbs up from Cheryl for never, ever hesitating to accept her as a fellow golfer.  These stars included men who just weren't threatened by a little woman of five foot three competing in \\"a man's world.\\"  Some of the stars she praises include Clint Eastwood, Andy Garcia, Robert Wagner and--surprise!--Jimmy Connors.  Who'd have thunk it, Jimmy!<br /><br />Read this book also if you want a crash course in improving your handicap and (if you're a woman) using your breasts to help your game, not damage it.  She suggests to all wives who are thinking of taking up golf not to try practicing with their husbad's clubs because they will soon get discuraged from continuing.  In TOKEN CHICK there are lots and lots of pictures of Cheryl Ladd looking foxy which will appeal to a lot of guys and, of course, a lot of women as well.orld.\\"  Some of the stars she praises include Clint Eastwood, Andy Garcia, Robert Wagner and--surprise!--Jimmy Connors.

It is not, however, solely geared for family members and I would encourage all to buy a copy of this book, you do not need to have a mother or father with Alzheimer's, it is perfect for reading along with any friends of yours, even younger people, who are troubled by memory challenges in the Alzheimer's range.  For example, I took this book with me on my visit to the local elderhostel near my home, offering to share it with anyone who would like to read a good book, and once we were snuggled up on a park bench overlooking a pool swimming with koi, the \\"two lap\\" approach found me reading aloud to a white male stranger who might have been in his early 80s, a dignified man whose clothes were impeccable, if somewhat out of style, and obviously he had memory problems as he could not tell me his name.  We sat down and began to pore through the book, with its lovely illustrations--not childlike, just very clear and nostalgic.  After a few pages he told me that he had been in the Normandy Invasion!  There are other suggestions in the book, tips on how to say things in ways which don't threaten the memory-challenged adult, and to my astonishment the man was telling me about a friend of his who had drowned in the surf on Omaha Beach, and he (my new friend) had climbed to safety on the back of his dead buddy.  When we got to the part about his favorite song, he began to sing, \\"My Buddy,\\" a song which I did not know but he sang it so loudly that others in the park turned their heads and a few chimed in.<br /><br />Some residents said that this man had not spoken aloud in years, and one said this was the first time anyone even knew that my new friend was an American.  He spoke so little that, based on his name, many had thought he was a Frenchman marooned in this country by dementia.  That day we truly felt \\"the sunshine on our faces.\\"  Even though it was not (strictly speaking) a good memory, it was still a precious one.though it was not (strictly speaking) a good memory, it was still a precious one.	2005-05-09

Northcott provides a brilliant translation in which you feel the sun's heat and the sizzling flesh through the words.Scott Denham places the novel in the long history of German war novels, reaching back to Erich Maria Remarque and Ernest Junger, whose novels of the 1920s and 1930s are still read today, and also the poet Walter Flex, whose sentimental approach in his 1917 romance Wanderer Between Two Worlds was wildly popular at the time in which Rehn was writing.  Denham also shows us how Rehn is best thought of in terms of the existential novel popular in the 1950s, particularly the \\"Waterworld\\" of Hemingway's THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA, and the dialogue based works of Samuel Beckett, particularly those like GODOT with very limited casts of characters.<br /><br />The book is no easy read and Rehn's descriptions of the two men's travails still packs a punch.  You wince every time one tries to take a drink of whiskey and their thirst and emaciation prevents them from enjoying even these few last drinks.  They think about the women they loved and the men and women who let them down.  In a way it is perhaps a pacifist book, showing that despite being on different sides in the war, both of the men are pretty much the same under the skin (literally).  I wonder how Rehn picked up so much information about the private lives of American citizens.  He does Texas to a T!<br /><br />Nothing in Rehn's career approached the success of this, his first novel, or so Denman announces, although this is the first of a loosely-linked trilogy of war novels.  I would very much like to see the other books in this series.  It's a shame Rehn isn't around today to enjoy knowing that his work is still being appreciated a good fifty years after its first European publication.<br /><br />I thought of the John Boorman film, Hell in the Pacific, while reading this book.  Wonder if Boorman was familiar with this book when composing his fable of the two men (Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune) trying to destroy each other even though they are the only ones left fighting World War II!une) trying to destroy each other even though they are the only ones left fighting World War II!	2005-05-08

His history of The Pittsburgh Gazette is interesting because it parallels American history.  Why, the Gazette was founded before the US Constitution was signed!  It's hard to believe but people loved the news even back then, so much so that horses would deliver the paper on broadsides and it would be read on the village square and in pubs in the tiny hamlets of western Pennsylvania.  Reading the progress of the paper over the years of the nineteenth century made me think of that movie THE VILLAGE, the recent film for which an old time village was fabricated in the woods outside Pittsburgh or wherever.  The most intriguing characters were the Block family.  For me, they were examples of courage because they dared press for integration, both subtly and openly, as the calendar moved from the 1930s through the 1940s and 1950s.  Just as Branch Rickey and Jackie Robinson and other enlightened figures in baseball gave us a glimpse into an integrated USA, Pittsburgh had its own quiet heroes.<br /><br />Paul Block, the one who engineered the merger of the POST and the GAZETTE, had an intriguing career too!  I have read many books on Hearst and Marion Davies, and never ran into the story which Mr. Thomas reports in this book--that Block and Davies were an item before she met Hearst, and that the three of them palled around together even after she took up with Hearst (one newsman after another for our favorite comedienne, Marion Davies)!  It is an eye-opener for sure and presents an interesting sidelight on a much-discussed liaison.  I hope that this book will soon produce a related sequel, perhaps one that will reprint the texts of the articles Thomas discusses.  It would be great if we had the entire run of the Post-Gazette's coverage on, say, for example, favorite son Andy Warhol, and watch the paper deal with social and artistic changes over the decades.ire run of the Post-Gazette's coverage on, say, for example, favorite son Andy Warhol, and watch the paper deal with social and artistic changes over the decades.	2005-05-05

Her previous book was the life story of enterpreneur Lisa Price, the woman who came back from financial ruin to found CAROL'S DAUGHTER the great herbal essence success story.  Lisa got to meet many celebrities, in fact she knew them before they got big, and her cosmetic prescriptions, learned from her mother and Trinidadian family, helped Erykah Badu and Jada Pinkett among others,<br /><br />Venus and Serena, who have collaborated with Hilary Beard on her new book, were famous when they were still girls, so their trajectory is somewhat different than that of Lisa Price, who struggled for artistic and commercial validation for many years and told the story in the fabulous SUCCESS NEVER SMELLED SO SWEET.  Hilary Beard, who lost her father several years back, was drawn to the Williams sisters partly because of the strong guidance each received from their dad, a bittersweet association for Beard that accounts for some of the strongest writing in this book, SERVING FROM THE HIP.  An avid tennis player, Beard knows what she's talking about, and she can help the Williams sisters structure a book and add depth to their insights about their own game.<br /><br />Whether or not you're a Jehovah's Witness, this book has something for everyone, so don't shun the Williams girls just because their faith is a little bit different than yours!  That's what America is all about--or it used to be!	2005-05-04

Tony's fights and reconciliations with his wife, Elaine, over family issues and how to work out a long distance marriage are part of the book, a big part, and any honest reader will see both sides to the story and will come away with admiration for both LaRussa's for trying to handle a difficult issue in public.<br /><br />Darryl Kile's death, which ironically occurred in Chicago, the city with which St Louis has such a great rivalry, is presented here in moving detail.  I feel sorry for Flynn, Kile's lovely wife, and their children.  Their little boy is maybe three or four now and yet he will never know his father.<br /><br />The story of Rick Ankiel is treated more lightly, and will keep you in stitches.  Ankiel, the pride of Fort Pierce, comes off in Bissinger's aphoristic prose as a bit of a flake.<br /><br />The three games Bissinger writes about are thrillingly presented, but when I closed the book it all seemed to have happened so long ago, particularly because only in the past year or so has the issue really been broached about steroid use.  LaRussa seems honest about this, but it's hard to tell how much he's covering his own ass about rampant steroid use on his team and what he knew about it.  After Jose Canseco's book and congressional hearings into the matter, maybe the real story will have to wait until a few more players die brutal and unexpected deaths.  Or perhaps, as Canseco implies, you're not really a man if you can't handle the drugs that go with baseball.<br /><br />I must also add a word in favor of LaRussa's work with the Animal Rescue people.  No matter what people say about Tony, you know his heart is in the right place, and this animal work is nothing new for him, he's been into it for eons.  Good for him.  If St Louis ever tires of T, there's a place for him reserved at Rainbow Bridge.ainbow Bridge.	2005-05-04

Speaking for myself, a man who's always in a hurry to find out the \\"meat and potatoes\\" of a book (pardon the metaphor), I did not appreciate being first treated to the lengthy autrobiographical chapter about Dre. Campbell's early life on the farm.  To me, this was not strictly necessary.  And yet, when I look back, I see this as a way of humanizing the doctor and making us see that even geniuses had boyhoods (or girlhoods as the case may be).  Some of us grew up in cities, some in unspoiled rural areas, some in the suburbs, but the cold truth is that there are in actually no \\"unspoiled areas,\\" for the food and drug industries, together with the medical establishment, have establihed outposts and dug in their heels in every nook and cranny of the world.  That is why a boy like the young Colin Campbell was force fed lies about protein that it took him a whole lifetime to regurgitate, and why he finally found it necessary to do his work in the far counties of rural China, where THE GOOD EARTH once took place, but now, well, they live a plant-based lifestyle but one which is rapidly changing.<br /><br />In fact, I hope that a far-seeing film company gets the rights to this book and makes a movie out of it.  \\"What?\\" you say.  \\"A movie based on a diet plan?\\"  But THE CHINA STUDY is not only a diet book, nor is it only a condemnation of the linked, globalized drug and meat interests.  No, there's a human interest story in here of a gentle young boy put in charge of a herd of innocent cows and then, in outward circles, we see the boy grow up and become a man, in a tale reminiscent of the old favorite A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT, so sensitively helmed by Robert Redford.	2005-05-02

Jackson's book is thoroughly researched and a story compellingly told.  It is a book with no heroes, so it's hard to develop an abiding interest in it.  Gamble and Huff on the one hand, and Thom Bell on the other, all exhibit--in John Jackson's retelling of this mythic story--delusions of grandeur that come to destroy their empire.  It may be that all three are \\"really\\" sterling human beings, but Jackson makes out each man out to be a megalomaniac whose success first went to his head, then turned around and bit him in the ass.  Nevertheless the records produced and written by these three guys will stand the test of time as well as any pop music made in the 20th Century.  The Stylistics, The Spinners, the Delfonics, The Three Degrees, Jackson has spoken to them all.  A curious deficiency of the book is that none of the individual musicians or singers really comes to life, they all become a blur, their personalities rubbed out in the service of keeping the narrative movements.<br /><br />As you read further it becomes apparent that a case could clearly be made out that this hit factory was the dominant music force of its time and place.  And the tragedy is that human error caused its collapse.  The book's later chapters are studies in the pathetic that have rarely been equalled.  It is not really an inspiring book; but it is one that will get your pulses moving and your toe tapping, as all the magic tunes come back to life, one by one.<br /><br />And what happened to Linda Creed?  Far as I'm concerned, she had just as much talent as the big three.  Jackson seems unwilling or unable to take a stand on this issue.  Was she just a jumped-up backup singer?  Or was she Philly's answer to Carole King or Lucinda Williams?	2005-05-02

In a way it was bad luck for Orson Welles that the man he wound up attacking in his masterpiece CITIZEN KANE was one of the very few men with the power to avenge himself so thoroughly.  For Hearst's tentacles were everywhere.  John Evangelist Walsh, a veteran of history's noirish back alleys, has written interesting books before on the treason of Major Andre and the sex life of Emily Dickinson.  Hearst apparently saw Welles as a kind of Major Andre and CITIZEN KANE as an attack on everything America holds dear.  Incidentally, it was a slanderous, even misogynistic portrait of the talented soubrette Marion Davies, Hearst's girlfriend of many years' standing and practically his \\"other wife.\\"<br /><br />Almost a \\"third wife\\" was Hearst's hatchet woman--the columnist Louella Parsons who had a contract with Hearst's newspapers and a mission to destroy Orson Welles.  Quickly RKO lost faith in their erstwhile \\"wonder boy\\" Welles and managed to sabotage his projects THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS and IT'S ALL TRUE, along with several others he had planned, including the thriller SMILER WITH THE KNIFE and a proposed movie version of the Joseph Conrad novella HEART OF DARKNESS.  Walsh is the kind of writer who will do just about anything to advance his own thesis, but here he writes crisply and cleanly about the battle between two men who were both, in different ways, quite megalomaniacal.  Though the verdict is still out about who was right and who was wrong, CITIZEN KANE still remains one of the towering pinnacles of world cinema; however, the reputation of the slandered Marion Davies has emerged from the Stygian gloom into which KANE had plunged it, and she has rebounded cheerfully into the light of critical regard.	2005-04-28

Take the \\"Candy Necklace\\" in the title poem. An elderly professor visits the student bookstore and sees a necklace made of candy for sale. \\"Blue, yellow, white and pink beads snuggling together.\\" It's whimsical and fun and something suitable for the very young, so already the poem has a bit of the late Yeats AMONG SCHOOL CHILDREN type of wistfulness. \\"They make me want a hug,\\" Bedient confesses. And he thinks back to his daughter's precious youth. \\"A mountain cannot but look down/ on the clefts its heavings made. My daughter's/ the thicket in which I bleed.\\" Bedient has a sotoriously sexual way of putting matters, and there's no sex metaphor left unchurned in his remarkable, auspicious debut.<br /><br />He will go far in poetry, but based on the author photo on the back of the book, he has a kind of Jeff Chandler good looks which would have won him a certain manner of fame in the late 1950s, though the picture looks like his skin's now a little leathery maybe from the UCLA sun. Easygoing and friendly, now scary and electrifying, Bedient's poems carve themselves a new pathway through the leather saddle of American letters. He knows how to surprise the reader, and how to tickle him (or her) until nearly time for the family romance.	2005-04-27

Others will be intrigued by the way this man, G.H. Colt, has harvested his own memories and those of different members of his extended family, and put them all down in one book.  The book is a little long, but it will bring back all the lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer, as Nat King Cole used to sing about.  What better way to bring back the humid summer heat around Cape Cod than by recalling all the ways a family can drive itself half-mad trying to be the first one to spy the water as you come running down the hill towards the beach, trailing towels and buckets for sand castles and the ever precious suntan lotion, while overhead stern seagulls watch for prey, and far out in the Atlantic you might spot a liner or tug?<br /><br />Howe Colt tells it all, and more, for deep within every family, especially an upright WASP enclave like his own, there are skeletons that are too dark to stay hidden for long.  Like something out of Nathaniel Hawthorne, the sins of the Colt and Atkinson families eventually overwhelm the happiness of the living descendants and they all come to realize that the life of white privilege isn't exactly always 100 per cent paradise.<br /><br />From one observing from the outside, Howe Colt lived an enviable patrician life, pastel as one of the Maurice Prendergast oils collected by Isabella Stewart Gardner, but when looked at in the cold light of day, and with the frequent hangovers that were the family curse, it was like something out of a late period John Cheever tale, bleak as smegma.  At one time I lived a few miles from the Colt house, and we didn't think it was \\"so big.\\"  But compared to the way McMansions are built today, it was a glorious pleasure dome indeed.	2005-04-27

And even though you've turned eighteen, or so it says on your birth certificate, you're still not ready for adulthood?  Children in foster care face this dilemma daily, for as soon as they're 18, they're dumped from wherever it is that was paying for them to stay.  The Williams brothers, three small boys, grew up tough, and in their different ways, Jermaine, Lamar and Jeffrey all tried to cope with a foster system that alternately coddled them and abused them.  I was moved to tears by reading the account of Jermaine's last days on earth, simply written by ace reporter Martha Shirk.  Happily, the other members of Jermaine's family are living still.  Then there's Giselle, a promising young girl who unfortunately becomes prey to anorexia.  All too soon, adulthood is upon her, while she's still struggling with a common problem of teenage girls.  Liberals worry about these issues, while those of a more conservative bent argue that 18 is certainly old enough to expect a young man or woman to get out on his own and stop depending on charity or handouts.  But Shirk and her co-author Stabgler admit there are no easy answers.<br /><br />Anyone can read this book and identify with the ideas behind it, for in one way or another we are all affected by the problems of aging and by being forced by old Father Time into a realm we are really not prepared for.  For these young people, it was turning 18.  For some of us, it might be turning thirty.  And for baby boomers, it will be the call of the retirement trumpet when, once so active, people born in the 1940s and 1950s will be put on the shelf in today's changing world, without sufficient preparation on how to live in that place of old age.  Jimmy Carter contirbutes an elegant foreword that shows he has really thought about the problems of youth.  That's the saddest story of all.	2005-04-26

It is a heartwrenching tale of a pair of brothers who are as different as night and day.  When I was in high school a lack of girls required that I play the challenging part of Mary Tyrone, once a youthful beauty revelling in her ability to love and be loved, her body a wonderland as they say nowadays, but now only a shrivelled up hag, left on the shelf who finds solace in her needle full of morphine.  Her husband, she thinks, doesn't understand her.  The surprise in the play is that she finds out, oh yes he does understand her-only too well.<br /><br />She wears bedraggled clothes of the turn of the century period, which she has  pathetically tried to keep clean, ironed and pressed, but which her morphine habit have caused to look wrinkled and generally dishevelled.  She knows how she has fallen apart and it is part of her agony that she no longer looks very trig.  Poor thing, she is always fussing with her hair (in my case, a long gray wig which my mother attempted to tie up in the middle like an old fashioned chignon.  It kept falling out of its ribbon as I attempted to totter across the stage, imitating someone in the last throes of drug addiction, about which I knew very little.  I imagined that I would always be seeing invisible people and monsters, like Ray Milland in Billy Wilder's LOST WEEKEND.  And I would misplace things like my yarn and my spectacles, dropping them on what I thought was a book shelf but was actually thin air.  I feel sorry for my fellow actors, three lovely guys totally upstaged by my antics, but I didn't know any better.  The play lasted a considerably long time.  We only had three performances though, and for the third we brought on two understudies for my two sons had quit the play and joined the basketball team instead, less stress.	2005-04-25

Anybody who dropped by Cannon Chapel at Georgia's Emory University made it a point to see if \\"Billy Cannon\\" was presiding, no matter if you were Jimmy Carter, or Pope John Paul II, or just Joe Schmoe, he had a wise word and a prayer for everyone.  In a way he was kind of a Hollywood preacher, and his book makes no bones about his attraction to the spotlight.  His famous friends made him feel good about himself and good about the Lord, and so everyone wound up a winner.  He always joked about LSU's Billy Cannon, the Heisman Trophy winner with whom he was sometimes mistaken.  Often enough credit card companies would send him approved credit cards with big, big limits, and obviously they did not know that he didn't have a big salary but subsisted on whatever the Lord and the Methodists would provide.  He would joke that the disgraced football player Billy Cannon would wind up paying all of his bills, and he hinted that in this way poor Billy would wind up slipping in through Heaven's back door after all.  He wasn't a joker per se, but as anyone knows who sat through any of his sermons, he knew how to leaven the serious word of Christ with a little myrrh and frankincense.<br /><br />I can attest that Emory was a tough place to work at unless you loved the very young people, some of them quite immature, who attended college there, and Bishop Cannon tells several stories about his counseling the troubled youth of Georgia, some quite moving, in this many-layered autobioghraphy.  Published only after Cannon's 1997 death, MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION is no Jane Wyman-Rock Hudson love fest, but instead a readable, if rather dull, story of a man who loved Georgia, Christ, and the a good meal served up hot, as well as one of the most unforgettable characters ever to grace a bishopric.	2005-04-25

Oh, she fell in love with him young, she was not quite fourteen years old, and still Loretta Webb, under 14 just like Juliet in ROMEO AND JULIET, but when push came to shovem it was Loretta Lynn who got pushed and shoved sometimes physically and violently.  She explains how she was forced to write COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER and put a positive spin on things, by her management and by family pressures, and also she did not see yet how \\"Doo\\" and his wayward cheating ways were destroying her family from the top on down.  You know how one bad apple can destroy the whole sack?  Well in this case it was \\"Doo.\\"<br /><br />And yet she continued to stay with him and nurse him through his battles with diabetes, etc, heart problems, until his 1996 death.  But at that point, as she says, it was like the sun (instead of going down) appeared from behind dark clouds and she found herself able to see a lot more clearly.  Doo drank too much, often with her connivance, and slept around, most humiliatingly with women in her own family, and yet she sucked it all up and stood by her man even when she was actually in danger from him.  She admits that theur children were hurt in this one-sided struggle, and yet as she saw it, it was all part of a mysterious game plan God had for her (and for them).  However, STILL WOMAN ENOUGH is not all about blaming Doo, it is about good friends, good times, the incandescent electricity of being a country star, and many anecdotes about fame and her fellow musicians.  On every count you feel that she has pulled up a kitchen chair and she's telling you things in her low voice, intimate things that make you feel you're the only one in on the know.	2005-04-22

I suppose it's possible he hadn't read it all the way through, but that seems unlike the master researcher Lord, he who was famous in his day for going to any lengths to find witnesses and to verify their stories.  Butler is a good writer and although some have said he writes too quickly to be accurate, I have not found an important mistake in any of his books, including the newest on THE AGE OF CUNARD.  He has a special affinity for the great liners and some have linked this to his own aristocratic mien and dignified bearing, as though he were like an ocean liner walking around on legs.<br /><br />Anyone who has heard Butler speak knows that his voice is thrilling as the sound of a whip's whistle announcing land in sight.  His enthusiasm is contagious, it catches hold of you and forces your involvement in whatever it is he's talking about.  When you get him going on the afterlives of the Titanic survivors, it's clear that he knows his facts backwards and forwards, he can practically recite the names of each of the lifeboat survivors and in which boat they were sitting.<br /><br />The irony of the Titanic--that it was the ship no one thought could ever sink--and its sinking on its first or \\"maiden\\" voyage--is what catches your eye and is what, I think, has kept the legend alive all these years.  It's taught us one important lesson, that the next time someone assures you, \\"Such and such a thing will never occur,\\" then that is when it is sure to happen.	2005-04-21

People say Gloria Vanderbilt wasn't too thrilled with the amount of attention Goldsmith's pioneering biography rained upon her mother and the mother's sister, not to mention her own many marriages and tragic love life.  Now Goldsmith zaps the radioactivity out of the Curie papers to serve up yet another bittersweet tale of a woman driven by extra-social needs to help cure the world.  For despiute everything else, Marie Curie was first and foremost a humanist.  Ironically, her use of radioactivity was like opening a Pandora'a box and, as we know, it eventually killed her along with her husband and one of their children.  Even sadder was Marie's touching attmpts to find love anew after the premature wasting away of Pierre.  While I believe that she loved Pierre fair and square, Goldsmith points out that, like George Eliot, Marie wasted no time getting on with her life, and by that time she found herself attracted, again like Eliot with young Cross, by a younger man.  Not that he was a boy toy or anything, Paul Langevin was a scientist like herself.<br /><br />He had in addition brilliant potential and the hopes of a generation, but the scandal that circled around his \\"affair\\" with Marie Curie was enough to retard his career permanently (for he was a married man).  Paul Langevin--what did he have that attracted so many women?  In my family there is a legend about him, that he had long, tapering fingers (Goldsmith does not mention his hands) that appeared aristocratic from across the room, where he would dangle his fingers on his knees listening to another play the piano.  Occasionally he played himself and his long fingers could span several octaves.  My dad said that, if bowling were a popular sport in Paris in La Belle Eopque, Paul Langevin would have been ineligible to participate, for his fingers were too long to fit comfortably in the holes.  The US detective writer and art critic S S Van Dine (Willard Huntington Wright) is said to have modelled his detective hero, Philo Vance, on his observations of Langevin in the salons of Paris.<br /><br />Madame Curie became a legend of France, while Langevin languished in the background, occluded from the MGM film of Curie's life, and in general forgotten, the way that Morton Fullerton was for many years only a ghost in Edith Wharton biography, but now, perhaps, thanks to Goldsmith's efforts, his cause will be championed more frequently.  Though no genius himself, he loved one deeply.  It was not just a shallow \\"affaire\\" for Paul Langevin.

Swyteck had a privileged upbringing (if you think back to THE PARDON that's the one where his father has Jeb Bush's job, governor of Florida, though it's been a long time since the people of Florida elected a man called \\"Harold.\\")  Grippando is famed for his tough-guy dialogue and his white-knuckle suspense, and here he goes for the eternal triangle as Jack's wife has every reason to get jealous when Jack takes up the case of Jessie Merrill, with whom he was once sexually involved.  Shockingly Jessie now says she has Lou Gehrig's disease, and wasting away she wants to get money for her life insurance.<br /><br />Folks who know nothing about so called \\"viatical funds\\" will have their eyes opened but good.  It's sickening to think of the ways in which the Russian mafia is trying to make money off of human suffering.  But this is one case in which the Russian mafia gets theirs!  Jessie isn't all that she seems to be, and one of the two women in Jack's life winds up in his bathtub!  And not in a good way either.<br /><br />If you liked Mickey Spillane's classic private eye thrillers of the late 1940s, you'll like the way James Grippando gives suspense a new name.  Those of you who enjoy a good John Grisham might also go for this book BEYOND SUSPICION, on every page there's a new set-up and a new release, it's like watching your life go by in sixty seconds.<br /><br />Jack is a hero that every man will envy and every woman too.  He has decency, cunning, smarts and plus, he's only human so once in a while he'll make a mistake and when he does it's a beaut.  Perhaps getting involved with Jessie Merrill will prove to be his biggest misstep yet.	2005-04-20

Do they imagine that in comsequence she will be easy to push around?  Fennelly has a wild imagination and is not afraid to take on all comers.  Some of her humor is in her reading style and doesn't translate well to the page.  The book should have come with an accompanying CD so you could get some of her affecting performing style.<br /><br />Some have complained that she tries your patience by writing so much about her baby daughter Claire.  I say, tie a knot in it.  She does have other subjects, and besides, she is essentially a poet in the vein of Elizabeth Bishop, only, as I said earlier, not a Lesbian.  \\"We should write about what we know/ Won't change, volleyball, Styrofoam, or mildew.\\"<br /><br />These lines are from \\"Why We Shouldn't Write Love Poems, Or If We Must, Why We Shouldn't Publish Them.\\"  A simple twist on the MFA workshop standby \\"write about what you know,\\" turns the poem into a bittersweet allegory for the perils and problems of motherhood, which natrually makes the poet think about being a poet as well.  I take it that the title is some sort of reflection or take-off on TENDER BUTTONS by Gertrude Stein.  Stein was herself sort of a domestic poet and never more so than in the simple descriptive miracles of TENDER BUTTONS.  In Fennelly's displacement, she turns \\"buttons\\" into \\"hooks\\" as if to torque Stein's masterpiece into a twenttieth century (and of course, not Lesbian) commonplace book.	2005-04-20
272651:US	46134316	R1CTC8G9GE2UBG	0374205183	500114205	The Path to Victory: The Mediterranean Theater in World War II	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Enthralling	I have spent most of the past eight months going through this massive book, pausing from time to time to consult some other work of history to further elucidate Porch's astonishing arguments.  I had never really thought about the Mediterranean theater, whether it was primary or secondary, never having really stood back and seen it as it were as a whole.  Simon Evans has rightfully criticized THE PATH TO VICTORY for its lousy maps, but the first one is really emblematic--the Med is depicted as a gray entity, the only visible thing in a field of snow, the surrounding countries and continents, forcing us to look at the Sea as a living entity with apparently, a mind of its own.  It's a snappy way of letting us see that Gibraltar and Rome and Egypt are connected arms of the same living creature.<br /><br />Porch anticipates much of the reaction his arguments will make and also seems to have thought out his statements, for good or ill.  And he has learned the debater's useful trick of being able to swallow the opposing point of view in order to regurgitate it when most helpful.  Thus he lists the three main reasons why few have earlier seen the Mediterranean as a place of interest, much less importance.  They are general unwillingness to view El Alamein (for example) as the equal of the battle of Stalingrad; the desert war far too often seen as a clash of titans (Rommel and Monty) to the detriment of more nuanced ways of looking at North African conflict or indeed the war at large; finally, the rise of \\"contrafactual history\\" which makes it all too easy to imagine that the Mediterranean war was fought at the expense of an imaginary 1943 D-Day which might have been launched had not the Allies (esp. France, England and America) not been too busy pushing for victory in N. Africa and then Italy.<br /><br />There is a fair amount of repetition, how many times do we hear porch slating John Ellis for his comments about \\"The whole [Med] campaign barely merits an extended footnote.\\"  But there is no book which, read for eight enthralled months, will not yield up a bit of \\"heard it before.\\"note.\\"  But there is no book which, read for eight enthralled months, will not yield up a bit of \\"heard it before.\\"	2005-04-18

It is particularly notable for its insights into the home life of Stanley and Christiane Kubrick in London during the 1960s and 1970s.<br /><br />Evelyn undergoes some truly trying times, including trying to prop up the failing life of her former husband Artie Shaw, as well as being privy to some of the alarming physical setbacks endured by her other famous husband, John Huston.  Meanwhile she attracts a young gay admirer and revisits many of the old sites and people from her past, the whole thing taking on a very very Proust, Past Regained semblance of deja vu.  Kirk Douglas behaves badly towards her, as is to be expected.  She appears in an episode of Steven Spielberg's TV series, directed by Joe Dante, co-starring an old face from the 1940s, pal Eddie Bracken.  She stars in the national tour of No, No, Nanette, with Don Ameche, who comes off like a prince.  While her glow of stardom was never as great as that of say, Lana or Marilyn, Evelyn gave off some good performances and was always a trouper.  We don't often think of her but when we do, it's with great affection and nostalgia.  She was, as they used to say when they didn't know what else to say, a pistol all right.	2005-04-18

Huggins Lectures)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	History Drawn Through The Eye Of Culture	No Coward Soldiers would be worth buying and savoring if it only inclided Martin's extended discussion of the art of Elizabeth Catlett, a painter and multimedia artist whose work is comparatively little known, most pointedly in comparison to her male colleagues Romare Bearden and Jacob Lawrence.  Martin astutely pins the disparity in critical reception (itself a matter of \\"cultural politics\\" at their most palpable) to the fact that Catlett is an overtly political artists whereas Bearden and Lawrence were \\"transcendent,\\" to quote Professor Martin.  That is, their themes and executions ran beyond the reality-based limitations of the moment and sought out the eternals.  When it comes to the case of Roy De Carava, he falls somewhere in the middle, perhaps due to his status as a photographer, so that reality is always somewhere hovering about.<br /><br />Martin is also good at showing how young Cassius Clay became a bellwether for his age and how he (as both Clay and Ali) brought politics openly into the ring, whereas previous heavweight champions had merely let the simmer, boxing in a ring of unspoken racial assumptions.  Martin has a nice easygoing style and, I imagine, is a marvelous lecturer.<br /><br />Professor Martin knows a lot about pop, jazz, blues, writing, and many kinds of cultural discourse, but in this slim book he tries to cram in too many topics.  Hopefully the print edition will avoid the errors of the Advanced Reading Copy they sent me, mis-spelling Allen Ginsberg's first name AND last name, and adding an extra \\"n\\" to the name of the poet Bob Kaufman (thus three typos in one sentence).	2005-04-18

And until two weeks ago, I still thought so.  Then I went to see Ali Liebegott and had the same kind of earthquake experience all over again.  She's insanely talented, it's mad.<br /><br />If any of you enjoyed Anne Carson's \\"novel in verse,\\" AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN RED, I imagine you will like this book too.  It is coming out of the same impulse, to find the lyric heart lurking inside narrative and to display it, to glory in it, to foreground that which is ordinarily hidden.  THE BEAUTIFULLY WORTHLESS criss-crosses the USA, like CLOSE TO THE KNIVES, like Kerouac, desperately seeking out everything occluded and driven, a frenzy of seeking frozen into poetry.  The sequences late in this book are written in language as stately and magnificent as the Psalms (King James version).<br /><br />Before this reading I wasn't very aware of Ali Liebegott and now I'm like Saul after Tarsus, I've seen the light and I'm here to spread the word.  Whatever we were looking for, all the basic reasons we are drawn to reading, for escape, for commitment, for pleasure, for passion, she's got them good, like fever.	2005-04-15

It's an interesting collection of documents, some from sources very far afield, most all of them fascinating both to look back on in nostalgia, others we watch and recall with amazement amounting to shock, for they describe experiments in the past which we are repeating again to our diminishment.<br /><br />John Held, Jr., provides a succinct account of \\"Mail Art Exhibition,\\" reminding us of Mail Art's utopian beginnings within the gathered contexts of Fluxus and Black Mountain experimentation (1940s, 1950s),  When he recalls the \\"vanished borders\\" that Mail Art was supposed to float blithely over, we think now with bitterness of the tracking devices with which it is said we are going to now be adding to all of our overseas mail, not to mention our passports.  For every innovation, comes a reduction in our personal freedom--such is true of the net as well of course with its \\"cookies\\" etc.<br /><br />Melody Sumner Carnahan contirbutes a charming memoir of working with some visionary artists in the far-away, long-ago 1980s while creating Burning Books and allied artists projects.  by turns her writing is hilarious, wry, witty and quite touching.  Roy Ascott is a little scary recalling the psychic experiments of the 1960s, including X FILES type of parapsychology experiments, which even in the Cold War represented some kind of like minds thinking in Russia and the US.  I love him meeting up with Luiz Antonio Gasparetto, a \\"Brazilian psyhcic who demonstrated the ability to paint four paintings, each in the style of a different 'modern master,' siumultaneously with his feet and hands.\\"  Ascott managed to film Gasparetto doing this!  Wish I had access to that footage!  In general the individual art object is downplayed, a characteristic of current art practice, in favor of networked and relational (often \\"serial\\") projects.<br /><br />Though the book seems strangely Bay Area-cenrric, I have the suspicion this is entirely coincidental, or perhaps more than anything else it is a symptom of our propensity here to work communally and to ignore as far as possible the ego drives of the individual artist.  John Bischoff's account of Mills College (Oakland) as the center for the \\"LEAGUE OF AUTOMATIC MUSIC COMPOSERS\\" is a mind-shiveringly inspiring version of the same.  Funny that the book comes to us all the way from Sydney, Australia, where the two editors both work at the University of Technology there.retto doing this!  Wish I had access to that footage!

But she would have been happy, I think, knowing that people were reading them again and enjoying them.<br /><br />She is one of those cases where a novelist could be extremely popular in her own lifetime and then, almost forgotten.  Meanwhile the movies made from her books (including STELLA DALLAS and NOW VOYAGER) show how original and striking her plots were, how unique she was.  Sylvia Plath, who wrote her many flattering, almost gushing letters so long as Prouty was giving her money, was vicious about her in private (and in the pages of THE BELL JAR, in which Prouty appears as a menacing, elderly Lesbian, almost like She-Lob at spider).  It's funny how the encounter between Plath and Prouty has taken on mythic proportions, and how indeed Prouty's best work approaches thast of Plath in terms of its insight into the human condition, especially of suffering, illness, pain and madness.  Anyone who reads NOW VOYAGER, or its \\"prequel,\\" LISA VALE will see that Prouty was intimately familiar with neurosis.  Plath might have been taken aback had she realized that Prouty herself had been hospitalized for mental illness when she was a teenager, way back at the turn of the century.  In many ways, Prouty's whole life foreshadowed Plath's.

Props to Elijah Wald who hand-crafted this material from a bunch of Van Ronk's monologues.  It reads like a book and you'll hardly know it wasn't.  The detective writer and creator of Matt Scudder, Lawrence Block, adds a preface that does the job efficiently and well.<br /><br />What a life he had!  (The singer died in 2002.)  In the chapters devoted to his youth, Van Ronk paints us picture after picture, of the memorable individuals he met in the age of the first folk revival.  In San Francisco he encounters the nutty Jesse Fuller, who had once been the folk-singing protege of Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford.  In New York he shares a stage with Odetta, whose powerful voice could fill all of Manhattan when she let it loose.  The truth is that being a folk singer in the late 1950s wasn't very much fun, and Van Ronk believed in getting paid for his singing and playing, so he was denied a space by the coffeehouse owners who could put on all the entertainment they wanted for free, and so he started organizing the musicians properly.  All of this is fascinating to read about.  Those of you who enjoyed Christopher Guest's folk revival send up A MIGHTY WIND will howl with recognition as Van Ronk lays into the \\"crewcuts in drip-dry seersucker suits\\" of the period such as the Kingston Trio.  \\"There was an obvious subtext,\\" he writes, \\"to what these Babbitt balladeers were doing, and it was, `Of course, we're really superior to all this hayseed crap-but isn't it cute?'  This attitude threw me into an absolute ecstasy of rage.  These were no true disciples or even honest money-changers.  They were a bunch of slick hustlers selling Mickey Mouse dolls in the temple.  Join their ranks?  I would sooner have been boiled in skunk piss.\\"  Yowzer!<br /><br />He's funny also about the truth that, although he was a tried and true Bohemian anarchist, he sure wasn't getting laid very much.  In the pre-Pill age, he says, nobody was.  \\"And the fact that we were a pretty scuzzy bunch might have had something to do with it.\\"<br /> <br />He's funny also about the truth that, although he was a tried and true Bohemian anarchist, he sure wasn't getting laid very much.

It has a strange, surreal storyline that seems to be a combination of Native People's origin myths and the underground of Dostoevsky.  What happens when cultures collide?  If they are cultures with very differing strengths, then one inevitably crumbles, and when McLennan, the Canadian sailor, is abandoned by the rest of his crew and left to die in the Arctic wilderness, he gradually feels his culture flake off of him like a snake his skin.<br /><br />In its place he adopts many of the ways of the tribe who have taken him in and saved his life.  Is this a case of Stockholm Syndrome?  Almost, but it is Rytkheu's strength as a novelst to make this transition seem inevitable.  You'll love the Chukotka people and their ways of doing things which have been authentic survivals from what must be the Iron Age.  Their hunts, their feasts, their joys and sorrows are all seen through the half-sophisticated, half-adrift sailor boy John.  When John stumbled across the carcass of a whale, the force of Rytkeu's writing hits you with a visceral punch, it's almost as if you were there in that terrible place of ice and decay.  The notes and glossary are exemplary, printed in that \\"ghost\\" type (half the amount of ink as in the actual text) that Black Sparrow used to print the \\"Explanatory Notes\\" in Jack Spicer's \\"Homage to Creeley.\\"  I must comment also on the translation (out of the Russian) by Ilona Yazhin Chavasse.  What a masterful segue from Russian to English--by way of the Chukotka tongue.  You will feel effortless, like a plank on the sea, floating, through the pages of this book, like a dream in polar fog.	2005-04-14

If ever the word \\"hero\\" was deserved it was here, and it gains luster from use when applied to Slanger, Cummings, and all the nurses who landed on Normandy sixty years ago and more.  Can you imagine trying to jump off a boat, eying the water ahead of you, and trying to guess if it was three feet of water--or ten?  Poor Frances, burdened down with a pack almost half her size, sank to the bottom of the ocean floor almost immediately.  Why, her helmet alone was nearly 50 ounces.  Luckily some strong men rescued her, for she was needed on the bloody sands of Omaha Beach.<br /><br />A girl of European origins, young Frances was nearly turned back at Ellis Island due to a swollen eye.  We do not know the details, but we suspect that some now unknown kindness bent the rules a little bit and allowed Frances to remain with her kin even though she was, by strict standards, \\"damaged goods.\\"  The girl grew up eternally grateful to the USA for allowing her and her family safety and security (for they were Jewish fleeing an anti-Semitic overlord in Europe) and it seems only natural in retrospect that she should have chosen to become a nurse.<br /><br />In Europe she died a heroine, but she always insisted, \\"No, it is not I who have done anything--it was always the boys, the brave boys.\\"  It was almost as though to call attention to her own heroism would have been to diminish it.<br /><br />Bob Welch should be proud of what he has done here.  The book isn't always brilliantly written, and he employs a confusing time structure of trying to tell the day by day story of Frances Slanger's war, with interspersed flashbacks of her difficult pre-war life, and it just doesn't always work.  But it doesn't have to.  The story is riveting nonetheless.nonetheless.	2005-04-12

Prince has been humbled, I suppose, and now he plays his greatest hits like clockwork and has attained a semblance of his former fan base.  But on the whole his career has been too complicated to fit into the traditional \\"rise and fall\\" motif.<br /><br />Hahn does name names and he's pretty harsh on our boy Prince, who comes off sounding like he's trapped in his own world, unable to break out and see what's real.  He is haughty, weird, and troubled.  But Hahn is also genuinely interested in the music, and in seeing who did what in the various incarnations of Prince's collaborators.<br /><br />Prince is a sparkplug of energy with a fantastic melodic line and a master of r'n'b.  I love the story of Prince helping out Stevie Nicks during the writing of \\"Stand Back\\" one of her signature tracks from the 1980s.  It's a shame nothing from his sessions with Kylie Minogue ever saw the light of day; but Hahn holds out a ray of hope that someday, way down the pike, we will hear everything because Prince is a sort of packrat when it comes to holding onto the all precious tapes (obsessively, like Howard Hughes holding onto his fingernail clippings).	2005-04-12

In JOE he does a fine job in recounting the basic facts of Joe Brainard's life, and his arrangements and paragraphs are written with a poet's eye to detail and piquancy.<br /><br />Everyone loves Brainard's art and his writing, and the difficulty insofar as I can see it is that the book loses a little something after Joe meets Kenward Elmslie and his career moves into high gear.  As Padgett admits, his closeness to Joe began to unravel slightly at this juncture.  (The two had been high school pals in Oklahoma and had moved to New York together, with the poets Dick Gallup and Ted Berrigan, from Tulsa very early in the 1960s.)  Once Joe stops worrying about money, a little of the tension disappears from the story.  Until then it has the high drama of a Dickens tale, even down to the story of Joe reduced to begging in the Boston streets and being too embarrassed actually to ask people for money.  After his success, he goes to Vermont every summer, he can afford tables at the finest restaurants, he meets Jackie Onassis and Willem De Kooning, the whole nine yards of NY social success and eventually he stops painting.<br /><br />His death from AIDS is briefly discussed.  I have the feeling that Padgett did not want to make this into an AIDS story, and wanted instead to celebrate his gay friend's life and work, but as he admits many aspects of Joe's sexuality were occluded from himself and from Pat (Padgett's wife).  Whenever Joe gets close to a woman he has fantasies about taking the next step into having sex with her, but this seems to have occurred seldom if at all.  In the meantime he continues writing his book I REMEMBER and its many sequels and extensions, and launches into a longrunning affair with the actor Keith McDermott.  Many other figures grace the book, including Andy Warhol and Frank O'Hara.  Through every detail Padgett retains his equanimity, never letting the bathwater drown the baby.  I wish he would write a memoir of all his friends (and relations, having enjoyed his book about his own father, a bootlegger and a real Oklahoma \\"character\\" like Curly or Jud.)<br /><br />Many anecdotes, many insights, in \\"Joe.\\"  I love the tale of Padgett asking Joe, a notoriously hard person to shop for, what he would like for Christmas.  Joe says, \\"Stairs.  I don't like sitting in chairs, but I always like sitting on stairs, and I'd buy some, only I never see them for sale in shops.\\"  That would be charming enough, but then amazingly Padgett gets out his carpenters' tools and builds Joe a set of four stairs each about thirty inches wide and hauls them over to Joe's loft a few days before Christmas.  It is this kind of affection and amazement that pervades this book and indeed, pervades our reading of Ron Padgett, no matter what he writes, poetry, memoir, translation.<br /><br />It seems that on every page Joe is expressing his love for Pat and Ron by giving them painting after painting, drawing, collage, sculpture, you name it, they must have the world's biggest art collection.

If I had my way, she would be declared a national treasure.  I think of her as an American writer, but she has been able to get the gist of Anna Held's mysterious European origins and now she turns her gaze onto Kay Kendall, the epitome of postwar UK chic, and she comes up with another winner.<br /><br />Kay Kendall's life, and especially her death, made her a legend in the late 1950s, and if she is pretty much forgotten nowadays it is not due to a lack of ardent fans who love her, like I do.  Once more of her films are released on DVD perhaps we will have a revaluation of her work as an actress, sort of the way people started to appreciate Norma Shearer only within the last 20 years, based on the policy of going back to the films and seeing what worked, what didn't in them.  Who among us for example has more than the vaguest of memories of ONCE MORE WITH FEELING, the Stanley Donen comedy which was Kendall's last picture.  Poor thing she had to co-star with the film world's biggesr ham, Yul Brynner, while at home she was getting locked out of her hotel room by Rex Harrison, her husband, who was pretending to enjoy his tempestuous relationship with her while trying to keep the secret from her that she was dying of leukemia.  Eve Golden and Kim Kendall try to give thhe devil his due, but by the end of the book you're thinking that meeting Rex Harrison was the worst mistake poor Kay ever made in her tragically abbreviated life.<br /><br />Dirk Bogarde was a close friend to Kay, and Eve Golden apparently was able to interview him at great length in the years before his death.  His contributions give the book a lot of depth, while the recollections of Princess Lilian are also important, historically.  I also liked the memories of Kay's younger half-brother Cavan Kendall, who must have been around 20 when his sister died but who retains a lot of the crystal sharp memories of youth.<br /><br />Yes, Kay Kendall had her faults, and chief among them was her inability to see that she was doing wrong when she wanted something (such as someone else's boyfriend or husband).  In context, Golden lets us realize that some young women who grew up in London during the blitz had an amoral attitude towards grasping the brass ring.  Because at any moment death might rain down from the sky, the feeling was, live for today, and damn the consequences.<br /><br />Yes, Kendall had her faults but I do not see that it was the job of the biographer to gloss them over.  She wouldn't have been hman if she was just the madcap clotheshorse she played in a handful of sophisticated flicks.  She did sterling work for Muriel Box, Vincente Minnelli, George Cukor.  For that I would forgive her many sins.  And her death is still very sad.

Her name?  Helen Tanizaki.  Norman was a junior and Tanizaki a senior translator and Arctic analyst, and the two of them had met up in God's own country, Manitoba Canada, to transcribe<br /><br />Did you know that both Deanna Durbin and Nia Vardalos (MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING) are both from Manitoba?  Marshall McLuhan and Neil Young are others who hail from this part of the world.  In the Inuit legends, Manitoba, about which Norman has written often, is derived from the sound that spirits play while beating on a \\"drum.\\"  Compare the word \\"manitou.\\"<br /><br />As Norman was to discover, there were one million filk legends on the Manitoba wind, and they had been so distorted by time and whispers that his informant, a colorful fellow, might tell Norman one version of the same story one afternoon, and that enebing he would have told Helen quite another.  Howard Norman, of course, grew up to be one of the world's great story tellers himself, and this book is a bittersweet reflection of a love that didn't really \\"happen,\\" but it happened nonetheless, and in her conviction of friendship for Norman, Tanizaki's name shall be long remembered, for he has written an astute memoir about her.  I loved the part where Norman watches in helpless irritation, while Helen doubles over in laughter by something their Inuit informant is telling them.  The truth is that Norman just isn't expert enough in the kanguage to understand Mark's quite ribald native humor.  Helen never rubs it in, she merely gives him space enough for him to figure out that he isn't quite the authority his training had left him thinking he was.  For out in the field, Norman was often hampered by his own inexperience while Helen, quite a bit older than he, had the benefit of many years of working and thinking and creating with all sorts of people in many cultures.  Rather touchingly, as the two become closer, he asks her for a reading list of modern Japanese fiction, and she complies, saying, these books qill keep you for quite awhile (for she knew that she would be dead before he had finished all of the books).<br /><br />Thus into this cold Canadian paradise crept something of the romantic, renunciatory spirit of Der Rosenkavalier.  Though not everyone will enjoy this book, those of us who like a good love story, such as the old chestbnut 84, Charing Cross Road, by Helene Hanff, will find plenty to like here.  Norman's understatement can be a bit annoying from time to time, but there is never a moment when we lose sight of the important threads of the story.  As Helen says, \\"Illness tends to turn you inward.  It makes you eccentric in ways you ever wanted.  It's hard to explain.\\"<br /><br />Hard indeed, but Norman does his level best and that should be enough.and thinking and creating with all sorts of people in many cultures.

Lee was but one of the victims of the tragic blacklist, and the HUAC hearings which tore apart the country, especially the entertainment world in which many well-meaning folks had taken part in various charitable organizations before and during World War II only to find themselves suspected of Communism or merely \\"premature anti-Fascism.\\"  It was a time in which, to paraphrase playwright Lillian Hellman, you had to cut your conscience to suit this year's fashions, and such a time may be coming around again.  If so, the Canada Lees of today are going to come to a terrible end.<br /><br />What a world!  And yet, as Mona Smith shows us, there is redemption for even the most miserable of us, and Lee was able again and again to triumph over the ingrown and casual racism of the film world by finding parts that made him more than just a grinning servant a la the underrated Stepin Fetchit.  He refused to play a servant and thus suffered many privations and was debied many roles, along with his better known compatriot Paul Robeson, also a famous athlete before turning to acting.<br /><br />Lee's greatest films included Hitchcock's LIFEBOAT, in which he plays the only sane man in a lifeboat filled with hysterical excuses for human beings.  This film, written partially by John Steinbeck, is one of those movies that seem more and more central to Hitch's career as time goes by--to Steinbeck's too.<br /><br />Mona Smith's account of how she came to write the life of Canada Lee, as set forth in her preface, is heartbreaking.  Unbelievably, Canada Lee's widow was still alive and was able to share with Ms. Smith a mountain of personal papers.  It is trily one of the miracles of the archival process, and it makes her book not only a showbiz biography, but a study in civil rights and in American history and human endurance.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone, of all ages, who wants to learn about redemption and sacrifice.endurance. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to everyone, of all ages, who wants to learn about redemption and sacrifice.	2005-04-11

What a lovely book!  I didn't know much about ancient (more properly speaking, medieval) Syria before picking up this attractive volume, but it was from a press with an impressive track record of assisting American readers who seek to understand  present day conflicts in the Middle East, so I decided to give it a shot.  Am I ever glad I did.  I take it that many historians tend to \\"look the other way\\" when surveying this period, rather than have to take a stand and speak coherently as to what precisely happened in this fertile land of long ago, for the records are frustratingly scarce when they are not actively made up lies.  Oops, that kind of situation is a historian's minefield and he must pick his way carefully over potential hazards to his wellbeing.<br /><br />My hat is off to Professor Cobb who lays out the story economically.  La Rochefaucauld would be proud of him, for Cobb has an epigrammatic wit that serves him well.  His knowledge of Arabic would put to shame that of T E Lawrence, as if I would know, but his translations sound tiptop to the American ear.  All in all, Cobb brings to life as no other historian the story of a culture-driven people drawn to the brink of reolution and beyond, in a time of Islamic uprising not unlike our own.  (The parallels are striking.)<br /><br />It seems as though Syria was always caught between a pair of warring superpowers, Egypt and Iraq, and from decade to decade the influence of one or the other would manifest itself on every level of their social organization.  This makes for uneasy reading, as we go back and forth like spectators at a table tennis match, but ultimately Cobb leads us right up to the beginning of the Crusades, where for better or worse the so called \\"West\\" began taking an active interest in, and oppositon to, fundamentalist Muslims.<br /><br />He shows also something of the massive upheaval that occurred roughly at the same time as the changeover from Umayyad to Abbasid society.<br /><br />One of these days I hope to study with Paul Cobb, I'm sure it would be exciting.l Cobb, I'm sure it would be exciting.	2005-04-11

Adrian Conan Doyle, the \\"playboy\\" son of Arthur Conan Doyle, wrote half of the stories in this volume unaided, but for the first six he had the assistance of the famed mystery writer John Dickson Carr.  Here are twelve new tales which vary in quality, but in one way or another, all of them are intriguing.  Speaking personally, I would rate this volume rather higher than at least one of the \\"canonical\\" volumes.  I have a feeling my comments are unnecessary, but let us examine the 12 tales one by one:<br /><br />THE ADVENTURE OF THE SEVEN CLOCKS.  What would cause a brave and stalwart man to faint at the sound of a ticking clock?<br /><br />THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLD HUNTER.  Holmes and Watson tangle with Lestrade in a story drawn from the famous Bartlett case, involving chloroform.  Here is a splendid variation on the \\"least likely suspect\\" leitmotif.<br /><br />THE ADVENTURE OF THE WAX GAMBLERS.  Stories set in wax museums are always spooky and this one has a socko ending.<br /><br />THE ADVENTURE OF THE HIGHGATE MIRACLE.  This is the famous tale Watson once mentioned, the case of \\"Mr. James Phillimore, who, stepping back into his own house to get his umbrella, was never more seen in this world.\\"  A natural for John Dickson Carr.<br /><br />THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLACK BARONET.  A thoroughly bloody mess of a crime and a drinking cup that proves unexpected fatal for a despicable cur.  Not a very good story.<br /><br />THE ADVENTURE OF THE SEALED ROOM.  The \\"sealed room\\" is again a trademark of John Dickson Carr.  This story is oddly more like something G K Chesterton might have turned out than an authentic Sherlock Holmes adventure.<br /><br />THE ADVEVNTURE OF FOULKES RATH.  This story has been widely praised, but I do not see its appeal.<br /><br />THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBAS RUBY.  Holmes undertakes to prove the innocence of a butler suspected of stealing a precious jewel.  It is nice to see him helping out a member of the servant class.<br /><br />THE ADVENTURE OF THE DARK ANGELS.  To me, this tale seemed the most similar to the original tales by Arthur Conan Doyle, with its plot involving a secret society determined to avenge betrayal by a former member.<br /><br />THE ADVENTURE OF THE TWO WOMEN.  It is rather like having a good Irene Adler, and a bad one, both in the same case.<br /><br />THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEPTFORD HORROR.  Slick re-write of the famous original Conan Doyle case of THE SPECKLED BAND, but frightening and horrid nonetheless.<br /><br />THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED WIDOW.  Gregson accepts Holmes' suggestions in the \\"red widow\\" case.  \\"Red widow\\" - guillotine.  It's graphic.  \\"His hands were tied behind him and a white cloth, hideously besmirched, concealed his head, or rather the place where his head had been.\\"<br /><br />What a book!

Robinson seemed tough, but he had a sensitive side too that was most obviously expressed in his love of modern art; his collection of Renoirs alone was for many years the most impressive West of the Mississippi.  He was said to have bought a masterpuece every time he made another film for Warner Brothers, to reward himself with some beauty for dipping himself in dreck.  And yet Robinson's films still startle with their magnificent energy and passion.  They too are works of art every bit as much as his Soutines and his Picassos.<br /><br />He was not a ladies man in the traditional sense of the term, but as Gansberg's fine biography shows, he was interested in all forms of beauty.  And part of the reason he could so well play obsessed characters (such as his films with Joan Bennett in the noir cycle) is that he too was prone to obsession.<br /><br />The blacklist (or more strictly speaking, the graylist) affected his career badly.  For some time offers of employment dried up, even though he was never a Communist or anywhere near it.  The mere idea is laughable.  Cecil B. De Mille of all people, the director and producer often thought of as a rightwing nut case, was the one who gave Robinson a solid job playing in his own remake of the TEN COMMANDMENTS.  No other mogul in Hollywood would have had the balls to cast Robinson so promimently, not at that time when men walked scared of HUAC and its minions.  It took a compassionate conservative to restore Robinson to the high echelon of film stardom to which he rightfully belonged.<br /><br />Robinson's own book, ALL MY YESTERDAYS, was famous for revealing so little about its subject.  Author Gansburg gets right down to ground zero with Robinson's psyche, exploring his ups as well as his well chronicled downs.  I wish I had been a fly on the wall when Gansburg interviewed some of his many Among his many films, TWO WEEKS IN ANOTHER TOWN, THE VIOLENT MEN, SCARLET STREET, SOYLENT GREEN and NIGHTMARE have all undergone recent critical revision, while DOUBLE INDEMNITY&lt; KEY LARGO, and THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW remain American masterpieces of the highest order.ndergone recent critical revision, while DOUBLE INDEMNITY&lt; KEY LARGO, and THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW remain American masterpieces of the highest order.	2005-04-11

When she says that there are two million teens involved in some sort of mentoring program, it makes you feel sad about the millions more who need such a program and yet don't have the means or incentive to discover it for themselves.  For, as her research shows, such programs are often of great benefit to the youths, who would grow up with twisted morality or stunted social values without mentoring.<br /><br />And yet there is a dark side to this happy story, for all too often (says Dr. Rhodes) there may be a boy or girl whose psyche is not helped at all by tutoring (or mentoring) and who may be poorly matched with someone who really owly cares for them to the extent that they can feel good about themselves and tell their friends around the water cooler, \\"Oh, I helped my Little Brother this weekend,\\" when really all he did was perhaps drive him to an arcade and give him a ten dollar bill telling the boy to enjoy himself.  Such mentoring does not help--and even worse, this may hurt the kids.  For young people are not cogs in a mechanical wheel, and they do not have interchangeable parts.  In this way adolescence has bypassed modernism, and it is time the sociologists realized it.<br /><br />Dr. Rhodes follows correct protocols, and yet she still believes in the sanctity of the individual personality--you might even say, the \\"soul\\" of the at-risk teen.	2005-04-08

Reading his account of that strange, fateful day, we begin to see for the first time how the darkness that surrounds us is due to a combination of factors which collided with a crash.  Tague is a likeable narrator and gives you the feeling that he is a reliable witness, though in the back of your head you are always thinking, well he was the top car salesman ion the South, how honest could he really be ha ha?  He befriended Harold Weisberg, one of the guys who came to Texas steeped in conspiuracy theory, and Tague's recollections of his late friend are somehow touching and direct in their simplicity.  It is plain that Tague cared for his friend and that his 2002 death left him with a hole in his affections.  So it wasn't just a collaboration between Kennedy aficionados, it was an abiding friendship.<br /><br />Tague was injured during the assassination!  Not severely, but enough to cause quite a commotion.  A bullet came out of the grass and shot into the curb he was standing on, leaning all his weight on the stone that exploded into his face.  Good thing he wasn't wearing short pants!<br /><br />The strange thing is, the Warren Commission was keen to discredit Tague, even though he was one of the more upstanding witnesses to the Kennedy assassination.  There's no arguing with people whose minds are made up ahead of time.<br /><br />NOT THAT Tague is sure about what happened that day.  There was no smking gun left at the crime.  Oh wait, yes there was!  in TRUTH WITHHELD, one of the last people to still be alive to tell his tale finally does so, complete with several interesting photographs which which challenge your eyesight and your \\"received wisdom.\\"  What happened?  Who did it?  When did suspicion harden into the cold wax of reality's seal?  Tague knows the answers to some of these questions, and for the rest, he's refreshingly honest and refuses to pull empty answers out of his ass.  I saw Oliver Srone's JFK and thought he went wway too far, impugning the good name of some and glancing right over the obcious points he might have made.  Tague takes a middle balance, and his shot through the ambuscades just may be the most accurate of all.<br /><br />As other reviewers note, there is something creepy about this book, with its hidden menace, as though Lovecraft were present that day in Dealey Plaza.he's refreshingly honest and refuses to pull empty answers out of his ass.

His book of Longfellow is the best selection since the 1950s.  Now comes a more comprehensive, and at the same time more intimate book.  The sheer breadth of poets who might be said to be \\"Poets of the Civil War\\" is astonishing, and this is not even counting the many British, French, Caribbean poets who wrote on the war as well, this is just the Americans (both North and South).  You can see the years pass by as the book begins with a not very memorable poem by William Cullen Bryant, who was born securely in the 18th century, while several of the poets made it through all the way into the 20th century, not within living memory but sort of.  Anyway McClatchy hit on the idea of arranging the poems by the birthyear of the poets who wrote them, and this really points up in an elegant way the mechanisms by which attitudes towards the war seem to shift by generations.<br /><br />The older poets, people like Bryant who might be described as being old even when the war began, have a very different take on it than those who were teens or even children when the war broke out.  We can see this paradigm shift recapitulated in the case of a single poet, say Walt Whitman who, as McClatchy cleverly points out, was all gung ho about the war at first, but later on in life he saw the sadness and the tragedy of the war.  \\"Drum Taps\\" indeed.<br /><br />This writing teeters on the edge of Modernism and in fact, a fascinating sequel might be compiled, perhaps by McClatchy once again, in which the early US modernists (Amy Lowell, TS Eliot, Pound, Moore, etc) might be seen to be echoing the Civil War as a subject in their poetry.  Like Lowell's poem about his Civil War ancestor.  In the 20th century, McClatchy claims, poetry narrowed to the \\"increasingly oblique and intimate lyric.\\"  Yes, but this is only a partial truth.  Plenty of poems were written on a national and epic scale, but they were increasing de-valued by partisans of New Criticism.  Check out Cary Nelson's work in this area.<br /><br />Though the work on view here in this book is indeed second rate, as McClatchy is eager to admit, it is not negligible, and in fact it's often thrilling, particularly the well chosen poems by Emily Dickinson, Herman Melville, Ambrose Bierce, Francis Fich, Julia Ward Howe (the famous \\"Battle Hymn of the Republic\\"), Emerson's \\"Boston Hymn,\\" and four great poems by the incomparable H W Longfellow.and epic scale, but they were increasing de-valued by partisans of New Criticism.

Sonia Sanchez wrote a wonderful encomium for Scott, saying, \\"I know Jill Scott.  She is pot liquor and cornbread.  She is caviar and champagne.  She is a blues song and a spirtual.  She is Nina, Leontyne, Sarah, Aretha.\\"  Sanchez' poetry is one of the wonders of the 20th century so I decided to give her prot&eacute;g&eacute; a try.  It wound up with me liking the book and I imagine many will too.  Unlike Sanchez, her subject matter is not very variegated.  It's all about love, love, and more love, and then there's some about feminism and black pride.  She can compose infinite variations on these three topics, but after awhile you're like, \\"Oh, not another haiku about crazy love.\\"  However in a later section of the book Scott experiments with taking on different personae and these are much stronger.  One poem takes the point of view of the adult looking back to days of childhood and realizing her mother loved her.<br /><br />\\"She cries when she sees me/ holds me close when she knows I need me/ \\"Mommy\\" I say/ \\"Mommy\\" I say/ Smells so good/ Reminds me to go out and play/ makes me strawberry lemonade.\\"<br /><br />The sights and sounds of ordinary life are wistfully accounted for, almost as though she wasn't a star and just Jill from the block you might say.  There's another poem that alludes to the pain of having lost a child, rather like Joni Mitchell's poignant \\"Little Green.\\"  And the best of all she speaks from the perspective of a roughened, overworked street prostitute with a broken soul whose age becomes the turning point of the poem's final, shocking lines.  In her preface, Scott gives credit to her forebears, including Langston Hughes and Emily Dickinson.  This poem \\"One of the Reasons\\" will remind readers of some of the soliloquy poems of Sapphire.	2005-04-07

No wonder it is the favorite novel of so many young women.  \\"Although Lee's community sets up enduring heterosexual marriages as the norm, they are almost nonexistent and, with the one exception of Tom and Helen Robinson, never gratifying.\\"  He shows us that the way Atticus is not a married man is an example of a deliberate choice by the author to make him not a sexual creature.  We had thought it to be a book about racial otherness, but in fact Richards suggests it is a book about sexual otherness, so that even so twisted a creature as Boo Radley can be sympathetically alluded to with his mockingbird symbolism.<br /><br />Richards can't make William Goyen any more interesting than previous commentators.  I think the truth is Goyen is pretty bad, but on the other hand Richards scores a touchdown when it comes to re-imagining Lillian Smith, the author of STRANGE FRUIT and ONE HOUR, two books that deserve a wider readership for, despite their creaky datedness, they possess that most inextinguishable thing, the touch of genius.  Richard Wright and Carson McCullers also get the Gary Richards treatment as well.  While we are now familiar with Carson McCullers as a woman fascinated and moved by same-sex desire, readers of Richard Wright might be startled by Richards' frank account of him as a writer and man working out an eager bisexuality, particularly in the late novel THE LONG DREAM and the early story \\"Big Boy Comes Home.\\"	2005-04-07

Every year the students, teachers, parents, in fact the whole community goes overboard to make sure that Prom is a once in a lifetime experience for their graduating seniors.  Mike Bamberger arrived there one summer and spent the next ten months following a handful of students and other citizens as they planned for the Prom.  There's a young couple who are having a baby.  There's the star quarterback, and the homecoming queen.  There are nerds and jocks and heads and Goths, and everyone focussed on one activity--the Prom.  What makes the book so good is Bamberger's attention to even the smallest details.  He is from the Lillian Ross school of journalism, in which details like the clothes the characters wear and the slang they use serve to characterize them as a great novelist might populate the pages of his mise-en-scene.<br /><br />In any documentary some of your success is going to be a matter of luck, and it depends on who you choose to follow.  I think Bamberger made a tiny mistake focussing on this one girl, Lindsey Milroy, the head of the Prom Committee, to whom nothing interesting seems to happen, she just remains unlikeable and weird looking--great hair, small face.  The other characters grow in your mind, especially Bobby, the QB with a disabled younger brother of 14 who depends on him in every way.  This storyline is enough to break your heart, as is the story of the young boy who gets killed in a traffic accident on his Christmas break.<br /><br />Played for laughs is the storyline of the detention monitor, \\"Miss Snyder,\\" who seems to have a yen for one or more of the boys in the senior class.  It is whispered through the whole community that she parties with her favorites and even buys one of them a tattoo.  She's daring if nothing else.<br /><br />The go-getter boy, Bob Costa, is hilarious, whether he's ogling the homecoming queen Alyssa Bergman, or trying to score an on camera interview with Patti LaBelle, hampered not at all but not even knowing who she is.  I think Bamberger identifies with this boy, as a modern-day version of his own high school self (he graduated in the 1970s from Patchogue-Medford HS on Long Island) and paints him as a geek with balls for days.  Towards the end of the story Costa meets one of his heroes, and again the encounter will have readers clapping their hands with delight.<br /><br />I think anyone who's been to an American high school with identify with one or more of the characters in this book.  Or anyone who's had a dream of doing something great.<br /><br />My estimation of Maroon 5 has grown exponentially, and my regard for John Mayer has sunk to an all time low.  Bamberger paints him as a mean, sarcastic creep surrounded by layers of entourage like cotton batting, keeping him far, far away from human reality.  As Bamberger plays it out, you get the feeling that one of these days Karma's going to come back for a big bite out of John Mayer's ass.score an on camera interview with Patti LaBelle, hampered not at all but not even knowing who she is.

I guess it's plausible that somewhere in Florida an elderly private detective is pondering the many times he was hired to bring back the boy Elvis Cole after the boy ran away so many times looking for his dad, the human cannonball.<br /><br />It's possible, but not plausible.  Crais does his best to make it seem believable, but it's not.<br /><br />I thought that it would turn out that little Elvis heard his mother wrong and that his real dad was not a \\"human cannonball\\" but a \\"human cannibal.\\"  That would have made sense considering where the novel winds up.<br /><br />Elsewhere in the plot Carol Starkey just pines and pines for Elvis as though she were about to burst into \\"My Man.\\"  I remember admiring the way Crais sketched her character in \\"Demolition Angel,\\" and now I find myself tsk-tsking the way he has turned her into a junior version of the Glenn Close character in \\"Fatal Attraction,\\" with nothing better to do than to park outside Elvis' house hoping for a glimpse of him.  No, no, that's not the Carol you made us love before.<br /><br />Department of Loose Ends: Is it me or at the very beginning of the book, the main villain guy gets panicky and gets a shovel and starts digging up a batch of skulls that have been long buried.  What ever happened to those bones?  Whose were they, was this ever established?<br /><br />Oh well, this is still a great read and a powerful examination into the way the past has its grip firmly on our souls.  As another great US novelist once wrote, \\"The past isn't dead--it's not even past.\\"<br /><br />Postscript 2009,<br />Here I thought I had missed an Elvis book so I went and ordered this one from Amazon.  I read about forty or fifty pages, all excited, and then I got up to the part where Elvis is a child running away from home in search of the man who his mother used to taunt him about--and then, like a lightning strike, I realized I had read the book before.  Even if it was the best Elvis book of all, and let's face it, it ain't, the \\"Human Cannonball\\" material is a misfire of colossal proportions.  My friends and I all agree, yes, when Crais decided to explore Joe Pike's past in an earlier novel, it was rich, meaty and enthralling, but when the Human Cannonball storyline emerges, we all marked it as the moment when Crais jumped the shark.<br /><br />And yes, Carol Sharkey is the very definition of shark jumping, it's even in her name.<br /><br />However, I love the books he's written since The Forgotten Man, so maybe this was just a horrid wrong turn and he's got back on the highway now.<br /><br />It's still a good book, just badly conceived.<br /><br />It's not a one star book, but a disappointment only when considering how good Crais normally is.ike a lightning strike, I realized I had read the book before.

In some ways it is Whitehead's response to the uber-feminism of Saint-Phalle's vision of DADDY, and so there's a harshness and a coldness that speaks as a rebuke.<br /><br />Otherwise the warmth and passion of the French Riviera suffuse these photographs.  You can almost feel the summer air puff back the curtains at the French windows, smell the salt and the fish in the air.  At least a dozen different dolls can be identified from their arms, legs, and china faces, and this body of work shares an affinity to the \\"Doll Parts\\" that Courtney Love wrote about in Hole's first LP.  Mia Martin, who was to go on and become one of the most memorable Hammer girls in THE SATANIC RITES OF DRACULA with Joanna Lumley, is very young and sweet, and looks pretty high even when she manages to get her eyes open.

They did not depend on others, they went ahead and did it themselves.  Wilson's book is both depressing and inspiring, but it is never dull and it is one of the best books of the season.<br /><br />I guess \\"victims\\" is the wrong word; that dates me back to the time when polio was the scariest thing in a Cold War childhood, and the scares were everywhere: \\"don't got swimming,\\" \\"don't go to the movies,\\" \\"avoid that crippled boy for he might have the virus.\\"  Then in the mid-50s Dr. Salk's vaccine put polio in the past for most of us, for the lucky ones who were spared, but huge numbers of children all around the world had been affected and have been \\"living with polio\\" for the past fifty years.  Ironically, a large percentage of these have been stricken with so called \\"post polio syndrome,\\" a further debilitation that might ensue twenty, thirty, or forty years after the original outbreak, and these poor souls are faced with trying to convince young doctors that they are sick all over again, and it is the case with many doctors that you might be a neurologist and very sharp in your field but you might not ever have faced an active case of polio, so you're going to be 100 per cent useless in the case of PPS.  Many patients report having to talk themselves blue in the face trying to convince the mindless MDs that their symptoms were not \\"all in their heads.\\"<br /><br />Wilson gathers the testimony of dozens of survivors.  They are the bravest bunch of people you'll read about all year.  No matter what their trials and tribulations, they needed bravery to survive the tears of intolerance, of reduced or eliminated movement, and the ignorant Western policy of non-accommodation so that for many children with polio, they were actively discouraged from attending school or even from going to a dance or on a date.  It sounds crazy, but Wilson presents case after case of human beings whose lives were thwarted by social policy, not to mention a biological disaster.  And yet there is room for laughter in these stories, and hope too.<br /><br />Wilson is not only a skilled writer and sociologist but his book is sort of autobiographical too, for he is one of the polio survivors, and too he is coping with PPS right now.

I saw on his back an embroidered clown face somewhat like the old clown \\"Red Skelton\\" used to imitate on TV.  I asked the somewhat tipsy biker who did his cross stitching on the back of his shirt, he said, he got it from a Julie Hasler design.  He had the same design tattooed on his upper arm as well, he was the first real Hasler fan I ran into.  After a few drinks I decided to investigate the whole cross stitch phenomenon and quickly snapped up her different books as they came my way.<br /><br />Most of us have at least seen some of her work, the intricate maps she made for the Beatrix Potter characters, or maybe one of her books on cats.  Hey, even if you're not an animal fan per se you have to give her points for cuteness.  (Check out Julie Hasler's Teddy Bear Book if you want the whole gamut of Teddy Bear emotions from A to Z.)  But there is a serious side to her too, even a mystic one, not just clowns but Native American symbols such as totems and shamans--and the occult too, as you get mostly from this book of fantasy signs.  Even if you're just into the LORD OF THE RINGS this book will give you many practical hints about starting up your own line of designs, based on her prototypes.  The cross stitching is superb and very carefully worked.  Most of all you will rejoice at the way all the Zodiac signs are given special prominence.

Unfortunately youth's preservation comes accompanied by a growing moral decrepitude, which manifests itself only on the canvas, which Dorian stows away behind a curtain, while killing everyone who guesses its secret, including the painter.  Basil's sin is not, perhaps, in painting the maniacal portrait, but in his failure to acknowledge the implications of its creation.  Grasping at straws, he blames everything else, even nature and even weather:<br /><br />\\"The thing is impossible.  The room is damp.  Mildew has got into the canvas.  The paints I used had some wretched mineral poison in them.  I tell you the thing is impossible [ . . .]  You told me you had destroyed it.\\"<br /><br />\\"I was wrong.  it has destroyed me.\\"<br /><br />\\"I don't believe it is my picture.\\"<br /><br />\\"Can't you see your ideal in it?\\" said Dorian, bitterly.<br /><br />Whatever else it is, the portrait-like any other work of art-is a social contract between two human beings-and thus is often said to return the humanism that Modernism systematically removed from art.  But what if it's precisely the opposite?  The fantasy of the living portrait, whose surfaces shift irrevocably towards decay, has correspondingly crept into our feelings about art, altered their structure, thanks largely to Oscar Wilde.  The portrait emanates anxiety, its aura a menace of malevolent will.  Dorian Gray throws a mocking salute to Basil Hallward.  \\"There is something fatal about a portrait,\\" says Dorian.  \\"It has a life of its own.\\"	2005-03-31

Her mother is set on having Reena marry a man of her own race, so Reena and David hide all traces of David's living with Reena whenever the mother pops over, which is quite a lot.  \\"They had been living in the apartment for ten days when David was first asked to disappear.\\"  This would be a humorous in-law type tale except for a tragic development way out of left field which makes David feel like an exile from his own life.<br /><br />In \\"Absence,\\" a Peruvian painter called Wari is visiting New York where a show of his work is going up at a university-affiliated gallery.  In flashback he contrasts the hopelessness of his life in Lima, with the marvels of Manhattan, and contemplates not going back, casting his fate to the winds of exile.  His show is not well received and, as Daniel Alarcon describes his paintings, they are not memorable.  Wari befriends the girlfriend of his American sponsor, a warmhearted woman called Leah, who attracts him with her efforts at intimacy.<br /><br />Several of the stories take place in Latin America, where a revolution is going on.  Perhaps the strongest of these is \\"Lima, Peru, July 28, 1979\\" in which a cadre of young rebels spends the night killing black dogs, each one representing a capitalist.  When Lima runs out of stray black mutts, the narrator, Pintor, is charged with painting the not-quite black ones a more solid black.  Alarcon makes heavy play out of the way that Lima's packs of feral dogs resemble the young men who want them dead.  Pintor winds up having a confrontation with a well-meaning policeman that ends in an unhappy way.<br /><br />\\"City of Clowns,\\" which was first published in the prestigious magazine THE NEW YORKER, is the longest and most contrived of all the stories here.  I can imagine many enjoying Alarcon's talents, but to appreciate WAR BY CANDLELIGHT, you will have to have a large tolerance for the kind of awkward symbolism that was popular in the heyday of Irwin Shaw.  No magic realism here, just a dim way of looking at a world in chaos.  Although young Alarcon holds an MFA from Iowa Writers Workshop, his style is not quite leaden, but something close to it.  What's another word for \\"leaden\\" that's a bit less heavy?  How about \\"Tinny?\\"  \\"Wooden?\\"  Anyhow, the book is no disaster, just a disappointment in the face of the campaign hype that promised us a new Salman Rushdie or Orhan Pamuk in our midst.BY CANDLELIGHT, you will have to have a large tolerance for the kind of awkward symbolism that was popular in the heyday of Irwin Shaw.

In THE UNINVITED he is on his own home turf and the advantage is decidedly his.  That said, naming his hero \\"Procter\\" made me think all the way through the book that he, Procter, should have been a proctologist, but insetad he has one of the world's ghastliest and seediest occupations, rent boy, that is, one who collects rent, and then when that falls through, he takes up the more romantic job of bike messenger.  It's still seedy, but as House describes it, it's wonderfully sexy and makes a man forget his troubles, in Procter's case a withered sort of arm--really an affliction out of Nathaniel Hawthorne--an affliction of the soul, symbolically transmuted to his body.<br /><br />It wouldn't be Richard House without a strong gay sex plot, and here it is again, as Ian Procter falls for a fellow biker called Peter.  The two of them have at it as though the Wolfenden Act was just signed on Tuesday.  Born in Cyprus, House has a sensual languour and challenge that escapes many of his UK colleagues, and when Iam's friend Malcom winds up dead, his body at the bottom of a staircase, readers with long memories may call up to mind the Gothic splendors of the old Paramount ghost classic THE UNINVITED (1944) in which swift deaths were dealt out as impartially as Fate.  House's book is a splendid addition to the bookshelf of crime, fear, and the f--kedupness of things in general.	2005-03-30

I kept thinking that \\"Mom's\\" story was the invention of a Hollywood screenwriter and didn;t ring true.  Outside of that, the only false note was DiPego's suggestion that a streert person prominent in the storyline might actually be a famous recluse whom another character in the book has been trying to find all along.  This is Ross Macdonald territory and even he could hardly ever carry out such a preposterous plotline.<br /><br />I liked Cheevey, he is an admirable young man, decent in every respect, thoughtful, kind, loyal, and good at heart.  His horndog crushes on two older women are appealing.  You'll laugh out loud at the one part where one of them enters the bathroom where he's taking a shower and in distress he turns his back on her, waiting for her to leave.  \\"You turned your ass to her?\\" exclaims his best friend, later on, while Cheevey tries to explain himself.  \\"What could I do?  What d'you think, I flashed her?\\"<br /><br />The brother, Phil, and the sister, Mari, carry around most of the psychic baggage of the parents' miserable alliance.  Like a good younger bro, Cheevey tries to help each of them as they enter their own crises, while trying to minimize the pain he's feeling too.  When Mari's little boy, Ballyhoo, develops some troubling symptoms of neurosis, Uncle Cheevey is the first to spot the ways in which the cycle of abuse keep coming on over and over again if unattended and unspotted.<br /><br />The book will make you laugh and will make you cry.

On the one hand, a lavish cookbook with recipes taken from the finest restaurants in the world, and on the other, lovely music drawn from Sharon O'Connor's historic past as a musician and record producer.  On the Italian CD, you get a very fun band playing background music for when you dig in to her recipes.

You won't believe you're eating something not too far removed from ordinary chicken parmesan.<br /><br />But oh, the difference is delectable!

She wasn't always the nicest person, and she's not ashamed to tell all about herself.<br /><br />Along the way, she met many of Hollywood's greatest stars and creative talent, and she has a knack for isolating their traits in a way that gives us a concise impression of each.  Mia Farrow was \\"kissed by the fairies.\\"  Kate Hepburn was so generous to old actors that she kept an open account at a shop in Westwood Village so that any old actor who needed a cane could go in and get one for free, compliments of Miss Hepburn.  Rock Hudson was spoiled and self-centered, as was Elvis, who would walk away from any conversation if it veered away from himself.<br /><br />People thought that Martha Hyer married \\"up\\" when she got hooked Hal Wallis, the famous producer who made CASABLANCA and TRUE GRIT.  What no one knew was that Hal was horridly cheap and Martha had to finance their marriage entirely through her own pocketbook and the profits of having made 50 or 60 movies all over the world.  Before she knew it, Martha was a pawn in the hands of underworld loan sharks who made her life a living hell.  She owed them literally millions of dollars and they forced her to do all kinds fo things she abhorred.  It was blackmail, pure and simple.<br /><br />There was only one way out of her dilemma.  She gave herself up to Christ, who put her on to a book that had been sitting, ignored, for years on her library shelf, LIVING THE INFINITE WAY by the mystic Joel Goldsmith.  Thanks to that book, she found the solution to her impasse, renewed the trust of her marriage to miserly Wallis, and moved to Santa Fe.  It's a shame she's not on the screen any more, but happily, many of her best movies are now being released on DVD.<br /><br />She was \\"Universal's answer to Grace Kelly,\\" and while never as complex a screen presence as Kelly, she had her own grace and gravity.

I was slightly startled to discover that she has apparently abandoned natural foods guidebooks to producing a new line of light novels about women with occult powers who share happy times and sad with each other in an area of Massachusetts not too far removed from the \\"Salem\\" of the witch trials.  I decided to give these books a try and happened on the brand new one, which seems to be the third in a series which includes CIRCLE OF FIVE and CHARMED CIRCLE.<br /><br />The new \\"CIRCLE\\" book is called THE DIVINE CIRCLE OF LADIES MAKING MISCHIEF, an awkward title but one that aptly describes the nonsensical and magical camaraderie among these five (5) women whose backgrounds couldn't be more different, but who share a certain supernatural flair.  Cassandra owns a herbal preparatory that mixes up cosmetics which are not tested on animals, and she is pretty much the guiding spirit behind this circle.  I predict that this series will appeal to some of the same people who watch ABC-TV's massive hit DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES.  Like HOUSEWIVES, it assembles a group of wacky women who come replete with secrets both domestic and deadly.<br /><br />Little Scruffy, the pooch, gets in many of the best zingers, just as in DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES it is the dead narrator who has all the best lines.<br /><br />I wish Ms. Riccio would produce another guide to natural foods, perhaps with updated health information, but in the meantime I wish her luck with her humorous and heartfelt series of CIRCLE books.	2005-03-28

Mark Twain, Ambrose Bierce, Gelett Burgess, and Jack London, are but a few of the more famous names of those who have written up these spooks over the past 150 years, and Rand Richards includes tales by all here.  The front cover gives the clue, it is a ghostly photo by Larry Moon which was recreated in Hitchcock's famous thriller VERTIGO, likewise set in San Francisco that is even now becoming a dream, the SF of the immediate postwar era when gaslight was still within the memory of living man and woman.<br /><br />There are also interesting reminscences of the bell tower of the San Francisco Art Institute, written by Antoinette May.  Ms. May interviewed several artists who happen to be quite well-known, among them Bill Morehouse, Hayward King and Wally Hedrick.  Alas, since they testified about the 1947=1948 apparitions of the bell tower ghosts, both King and Hedrick, two of the six artiats and poets who began the famous \\"6\\" Gallery in San Francisco, the place where Allen Ginsberg first read HOWL, have passed on.  Richards rings the multicultural bell by including Hayward King in his book, for so often when compiling ghost stories the experience of African-American participants is neglected, and King was one of the notable black artists of the 1950s through the 1980s.<br /><br />I also like the story of the haunted penthouse of Pat Montandon.  In May another book will appear called OH THE GLORY OF IT ALL in which young Sean Wilsey, the son of Pat Montandon, will expose her as a kind of second rate Auntie Mame, but his book glorifies her haunted penthouse as a sort of atelier of ghostly ambition.  In San Francisco there are always stories within stories, and once in a while a drop of truth squeezes out like a tear.ar.	2005-03-26

That's what this book does for poor deceased Lewis Grizzard, sportswriter. columnist, southern humorist.  The editor claims this is a book written by \\"those who knew him best.\\"  That's a dangerous practice because these so-called friends not only knew where all the bodies are buried, they're providing maps.  Poor Grizzard was a bad drunk, a womanizer whose love life was ruled by his d**k, a cheat and a bipolar, self-centered son of a gun who could not be trusted worth a darn.  And that's his friends talking.  You can imagine what his enemies say about him.  All the old charges of him being a racist and a homophobe are once again dredged up, if only to give him the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />To be fair, the book is filled with valuable information.  The trouble is, after he went to college, his life really wasn't that interesting.  He felt enslaved by the system of publication.  Sure he was a best seller, but he felt that something was always gaining on him, \\"You're only as good as your last book\\" syndrome.  Thus, even though he had many best sellers, he was deathly afraid of running dry and also that his vast public wouldn't like him any more.  He was also paying alimony to three ex-wives, all of whom he stopped loving whenever someone younger came along.  Except Nancy, wife #1, for whom he carried a torch for many years.<br /><br />Poor Lewis Grizzard was haunted also by the revenant of a ne'er do well Dad whom he adored, but who was a terrible boozehound and even as a boy, Lewis was often forced to clean up after his own father and to apologize for his father;s frequent passing out.  How sad when he himself began to exhibit signs of acute alcoholism himself.<br /><br />What a sad book and how ironic, for has any other author brought so much joy to his readers?his readers?	2005-03-25

In three sections, SOMEHOW manages \\"somehow\\" to replicate a whole world of existence, from birth through death, often by concentrating on the little things, the quieter moments that are often ignored in contemporary poetry.  The \\"haiku\\" form which he takes up in one poem might be said to explore this tendency in a spectacularly compressed way, but there are no such fireworks in Kimmelman's writing, which is all to the good.<br /><br />He includes a few ekphrastic poems here (poems written to works of art or to pieces of music), which ordinarily I don't care for, but these two, on Richter and Sol LeWitt, are pretty fine.  They don't hit you over the head saying, \\"I am to poetry what Gerhard Richter is to painting\\" or anything of that sort.  People say that sometimes you can \\"read\\" a poet's work by noting first the names of those to whom he (or she) mines for epigraphs, ad I've never been so convinced of the verity of this generalization as in this specific instance.  Kimmelman's epigraphs tell us who are his masters (say, Zukofsky, Chaucer, Gary Snyder) and include some lesser lights to make him more human (Michael Heller, Ronald Johnson, William Bronk).  Or maybe he is telling us that Johnson and Bronk are the equals of Zukofsky--many poets are coming around to that point of view--but in that case I'm not going there with him.<br /><br />What is astonishing is the middle section, in which he writes poems about a daughter, Jane, from her birth to age 11, in different poetic styles, but always seeming to catch the exact delicate moment of youth and to tabulate its changes from year to year with the feathery hand of grace.  And the final section breaks your heart with its simplicity and its weathered gravitas.  I wish I had space to quote the whole thing, but it's twelve poems, \\"Late January,\\" \\"Late February,\\" and so forth, poems quite brief, nearly negligible, but taken in succession, we feel while reading this sequence some Arnoldian sadness as though yes, we are very late in this spell of late capitalism and even nature feels as though time were running out.  Here is a mood and mode entirely bypassed by Zukofsky, who otherwise seems to have already mastered, like Shakespeare, so many other and subsequent poetic ideas and tropes.  In SOMEHOW everything comes together so beautifully you will just feel sad it's ended instead of with a breath of relief as in other, overextended books of US and Continental poetry.y,\\" \\"Late February,\\" and so forth, poems quite brief, nearly negligible, but taken in succession, we feel while reading this sequence some Arnoldian sadness as though yes, we are very late in this spell of late capitalism and even nature feels as though time were running out.

Back then people read it for Osborn's portrait of himself as Jim Hart, the young, idealistic law student, still kind of a do-gooder underneath the long hair.  Jim busts his ass trying not just to pass but to excel at Harvard yet runs afoul of the dread Professor Kingsfield, whose course in the bleak Langdell Hall is legendary for being arduous and still finally rewarding.  Now, thirty years on, Osborn has attained Kingsfield status himself as he teaches nearby at the law school at USF (University of San Francisco, the Jesuit School here in SF), and students are said to quake outside his office door but, once they encounter his warm smile and kindly handshake, the fear abates.<br /><br />I hate to disagree with a previous reviewer who said that Osborn's novel is a 1960s revision of a 1940 novel.  I don't think so, my friend.  You must be getting your facts wrong from someone else.<br /><br />The TV version and the movie version of THE PAPER CHASE fleshed out the rebellious, seductive daughter of Kingsfield, and the movie version was notable for the scene in which Jim was caught in her bed and had to leap out the window is just a pair of boxers to escape the professor's wrath.<br /><br />Harvard, which allowed no women into its law school until the 1950s, was paradoxically proud of its law program, and they say this novel (together with LOVE STORY by Erich Segal) caused the flurry of admissions for Harvard to leap up 200 per cent when it was first published.	2005-03-24

Though she steadfastly guards her own privacy, Juliette Cunliffe has established a reputation as one of the world's great experts on toy and rare breeds.  MALTESE, which she wrote for the Kennel Club Dog Breed Series, is a fine example of her work.  Perhaps not as carefully researched as PUG or SHAR PEI, two of her other classic works, the love is obvious as you turn over the pages of her book.  She cares for the humble Maltese, with its so-called \\"bridal veil\\" of white fur that tumbles over its brow and forms a fringe over its cute little black eyes, eyes which sparkle with affection and aristocratic breeding.  On the other hand, you never get the feeling that Cunliffe has actually owned a Maltese herself, whereas her feeling for the Bichon Frise emanates throughout her handbook BICHON FRISE and the KING CHARLES SPANIEL book has a similar warmth to it which is oddly lacking in MALTESE.<br /><br />She is also very good at the racing dogs and her book on WHIPPER and GREYHOUND have some good tips in them.  Of course the little Maltese will never be a race dog.  His heart is closer to the ground!

Why not just read the books the two editors have ripped this material out of?<br /><br />The bonus I guess is the frank Korean War journal which has not been published.<br /><br />In his declining years Faulkner published a similar book BIG WOODS, composed largely of excerpts from books still in print, given his imprimatur as a volume of hunting stories, and his publishers encouraged Faulkner's audience to think of it as a new book by virtue of its new juxtapositions.  Now Salter is getting the Faulkner treatment.  So be it, but don't expect all the readers to be happy about paying money once again to a speciality publisher for a lot of stories we heard just a few years back when Salter published BURNING THE DAYS (1997).  He's great and all but he's no William Faulkner.	2005-03-24

She and Lloyd Bridges, with whom she was together for 60 years, had to find space for themselves, with Lloyd's acting career and her determination to be a good mother and housewife, even if it meant having to tamp down her natural creative inclinations.  But she had time for her poetry, and every year from the 1930s till the 1990s (and even today) she wrote out a valentine poem for her husband.  (There are some touching little valentines on display from Lloyd to Dorothy, but the bulk of the book is her collection of her annual poems from then to now.)<br /><br />Even after he died she found herself continuing the tradition, and some of the best poems in the book demonstrate her helplessness and the indignity of loss.  They are heartbreaking.  Heartbreaking too were some of the losses which she frankly describes in this memoir.<br /><br />Such as the way HUAC came down hard on Lloyd Bridges, forcing him into a graylist until SEA HUNT came about and the whole US public got behind it, effectively telling Senator McCarthy, we don't care about your anti-Communist crusade!  Sad too, indescribably so, was the crib death of another of Dorothy's little boys.  And she mentions in passing that in fact Lloyd wasn't a perfect husband and that there were occasional affair-ettes on the side (on his part not hers).  But all in all it was a reasonable successful alliance by any standard, and many of the valentines attest that one way of measuring success is that the children of the marriage feel loved.<br /><br />All the surviving children seem very content and very aware that they grew up in a very loving family.	2005-03-23

In particular, we gasp at the perilous journey Chjekhov, the nephew of the playwright Anton, took when it became clear he had turned into an enemy of the Soviet state.  It makes you wish there was a full-dress biography of Beatrice Straight and her parents, the chatelaines of Dartington Hall in England.  The talent they assembled there, including Chekhov, Kurt Jooss, and Benjamin Britten, turned the estate into a splendid arts factory, training Hurd Hatfield and Yul Brynner and many more.<br /><br />When Chekhov went to Hollywood, he appeared in nine films of varying quality, including SPELLBOUND and the SPECTER OF THE ROSE, both written by Ben Hecht who had an affection for the old rascal who came dripping \\"Russian sugar.\\"  The young actress Mala Powers, seen as Roxanne in the Jose Ferrer film of CYRANO, makes a prominent appearance here, as the keeper of the flame.  She is the executrix of the Chekhov estate.<br /><br />Chekhov somehow evaded the scrutiny of the House Un American Activities Committee but maybe it would have caught up to him had he not died--oddly enough on the very same day as James Dean did, so his death slipped out of the public's consciousness and many think he is still alive.<br /><br />A marvelously written tome.  I saw only one mistake, Marowitz--himself a famous director and theorist--apparently thinks that Orson Welles appeared in John Farrow's THE BIG CLOCK; it only seems that he did, for it was actually Charles Laughton.	2005-03-23

The famous and the hip are high up on the list of Vicki MacKenzie's priorities, and perhaps the talented and the rich make better interviews, but reading so many of them in one clump would make a novice feel that if you're not in the \\"in crowd\\" than the Buddha doesn't want you in his religion.  Which is not the case, not really.<br /><br />Many Buddhists in the USA will tell you that they have drifted into Buddhism naturally, finding in it a place to forget about the cares and the oppressions of the Western way of life.  They are emphatically not drawn to it because of its reputation as a nearly 100 per cent white practice.  Indeed the few people of color who take to Buddhism are often treated like heroes of sanctity in the Buddhist circles of America.  In meditation, we can all be color-blind.	2005-03-23

It's also the earliest example of Steinbeck's success at the short novel, a form he excelled in, often enough planning each one is two forms at the same time, a short novel and a play based on the same materials.  There's a way in which Tortilla Flat sacrifices its dramatic oomph to the laissez-faire attitude its easy going characters embody, but it's still charming from beginning to end.  The story of Danny, the loyal and trustworthy man with a cadre of shiftless pals who move into his casa without so much as a by-your-leave, is funny throughout, and his crush on Dolores \\"Sweets\\" Ramirez is sweet and funky.<br /><br />Yes, there is a lot of wine drunk in this book, but in the context of the times (Depression era 1934-5) and the extreme poverty of the region, we can easily see why people drank even more than usual.<br /><br />There was also an old movie of TORTILLA FLAT which cast Spencer Tracy, John Garfield and Hedy Lamarr as Mexican Americans.  It actually turned out to be a good movie, but it's hard to get past the idea that there weren't enough Latino stars to cast the movie more authentically.	2005-03-22

I loved reading her book about filmmakers with Italian heritage in their blood.  And many of them are actually born and bred in Italy, and some of the conversaziones (interviews) were conducted in Italian and translated back into English by Baldassare.  This book is titled in a funny way and it's not a terribly applicable title, which is probably one of the reasons it failed to do well on its initial run, because \\"great\\" or \\"poor\\" these are men of honor, and not dictators.  Anyone who's been on a set on any of Steve Buscemi's films will know right away, he's a gentleman from the inside out, from the toes up as my grandfather used to say.  Never a harsh word, nor a Fascist leaning, the opposite of what you think of as a dictator.<br /><br />The surprise is learning that the aggravating Roberto Benigni has a thoughtful and reserved side to him.  Of course, Ms. Baldassarre interviewed Benigni before he made PINOCCHIO, and perhaps the fame hadn't hit him yet.  Remember him jumping up and down trying to look into Sophia Loren's cleavage the night he won the Oscar?  Pathetic!  And yet in this interview it's apparent he's familiar with Kierkegaard and Sartre and a dozen other philosophers.  I did not realize that Franco Brusati wrote the screenplay for one of my favorite movies, Zeffirelli's ROMEO AND JULIET.<br /><br />It was interesting to find out also that Don Coscarelli, the American auteur who made the PHANTASM movies, came from Libya like Moammar Gaddafi.<br /><br />Now, there's a dictator for you!<br /><br />But, why no women?	2005-03-22

Did De La Pena write his own diary or not?  Was it a forgery written years and years later?  Groneman knows that on this work a lot of our interpretation of the \\"13 days\\" depends.  He introduces the material carefully, and weighs the pros and cons like a pro rather than a con.  But all in all, when we get to the end of the book, most people will still feel that they donb't really know what happened, for most of the truth is lost to the mists of time, and when you go to the memorial and visit the Alamo site, you are struck by the sadness of it all (and also, as many have noted, by how small the building itself must have been).  In comparison, the movies paradoxically create their own reality; we see a mighty building peopled with real, breathing people with virtues and faults and problems we can apprehend (John Wayne, Lawrence Harvey, Dennis Quaid and all the rest).<br /><br />Out of Groneman's Alamo books, this is the one to buy, even though it has the least amount of \\"him\\" in it.	2005-03-22

Palacios is the Panamanian-born New York based author of several children's books and she has always done a fine job re-telling the legends and folk tales of the indigenous people of Peru, Latin America, Central America, even the Spanish speaking people of the West Indies; and she has often provided for the children of those lands up todate and accurate translations of the beloved US children's writers (like Beverly Cleary).<br /><br />VIVA MEXICO is a little diofferent for her, but it just goes to show you, a talented writer doesn't have to depend on re-telling the same old folk tales.  This book is a remarkable book of history--with no talking animals here--and it just \\"happens\\" to be written for kids, with cute illustrations in bright, primary colors, and it tells the story of Benito Juarez, a boy from the Zapotec Indian tribe who grew up the lowest of the low and yet somehow found it within himself to climb and scratch his way to the Presidential Palace of Mexico City and sit on its throne there.<br /><br />Life wasn't all peaches and cream for Juarez, for he had to fight one of the bloodiest battles ever fought on this continent, the so-called Battle of Puebla.  It so happens that this battle took place on May 5--in Spanish we say, \\"Cinco de Mayo\\" and school children and patriotic adults celebrate it everywhere we honor the spirit of a free Mexico.<br /><br />It's funny hearing the explanation of phrases you've heard your whole life long and never understood the meaning of, and that's why we are so grateful to author Palacios.<br /><br />By the way, this book, like the AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MALCOLM X, was edited by the great Alex (ROOTS) Haley.  Maybe one of these days Sra. Palacios will drop her cloak of silence and pen an autobiography of her own, revealing among other things what it was like to work with Alex Haley while creating her own masterpiece.

Who knew that among his many skills was the ability to write a novel too?  ASPHALT stands by itself as one of the year's most interesting novels.  Have you ever seen the Altman movie, QUINTET, with Paul Newman?  If so you will be viscerally reminded of that movie when you begin creezing through the opening chapters of ASPHALT, the ones that establish Racine as an underground DJ par excellence and the rundown brownstone he camps out in becomes a sort of United Nations of lost souls, each tenant lonely and frustrated, and frightened for the future, each one coming from a different post-colonial background.<br /><br />In the Altman film, which treats a similar post-apocalyptic future, the survivors were largely white, even blue-eyed (including Newman, and co-stars Bibi Andersson and Nina Van Pallandt).  There were a few \\"Latin types\\" including Fernando Rey and Vittorio Gassman, but outside of that it was all about racial blankness amid the Alaska tundra.  Here the Brooklyn setting and the rapid back-and-forth flashbacks jarred by the frequent musical interludes give the reader the sensory excperience someone like David Mitchell is aiming for in books like CLOUD ATLAS.	2005-03-21

Now, nearly seventy years later it is in print in a lovely edition from New Directions, his longtime publisher.  This was his first play to receive a production; he hadn't even adopted the sobriquet \\"Tennessee\\" yet.  It's a piece of social realism, relatively speaking, and the main characters are coal miners and the activists who seek to unionize them.  Underneath it all you can see the outlines for the play of power and greed that became SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH several decades in the future.<br /><br />A bleak chorus of coal miners speaks in poignant Walker Evans terms about the terrible lives they are forced to live in the Depression.  \\"My kids are swole up in the belly from not gettin' fed.\\"  Another agrees, \\"Yestiddy I caught my youngest puttin' dirt in her mouth.\\"  Third Miner: \\"Hell, mine eat grass for supper.\\"  Against the darkness a tremulous love story, between \\"Star\\" and \\"Red\\" struggles to see expression.  STAR: \\"I didn't want to be tied down with Jake Walland or any of his kind.  That's what I meant by wanting freedom.  Now I don't want it any more.

It's scary, too, really frightening when Brian looks out the window and finds the automaton sitting balefully in the middle of Madeleine's garden.<br /><br />Best of all, the ending is a surprise, a shocker.  Often when i read Carr I feel that he's been so busy putting together an impossible crime that he allows \\"any old suspect\\" to be the killer, but here THE CROOKED HINGE has an almost Agatha Christie feel, it is really the \\"least likely suspect\\" who commits the crime.<br /><br />Does Carr play fair with the reader?  He may think so, but I don't.  For example, how many times does Dr Fell assure Brian and the constabulary that \\"only one person\\" was responsible for all of the crimes?  And then, the final chapter tells a very different story, doesn't it?  (Fell says it was necessary to prevaricate in order to smoke out the more heinous of the killers.  But that isn't playing fair, if you ask me.)<br /><br />One note that may amuse, during the flashback sequences, during the struggle of the two John Farnleighs during the sinking of the doomed TITANIC, I kept waiting for Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet to float through and say hi, or perhaps to rescue our heroes from their watery fate.<br /><br />The writing of THE CROOKED HINGE is so good that we forget that the whole premise of the book depends on an amazing, unbuyable coincidence, that one of the two John Farnleighs would consult the other on a professional errand without realizing who he was?  No way, I don't think so!  (I don't think I've spoiled anything by divulging that much.)  Carr's mysteries are always subtle, a disturbance of the atmosphere.	2005-03-20

Pike	Books	5	19	20	N	N	Sobering, Revisionist Look at the 1960s	Robertson, a writer new to me but apparently one of some renown whose other books I will be sure to look out for, has written a sobering account of the 196os through a particular prism, the charismatic Episcopal bishop Jim Pike.  Pike was a radical theologian and a moving speaker, whose positioning of himself as an effective force for change took him to what were pretty much the limits of free expression within the church through the 1950s and exploded, as did so much else, in the 1960s.<br /><br />Here in San Francisco he is still remembered, if vaguely, as the man who held press conferences (some of which were televised) at Grace Cathedral at the top of Nob Hill to discuss his latest activities, boycotts, rebellions, hirings and opinions on national and international affairs, not only on matters of religion, for he cast a wider net.  He wrote an article, \\"How My Mind Has Changed,\\" which made public his doubts about the Virgin Birth of Christ and about the three-personed nature of the Trinity.  He called for a stop to the practice of \\"speaking in tongues.\\"  More traditional Christians grew skeptical, then became resolutely opposed to his liberal ways.  His heavy drinking and his affairs with women caused his wife, Esther, to seek a divorce, and their four children suffered the most.<br /><br />One of them, Jim Junior, in fact killed himself in New York City, and this put the Bishop into a real tailspin.  Like Conan Doyle before him, he took to seances to raise the spirit of his boy.  And then he came to believe that he would find redemption out in the desert, and the whole world was shocked when his body was found in the wilderness.  Robertson recites all these numbing facts ably and with deep understanding.  The spectacle of a man's search for meaning is a brutal one, as he goes, punchdrunk, into one cul-de-sac of faith after another, but Robertson persuades us that, underneath it all, we are all human and we all make mistakes sometimes.  He has sympathy for even Pike's most outlandish choices, and his book is all the better for it.Pike's most outlandish choices, and his book is all the better for it.	2005-03-19

However if anything the shoe is on the other foot as PINK HORSE was published earlier than KNOCK--though it is true that KNOCK was written first.<br /><br />A memorable film was made of this novel, with Robert Montgomery in his noir outfit, and the lovely, mysterious Wanda Hendrix dyeing her hair to try to look Latina.  She doesn't look Mexican but she looks utterly fantastic.  And Thomas Gomez, surprise, a real Mexican to play a Mexican, an utterly unique casting call for Hollywood back in the day.  Gomez was even nominated for the Oscar.<br /><br />For some reason the film isn't available on DVD, indeed was it ever even on video?  However we have the book in this splendid Canongate edition.  Like Patrick Quentin's PUZZLE FOR PILGRIMS, it shows us Latin America through the slatted blinds of noir bleakness.  Hughes wrote one more splendid novel, IN A LONELY PLACE, and then several other lesser books.<br /><br />There was even a re-make of PIONK HORSE in the early 1960s, one of the very first TV movies, by Don Siegel who had also made THE KILLERS for TV.  This telefilm too has not been released on video.  THE HANGED MAN (with Robert Culp and Vera Miles) took the events of RIDE THE PINK HORSE and transported them to New Orleans, and threw in the Mardi Gras parade for good measure, even filming a bit of Stan Getz and Astrud Gilberto making winderful music together.  How about a two sided DVD release of RIDE THE PINK HORSE and THE HANGED MAN?	2005-03-18

The first man he runs into is someone from his home town, Donny Lee, the only one in England who might guess his secret--that he is underage.<br /><br />Thus the novel depends on an amazing coincidence which cripples its credibility right at the start.  However, once that nonsense is out of the way, we get a tender and yet exciting war story about the relationship between a flight crew and their pigeon.  Yes, you heard me right, apparently before each sortie over occupied Europe a homing pigeon was brought on board and used for all sorts of things, but in Kak's case, little Percy, exquisitely described by teacher Lawrence, becomes his only friend.  At first Kak is turned off by Bert, the pigeoneer, dirty and messy, slovenly and fragrant, butb then when he finds out Bert's \\"back story\\" he becomes more sympathetic, if horrified.  Because there but for the Grace of God went he himself.<br /><br />All the boys in the flight crew carry a lucky charm of some sort; one carries a handkerchief doused with a woman's perfume somewhere on his body, and young Kak wears a ring with a ray-gun on it.  He is a comics fan and loves SUPERMAN and BUCK ROGERS.  The epilogue reveals that all of this story was based on reality, and it is Lawtence's tribute to the brave Canadian boys who went to war against the Nazi menace.<br /><br />I didn't realize this was a book meant for kids, but it did strike me as improbable the ultra clean language of these bombadiers.  About the raciest thing any of them says is \\"Wheezy jeezy,\\"--oh, and one of the British speakers under extreme provocation exclaims, \\"What a bloody balls-up.\\"  Outside of that, dialogue is not Iain Lawrence's forte, but he is such a good storyteller that you will forgive him such primness.mness.	2005-03-18

In any case I think it's a cheap shot when a paperback changes the name of the hardcover because there will be many, like me, who buys both books falling for the misleading new title and thinking it a new book.<br /><br />What's great about Casey Sherman's book is that, although he's a little fellow, he had this great determination to avenge the death of a woman who died before he was even born, his mom's sister Mary, who died in January 1964.  Casey isn't a midget per se but he brings up his perceived lack of height several times in the book, leaving the reader feeling that this is indeed an issue in his life.  He is a powerful writer and delivers a book filled with regret and rage, and the eerie silence of a family touched by crime.  For in the Sullivan family there was a great loss, an empty space where once Mary had laughed and sang.  He digs up a certain amount of DNA evidence that makes it seem as though, whatever else he was guilty of in his crazy life, Albert De Salvo certainly didn't kill Mary, even though he was implicated in her death.  Casey Sherman analyzes the corrupt state of the police back in the 1960s and the ways in which pressure was put on top politicians to \\"bring in the killer\\" and it seems clear they didn't mind if they fried an innocent one, as long as the murders stopped.<br /><br />It was like JAWS in that, so many women were being killed in Boston, that tourism had come to a complete halt!<br /><br />Mary is smiling now that justice has been unearthed.  Good for you, Casey.  Warner Books, stop chiseling money out of the pockets of the citizenry!pockets of the citizenry!	2005-03-17

Because it was seen as Bing's follow up to the heavy drama of THE COUNTRY GIRL, which had starred Grace Kelly, Inger Stevens was compared unfavorably to Grace Kelly's classic good looks and acting ability.  Even though the critics anknowledged that in a glum part, Inger Stevens brought some life to it, she was dismissed as a Grace Kelly wannabe before her career got off the ground.  And Hollywood insiders and gossips were wagging their tongues about Inger and Bing.  Today, in the wake of \\"Bennifer,\\" their purported romance would make them \\"Binger\\" I guess.  Anyhow Crosby was notoriously caddish to his female co-stars, and most of them wound up on the scrap heap of Hollywood history, but for Inger Stevens, she was just beginning a romantic history that would see her careening from romance to romance like a bumper car out of control.  Who didn't she fall for?  James Mason, Harry Belafonte, Anthony Quinn, David Janssen, just about every guy who crossed her path who might as well have had \\"Trouble\\" written on his forehead.<br /><br />It was almost as if, as Patterson indicates, she had some kind of delusion about where to locate strength in a man, and life found her confused about what was real, what wasn't.  The druggy vacuity of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS seems campy to us today when we see it on screen, but it was the harsh reality of Inger's life.<br /><br />Patterson's book takes the high road in trying to separate out the rumor from the fact, and it opens up a lot of previously sealed doors.

I know that if I were a married woman living in Modesto, I might give an attractive, blond massage therapist a skeptical glance, but not after reading Frey's WITNESS, which she wrote to help defray the college expenses of her two mysterious children.<br /><br />Amber speaks her mind, and acts all innocent.  No one has accused her of being Albert Einstein--if she was gnarly looking I doubt that shallow Scott would have wanted to pursue an affair with her not one hour after being introduced by Amber's former friend Shawn Sibley, the woman who gave poor Amber the cold shoulder after realizing that Amber had technically committed adultery and also that she might have been the motive in the double slayings of Laci and little Conner.  However, by the end of the book I think it is Shawn Sibley who will regret the day she ever played Cupid with two such different people as Scott and Amber!<br /><br />Oddly enough Amber has nothing to say about Anne Bird.  I wonder if Anne Bird's book doesn't make Amber look bad enough.  Expect a second edition of Amber's book to come out with a few new pot shots pointing out the inaccuracies of BLOOD BROTHER.<br /><br />To sum it up, I used to think Amber was brave, to risk her life talking on the phone for the police to tape her conversations with Scott, who never really admitted anything, did he, but then I decided, she was also trying to get some more juice for her upcoming memoir.  Don't tell me she wasn't thinking of it even then!  Ask Gloria Allred if you don't believe me.he wasn't thinking of it even then!  Ask Gloria Allred if you don't believe me.	2005-03-17

Do teens really want to hear the story of THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO told all over again?  Actually, it is like THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO crossed with FIGHT CLUB, a truly bizarre mix.  (The jacket copy suggests it is like 8 MILE, which it is so not.)<br /><br />Poor Jude suffers through one appalling betrayal after another, as his father, his mother, his stepfather, and his best friend all do him wrong in terrible ways.  A long section has him fending off sexual predators in an adult prison where he has been interred after a conviction for heroin sales.  Talk about grim, and yet, you'd think it would at least be exciting, but it ain't.<br /><br />JUDE is a book in which no one is sympathetic.  When we first encounter Anna Grady, the smart, idealistic up and coming attorney from West Hartford, who turns out to be Jude's mother, we warm to her as we did to Sarah, the heroine of Morgenroth's previous adult novel KILL ME FIRST.  But then she just gets more and more nasty and self-centered, while Jude heroically goes to hell to help her career.  In the last fifty pages or so Morgenroth develops an unrealistic love story for Jude.  I guess that's her version of a happy ending but it is just as unconvincing as anything else in this disappointing excursion into YA noir.	2005-03-17

You can get a good collection of Jones' greatest hits, on the import LP WE'RE IN LOVE WITH THE WORLD OF JANIE JONES.  She later turned to the more lucrative world of prostitution and went to prison, where this book really takes off, because she befriended a notorious child-murdered called Myra Hindley.  First she stumbled across Myra's body--Myra had been assaulted and beaten by other prisoners, for everyone in England hated her for the crimes she had committed about 10 years before Jones met her.<br /><br />Then Myra began confiding in her, and opening up.  Well, Jones listened and listened, and sympathized with her, and agreed to help her appeal for parole, joining the venerable Lord Longford in fighting to get Myra freed.  But later, when she had time to think about it, Janie Jones changed her mind and wrote this nasty little book.  She (Janie) also made a great record with the Clash (UK rock group) who admired her trashy demeanor and limited vocal ability.  Look for that, skip this awful book.	2005-03-16

His reading of Stein is both deep and wide, and in a way his book is a reply to her famous AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF ALICE B. TOKLAS, for just as she became a legend only after leaving the USA to live in Paris, the same applies to John Graves and his status as living legend of American writers.  After an uneventful childhood, Graves found himself at 21 in the grandest adventure of them all, he joined the Marines in time for World War II.  A sniper took out one of his eyes, and he acknowledges this was probably all for the best because otherwise he would have led his squadron to Iwo Jima where casualties were out of hand.  Afterwards he became part of a second \\"Lost Generation,\\" trying to learn to write in Mexico, Mallorca, and Spain.<br /><br />If you know Graves' writing, then you keep searching through the book trying to find out the books he read and the dilemmas he pondered while writing his first novel A SPECKLED HORSE.  The lists are fascinating and his comments uncensored.  He strikes the novice as being outspoken, irreverent, lusty and always in love with one beautiful woman after another.  It is a book in the old style of restless young American wandering through the cheap capitals, dreaming of the great American novel.  I kept wondering when he would meet Robert Graves, and if the two of them would acknowledge they shared the same surname, but I was disappointed.  John Graves, he tells us, stayed away from famous people, even those who writing he admires.  On the jacket copy it says that he hobnobbed, as an expatriate, with the famous as well as the obscure (like the 400 pound, cryptohomosexual Park Benjamin), but this is not so and after a hundred pages or so, we realize we're stuck with him meeting a bunch of nobody drunks and whores.  But he's fascinating and his book is pretty good, dull only occasionally.	2005-03-15

People say she is disgusting, but they just aren't seeing the truth.  The truth is that Jackie, of all people, let Anne down by giving her away--and then even though Anne thought she loved Jackie later (after being reunited), how could she?  The seed of resentment had been planted long ago.  How can you look a woman in the eye, a woman who has given you away and kept your brother--who turns out to be a killer no less, and a cheater--and smile and say, \\"You're still my mother.\\"  The facts are that Anne grew up in an OK household, but how did Jackie know that when she gave her up so long ago?<br /><br />As Anne admits, she did some worrying about her own bloodlines, for if Jackie was so awful, and Scott a cold-blooded sociopath, aren't these things shared genetically by Anne?  No wonder she has chosen this path, she can get it off her chest, help the US understand more about the Peterson family, and also rake in over 1.2 million dollars.<br /><br />She'd have to be insane not to take up the offer of the publishers and agents.<br /><br />If they make a movie from Anne's point of view, I think Meg Ryan should play her, and Jeff Goldblum could play Scott.  As for Jackie, who else but Bea Arthur?	2005-03-14

A sequence of sonnets begins in the butterfly valley itself.  We have one here just south of San Francisco in Santa Cruz, and anyone who has seen one of these resting places for weary butterflies will recognize the perfection with which Christensen's poem is etched.  \\"Here gooseberry and blackthorn bushes grow;/ whichever of the words you eat, they make/ your life butterfly-easy to recall.\\"  Hats are off to translator Susanna Nied for supplying the neologistic \\"butterfly-easy.\\"  A 15 part \\"Watersteps\\" which uses what seems to be a very restricted methodology, shows off Christensen's formalism and gives us something to chew on intellectually.  The sources of the five voices perplex until the mystery resolves itself into a wonky question mark.  I did not care for the \\"Poem on Death,\\" until the end, when the stunning revelation arrives that \\"the dead lift the living/ up to drink.\\"<br /><br />The final poem, \\"Meeting,\\" is a bit like the lesser poems of the French poet Anne-Marie Albiach, and a little like the new track by Australian pop superstar Kylie Minogue, \\"Last night I lost my head/ And fell right back into your love./ I lay intoxicated / While angels circled high above.\\"  While Christensen remains on a branch of her own, in the tree of poetry, thank goodness for New Directions, bringing her to English so that they can begin to sketch out her entire taxonomy, for she has an oeuvre worth exploring in extensis.	2005-03-14

I was unimpressed at first when I heard she had taken to poetry, but after reading this book, bought for me by an insistent friend who said, \\"If you like Barbara Guest's poetry, you will enjoy this as well,\\" I guess I'm a convert, and you know what they say about converts.  Is there something painterly about A TABLE OF CONTENT?  The jacket copy says so, but oh, I don't know.  She's certainly proficient with words and uses them like boomerangs, they flail about her head like the wings of green and red parrots.  The poem, \\"No Palms,\\" uses an unusual device--both lines in each of its couplets *begin\\" with the same word, and she pulls this off wonderfully; again, it was something I didn't think could be done, nor did I think Ms. Tanning would be the one to do it.  Another device which would not ordinarily work is the way the poems are arranged, by alphabetical order, by title; usually a banal way of arranging work to divert thematic connections.  Yet here those connections constantly appear and grow, vinelike, from page to page.<br /><br />And finally her big gift is her voice itself, very different than that of Barbara Guest, a voice stripped of sophistication 9though not of wit).  Tanning may be advanced in years, but a sweet innocence and youth blossoms in the exquisite lyric of her \\"I.\\"  \\"If it isn't too late,\\" she writes, in 'Sequestrienne,' \\"let me waste one day away/ from my history./ Let me see without/ looking inside/ at broken glass.\\"  In these lines the idea of a 'looking glass' or mirror seems to float around the music of the verse without ever actually being mentioned.	2005-03-14

Its hero, Jack Burden, follows the adventures of a populist Southern politician called Willie Stark.  William Faulkner read ALL THE KINGS MEN and singled out the Cass Mastern story as a \\"beautiful and moving piece.  That was his novel.  The rest of it I would throw away.\\"  Pretty harsh words from Faulkner, but it shows you the regard with which Cass Mastern's story, \\"Cass Mastern's Wedding Ring,\\" was held in some quarters.<br /><br />But in other quarters, it was greeted with a puzzled shrug.  James Perkins argues that the Cass Mastern story is integral to the book, not some add-on extraneous story.  While you could conceivably publish the novel without telling this story, it would detract from the experience Penn Warren wants us to have.  In fact the British edition of ALL THE KINGS MEN simply omitted the whole novella length tale, not seeing the point of it.<br /><br />What this book reveals is that Penn Warren was developing this story for many years, and he was not entirely satisfied with it even after he had won the Pulitzer Prize and after a famous movie had been released starring Oscar winner Broderick Crawford.  He kept developing the story into dramatic form.  All in all, Perkins reveals, he worked on this material from 1937 to 1960 (of course releasing a lot of other books too, so he wasn't solely preoccupied with this story.)  Perkins includes a kind or meandering, pointless interview with dramaturg Eric Bentley, who doesn't seem to remember much, to bolster his story of Penn Warren's fruitless attempts to get a Broadway producer interested in the Cass Mastern play.<br /><br />Perkins also fails to persuade us that Penn Warren's surprise ending to ALL THE KINGS MEN (when Jack finds out his true paternity) was itself a double bluff and that Jack's real father was exactly who he was supposed to be at the beginning of the book.  I'm trying not to give away the spoilers here, although Perkins reveals them all by page ix of his introduction, so I don't know why I'm tying myself up in knots about it.  Anyhow, it'll be a cold day in hell before Perkins convinces anyone that his blue eyes-Mendelian reading of Penn Warren is anything more than a Baker Street Irregular type goof.<br /><br />It will be interesting to find out if the upcoming remake of ALL THE KINGS MEN, with Jude Law and Sean Penn, uses any of this scholarly material.

The movie version of Tompkins' book inspired a bizarre soundtrack by Stevie Wonder that completely derailed Stevie's career; and now come PARADISE FEVER, which describes what living with Peter Tompkins was like for a lonely, self-absorbed young boy at the dawn of the 1970s.  Ptolemy Tompkins knows how to write, and he paints an affectionate portrait of his \\"stupid\\" mother--she called herself \\"stupid\\" seemingly to prevent anyone else from calling her that, but actually she was smarter than her husband in lots of ways.  And even the father comes in for some sympathy.  But mostly it was a case of too much, too soon.  Peter Tompkins did some brave things in World War II, in Rome, as a spy in exile, and he specialized in garnering factoids from old libraries like the Vatican or the Library of Congress.  Soon enough he was leading the complete gonzo lifestyle, investing heavily in new age philosophy and the boon of free love.  Betty Vreeland moved in, Ptolemy's mom moved out--though not far, because she ws often needed.  Mom and Dad called the little boy \\"Ptolly,\\" which was bad enough.<br /><br />Though the book has some interesting things to say about the 1970s, Tompkins lets it get away with him, when it comes to describing how in later life he became addicted to heroin and to booze.  Then a great chasm of self-pity yawns, and so, ultimately, does the reader.	2005-03-14

It was an offshoot of similar work done by the US Army trying to figure out how to grow crops in occupied countries, particularly in the Far East and in postwar Europe.  Thus the experiment wa spartly one in Cold War control, and which regime could present a more socially-aware program of farmers' education than the others.  In some lands, as we know, Communism won the battle, though it lost the war in the long run.  However with US knowhow returned to American soil, LBJ was all over this like a wet hen, as revealed in the astonishing Caro biography.  This Corn-Green Manure report was one of many interesting projects that some called exercises in government boondoggle.<br /><br />It's a little bit technical but it was intended for an audience not only of scientists but of farmers as well, in the Hill Country anf the area around Prairie View, so there are effective maps and charts.  The subject matter may be pungent, but there's a bit of green to be spotted everywhere around the edges.  The report is dedicated to the memory of Sam Houston, one of Texas' authentic farmer heroes.	2005-03-12

Neither of them do a great job showing what kind of woman Ginger really was, though Furia has some scenes showing Johnny treating her as though she were nothing but trailer trash.  Let's face it, Ginger isn't going to be well thought of by any member of the reading public until she gets a full biography of her own.  Why not?  Ada had one--the wife of Vladimir Nabokov.  And after the two biographies of Johnny, we certainly need a life of Ginger as a corrective.  Lees hints that Johnny Mercer had a sexual identity problem.  Even if he did it wasn't Ginger's fault.  You know right away that as soon as some guy reveals that Judy Garland was the love of his life, well basically that is saying, well, he's gay.<br /><br />That said, Lees is very good about exploring the general shape of Mercer's career.  It was a skyrocket that looped and billowed all over the night sky, and he never wound up in the place you might have predicted for him.  His writing was sometimes ornate and flowery, but just when you had him figured out as a Swinburne of popular song, he could surprise you with something austere and simple (like \\"I Thought About You\\" or \\"Autumn Leaves\\" or \\"The Sweetheart Tree\\").  His writing changed with the times, and yet it seems timeless, like the moods of \\"Moon River.\\"  Gene Lees responds more than Furia to the claims place made on Mercer, from Savannah to New York to the famous Capital Records building in LA which he helped to build.  He remains an inspiration to songwriters everywhere; poets too.	2005-03-10

Here we get the whole nine yards.  The novel has a sort of Willa Cather flavor to its title (remember THE PROFESSOR'S HOUSE?), and Raboteau's combination of delicacy and broad strokes do call to mind a young Willa Cather.  But other bodies of writing are part of Raboteau's project too.  I think everyone who reads this marvelous novel will feel, like the blind man and the elephant, that she has grasped at least a good chunk of social and moral America that has never before been adequately described or taxonomized.  \\"The Professor's Daughter\\" sounds like a bookish title too, and this isn't that imaginary book, but a novel of raw power like Ellison's INVISIBLE MAN or Richard Wright's THE LONG DREAM.<br /><br />It is rather like Terms of Endearment written on a bigger scale, but with the same imaginative sympathy that Larry McMurtry brought to his suffering mother and daughter.  Here Emma (even the same name as the character Debra Winger played in the film version of Terms) isn't the one in the hospital, no, here it is her brother Bernard, the brother she has idealized for so long as the strong one, the tentpole in the family, now in a coma, a helpless mass of silent body parts.  From this deracinated body she must exercise all her powers of analysis to determine what happened to her brother, what happened to her family, and what happened to white and black people over the whole troubled course of American history.<br /><br />The storyline travels in jumps through time, back into the past and then abruptly, into the present while Emma cogitates.  Strange fragments of dreams take precedence from page to page over the ordinary privilege of narrative.  And we get a fair amount about the Negro Leagues too, so you might want to brush up on Ken Burns' BASEBALL video.	2005-03-09

There should be equal time for a book about JFK and the movies.  JFK appears everywhere in the American cinema, from THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE to PT-109 to THE GREEK TYCOON, not to mention his own real life romances with movie stars like Gene Tierney.  His father made a pass at becoming a tycoon during his own affair with silent star Gloria Swanson.  It might be, however, as Feeney suggests, that Nixon is a more natural film subject, if only because the shadows are darker when it comes to Nixon, and the contrasts between the light of California and the darkness of Watergate and Cambodia is more shocking.<br /><br />We knew that Nixon watched a lot of movies while he was President, but it's startling indeed to see him attending several movies a week even when he was \\"in between jobs.\\"  Feeney shows how Nixon and American film grew up at the same time, even though he may be stretching a point to cite De Mille's SQUAW MAN (1913) as the first American full length film, that's simply wrong.  You might as well call John Waters' SERIAL MOM the last American movie, since bizarrely enough that was the number one movie at the box office the day Nixon died (April 22, 1994).<br /><br />I liked Feeney's writing throughout, and the parallels he makes between Nixon's character, and the character of several American film heroes (like the part Jack Lemmon plays in THE APARTMENT) is always clever and rings surprisingly true.  There is something, perhaps, about identifying oneself as a member of the moviegoing audience, as Nixon did, that makes you a little more --what, passive? -- than other US politicians.	2005-03-08

He was going by the cover, not one of Chip Kidd's masterstrokes, and maybe by the author's photo, not one of Marion Ettlinger's best either.  In fact he looks a little frightening, as though he had lived through something horrid like the Rwanda massacre.<br /><br />But anyway as it turns out the book is an insightful one, and for all its complicated time structure of multiple flashbacks and its weighted load of interior monologues, it's refreshingly straightforward.  Matthew is all caught up in trying to figure out if his father's suicide is the result of his mother's long ago Lesbian affair.  Indeed the plot is rather like that of Hamlet, turned sideways.  In the meantime, and during his therapy wich isn't that interesting, he is now addicted to $.15 a minute phone sex lines, and occasionally to a bathhouse called the Downtown Club.  The scenes of Matthew addicted to anonymous sex aren't as arousing as one would hope.<br /><br />Maybe Knopf asked Galanes to tone them down because they just kind of lie there, flatly, like jellyfish.  When he meets Henry he complains that Henry is too perfect for him and that the \\"rockets red glare\\" isn't happening between them.  Towards the end of the book when he has his catharsis about his mother, Henry starts to look better and better and somehow he realizes that maybe he isn't such a sexual person after all.<br /><br />All of this is balanced pretty nicely.  It's not a book which takes in a whole lot of the world, and all the characters have lovely clothes and go to nice restaurants, and no one is poor, and Matthew has some kind of gallery job that is almost a cliche of the disaffected consumerist art queen--but these are minor defects in a novel which isn't trying to be a Zadie Smith or David Wojnarowicz, it's about money, class and privilege and in the long run, the novel is a bourgeois structure isn't it, this book just reinscribes that status with some chuckles thrown in, and a lot of introspection into the human heart.<br /><br />I enjoyed it and would recommend it to friends.ok just reinscribes that status with some chuckles thrown in, and a lot of introspection into the human heart. <br /> <br />I enjoyed it and would recommend it to friends.	2005-03-08

FRAGMENTS is a very overdetermined word, too, it makes you wonder why, after Kierkegaard and Barthes and all the other writers who used the word so precisely, if Baudrillard sanctions its use or is it a \\"clever\\" device of the translator?<br /><br />He's constantly fascinating, and quite a conversationalist, not a dull sentence in the book.  Did you know that in Japanese there is no word for \\"the subject,\\" nor for 'the universal,' nor again for \\"communication\\" itself?  It makes you realize with a start that if one's vocabulary is shaped with some words and not others, than one's conceptual limits will be quite different than someone else with a different language, where perhaps there are three hundred words for rice--or love.<br /><br />Ha, it's funny how Jean and Francois put down America for producing novels that last for manybe a thousand pages.  This is hypertrophy they say, linking it to America's search for empire and planet glory.  Well I have read some baggy monsters originated in France too.  Then he (Jean) will turn around and praise something like Abbott's wonderful FLATLAND, and we see that nothing artificially determined sways his likes and dislikes, and that for Baudrillard, cities and cultures alike are controlled by language, borders, and the shock troops that keep us all from understanding one another.  He follows Abbott in seeing God as an intuition, a vanishing point, very much as Antonioni found God in the American desert in Zabriskie Point.

Take a look at the family car, so beautifully evoked by McCarty's steady luminous colored pencils--it's definitely a prewar car, and the whole book is bathed in the sunlight of nostalgia for a simpler day in which even dogs and cats could lie down together at the end of the day like the William Blake poem about the lions and the lambs.  Hondo is adorable, as is his pal \\"Fred\\" (Mertz?) and Fabian is also quite cute with a perky little nose and a taste for turkey and a dislike for baby's grubby hands.<br /><br />The animals could step right out of a 3-D movie and come alive, they are so well portrayed.<br /><br />It is the kind of book that would make an author's reputation even if he were not responsible for the glowing Thomas-Kinkade like illustrations.  They fairly give off light like distant stars.	2005-03-07

Like many I have read very little by Bryher and know almost nothing about her, but I remember my grandmother delighting in her historical novels of British and Celtic bygone ages.  This book on the other hand is a modern day thriller, seemingly very much influenced by the spy thrillers of Nicholas Blake, the poet C Day Lewis, particularly his famous anti-Fascist tale THE SMILER WITH THE KNIFE.  Orson Welles planned to make TSWTF as a vehicle for Lucille Ball when he still had an office at RKO; it would have turned Lucille Ball into an anti-Fascist sculptress caught up in a very Graham Greene predicament.<br /><br />As a bonus we get a fine introduction by the poet (SWIRL) and scholar (CINEMATIC MODERNISM: MODERNIST POETRY AND FILM) Susan McCabe, who teaches at USC and who plans to write a full biography of the novelist Bryher.  Not only that, but we get an afterword also by McCabe which puts this novel into context in any number of senses, linking this book to Bryher's other fiction, and seeing the parallels between the age in which it was written (the 1960s) and the Hitler era in which Bryher used her money the right way.  And today when so many of our civil liberties are being torn away from us one by one.<br /><br />VISA FOR AVALON grabs you from the very first word and won't let you go until the twisty end.	2005-03-07

A poem like \\"Aspiring, Now and Then\\" would be perfectly fine if written without line breaks: \\"I've climbed similar staircases/ before, ascending windowless/ cathedral towers up to high-wind/ belfries where birds swoop and circle,/ up to walkways to sudden sun/ shining on red-tiled rooftops.\\"  That's all very well, but why try to make it into a poem?  Well for one thing it allows you to make drama out of an ordinary set of steps.  (To say, \\"I've climbed similar staircases before,\\" as though she lived in a medieval village and had done this dozens of times before, is in itself a masterpiece of concise condescension.)<br /><br />People compare her to Wallace Stevens, to which I say, they haven't really read Wallace Stevens then.<br /><br />There are some good poems here, such as the poem about the \\"Stray Cat, Black And White\\" which will appeal to nature lovers among us, and lovers of cute little pets, of which I plead guilty, but this is not the stuff of which reputations are made, and seeing the amazing acclaim on the back of this book for Ms. Rogers it makes me despair of poetry overkill.	2005-03-07

Fisher is a talent of such a different sort than Michael Powell's that all we can say about David Lazar's taste is the word, \\"eclectic.\\"<br /><br />Lazar reprints (and in some cases prints for the first time) some great interviews of Powell, who's always sparkling and seems to be on in the great tradition of Peter ustinov (i.e., a born interviewee).  The brilliant film director Oliver Assayas asks perhaps the most probing questions, whereas Martin Scorcese, who is a special guest star in one of the interviews, doesn't really seem like much of an intellectual, does he--he lobs off all the questions and continually defers to Powell as the one with the brains.<br /><br />The only trouble with these 13 interviews is the amount of repetition, from questions that Powell has answered many times.  It's interesting to find out that John Sweet, the American serviceman who plays basically himself in A CANTERBURY TALE, never made another film but went back to his home town in the states, entered the business world, and years later showed up at a tribute to Pressburger and Powell with his family in tow, a happy man.  But then when you hear much the same story again, you lose interest fast.  Ditto with the repetitions of the same answers about knowing Hitchcock, Winston Churchill, etc.<br /><br />And what about the condescending way he refers to CHINATOWN as a studio movie unworthy of the genius of Polanski?  Clearly he hated CHINATOWN and he certainly minces no words about NEW YORK, NEW YORK (\\"horrible film with Liza\\").	2005-03-07

York	Books	5	52	54	N	N	Everyone wanted a piece of him	After reading his life of Mary Custis Lee, which was quite impressive and turned up many unique insights into a tragically misjudged lady, I sought out other books by Tennessee's own and only John Perry.  I found a copy of UNSHAKABLE FAITH, but it had mildewed badly and was nearly unreadable.  But faith must have led me to a path of light because on a dark shelf in an East Bay bookstore my hand crept down past a row of Elizabeth Peters books, and landed almost by a miracle on this earlier book by Perry.<br /><br />I knew very little about Alvin York, except that my grandfather, whose name was Alvin, always blamed the remarkable fame of Sgt York on the popularity of this previous unknown name.  He said when he went to school there were thirty-four boys in his graduating class called Alvin.  John Perry addresses this amazing renown.  His exploits in the Argonne Forest became the stuff of legend, and the Gary Cooper biopic in 1941 muffed the facts a bit to give York more of a country background than actually he had.  Many members of his extended family were quite erudite, and my grandfather always used to say that one of York's aunts had written the very first home economics textbook in English, predating Boston's Fannie Farmer by some years.<br /><br />Perry has a sincere way of writing, and the excitement doesn't let down when York comes back home a hero.  You see him doing good works in the name of the Lord and, although many politicians and lawmakers were ever ready and anxious to buy up a piece of his ass, hoping to enlist him into one or another misbegotten crackpot scheme.  To his credit York paid them no mind and just continued on his humble way.  As with his life of Mary Lee, Perry shows how a good writer concentrates on the facts and lets the legend go its own way, like a small boy cutting the string to a kite and waving it goodbye.  The truth is, what becomes a myth is something we have no control over, and Perry acknowledges this with good grace and a wry smile.<br /><br />Highly recommended not only to Tennesseans and to Christians, but to everyone out there interested in a good life story.recommended not only to Tennesseans and to Christians, but to everyone out there interested in a good life story.	2005-03-07

Evanier does a good job of showing what a great singer and entertainer Darin was, and how his legacy is still alive--the records sound brand new, as though he's right in the room with us.<br /><br />His research is astounding, and reading the book you marvel at how many people he got to talk about Bobby Darin.  Hesh (Harriet) Wasser is pretty wise, and so is wonderful Rona Barrett, who knew Bobby way back when.  The memories of Steve Blauner, Darin's manager in the late 1950s and 1960s, are always vivid although a bit self-serving.  Blauner always provides us with the unforgettable image of the valet bringing Darin three condoms to wear while dressing for a show because he was so into singing that he would ejaculate on stage.<br /><br />Evanier seems unfair to poor Sandra Dee, quoting scores of people who have unkind things to say about her.  Was it her fault that the marriage didn't last?  She wasn't the one who'd had two horrible earlier marriages.<br /><br />Evanier seems of two minds about darin's film career and at one point makes the astomishing statement that Darin made only \\"two serious movies\\" (out of thirteen)-- Pressure Point and Captain Newman, MD.  In this context WTF does \\"serious\\" mean?  I don't think he really likes movies.  You know he was problems with US cinema when he talks about the reason Darin went for Sandra Dee, she was America's sweetheart and her signature roles were \\"Tammy\\" and \\"Bridget.\\"<br /><br />\\"Bridget\\"?<br /><br />How about \\"Gidget\\"?  What on earth is \\"Bridget\\"?<br /><br />Also, I don't understand about the secret.  If Darin's \\"sister\\" was really his mother, and she was keeping a secret of his medical condition from him, and he didn't find out till 1968 that she was really his mother, not his sister, how on earth did Jacqueline Susann manage to write VALLEY OF THE DOLLS so much earlier, using all these events (including the marriage to Sandra Dee) in her roman a clef in the story of Tony Polar and Jennifer Welles?

Now I'm looking forward to reading the nove, STAGGERFORD.  If you can believe the jacket copy and the back of the jacket, STAGGERFORD is one of those beloved masterpieces like CATCHER IN THE RYE that high school students everywhere are assigned to read, and even though they grumble, they eventually fall in love with the book and take it to heart.  Even Hillary Clinton, says Mr. Hassler, has read STAGGERFORD.  I feel so dumb not having known about it.  Maybe I should have read the book before reading Mr. Hassler's 1975 journal describing the year he took off from an oppressive community college somewhere in Minnesota.<br /><br />He took time off to visit historic sites in New England, including the House of the Seven Gables and Walden Pond.  He makes an embarrassing faux pas inthe home of Emily Dickinson, in her bedroom, where like any other tourist he whips out his canera and the guide reminds him in a miserable shriek, \\"Cameras are not permitted in Emily Dickinson's bedroom.\\"  You can really feel his abjection as sadly he pockets his camera.  He's lucky they didn't destroy it I guess.  I had no idea that this house in Amherst is a private home and that you can see only two rooms, this bedroom and a sitting room.  Who would want to live there, it would be weird.<br /><br />Once STAGGERFORD gets published, by Atheneum, you get the feeling that finally Hassler gets some self-respect, indeed some balls.  He quotes Thoreau to beautiful effect; \\"If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in the common hours.\\"<br /><br />I didn't like the part where he encounters a colleague who praises him and tells him his own favorite line from STAGGERFORD, which is, \\"If you wish to befriend an Indian, feed him pie.\\"  I don't know, it just sounds a little racist.  Outside of that, the book is well worth every penny.Outside of that, the book is well worth every penny.	2005-03-07

Some of the plights Bob Flaherty has invented to torment his two young heroes with will make you laugh until your sides ache.  You'll have to put the book down, unable to take any more laughter.  At the same time, we catch occasional reminders that for the underclass of a great city, life is pretty much non-stop grim, and family isn't really that much of a help.<br /><br />The boys' mother, now dying of a terrible cancer in a crummy city hospital, was once a talented artist whose one attempt at getting a book of her work published met with a terrible and humiliating rejection.  John Gullivan, her son, is now 23 and the narratuve keeps bouncing back and forth between the snowiest day in Boston history, and different times in the past of the Gullivan family.  We see the next door neighbor, Dalilah, now a beautiful and sexy ingenue and one with whom John G. re-ignites his childhood romance with during this incredible day.  I kept seeing John Cusack and Minnie Driver playing the parts, except they're both too old now of course.<br /><br />I don't see why the book had to be set in the 60s and 70s.  The author doesn't really recreate a bygone era at all.  He tries to  milk this aspect of the book, but for me, these two numbnuts brothers could be having exactly the same adventures today.  No matter, the publication of PUFF reveals Bob Flaherty to be a comic genius on the scale of James Thurber or maybe John Hughes.<br /><br />PS, PUFF, it turns out, is the family cat--a monster indeed.	2005-03-07

Marilyn Janovitz's illustrations combine a soft palette of colorful pencils with a warmth and a luster you don't find in many children's books, more's the pity.  In a way GOOD MORNING isn't much of a sequel per se, it's its own story, and a less violent one than its notable predecessor.  Remember in the first on,e the whole plot was about how Mother and Father Fox were always going off on Little Fox about, don't jump on the furniture, or it might break?  That was so cute, but also the breaking up of the furniture was a little strong and might frighten younger kids.  However, a lot of children love shopping and much of the book involved shopping for a new chair to replace the one Little Fox destroyed--just out of sheer rambunctiousness, it's not that he was the Bad Seed or anything.  You might say he's a typical 4 year old.  Or 5 year old.<br /><br />In the present book we see Little Fox claiming that he doesn't like porridge just because he has overheard his dad say the same thing.  In this way we see the little boy fox taking the lead from Father Fox, even if at the bottom of his heart he does actually enjoy the porridge.  Janovitz shows how gender roles are built up and rigidly stratified just based on a few stray comments.  It's clever, but maybe lacks the punch of LITTLE FOX Part 1.  Folks searching for yet another Little Fox book should watch out for ZORRITO, which my children ordered anxiously and then they were all too disappointed to find out that it is merely a translation (into Spanish) of the original adventure with the chairs.  However, they learned a bit of Spanish from reading the book so, no harm done, indeed a bit of good may come of it.	2005-03-04

This novel is  strong, stark and powerful as a Walker Evans photograph.  It is actually more of a book of linked stories that happen to the poor people of Gloucester (Massachusetts) and environs; if you consider Faulkner's THE UNVANQUISHED to be a novel, you might agree with the author who calls BROKEN TRIP a novel in stories.  One character, the social worker Tony, appears now and again, but mostly these miserable working class peons revolve haplessly and tragically within their own addictions and die brutal, deracinating deaths, lodged in the cycle of poverty and violence like some kind of extraordinary phlegm in the throat.<br /><br />I must warn you that, although I grew up reading Hubert Selby Jr, the violence and the misogyny in this book startled even me.  The sexual contempt these characters feel for each other, when they have not completely deadened their erotic consciousnesses wth drugs, is bewildering, pathetic.  Anastas sometimes tries too hard to be graphic and the results can be a little on the campy side, for lashings of melodrama and obscenity-laden dialogue sometimes fail to add up to a convincing milieu, but in other respects this ia an amazing book and especially written in today's conservative political climate, it will remind readers of French literature of the argot of Pierre Guyotat's EDEN EDEN EDEN.  I always have wanted to pay Gloucester a visit, see what it is like, but now I know I never will, I fear I would be murdered should I set foot there.  Now that's power.	2005-03-04

While I am not a theologian myself I picked up this book and found myself immersed in the controversies behind the mysterious idea of the Trinity.  In the Bible the Trinity is revealed, but it was apparently the early Christian fathers who elaborated on the sketchy, elemental Triune of \\"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\\" that we learned as children.  And just as children ask puzzledly, \\"How can three different people be the same?\\" their older friends and counsellors are also still puzzled on how best to understand what seems on the one hand as a lovely metaphor for relationality, but to others with a more fundamental view, it is an actual fact of the universe.<br /><br />Cunningham notes that many of nature's little miracles seem to draw their inspiration from the three-pronged trident that is the Trinity.  When John Donne prayed, \\"Batter my heart, three-personed God,\\" he was bringing a metaphysical twist in to what had been heatedly argued over in Renaissance days.  THESE THREE is similarly divided into three parts, and no one would say that the three parts resemble each other in any way.	2005-03-03

But his father, Jim, hadn't heard from him in some time.  When he rang up the boy at home, a strange woman answered the phone.  Thus begins the true-crime puzzler TRAIL OF BLOOD.<br /><br />Poor Scott was only 24 when he met Leisha, the sort of woman who pops up in noir movies in the late 1940s to destroy the men who loves her.  Leisha was seeing a few other guys on the side, just to keep her hand in, but she hated being rejected.<br /><br />When Jim came to see the house she shared with Scott, he wondered why she had a big couch right over a patch of carpet and why an afghan was covering the spots the couch could not.  Once you pulled up the afghan and moved the couch, you could see where a huge section of the wall-to-wall carpet had simply been hacked out.  And Leisha pretended she had never noticed this before!<br /><br />Local police and the DA said to Jim, \\"Sorry about your son, but without a body there is no case.\\"  He was in despair until he turned on the TV and happened, just happened, to see a profile of the mysterious \\"Vidocq Society,\\" about which I will say no more.<br /><br />The book tells a lot about fathers and sons and it's a sort of plea to sons to keep in better touch with their fathers, and also to fathers, it gives the wise advice that you should cherish your son while you can, he may not be with you forever.	2005-03-02

The writing is so wonderfully witty you will wonder why ESCAPADE isn't revived as often as, say, the plays of Noel Coward or even those of Oscar Wilde.<br /><br />In the original (1953) production, Stella was played by the incandescent Phyllis Calvert, while Hugh Griffith created the role of Derson, a nosy but ultimately wise tabloid reporter who installs himself in the Hampden's London home to weather out the scandal.	2005-02-28

The book is nicely produced and, at 120 pages, is not exactly WAR AND PEACE in length, but I don't think you will get many complaints about people feeling ripped off for paying $17.95 plus shipping for only 120 pages, for the material is interesting and the charts and other visuals well worth the attention of would be moms and dads.	2005-02-24

Then the dilemma comes when they start wondering if they aren't really only characters in an absurdist play:<br /><br />\\"If we really are in a play, when it ends, we wouldn't know it.  We'd cease to exist.  We'd die,\\" argues Jane.  Ray counters with an offer to prove otherwise, bringing in a rubber ball.  \\"If I bounce this ball off of a wall, and it doesn't come back to me, then that wall isn't really real, right?\\"<br /><br />Somehow he convinces her to have sex with him if he can prove that the world is real!<br /><br />I'll be curious to see what the next book is from PulpLit, because they've certainly come up with an unusual collection this time.	2005-02-24

Carole and Naomi start an innocent bet to see which of them will lost her virginity first to the attractive young actor, Eddie Lindbaeck, a boy will go down in thriller history as one of the most menacing villains since Sydney Greenstreet played Count Fosco in THE WOMAN IN WHITE.  In a snowy ski camp in Stowe, Vermont, Carole stumbles into an awful trap and wakes up believing she has killed a local.  The rest of the book develops her strategies for putting this murder behind her.<br /><br />Like a heroine from Cornell Woolrich, Carole Mason is literally trapped by her past.  Pam Lewis has a talent for suspense, and the book will keep you up all night trying to figure out how poor Carole will stay one step ahead of both the police and her savage \\"friends\\" Naomi and Eddie.<br /><br />The story continues for years, through the summer of love in the Haight-Ashbury, to a Moosewood-like restaurant in the New England countryside in the 1970s.  Actually I don't know why Ms. Lewis didn't set the novel at a more recent time, there's actually no reason why the book had to be set in the 1960s, and her anachronisms are sometimes grating.  (Would a girl describe another girl as dressing \\"like Tricia Nixon\\" in 1965?  I don't think so.  Did young men snap, \\"Whatever,\\" in 1975, or was that usage a byproduct of the Valley Girl-speak of the early 1980s?)<br /><br />Every time I saw the words \\"Carole Mason,\\" I thought of the esteemed experimental novelist \\"Carole Maso\\" who teaches at Brown, and I wondered if Pam Lewis was pointing some kind of admonitory finger at Maso.  But that's just me.<br /><br />The publishers are marketing this book like it's some kind of cross between Donna Tartt and other famous writers (the book jacket and the book title just scream, \\"Hi, I'm by Mary Higgins Clark\\"!) but Lewis' talent is resolutely her own, and even though you may want to shake Carole Mason for being such a ninny, no one with a heart can deny her sympathy, and the scenes in which she learns to love and give trust have a genuine pathos, and an honesty that's hardwon and feels real.

And yet Emily Herring Wilson's simple, deceptively placid writing style hooked me from page one.  She promises, then she reveals, over and over again.  Lawrence led a fairly sequestered life after going to Barnard in New York City, where--as Herring Wilson's research among the Ann Bridgers papers at Duke reveals--she fell in love (or something like it) with a man who shortly afterwards married another woman and then died within weeks of the marriage.  When Peter died you can almost imagine Elizabeth Lawrence deciding that marriage isn't for her, and that flowers and gardens would henceforward be her entire solace.<br /><br />That, and a loving family, and a wide circle of friends, which expanded as her writing about gardens brought her the kind of fame every writer wants most--the admiration of one's peers.<br /><br />She met Eudora Welty and Katharine Angell White, though perhaps she was even more interested in people whom the world might think of as nonentities, but to Lawrence they were men and women after her own heart, people who understood plants.  When A SOUTHERN GARDEN was published in 1941, such people sought her out and sent her clippings.  When Lawrence said, \\"no one gardens alone,\\" she was alluding to this kind of invisible web of support.<br /><br />I will be interested in going to Charlotte and seeing the original gardens which (reports the author) they are going to try to restore in Elizabeth Lawrence's honor.<br /><br />Until then, I will be happy re-reading this amazingly interesting and beautifully written biography.	2005-02-23

Kathryn Forbes must have been a delightful woman and her book is one of the finest achievements ever to have been written in San Francisco.  And that's saying something, considering what a rich and cultured city ours is.  One episode that will stick with me forever is the time when the little girl and her brother are talked into providing food for their whole class at school, and \\"Mama\\" saves the day by cooking up some of her good old Swedish (I guess Norwegian) meatballs.  When I first read this passage I was but a little boy and had never heard of any kind of meatballs but Italian ones!  Next thing you know, my mom and dad took us to dinner and the waiter asked me what I wanted to eat and I surprised them all by asking for \\"Swedish meatballs on little tooth picks.\\"<br /><br />It's a family book for people whose families are no longer with us.  And it will rekindle the spirit of hope in everyone, with its message of universal tolerance and mother love.	2005-02-23

Liz Carlyle's a likeable enough sort, and her boyfriend Mark is appealing in his Jude Law way, plenty of slime around the edges.  When Liz finds out that the Al-Qaeda are back (this time, calling themselves the Al-Saeda, and changing their policies to admit Christians a la John Walker Lindh), all hell breaks loose at MI5 and MI6, where Afghan agents in the field have reported that there is an \\"invisible\\" working somewhere in England.<br /><br />An \\"invisible\\" can be defined many ways, and this is the intriguing part of this true-to-life novel.  An \\"invisible\\" can pass as an Englishman--or Englishwoman which would be more to the mark.  No visible signs of adherence to Islam will spoil the disguise of an \\"invisible,\\" nor no cultural baggage to get in the way of their evil.<br /><br />If you've seen the TV series \\"24,\\" picture it as re-written and played so that the Alberta Watson character, Erin Driscoll, is now the leading lady, then you will have an idea of the harsh counter-intelligence world of \\"At Risk.\\"  Stella Rimington, you have written other books flaunting your past connection with this dirty trade, and OPEN SECRET was far superior to this melange of adultery and spy jargon.

There are the two high school friends, Adam and Dart, both of them cute and Dart newly so, so he's not used to being cruised or indeed any kind of attention at all.  There's the gay cop Jeff, in his mid-thirties, who takes a shine to Adam a week before Adam's graduation day.  Adam's dad is a piece of work who needs more watching than any baby, and his mother has abdicated her place in the family in search of a hot career.<br /><br />The book is too long and some of the gay boys' banter is truly uninspired.  Dart complains of getting a B in English: \\"I hate Jane Austen.  She can take her pride abd her prejudice and keep em.\\"  But Krach has the power to keep you reading along despite every lapse in taste or sense.  He has the old standby of the novel, narrative drive, and he plays this card in unexpected places.  The unlikely love affair between Jeff and Adam plays itself out in a truly sexy way, so you're rooting for them both to score, and Krach plays with your expectations in this regard like a master puppeteer.  Only his puppets breathe and quarrel and drive fast just like real boys do.<br /><br />I don't believe in June 1999 when the novel is set that any one, except maybe a casting agent, would admire another character's looks by saying he's \\"built like Vin Diesel.\\"  Vin Diesel wasn't known to the moviegoing public in general for another couple of years.  PITCH BLACK and THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS were only lustful anticipations in the Hollywood dream factory.  But that's just a movie queen talking, and it's the only mistake in chronology I could see in Aaron Krach's complicated, rewarding novel of manners.	2005-02-22

She wrote the novel LAURA, for goodness sake, as well as much of the sprightly dialogue of Mankiewicz' LETTER TO THREE WIVES.  Her memoir tells a lot about what it was like for a young, not pretty Jewish girl with a closely knit family, to grow up in the early part of the century and feel the exhilarating effects of the first sexual revolution--that of the 1920s, complete with Volstead Act and Scott FitzGerald.  One funny bit is the advice of a hostess during Prohibition: \\"Gin should never be 'young,' it should be made at least half an hour before being served.\\"<br /><br />Her first writing experiences are horrible ones and it's a wonder she kept at it.  She was the editor of DANCE magazine and on the side started writing a play with Winifred Lenihan (the actress who had starred in Shaw's SAINT JOAN).  Helen Hayes, then the grande dame of US theater, kept them on the hook for a year and a half by promising to star in the play.  Pregnancy took her out of the role for awhile, and after she had her baby, evil Jed Harris gave Helen's mother a mink coat to help him steal her away for another play.  By the time Vera and Winifred's play hit the stage, it had been re-written by Broadway loudmouths to make it into a \\"dirty play,\\" which closed after two weeks.<br /><br />In the 1930s Caspary joined the Communist party, in the spirit of youth, and in the 1950s she came to regret it as she and her husband, IG Goldsmith, were placed on a kind of \\"graylist,\\" so that afterwards her movie credits are spotty.  Still she managed to prevail and write her novels, as well as such entertaining later films as Gene Kelly's LES GIRLS and BACHELOR IN PARADISE with the beloved Bob Hope.  (Well, not beloved by Vera).  All of this she relates in a wonderully understated way.  She was eighty when this book was published 25 years ago.  It reads as though a very lovely woman had kept all her joie de vivre and curiosity about life and writing.  Hopefully it will return to print.riosity about life and writing.

It's not too dense or difficult.  I imagine anyone interested in show music would be able to profit from the book.  She really has a treasurehouse of new ideas about what the makers of Broadway musicals might have had in mind, subconsciously or otherwise.  I had never really thought about BABES IN ARMS, for example, and the way she deconstructs the lyrics shows that somebody, somewhere was doing a bit of overdetermination considerating the ostensibly slight plot of the show--and yet the lyrics insist that a \\"war\\" is going on.<br /><br />Professor Most writes clearly and firmly, and yet she is intuitive enough to gently squeeze the meanings out of the most opaque surfaces.  I thought I knew OKLAHOMA, and yet I had never really looked at the way the main (white) characters are a bit smug when compared to the \\"racially different\\" characters like Ali Hakim, and yet how much Hakim and say Jud, and even Aunt Eller, yearn to be like the better integrated characters (Curley,  Laurey, etc).  It might be because the Jewish writers of the show were composing an elaborate allegory about assimiliation and difference.<br /><br />ANNIE GET YOUR GUN I didn't expect to find a chapter about.  And yet, it makes perfect sense when you consider that Annie herself is a radical outsider, not even knowing how to read, knowing really only one thing (how to shoot), she's almost the \\"wild child\\" of legend.  Her contrajuxtaposition vis a vis the native peoples (\\"I'm an Indian Too\\") for the first time doesn't seem racist, just makes sense.<br /><br />All in all, a book which will give you something new to think about on every page.	2005-02-20

White of music journalism.  He is careful to place the phenomenon inside a political and social context which included the passing of the Thatcher kingdom and the birth of \\"New Labor\\" as exemplified by the triumph of the young, music loving prime minister, Tony Blair.  And paralleling also the rise of the Young British artists llike Damien Hirst and or Tracey Emin.<br /><br />Against this changing backdrop of society and expectations, a new breed of British bands appeared all at once to world consciousness.  Oasis, Blur, Pulp and more seemed poised to take over the world the way that the Beatles, Stones and Kinks has once dominated rock 30 years before.  And yet within a few years, all this excitement had dried up, and the Gallagher Brothers were now seen only as a pair of drunken louts who slagged everyone they could, even their own wives and girlfriends.  Harris is good at depicting not only the appropriation strategies of these bands but the way they knew how to play themselves in the media against their American or Australian counterparts for maximum effect, culminating in the episode where Jarvis Cocker showed up at a Michael Jackson TV taping to denounce the black R&B singer, or the way that Noel Gallagher assailed Kylie Minogue for being a \\"lesbian,\\" or so he said.<br /><br />The Koran says, \\"In our beginning are our ends,\\" and this book Britpop! proves it over and over and over and over.<br /><br />Well done, John Harris.	2005-02-20

I had no idea, for example, that HOLIDAY SONG ws actually based on a Reader's Digest article about a man who encountered and reunited a husband and wife torn apart by Nazi violence in Europe during the war.  Chayefsky says he was given this article to adapt, but basically disregarded every part of it.  They didn't call it the \\"Golden Age\\" of TV for notbing.<br /><br />What strikes me is that he was so young when he did his TV work, and yet he was able to write parts for the elderly very well.  Will anyone who saw these productions ever forger the old cantor in HOLIDAY SONG, the veteran printer in the classic PRINTER'S MEASURE, or Cathleen Nesbitt quietly breaking your heart in THE MOTHER?<br /><br />It's amazing that a man in his twenties and thirties could see so deeply into the future of his own heart and his own old age--an age which he didn't really live to see.	2005-02-20

He is cool in all block letters, underline it and put it in bold!\\"  No one can figure out why Jason, a popular Detroit high school boy, is seeing Kyra, the brainy frump without a lick of fashion sense.  This book is sort of like the African American equivalent of a teen movie like SHE'S ALL THAT, but first time author Dana Davidson has the talent to give her characters real depth and to put them into situations which will bring out both the bad and the beautiful in them.  Jason's father for example, is a lonely man who has lost his wife to death and who experiences daily challenges as the only black male at a systems analysis company, and so he withdraws from his son and shows Jason only the cold, callous back of his hand, where's the warmth?  \\"Jay, do you hear me boy?  Then dammit answer when I call your sorry ass!\\"<br /><br />He just doesn't understand how much support and warmth a young high schooler needs to survive in a cold, cold world.  No wonder Kyra's understated affection is like manna to poor Jason.  The two of them then quarrel about having sex--should they or shoulddn't they?  Well, my friends, even when they don't they get up to some pretty sexy hijinks, so bring a fan with you.<br /><br />Good work, Dana Davidson, looking forward to more from your pen.	2005-02-20

Once she was a young girl--then a nun--then a rebel-- then she came out into the world again, sick and disillusioned with religion, with a pure hatred of God.<br /><br />Little by little did a queer kind of grace fall upon her upturned brow in a series of turns no one could have predicted.  Her quest for spiritual self-knowledge started all over again, and she wrote BEGINNING THE WORLD about 20 years ago as the full extent of these changes became clear to her.  I felt a little betrayed, having been a fan of BEGINNING THE WORLD for so long, to find out that Ms. Armstrong now regards her earlier book as a \\"mistake,\\" an abortive and failed memoir.  If this were so you'd think she would take it off the market and not accept any money for its sale.<br /><br />Such revisionism makes you wonder if, some years from now, her moody nature will change its mind once again and declare THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE as flawed and untruthful.  I hate to sound sacriligious but the singer Eddie Fisher wrote one autobiography, then twenty years later he did the same thing as Ms. Armstrong--denounced the earlier one and promoted the new one as being the real truth he was too blind to see earlier.  This said, it is still an amazing achievement, and she has such a beautiful prose style you might read this book even if it was presented as a poem by Walter Savage Landor.	2005-02-19

Jim and Val's Tugboat is one of the true \\"buried treasures\\" of Florida, and this guidebook has enough sense to put it in bold.

This guidebook will be a nice souvenir for you, even if you haven't been in Key Largo for some time.

She showed courage in defying the conventional wisdom of her day.  She loved children and small animals, and although we don't know much about her husband he must have cared for her through thick and thin.  After all, she was pregnant so many times!  Above all, Hutchinson marched to the beat of a different drummer and yet she had the good sense and the fortitude to agree with like minds.  When it came to founding the state of Rhode Island, for example, she made a few compromises and agreed to disagree with Roger Williams for the sake of the greater good.<br /><br />Eve Laplante, one of the millions of American descendants of Anne Hutchinson, has written an engrossing, if somewhat limited biography of her honorable ancestor.  Laplante excels in bringing us into the real fabric of the early Colonial era, what it felt like to have to make your own soap, to have to deal with native tribes some of whom understandably resented your presence, how it feels to see some of your children die before you.  Often she extrapolates from the known facts to bring us a richer sense of period and character.  Here and there, she goes too far, but I think on the whole her feats of intuition are by and large helpful.	2005-02-18

It has long been a \\"fact\\" in our family that Peter H. was sort of a Regency St. Francis, famous for giving away everything that he owned, even to the very shirt on his back and the money out of his pockets.  That said, Ms. Alexander is a skilled writer, marvelous at painting atmospheres, and both the frigid English manners and the warm, riotous Tahitian \\"adagios of islands\\" are luminously evoked.  She knows how to lay out a complicated story on several levels at one time, satisfying both the historian in all of us and also the child who likes to hear a romantic tale.  The book is beautifully done and I'm not surprised it has been an international bestseller.  Has it altered our appreciation of the famous movie with Gable and Laughton?  I think not.  All of the versions I've seen (including the one with Mel Gibson and the notorious Brando one) have some merit, and the story of conflict is one that keeps repeating itself over and over like a nightmare of civilization.  Caroline Alexander sees it as a class fable, in which poor old William Bligh may have whipped a few men here and there, but no worse than the way he was treated as a boy and young man.<br /><br />So continues the cycle of abuse, lo, even unto the next generation.  All in all, a tiptop read.	2005-02-16

This is the first and longest-lasting of the elements of the \\"Periodic Table\\" and the first and longest-lasting of Camille Minichino's many mysteries involving arch scientist Gloria, a retired lady professor from UC Berkeley who leaves her campus and her career to retire.  Only what does she get in little sleepy Revere (Massachusetts in the Back Bay) but a horrible case of murder.  The police bring her into the case, and once she is there, she embarks on a satisfying (to the reader) three way romance as she is torn between two lovers, while escaping for her life.  There are some lovely comparisons between the Massachusetts landscapes and the California coastal scenery, but Gloria isn't looking back, except in terror.<br /><br />This is the perfect antidote to those who say there is no excitement and no romance after fifty.  While later books in the series play down the Italian angle (Revere has a large Italian quarter and is said to be the birthplace of Oscar-winning Italian-American actress Anne Bancroft), THE HYDROGEN MURDER has it in spades, and when was the last time you read a mystery love triangle in which all the particpants were mature Italian-Americans?  That's why Camille Minichino is such a refreshing writer, she goes back to her roots both in science and in heritage.  Next up for the prolific cozy authoress?

Now most of her books are out of print, and even the publication of a marvelous revisionist biography a few years back did little to raise her profile among bookbuyers--until Oprah, who loves a proletarian classic.  Wang Lung is the archetypal farmer with a mystic relationship to the earth around him.  He is well matched in O-Lan, his ugly (OK, plain) wife whose quiet ways conceal a determination to survive and conquer the land and to see her family well-placed.  Wang Lung and O-Lan are polar opposites in many ways, but there is a deep bond between them.  I won't say what happens at the end but tears will come to your eyes when you find out what inspires the desperate cry:<br /><br />\\"O-Lan, you were the earth!\\"<br /><br />Famine, heat, the parched summers where nothing will grow in the earth, monsoons, constantly moving to find more land, drugs, disappointing children, the memories of slave existence, nothing gets O-Lan down for long--until the arrival of the concubine Lotus Flower.  Lotus Flower is beautiful, calculating, manipulative, like Julie Cooper on THE OC, and in fact for many she will remind you of Angelina Jolie--the wife's worst nightmare!<br /><br />She's great and this book does her justice too.  It is not an ordinary morality tale where bad gets punished conventionally.  It is a deeper book than that, with roots in the old China in which Pearl Buck spent her childhood )with missionary parents).  The next time you get a chance to see the movie, try to see it too, as Luise Rainer hid her beauty behind Asian makeup and looked convincingly \\"plain,\\" while as Wang Lung, Paul Muni also did his yeomanlike best.  The special effects were miracles of precision and imagination in their day, thanks to producer Irving Thalberg, and they still look pretty sharp!	2005-02-11

It's a strange, fervid fraternity and way back when someone started calling us The Price Club and the name just stuck.<br /><br />Denis Meikle has given us a book that clears up some of the myths surrounding Price's career, but he seems determined to create a new one, based somewhat on Victoria's great book.  His thesis is that the McCarthy hearings and the \\"graylist\\" of which Price was the victim made him scared that he would never work again, so that afterwards, from the mid 1950s on, he consented to appear in any piece of schlock if the \\"price was right.\\"  Again and again he evinces this theory to explain, for example, why VP appeared as \\"Egghead\\" on TV's BATMAN.  Price himself often stated that he wanted money to but more modern art with, but Meikle discounts this simple explanation.<br /><br />I am the proud owner of a signed copy of Price's awesome book THE ART IN MY LIFE and I think that he indeed loved art and that he wasn't just \\"running scared\\" from the HUAC police.<br /><br />But everyone deserves a forum for their views and Meikle makes a good case for his.	2005-02-10

Philip Williams, a young boy from Scotland, joined the Army mostly because in depressed Britain there just wasn't any other way to make a living, no alternative for starving youth.  Imagine his surprise when he got sent into an illconceived war and was knocked out by enemy fire.<br /><br />He woke up days later, in a daze, and he realized that he had been left behind by his own soldier boys!  The war in fact was over, and the British had sailed away.<br /><br />It took him the best part of two months to get back to civilization, freezing his balls off in the worst blizzard to hit Argentina in over 200 years, totally unprepared for the weather and having to pick his way through a pile of unburied Argentinean corpses!<br /><br />And then when he finally made his way back home, he found out that his parents gave up on him (the UK government had informed them that Philip had died), and they had held his funeral in his absence.  Oddly enough, this is when things turned even grimmer.  The tabloid press got all over his ass accusing him of being a deserter, and even some of his own colleagues in the Army--it will remind American readers of the Swift Boat People who accused John Kerry of lying more recently.

As a Roman Catholic, he is bound nevertheless to stay with her, and as a respresentative of England in a steamy West African country, he is honor bound to present himself as a happily married man.  However there are cracks in the surface, in which doubt and anguish seep through, and it's almost as if a cloud of locusts follow him around as he passes his days in a fever of unknowing.  God seems very far away, and the lies that he never used to tell himself come fast and furious now.  Can he find grace in the arms of another woman, the fresh, dewy eyed Helen?  Upon this dilemma Graham Greene hangs a whole tragedy of misunderstanding and meanness, with deep spiritual implications.<br /><br />I sometimes wonder where Graham Greene drew his inspiration from.  When he developed the characters of Louise and Helen, it's almost as if he were thinking of the old madonna-whore syndrome and trying to make it revitalized along with the deeply entrenched conservatism of the Catholic Church.<br /><br />Reading the book today, of course, we are more critical than most readers might have been back then, of Henry Scobie's ambiguous place within black African culture.  Greene however sees through this apparent oversight and manages to finish the book with a flourish that will satisfy even the most determinedly post-colonial savant.  The only thing that seems unlikely to me is Helen's attraction to a man so much older than herself and who is no sex machine.  Dream on, Graham Greene!	2005-02-10

In the days that followed our Moss party I heard many grumblings about how badly the book was written, but I paid them no mind, ascribing the bad reviews to the general hangover of our group.<br /><br />Also we've been worried about Kate Moss and her growing attachment to the Libertines' Pete Doherty, whose fascination with crack has emperiled our heroine and her beloved baby by Jefferson Hack.<br /><br />Katherine Kendall's book doesn't find the space to cover these latest debelopments, but with a figure so stylish and dynamic as Kate Moss, it would be hard to write a book that could keep itself up-to-date--maybe regular CD-ROM supplements would do the trick?  I liked the way she wrote about Kate Moss posing for Lucien Freud, it shows that she has a brain too, not just an appetite for sensation as a result of being brought up in a overly restictive family that would not allow her sweets.  Kate Moss has had to battle a lot of problems, including the bad press engendered by her rampages through hotels during the Johnny Depp days, and people feeling that she has no talent, and the rumors about bulimia and anorexia, and yet every time she gets written off, she bounces right back looking prettier than ever!  In our crowd, we consider her the Babe Paley of the 21st Century, than which there is no higher compliment.<br /><br />And her little daughter, Lila Grace, is so cute.  There are some good snaps of her in the Kendall book.<br /><br />Yes, the book is filled with re-cycled interviews and other sources, but it isn't all that bad.<br /><br />Perhaps next Katherine Kendall could write a book about the British actress slash comedienne Kay Kendall, whg was Kate Moss' spiritual ancestor back in the 1950s.  Trivia--did you know that Kate has appeared in ten films--always as \\"Herself\\"?  What other star can boast such a high ratio of appearances as herself?you know that Kate has appeared in ten films--always as \\"Herself\\"?

Isabel's new baby is just adorable, but staring at the infant Nina begins to remember the little brother she once had, called Colin, a baby who died of cot death--I imagine the same thing as \\"crib death\\" here in the USA.  To pay Isabel back for years of being more beautiful and evil, Nina undertakes a love affair with Richard, Isabel's older husband.<br /><br />The two of them have sex, sex and more sex, outside mostly, in the various gardens of the beautiful country farmhouse.  Their pale bodies crush the courgettes.<br /><br />I couldn't understand why Nina would want to have sex with Richard, unless it was to punish Isabel.<br /><br />The two sisters share a strange dynamic.  Both are selfish and destructive.  I didn't like the way Isabel calls Nina \\"Neen.\\"  When you read that word \\"Neen\\" two hundred times or more, you get sick of seeing it.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, Nina's a pig.  Nevertheless TALKING TO THE DEAD is a masterpiece of sensuality and vertiginous desire.  Might be the best Barbara Vine book that Barbara Vine didn't write.  However my old dad used to say that if a book has a gerund for a title it's going to be horrible.  Not since WAITING FOR GODOT, said Dad, and the novels of Henry Green, has there been a good one.	2005-02-09

Thirkell devotes at least one chapter \\"The Christmas Treat\\" to the spectacle of charitable countrywomen trying to provide fun and gifts for a pack of ungrateful kids who don't respond in human terms but adopt the scary faces of the kids in VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED while overstuffing their greedy fat faces with ice cream, courgettes, Christmas crackers and other British treats.  They are creepy as anything out of a Roald Dahl book.<br /><br />The real pleasure in the book is watching big, butch Lydia Keith start falling for the sophisticated, Noel Coward-like Noel Merton, a man with more of the ways of a woman than she.  Poor Lydia, a gross lump of a girl when in high school, now is more ladylike, and Noel finds himself attracted to her for her valiant courage in helping out her Mom and Dad, both ill and old, instead of going with her heart and taking up war work like her friends the infantile Geraldine Birkett and the stern Amazon Octavia Crawley.  As the book progresses, you find yourself rooting for Noel and Lydia to get together.  The other couples aren't very memorable, and you will get tired of the Bissells right away.  What's worse, Angela Thirkell's never-ending hatred of foreigners like the Mixo Lydians, or her condescension toward members of the lower class who were cute?  What's good about her books is the comedy in them, and the gentle romance that sometimes unites disparate county families.  CHEERFULNESS BREAKS IN is one of her best.	2005-02-09

Yes	They should call this book GREASE FROM A MONASTERY GARDEN.  The recipes use way too much oil to the point that they're not healthy for any living being.  If this is the way monks eat no wonder there are so many fat monks.  Take the recipe for Risotto della Certosina.  Right away you see the ingredients that begin with \\"Half a cup of olive oil (good quality).\\"  I don't care if it's good quality or not that's a lot for 4-6 servings--that's two tablespoons per person.  The way this recipe (for mushrooms and rice) works you could have just used one tablespoon of olive oil and it would taste just as good.<br /><br />The author has a nice style however, and the illustrations are a dandy delight in pale shades of red, silly pictures of monks having fun and growing vegetables.	2005-02-07

As an examination of the ways in which filmmakers have transformed texts both classic and pulp into resonant crime movies, HARDBOILED HOLLYWOOD has a bite and a fervor to it that other books with blander approaches have missed.  What a quirky selection of movies he calls the \\"Great Crime Films\\"  It's a strange classification anyhow, for what links THE GODFATHER to PSYCHO--yes, both of them have killings in them, but other than that they're here because the author, Max Decharne, has a thing for them.<br /><br />He doesn't bring that much new to the table in his chapters on those two films, but dig a little closer and you'll find some interesting commentary on films by Val Guest, Mike Hodges, and John Boorman.  Yes, three British directors whose work in the noir field is often slighted.  But for Decharne, HELL IS A CITY, GET CARTER and POINT BLANK rank right up there with THE BIG SLEEP and KISS ME, DEADLY, and as he explains it, his reasons are often cogent.  And the gossip he gives is fascinating.  I particularly enjoyed hearing about the career of Ted Lewis, the man who wrote the novel on which GET CARTER (the Michael Caine version, not the Sylvester Stallone version) was based.<br /><br />Decharne always has a sly kind of wit which produces a chuckle every page or so--no bellylaughs, just one brief \\"ha\\" and then another.	2005-02-07

Kaufman.  Once they had been the hottest team on Broadway, responsible for STAGE DOOR, THE ROYAL FAMILY, and DINNER AT EIGHT, but their last two plays, this one and THE LAND IS BRIGHT, didn't do well.  I wonder why, maybe it was the acting, because anyone who reads BRAVO! can see it acted out in their heads.  The characters and situations come alive and we really feel for these human beings while laughing at the occasionally acerbic lines Ferber and Kaufman provide for comic relief.  The main character in the play is Zoltan Laszlo, once an eminent European playwright whose fifty hit plays got him in trouble with the Nazis.  Fleeing Europe he has landed in a tenuous \\"grace and favor\\" brownstone in Manhattan where he has banded together with a group of motley Jewish refugees to stave off the tax man and the INS while taking incredibly humiliating jobs.  For example, Martin, once a judge of the Austrian Supreme Court, has to make candy and sell it door to door because he is unable to land a legal position in New York.  Anna, the great brain of Europe, a greater chemist than Marie Curie, is similarly underemployed.<br /><br />Zoltan and his actress \\"wife,\\" the tragedienne Rosa Rucker, take in a damaged war orphan, Lisa, who has spent years in a death camp and a year or more in a British mental home.  Her condition is fragile and although a talented ingenue herself, and the daughter of Europe's greatest actor, she is prone to cracking up when recalling her horrible SOPHIE'S CHOICE-type days in the camps.  In addition, the INS is trying to deport her.<br /><br />BRAVO! is a beautifully written play and one of the very first to star Kevin McCarthy (later of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS and a close pal of Montgomery Clift).  In BRAVO!, McCarthy played Kurt, a taxi driver on the streets of New York who falls in love with the delicate Lisa.  His matter-of-fact declaration of his love for her helps her to heal.  The play isn't really 'about' any one particular character, however; it floats from action to action with insouciance and a sardonic wit.  By the end, we love them all, even the villainous ones.claration of his love for her helps her to heal.

Look at the reviews on Amazon for samples.  Now comes new evidence that the version of POSTERN OF FATE which we have was severely edited and that Christie's original may be a very different (and more cogent) work than the one we all know and abhor.<br /><br />Sotheby's was offering the \\"complete Dictaphone recording of Agatha Christie dictating her last novel\\" including the original dictaphone belts she used (sixty of them).  This was evidently put up for sale by her secretary, Mrs. Jolly.  Did you know that \\"Postern of Fate\\" was Christie's sub=title for the novel and that the real title is \\"Doom's Caravan\\"?  Sotheby's catalogue, from which I quote here, reveals that \\"the text incorporated here differs substantially in very many instances from the final, printed version . . . Among the most striking differences might be noted the following.  [WARNING -- SPOILERS AHEAD.]  The group responsible for Mary Jordan's murder is here more clearly identified as a Fascist cell amd many more details of, and clues about, them are given in a substantial section eventually cut.  The motivation for the murder of old Isaac by a descendant of this group who is endeavouring to bring Fascism to England is, accordinly, more substantiated in the present version; moreover, in the way this material is here worked, clues are thrown out so as apparently to implicate a different murderer.  The rearrangement of the final, printed version, in which some of these chapters are placed earlier, also leaves a few threads hanging loose, evidently because of poor editing, there remain in the printed version a few references to certain of these sections which had either by then been moved in such a way that the references are inappropriate or else cut alttogether . . .\\"<br /><br />Perhaps it is the case that Christie's last novel isn't the sad, woolgathering, near-Alzheimers experience it presently seems to be, but instead it was the victim of \\"poor editing\\"?  Wouldn't it be great if a critical edition of POSTERN OF FATE--or should we call it DOOM'S CARAVAN--could be prepared by the Christie estate which would clear up some of these inconsistencies and restore the blot from her reputation?<br /><br />I give this book only 4 stars because, well, it isn't all that good, and until her original version is restored, this is all we're going to have.tie's last novel isn't the sad, woolgathering, near-Alzheimers experience it presently seems to be, but instead it was the victim of \\"poor editing\\"?

Without the melodies that go with them, the lyrics aren't as interesting or memorable as say, Frank Loesser's would be, for they lack a certain verbal sophistication.  You'll see how few of them have extended lyrics, and often as not the lyrics repeat and repeat in a way which works well on stage but on the page, well, your eyes get tired.  (Like \\"Shalom\\" from MILK AND HONEY, how many times do we need to hear that \\"Shalom\\" means twice as much as \\"hello\\"?)  But nitpicking aside the book is great, not only for itss lavish and rare photographs, but for Herman's personal asides--saying for example that the title song of DEAR WORLD is one song he regrets having written.  And some of the songs are indeed poetry, like the anxious lilt of \\"I Won't Send Flowers\\" from MACK AND MABEL or \\"We Need a Little Christmas\\" from MAME--\\"I need a little angel sitting on my shoulder,\\" etc.  A lyric that works not only in the theater but as a poem too. The book also includes the two numbers Herman \\"ghost-wrote\\" for the 1960s David Merrick production of BEN FRANKLIN IN PARIS, as well as some miscellaneous lyrics for revues, etc.<br /><br />That \\"Jerry's Girls\\" song is pretty lame though.  Just skip that page if you are allergic to name-dropping and self-congratulation on a Herculean scale.<br /><br />Funny how he manages in two different songs to rhyme \\"Zsa Zsa\\" with \\"maharajah.\\"  That's a sign of repeating oneself, a danger in a career as long and productive as Herman's.  The CD is good too although I would have liked to hear Michael Feinstein interpret some of the rarer or even the \\"trunk\\" numbers.	2005-02-07

So it is with great pleasure that I can report THE GUGGENHEIMS by Irwin Unger and Debi Unger \\"good to the last drop.\\"  The authors begin with a panoply of anti-Semitism in Europe and make it clear just how limited career prospects were for Jews of the second millennium, when they were forbidden all but the very lousiest jobs, and the jobs most guaranteed to annoy their Christian \\"brethren\\" (such as collecting rents and taxes).  Unike the other great Jewish families of \\"Our Crowd,\\" the Guggenheims made their money primarily from mining, in the farawy and exotic paradise of Chile (mostly in copper, and silver and lead as well).  By the turn of the century (1900) they were well on their way towards their legend.<br /><br />The biography has sweep and a certain falling grandeur, but I liked best the authors' marvelous pen portraits of the many younger Guggenheims.  I liked finding out that Gladys Guggenheim wrote two cookbooks and was named \\"nutrition commissioner\\" of New York by Thomas Dewey in 1934.  There's the shocking battle between the sisters Hazel and Peggy, over who could score with the most men sexually--when each got up to a thousand, the numbers started to blur.  I bet!  And then the terrible story of Hazel's 1928 rooftop tragedy.  She had taken her two little toddlers, Ben and Terrence, up to an unlikely section of her apartment's roof garden, and somehow the two tykes tumbled off t their deaths.  She was suspected as being some kind of Alice Crimmins-type Medea, but the family turned up a window cleaner nearby who claimed to have witnessed the whole thing and said Hazel was innocent and had indeed tried to save the kids!<br /><br />Who remembers now that Harry Guggenheim, the bigwig of the third generation of Guggenheims, once owned Dark Star, the horse that beat Native Dancer to the 1953 Kentucky Derby?  Harry and his wife, Alicia Patterson, started NEWSDAY, the Long Island paper, and he seemed to share her with the Democratic also-ran Adlai Stevenson with whom she fell quite desperately in love.<br /><br />The Ungers also tell the story of Diane, Harry's daughter, who sought escape from hr family in an unlikely place, the postwar \\"folk music boom\\" that led her to Ireland, of all places, where she began an intrigue with young Liam Clancy, then a teen and not yet famous for sparking the Clancy Brothers + Tommy Makem.  Diane changed her name and began recording her own folk music, which made me curious to hear what she did with her career.  She seems to have been kind of a Peggy Seeger, and just as adventurous.<br /><br />The last half of the book brings forward Solomon, whose legacy was the Guggenheim museum, and Peggy, the art dealer who married Max Ernst, discovered Jackson Pollock, and invented \\"Art Of This Century.\\"  In each case, the Ungers surpass all previois biographical treatments of their very complicated subjects.  Peggy in particular comes to life, not as a freak or a groupie, but as a woman with a particular historical and aesthetic mission  which she graciously fulfilled.  Good for them.  I expect this book will do quite well, and may restore some of the tarnished luster of the Guggenheim name.

This warm-hearted comic novel about a Lieutenant (junior grade) in the peacetime US Navy of the 1950s should be back in print, it is a minor classic of its time and place.  It was made into the kind of stupid Hollywood film ALL HANDS ON DECK (1961) but the book has a wonderful charm and it's filled with rueful stories about the Navy that will ring true with anyone who's ever been in the service--or been in love, because it is a pretty good love story too.<br /><br />Donald Morris went on to more sober literary chronicles, he became the author of the amazing THE WASHING OF THE SPEARS which attempted to tell the story of the Zulu's war against ther British from the Zulu point of view.  It is said that Hemingway gave Morris the idea for his groundbreaking book.<br /><br />You can see in WARM BODIES his sympathy for other races, as the most memorable character in the book is an enlisted man called S.E. (Shrieking Eagle) Garfield, a genius with hardware who refuses to speak anything but his native Chickasaw.  (In the film this character was played by Buddy Hackett, who did a pretty good job but of course he wasn't Indian.)<br /><br />The book details the plight of naval officers who aren't married, \\"confirmed bachelors,\\" and how they try to make themselves comfortable homes on board their ships.  In one funny episode a girlfriend tries to teach Morris how to make \\"something called beer balls.\\"  In another storyline he tries to goose the sailors into doing more chipping of rust off the hull of the ship.  \\"Chipping irons never wear out, and they never break.  Sailors may surreptitiously drop them overboard, but the boatswain invariably has new ones ready.  No one was ever been able to make a boatswain admit that he has run out of chipping irons.  Rudolph Rush claimed that eighteen and one half per cent of the United States defense budget was spent on chipping irons.\\"<br /><br />Since Morris wrote the book, the term \\"Warm Bodies\\" has passed from naval slang into the general population, but it's worth going back and seeing how he phrased it.  \\"A Warm Body is a man with at least one arm and two fingers who can pick something up when he is told to.  Warm Bodies can carry boxes, count small objects, turn on lights, chip paint, and sweep.\\"  Sounds like zombies, don't they?<br /><br />Pat Boone played Donald Morris in the long-ago film, and Barbara Eden played Sally Hobson, the Southern girl from Little Hominy (near Lye, Virginia) with whom he falls in love.

The late Susan Sontag gave this novel high praise. and reading it you can see why it would appeal both to Sontag's high intelligence and her love of the sensual and elegant.  In a way, the heroine's affair with a married man, and her encounters with his soignee mother, the Princess, are the materials of a Henry James study in contrasting cultures.  We warm to the Princess for her beautifully understated way of handling everything, as we did Isak Dinesen.  In one amusing episode she has to sit in an uncomfortable chair while listening to a speech. \\"She sat upright and did not stir.  Only towards the end of three hours did I notice a slight shifting in her seat.  She said, 'If I find the person who designed this chair, I'll throw it in his face.'\\"  However, her son Hare is pretty innocuous and the heroine's love affair with him is pretty lukewarm compared to her miscellaneous observations about the princess.<br /><br />The Readers Digest used to have a running feature where you could write in and tell all about \\"The Most Unforgettable Character You Ever Met.\\"  In this book, the unforgettable one is the princess.  And yet everyone has a story, an engrossing one.<br /><br />When the heroine tries to buy an air conditioner, you can see why people think Gini Alhadeff a fine writer.  \\"Reason epople did not quibble over the noise an air conditioner made--one so promisingly named Quietmaster.

When you read THE SUMMER GUEST you will feel the same way, that you have lived through generations of lovers and current events.  All the way from the battles of the Vietnam Era to the Salerno and Sicily campaigns of World War II.  The story is complicated so you might like to do what I did, and write down a chart of who is who, especially with the two Joes (father and son) you could easily get lost.  After awhile I asked myself why the main bluk of the story was taking place in 1994 instead of in the present day, then referring to my chart I realized that Cronin had sort of written himself into a corner for if he wanted to make Harry Wainwright the age he was, he would have definitely have had to alter his (fictional) birthdate.  A shame in a way, because unless you're keeping track of everyone's narrative voice (I used different color post it notes) (a different color for each narrator) you will be hard pressed to tell them apart.  They all speak in very simple sentences, very understated, like characters from some old time John O'Hara novel.  However, the story that Cronin unleashes will make your tearducts fill up and overflow as he reveals one surprise after another.  Some of the romantic passages, and episodes of yearning after an impossible love ideal, will make you think of THE NOTEBOOK.  And for that, there is no higher praise.<br /><br />Perhaps this book would appeal more to people who live in Maine, where I expect they will be more familiar with the surroundings, and take to Cronin's descriptions of well-loved native land.<br /><br />It's a good book all around (you definitely get your money's worth).	2005-01-31

The book has the same kind of wry, funny wisdom about very young people and their bewildered elders that Updike used to have, plus a Canadian twist which everyone will enjoy.  It's set in the autumn of 1965, the heyday of YOU ASKED FOR IT and GILLIGAN's ISLAND, and though the characters are kind of low-rent Grant Buday brings them a difficult dignity.  Some might balk at following the consciousness of a precocious six year old, but you'll enjoy the little boy's wry perceptions.  \\"He spotted something else, something new, something unexpected, something he didn't understand.\\"  The repetitions of \\"something\\" help sketch out the boy as being a little obsessive.  \\"In the long and boggy grass beneath a blue sky Ivor's dad--pants down--was kneeling behind Ivor's sister Nadia who was on all fours with her dress pushed up.\\"  Only a young child would see such a thing with such insouciance and outright curiosity.  \\"Mr. Skog and Nadia made noises.\\"  This is a book which removes nostalgia from memory, dosing instead with the finest pure science.	2005-01-30

We who have never seen the place, and probably bever will, have been given a tremendous gift by this fine author.  He has taken us on invisible wings inside a society and culture so different than our own as to be truly 'foreign,' and yet he has shown us that life mirrors life, even if you've never taxied to a landing in a little place supplied by the Kalahari Flying Club.<br /><br />By the way, as a sidelight, a Chicagoland friend told me that McCall Smith based the relationship of Precious Ramotswe and J L B Matekoni on that of our own Oprah Winfrey and Stedman Graham!  The same dynamic seems to be in play, Precious' nervous impatience, mixed with her steely fortitude, in contrast to her fiancee's seemingly laissez-faire philosophy toward taking the next step--in both cases, setting an actual wedding date.  It's not so farfetched because apparently McCall Smith was introduced to Oprah through the offices of Joanne (HARRY POTTER) Rowling, who lives in Edinburgh nearby the author of the LADIES DETECTIVE AGENCY series.	2005-01-17

I like the way the one man called him, \\"Meat,\\" and when Paul asks why, the player says, \\"because you're the best-looking piece of meat I've ever seen.\\"  A lot of men feel that way about Paul Hornung, there's isn't a sexual thing going on, or not much of one.  The trumpeter Al Hirt gives him a $25,000 ring right off his finger, saying, \\"This is from me to you, I love you.\\"  It's romantic, but not sexual.  Frank Sinatra called him \\"Pablo.\\"  Those were the glory days.  But Paul made a bad mistake, he turned down Sinatra when Frank offered to stand him a drink, and as Jilly Rizzo said, \\"That was a no-no.\\"  In another scary sequence, paul gets rolled, his drink spiked with scopolamine, and his Rolex and money taken from him.  He wakes up in Bellevue, and the police tell him, he was lucky he had something that the ambushers wanted.  \\"If they hadn't have gotten something,\\" said one of the officers, \\"they'd have killed your ass right there.\\"  He was great in his part in DEVIL's BRIGADE, though he'll never win an Oscar, and maybe he should have made more of a run at movie stardom.  He's not a racist, I don't think, but at the last minute a zippy epilogue addresses this possibility in the wake of the fuss last March when he talked about blacks at Notre Dame.  You be the judge.

It must have been written in the brief minute when the five men on \\"QUEER EYE FOR THE STRAIGHT GUY\\" were popular.  Now they're over, it's over, and from the results of the national election, gay is definitely unpopular.  Bret Easton Ellis, who recommends this book on the jacket copy, is a writer of permanent value, I think he must have liked this book for its pleasant locales and its roman a clef perspective into the married life of Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston.  However even they're now broken up and so the book has a kind of musty odor already.  But that is the peril of all Hollywood writers.  For although nothing really changes in Hollywood, the fads do, and since Robin Lynn Williams is satirizing nothing else, she has a quaintness to her like a book written by Anita Loos or Lillian Gish about the Hollywood of their youth.<br /><br />It wasn't so funny when Griffin, the guy who's not really gay, compares a minor character to a \\"pissed off Buckwheat.\\"  But any reader will be impressed with the way Williams, once a PA herself, can dip in and out of five different first person narratives and make them different from each other.  She doesn't do well with men's voices, but that's okay, it's always interesting to see what women think men think like!<br /><br />In addition, the device (pioneeered in Mexican telenovelas and countless graphic novels) of helping the reader to imagine what your character looks like, by inserting actual photos of them, is a neat one.  Soon newspapers will catch on to this, and TV.	2005-01-17

From Grand Hotel to Arthur Hailey's HOTEL from which the famous TV series was based, through the Hotel New Hampshire and John Wieners' Hotel Wentley Poems, hotels are an irresistible analogue for lie and its Bede-like in one window and out the other quality.  We check in, then what seems a minute later, we check out.  Third time novelist Nani Power makes a remarkable recovery after her disappointing second book THE GOOD REMAINS, by switching from the old CHRISTMAS CAROL madrigal to a vision of lonely people connected only the tenuous holds of room service and lobby switchboard.<br /><br />Success in this kind of novel depends on how fascinating you can make your guests and management.  Does anyone today remember Charlotte Armstrong's magnificent 50s novel THE SEVENTEEN WIDOWS OF SANS SOUCI?  Nani Power echoes some of Armstrong's lyrical, yet unflinching power, as she narrows her gaze in on five or six lonely, disfunctional people, some of them deracinated from other culturs and transplanted to the cold shores of Washington D.C.  Like the lovers in Edith Wharton's late novel THE CHILDREN, the hotel guests of THE SEA OF TEARS makes us realize how fragile life is and what an impossibility love is, even when you have it.  Her quirky humor is an asset.  In a moment of extreme tension, the \\"boombox still was on, anmd Josh Groban was singing through all of this.\\"  However the short, short sentences are not telling enough, we have no idea finally what Power's own take on her characters is.  Funny because in her last book she explained far too much and left us numb with preaching.  It's a fast ride, however, and I know that Nani Power's thousands of fans will lap this one up too.  For the rest of us, I leave you with Anne Sexton's bleak advice, \\"Flee, flee this sad hotel.\\"	2005-01-17

When she goes back to confront her Indiana sister, Andrea, she notes how beat up Andrea looks and how no woman in New York would look as old as Andrea, even if they are actually the same age.  In this way Kate Lehrer manages to alienate a whole slew of Indiana readers.  I don't think it's true and I've seen plenty of New York women who look like hags.  Check it out next time you go to New York!  Anyhow she has one husband Steve, who's not above a little shady business practice, he is a wealthy lawyer whose Christmas bonus is almost  half a million dollars.  And still Michelle's not satisfied.  She has her own business advising women to de-clutter their lives, get rid of old magazines, boyfriends, you know, \\"he's just not that into you.\\"  When she runs over Wilson Collins, I took it that someone must have advised Kate Lehrer to make sure her hero and heroine \\"meet cute.\\"  Taking care of Wilson, she falls in love and decides to depart with him on a romantic vacation in the rain forest, where the two get closer and closer.<br /><br />I like all the parts where Michelle (who calls herself \\"Mickey\\" after Wilson tells her she seems like a \\"Mickey\\" rather than a Michelle) feels like she's falling apart.  From childhood she has been afraid of snakes and tangly things of all kinds, they embody chaos for her and make her feel as though she were about to die.  At age 47 she has an amazing breakthrough, I'm not giving away any spoilers that aren't in the title of the book when I say that she takes the career advice of the novelist Anais Nin, who also had two husbands, and managed to have a successful career on top of that.  Kate Lehrer may not like Indiana women, but she likes individuality, good posture, and happiness for all concerned.  When Michelle begins to internalize her many selves, and has a bit of a health scare, you'll feel for her in every sick moment.sick moment.	2005-01-16

'You taught me first to bed, and now--you teach me how a beggar should be answered,' says Shakespears's Portia.  But it is not only the poor who feels life's endless snubs; they are no respectors of persons.\\"  Norris writes about the genesis of MOTHER in her 1959 autobiography FAMILY GATHERING.  As a staunch Roman Catholic she and her husband, the brother of the late San Francisco novelist Frank (McTEAGUE) Norris, were appalled by the spread of the birth control movement in the first decade of the century, and she wrote MOTHER hoping to raise the self-image of women who chose to become mothers, and to a certain extent it worked.  Former President Theodore Roosevelt named it as one of his favorite books, and honored the impecunious, Bohemian couple by showing up at ther flat for an impromptu dinner.  With growing celebrity she became intimate friends with the Lunts, Noel Coward, Frances Hodgson Burnett, Addison and Wilson Mizner, and other famous people of the day.<br /><br />Her friendship with fellow pop novelist Edna Ferber came to a bad end.  Ferber could never forgive Norris for going to Germany in the 1930s and accepting the honors bestowed on her by a grateful Adolf Hitler.  Norris returned from Berlin to find that her public had largely deserted her due to her Nazi connections.  She wasn't really a Nazi, just a Pacifist and you might say an isolationist, like Charles Lindbergh (another of her friends) and like Lindbergh her once proud name was stained with Nazi obloquy.  Yet she was a talented novelist and it's a sign of the times that she is so forgotten today and another woman with the same name is reaping the rewards of having a name people think they've already heard.  MOTHER, a tract against what she called \\"race suicide,\\" is one of her very best novels.	2005-01-16

Books	5	5	7	N	N	Caught up in a vicious circle of espionage and deception	People are disappointed that Antony Beevor isn't writing some super huge history of war like his previous book on Stalingrad.  I say, cut him some slack.<br /><br />The book contrasts the lives and characters of two women with confusingly simnilar names.  One was Olga, the widow of Anton Chekhov, who created roles in the original Moscow Art Theater productions of his plays (at the turn of the century) such as The CHERRY ORCHARD.  The other was her niece, who turned her back on the theater and fled to Berlin, where she became a protege of Erich Pommer and then of Josef Goebbels, the minister of culture who had a weakness for bigger-than-life actresses.  This catapulted the younger Olga into Hitler's circle (though hardly into his inner circle as the jacket copy hints) and when she got there, she began sending coded dispatches to the Russian version of the CIA, the secret intelligence corps.<br /><br />The only mis-statement that Beevor is guilty of nothing more than a bit overstatement--when he calls Olga Chekhova Hitler's Favorite Actress.  That's just publisher's hype.  Beevor must know that she was only one of the beautifukl women Hitler liked having around.  Think of the way that Leni Riefenstahl as treated by Hitler--she was one he liked more than Olga, or so I believe.  Contrary to other reviewers, i think that Beevor might actually have viewed more of Chekhova's films (and those of Michael Chekhov, her opposite number in the USA) and talked more about her acting.  For all the wartime prominence of the UFA film stars, they might as well be forgotten today in film history circles, and indeed she starred in some of the greatest films of the 1930s and 1940s, they're just not readily seen today because of that Nazi taint.	2005-01-16

Incidentally the books they write separately from each other are worth checking out too.  In this book, the authors combine accounts of real-life combat with a fanciful kind of science in which, to take one example, a troop of Marines gets shot at by a strange species of fighting flora.  Needless to say the Marines give the plants as good as they got, decimating plant life for 100 yards around.  The esprit de corps of the Starfist world is what makes you love these rough and tumble characters.<br /><br />I can easily picture a whole series of motion pictures outlining their adventures.  However film is not necessary for enjoyment of an alien universe.  It's creepy the way the Corporal in Charge, spotting a tree with vines, has to check out the vine ends in case they are not just dangling, but quivering, ready to do battle.  (The vines have the power to spray acid and disgigure and maim all attackers.)  You'll love Admiral Orange, the most irascible navy man since James Cagney intimidated MISTER ROBERTS.  All in all, a exciting, rousing adventure for the men and women fighters of the 25th century.	2005-01-16

That's only one of things you find out when you read her 1968 autobiography, which I picked up from a table in the Pyrenees for a song.  Bridge wrote vividly and well about all kinds of locales, from Peking to Portugal, and now I know why--it's because her husband, Owen, he of the big hands and the head for liquor, was posted to all of these places, beginning in 1914--I had no idea Ann Bridge was so old.  Her heroine, the Sydney Bristow-prototype Julia, is so young in my imagination, a true wonder woman, and barely out of her teens or so it seems.  Ann Bridge worked early on as a chicken farmer, and her accounts of killing dozens of chickens at a time, then plucking them all on a Saturday, and trussing them and selling them out of her parlor on Sunday morning--so as not to annoy her maids, who disliked the smell of chicken entrails--in the days before World War I is exceptionally interesting.  Did you know that many pullets produce eggs smaller than two ounces and thus people who own such poultry despair of being able to sell these undersized eggs.  Ann Bridge wound up making a dozen out of 16 and persuading small restaurants to served poached eggs for breakfast where the diner wouldn't really realize he or she was eating tiny eggs.  \\"They looked quite all right poached, on a piece of toast,\\" she recalls.  Mind you, as she notes, bread was smaller too, in general.  Our gangantuan portions came later on in the turbulent 20th century which she chronicles.  \\"In those days, if one took enough trouble, you could make money hand over fist with poultry.\\"  She also knew a butcher whose skill was amazing, he could lean over the stile of a pigsty, and watch the pigs running around, and estimate in his head how many cuts of loin would be found in the whole lot of them.  He was, she claims, never more than a pound or two off.<br /><br />It's a cute book and one which will make you think.r two off. <br /> <br />It's a cute book and one which will make you think.	2005-01-16

He has the invention of Wodehouse, but a grimmer state of mind, though one story combines both modes of writing, the tale of the \\"Promisekeepers,\\" a coterie of heterosexual rednecks who meet at a tavern with a man's name on it (so women won't distract them) to jaw over their problems with the opposite sex.  When one of them confesses a shocking secret, the others react in amusing ways and the scene ends with a frightening shivaree.  Though many of the stories are in the first person, he is often able to make these voices sort of different from one another.  You wind up finishing the book with a great deal of respect for Brian Everson, as a writer and as a thinker--for there are some tales which ask to be judged on their teleology alone.<br /><br />THE WAVERING KNIFE is a book so good it makes you wonder what kind of person Everson is.  For more inspiration I turned to the jacket copy.  Hey, he looks good all cleaned up.  The line of darkness turning his nose aquiline, that cloudy mass of backlit hair in the photo on the back cover reminds us of Clarence Bull's photos of Joan Crawford, Garbo, and other MGM goddesses of the 30s.

I was impressed by Jocelyn Burrell's ambitions to have a representative sampling of the writing of so many women from so many cultures.  Sometimes the excerpts seem curtailed, but I suspect that might be a publishing decision and that she was handed down the fiat to shorten the book by another 10,000 words.  If so it is excellently done with not a seam showing, just the general feeling of wanting more.  It is not only the most well known women authors who contribute the best pieces to WORD.  No, there are some great essays here by woman with very low profiles.  Liza Fiol-Matta is of course a widely published author and thinker of New Jersey, but she does not have the cultural capital of (say) Margaret Atwood, and yet her essay here, \\"Beyond Survival\\" A Politics/Poetics of Puerto Rican Consciousness\\" is every bit as captivating and poetically written as Atwood's--if not more so.<br /><br />As she says, \\"Rescuing a poet/ from the claws of colonial bilingualism/ is not an easy thing.\\"  In the poem that begins her essay, she lets loose with a number of uncomfortable truths.  As a Puerto Rican lesbian living on the mainland, stuck between Spanish and English, she is a nomad, doomed to carry mutual heritages and to weather a disastrous tide of diminishing resources.  She cites Homi Bhabha and Bhabha's conception of the \\"in-between spaces.\\"  She was six when her father moved her family to Arkansas--of all places.  Another great Puerto Rican author to appear here is Judith Ortiz Cofer, sometimes thought of as the \\"Puerto Rican Joyce Carol Oates.\\"  But in truth, if we were honest with ourselves and able to see through the thick walls of culture, we would be referring to Oates as the \\"Detroit Judith Ortiz Cofer.\\"	2005-01-15

He makes you feel Faulkner's yearning to be accepted as part of an international avant-garde, and yet at the same time he didn't want that, he wanted, like his grandfather,  to be a writer revered by his peers down home.  Parini does enough with the \\"gay male friends\\" theme to warrant further scholarly investigation into gay modernist Southern art and literature, though such a topic doesn't necessarily depemd on the weight of Faulkner's name for it to be interesting in and of itself.  And how about his friendship with Bil and Helen Baird and the whole puppeteering thing, I could read about this forever.<br /><br />About the women in Faulkner's life, Parini stumbles a little.  I don't think he makes Estelle, Jill, Meta Carpenter, Jean Stein or Joan Williams as interesting as Blotner did.  They all kind of converge into an foggy enemy figure, like Judy and Madeleine in Hitchcock's VERTIGO--maybe this was Parini's intention (to paint his hero as a victim of sexual obsession), but the truth is that all of these women were very different characters, and in my opinion still the best book written about Faulkner is the wonderful A LOVING GENTLEMAN, Meta Carpenter Wilde's very moving memoir of her love affair with W. Faulkner.  That said, I admire Parini's book and the skill with which it comes together.  It makes you want to re-read some of the neglected books, I especially like his defense of the cobbled-together 50s collection BIG WOODS.  The truth is I could read a new Faulkner biography every year, they're all pretty good and this one, as the newest, deserves the attention of all of us.	2005-01-15

I wonder why they thought \\"in the air\\" was better than \\"in the clouds\\" anyway?  One of those long-ago decisions that will always remain something of a mystery.<br /><br />Poirot is especially bright in this novel.  Until picking it up again at the New Year, I hadn't thought of this book in many years and definitely it came as a surprise to me how interesting it was, on many levels.  Christie's skills at characterization again come into play.  She gets you involved with everyone, even the initially unsympathetic and crass Countess of Horbury turns out to have a human, appealing side, while the gentle country romance of her husband with the horsey gentlewoman the Hon Venetia Kerr is handled robustly and plainly, like Trollope might have.  For comic effect we have Mr. Clancy, who writes a series of detective novels with a detective who bites his nails in every book; even though Clancy admits it's a disgusting habit, he feels bound to put in a scene of nail biting in every novel, otherwise the fans will complain.  Wonder if Ed McBain ever feels that way, with Steve Carella and his \\"Asiatic eyes\\"?<br /><br />My favorite character is the heroine, the beauty parlor manicurist Jane Grey.  You don't have to be an expert to know that Christie had a passion for gray eyes, and a number of her pert, \\"modern girl\\" heroines have gray eyes.  She liked the name \\"Jane,\\" too, even if it denoted someone plain in her day.  Jane Gray is remarkable appealing and fun.  The guff she puts up with from her upperclass customers is appalling but she takes it all in the right Bridget Jones spirit, and she and her fellow workers have fun laughing at the customer's affectations.  Her passion for her new dentist boyfriend is very real and very well sketched, but it is her relationship with Poirot that makes the novel worth reading.  By the end you might almost imagine an unwritten sequel in which Jane Grey and Hercule Poirot move together romantically closer.  She's adorable.<br /><br />There's one crumby anti-Semitic slur uttered by Gladys, Jane's friend, that kind of spoils it for modern readers.

Daninos, Farewell, Major Thompson	The papers report that over the weekend Pierre Daninos died in Paris at age 91.  His masterpiece, Les Carnets du Major Thompson, will live forever as a witty, sophisticated look into a Henry Jamesian situation, the ultra-Englishman living among the French and trying to understand their ways (while trying to preserve his own heritage, hilariously staged by Daninos).  When I was a boy we had to read this novel (in French) in high school French classes on Long Island.  I was so bad at French that at first I thought the novel was taking place in a prisoner of war camp.  It took me ages to work out the real locale of the book, but after that, my French picked right up, mostly due to the immense skills of talented M. Daninos and his gift for laughter and for sympathetic caricature.  I always thought that this book would make a good film by Jacques Demy, a director with similar gifts and an open, lyrical style.  (I have since found out that indeed this book did get a movie made of it, but it is one that NETFLIX does not carry.)<br /><br />I am sorry to hear of the death of Pierre Daninos, but would like to salute him from this side of the grave for giving so many generations of French and English speakers so much pleasure and insight over the years.	2005-01-14

If you enjoyed Monty Python's absurdity or the wild inventions of Peter Cook, you will relish the crazy captions Glen Baxter assigns to his beautifully drawn pictures.  The pictures themselves are gorgeous.  Baxter's imaginative sense of pastel and his daring use of color and light makes for a certain grandeur of design, and then on top of it is all the humorous, verbal play.  Those who cherish the SYLVIE AND BRUNO books of Lewis Carroll will enjoy these cartoons too.<br /><br />In the US we have no one exactly like Baxter, though I suppose the work of the eminent NY poet Kenward Elmslie resembles it to some degree, in their deconstructive deployment of the innumerable silly tropes embedded in a vicious society.  A typical caption reads '\\"As junior partner you;'ll be expected to work in here,\\" explained Hopkins' and then the picture shows Hopkins pointing inside the absurdly large waistline of his own pants.  As Baxter's trademark handsome cowboys, cricketers, sailors, gangsters and Mounties cavort in between the follies of youth and the rituals of age, we realize he is an artist, like Rembrandt, who just gets better with age.

His wondrous tale is told with such beauty and empathy that at its conclusion I sprang to my feet shouting Bravo!\\"  That's all well and good but then as it turns out Gardner was her boyfriend or so I understand.  I can understand him reaching out in his grief to try to write something about her, but is a blurb really the right format?  She has so many fans you'd think the publishers would be able to find someone who didn't know her personally.  And yet she has a huge fanbase partially because she was so personable and lovely.  I met her twice, and each time I took away a memory of a woman who could see deeply into the souls of others, and one with a Doris-Day-like feeling for animals as well.  Something of this gets into this charming fable about the North Americans banding together to try to save the rain forests, and they meet with the Dalai Lama, dwawn cutely by Berriault in her best \\"If I can draw, you can draw\\" mode.  What happened to the proofreaders of Counterpoint?  An ugly little slip on page 66 destroys the beauty of what the Dalai Lama has to say.  (Usually Counterpoint could be counted on to produce a flawless book, oh well, even Homer nods.)  Amy Evans McClure's cover design is a model of what can be done in a small, limited way, as though she had read the fable carefully and decided to \\"think locally, act globally.\\"<br /><br />I don't know about the post-colonial aspects of THE GREAT PETROWSKI.

Among my friends who drop by to look at my books of fables, there are several who always ask if this book was the basis for the notorious Coen Brothers movie, THE BIG LEBOWSKI and reluctantly I have to tell them that, no, THE BIG LEBOWSKI came first (1998) and this book merely mirrors the sounds and sense of that title, has no other relation to it.	2005-01-11

If you like the new ABC TV show DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES you might like to go back in literary history and see where some of the humorous and yet horrifying small town antics began, and there's no better place to start than Erskine Caldwell's searing PLACE CALLED ESTHERVILLE.  There's no article before those three words, it's not called \\"A Place Called Estherville,\\" it's almost as thouch Caldwell had such contempt for the town he describes he wants to spit out the title as soon as possible because it leaves a nasty taste in his mouth.  (By the way, as a sidelight, the town of Caldwell, New Jersey, named in honor of America's great novelist Erskine Caldwell, is the site where some of the HBO series THE SOPRANOS is filmed.)  In PLACE CALLED ESTHERVILLE, we get two separate stories that are connected together at the root, a la OLD MAN and WILD PALMS, the stories that make up William Faulkner's famous \\"novel\\" of weather and deceit.  In PLACE a brother and sister come to the eponymous town and attract a certain amount of unwanted attention.  Due to their mixed race background, they are physically extremely attractive, Tommy to the young white teenage girls and desperate housewives of Estherville, where he tries to make a living as a houseboy, [...]<br />Kathyanne, his beautiful and demure sister, can't even walk down the street without being accosted by men who treat her like she was an animal.  The book is brutal and frequently obscene, and puritanical parents of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s didn't want their children, either black or white (or both), reading such trash.  But today we can see with the benefit of hindsight that there wouldn't have been a socialist party without Erskine Caldwell, nor would there have been James Baldwin or indeed today's popular hip-hop.<br /><br />It reads like the wind.  Once you start you won't be able to put it down until the explosive ending.  If everyone read this book our race problems as a nation would shrivel up and explode like so many raisins in the sun.raisins in the sun.	2005-01-10

In Japan, the story is apparently very different than ours.  For one thing, the father, the stepmother and the two evil stepsisters are all evil zombies with green bodies and one of the stepsisters, when dissatisfied with something Cinderella has sewn for her, has the propensity to rip the breasts right off her own body.  What a drama queen.<br /><br />Cinderalla has enormous black eyes with hints of purple iris and enormous though oddly foreshortened eyelashes.  Her hair is like a Dolly Parton dream of festoons and swoopy bouffant, and it's a bilious violet that after a while you get used to.  She has a cute little mouse friend who gelps her at the restaurant.  So far so good, but poor little Cinderalla falls in love with the Prince, not realizing that he too is a -- oh well if I go any further into the Japanese revisious, I will be spoiling things for new readers.  The book is small, a graphic novel shrunk down till it could fit into a DVD case.  But it gives you full measure of fun and morbid chuckles and--if you think you have problems --they too will seem small next to Cinderalla's.	2005-01-10

Please note, Amazon doesn't credit Boston-based professor Mehan (who teaches at Emerson College) with having much to do with this book, but it doesn't take a genius to figure out he had just as much say in assembling the contents as did his co-editor, Nalo Hopkinson, the famous novelist of Canada whom many credit as being the \\"next Octavia Butler.\\"  Together they make an imposing duo and they are wise indeed both in what they decided to do for and the people to whom they appealed for new work.  The result is smashing and one of the very best books of 2004.<br /><br />Wayde Compton's \\"fairy tale\\" is almost too beautiful to describe.  A \\"growing ball of light as bright as a sky full of half moons\\" appears to our hero and tells him that his name is Mr. Polaris.  By the way, the hero is called Lacuna and thus describes the position of writers of color, often, marginalized within the already marginalized community of science fiction.  That is, it's a world filled with its own rules and domains, yet those in charge of the dominant culture regard it with skepticism and even violence, based on the fear of losing their own Antaean strength--the exploring strength of the colonizer.<br /><br />The blind Victorian writer Celu Amberstone contributes a diaristic and chilling account of a mother-daughter relationship gone tragically wrong.  In this brief and pointillistic tale, the daughter is called \\"Sleek\\" and she is almost like the spirit of the mother before society's pressures (and the pressures of colonization) took the free will out of her.  The months and the days are each given beautiful and poetic names.  The penultimate entry will bring tears to your eyes--even if you are a rock.<br /><br />I wish I had time to list all the stories and what makes them good.  Before I sign off I could add that, although Compton and Amberstone are both Canadian, the anthology has many writers from other parts of North America too, including the USA, as well as from other parts of the world.  This world--our world.  The editors have skillfully suggested to their readers the ways in which all science fiction embodies aspects both of colonizing and post colonialist teleology.  It's an eye opener.  Hooray for Arsenal Pulp for bringing us the news in this handsome and durabe volume.f I could add that, although Compton and Amberstone are both Canadian, the anthology has many writers from other parts of North America too, including the USA, as well as from other parts of the world.

A house specialty.  Bottoms up.\\"<br /><br />This pair of paragraphs from Jess Arndt's lovely story \\"The Unheard Arms of Olly Malone\\" suggests some of the extra-literary quality of this collection of 21st Century erotica, ably assisted by San Francisco editor Diana Cage, herself a very fine writer who shouldn't have been so demure, she should have included some of her own work.  But that's just my peeve.  Outside of that, I think you will find BOTTOMS UP a provocative and intriguing collection, one that includes some of today's best and well-respected authors, as well as a bevy of young talent with lots and lots of skill.  \\"Robin\\" by Eileen Myles is a story that has been around for some time, but still overpowers one with the specificity and the brilliance of Myles' powers of description and connotation (i.e., she pulls you into the story with image)--\\"I call her Robin because she is red and black and angular and resembles a bird in her speed and her cruelty.  I fell in love with her briefly, last year.  I'm just not in love with her anymore but there's this residue.\\"  Similarly Robert Gluck's account of the Folsom Street Fair has some of the haunting quality of folk fairy tale material and was originally written for an anthology of fairy tales re-written and made up to date by gay male authors.  It is called, \\"The Glass Mountain\\" and  its sparkle and its sheer impassability call to mind the mountain of its title.  Haven't we all been in love a little bit like that.  You can't go up, you can only go around.  \\"I can reach myself only through the medium of a brittle young man whose shadow touches what it falls on, the grass rising again after it passes.\\"<br /><br />Among the writers who are newer to me I will evince \\"Cruising\\" by  Myriam Gurba as a tiny masterpiece of danger, psychic pain, and physical fulfillment.  The young woman who tells us this tale brings to mind poor Elizabeth Short, the \\"Black Dahlia\\" who, we hear, once cruised these same tawdry beaches and amusement galleries in a slickly drawn Long Beach.  Shoshanna Von Blankensee brings is \\"Billy,\\" a story of multiple sexualities and multiple paragraphs, each one outlining an erotic possibility that should, but cannot, cancel the other out.  She is like a Julio Cortazar except with, well, much more sex LOL.  Tennessee Jones' story is very tangibly an excerpt and thus leaves you longing for more, for its grittiness and sheer perversity brings to mind the near-Gothic Southern writing of William Goyen or Flannery O'Connor.  It is a story of boxcar sex and prison longing, redolent of scents and stench.  I look forward to hearing more from Mr. Jones.  I could tell you a little bit about each story, but I don't have the time or space, so i should close by citing the unusually structured, and enchanting \\"Knockout\\" by San Francisco's Sarah Fran Wisby.  \\"Knockout\\" perceptively tells the story of a young sex worker whose knowledge of being seen, of the male gaze, increases her power over men and her own inner desire to bring into clearer focus the nexus of her family.  It has a final line that will make the hair stand up at the back of your neck a la Emily Dickinson.<br /><br />Here's to all the dynamite writers who have come together for this splendid occasion, in Bottoms Up.  I hope it's a great success.<br /><br />\\"To scratchy dreams!\\"n who tells us this tale brings to mind poor Elizabeth Short, the \\"Black Dahlia\\" who, we hear, once cruised these same tawdry beaches and amusement galleries in a slickly drawn Long Beach.

It's a fun romp which mixes elements of McMahon's other widely acclaimed novels with the sexual daring and wit of someone like Vladimir Nabokov.  The hero is Ira Foxglove, a memorable name which signals the author's intention to write a not=quite=realistic book.  His wife has left him, and he's trying to re-establish a connection with his lovely young daughter.<br /><br />He's not much of a stylist, and some of the racier elements of the 70s seemed to have bored a hole in McMahon's libido.  As Foxglove watches a play rehearsal, he notices that: \\"All three were in faded blue jeans like Henley's, but through a split in one of the men's pants it was possible to verify that he wore no undershorts.\\"  And a few pages later, \\" Her arms were thin and languid in the long sleeves.  Certain kinetic effects verified that she wore no bra.\\"<br /><br />His ingenue snaps, \\"You big mother-grabbing bully.\\"<br /><br />\\"You said it,\\" Wolf came back.  \\"Grabbing you is like grabbing somebody's mother.\\"<br /><br />I don't remember \\"mother-grabbing\\" as a word with any currency, but maybe in the scientific community it had a sort of lingua franca that escaped laymen.  \\"Peaches lay still and breathed deeply.  She held the wrist of my anal hand in a tight grip.\\"  It's almost as though it was a translation from some other language--\\"my anal hand\\"--excuse me?<br /><br />That said, IRA FOXGLOVE is a romp through autumnal ardor by a respected author, and will please many.	2005-01-10

It's almost as though they were going in this case for the coffee table crowd.  They have dragooned in a motley group of authors to respond to Singer's work, and the results are predictably up and down.  Sometimes I had the feeling the exact same contributors could have been set upon to write appreciations of some other bygone figure, say Fanny Brice, and come up with the same kind of verbiage that fills column inches.  I did very much like Jonathanb Safron Foer's appreciation of Singer.  That boy is like the Human Litmus Paper of Jewish writing, sucking up even that which he cannot understand.<br /><br />Singer's first story \\"Old Age\\" was written when he was still a young man, in 1925.  He moved to the USA in 1935, and his first years were difficult ones.  SATAN IN GORAY was written in Warsaw, while THE ASHKENAZY BROTHERS was written in Brooklyn.  The book is jammed full of bright pictures of Singer looking puckish and cheerful, rather like Isaac Stern.  Ilan Stavans, the world's greatest authority on Singer, has edited this volume, not always to maximum effect, but I can imagine it was kind of a rush effort trying to maximize on the impact of Singer en masse.One photo looks like Singer lived in the apartment of Henry Darger, there is so much \\"clutter\\" it's surprising either was able to get any work done at all.	2005-01-10

Now the famous Pulitzer Prize author describes and outlines a whole new set of tests and questions, kind of like a proctor of poetry, sitting up at the front of the class with an all-watchful eye.  For nothing escape the notice of Carl Phillips.  Here he is on the pilgrimage of St James of Spain, \\"where we/ stopped to bathe, and/ / for the first time/ saw him naked--/ one tattoo: a deer, gutted,/ pinned in what he called/ your standard/ Christ-on-the-cross position,/ / by which, it seems now, he meant in/ no way a thing/ unholy.\\"  By the time I get to the end of that I'm all sixes and sevens and wondering if \\"meant\\" is a transitive verb or not.  \\"By which he meant in no way a thing unholy.\\"  I take it that the man's naked body reveals something of the godlike about it, even with its ugly tattoo of a gutted deer.  Perhaps these tattoos are bigger in the high Castilian Spain of Compostela than they are in PETA-friendly California where I read the poem?  Or does the poem indicate that the nude man has not been blasphemous about Christ on the cross?  It's a fabulous riddle, and it's thrust into the middle of a poem in which the donkey is shot and a spray of indigo and sweetleaf is thrust into the bullet hole--again, as if to say, my life is a bit more brutal than yours and I am far from an academic poet but almost a big game hunter of barnyard animals.  So it's confusing.<br /><br />Nevertheless you come away from the book wondering if perhaps we are getting pummeled, as though with BB shot, by these powerful poems too often nowadays and maybe Mr. Phillips should take a break and not release so many books, though I understand the impulse to strike while the iron is hot for tomorrow, you may be outdated like John Masefield or someone, and ditto the impulse to take down what the Vates dictate to you.  For if you are not receptive to the words of the poem, they will go somewhere else entirely.else entirely.	2005-01-10

I hope they paid him a lot of money to do these hack jobs on Christie's already perfect plays, because he sure killed whatever credibility he had as a poet, critic and essayist.  HJe wrote a good book on Agatha Christie, but why go to him to turn the plays into novels?  Surely a fiction writer would have been a better choice.<br /><br />The Unexpected Guest wasn't even one of Christie's plays but when it is played properly on stage the character of Richard Warwick gets analyzed from many different perspectives until it becomes like Citizen Kane, a prism of a dead man's life.  For better or worse (and usually for worse) he affected the lives of everyone around him--his wife, his mother, his retarded half-brother Jan, and others.  I wonder what Christie originally intended to do with her tale's biggest loophole--what happened to Nurse Warburton, the corrupt nurse whom Richard Warwick bribed to give false testimony during the inquest into the death of the boy he ran over?  I always imagine that, if the police dug deeper, they would find that \\"Warby\\" had been murdered also--shot to death, just like Richard.  What do you fans think?	2005-01-10

He is fairly fearless when it comes to painting a portrait of himself as the ultimate New York society queen. Poor guy died of AIDS not long after this book was published, and I find it still enjoyable. It seems as though a lot of Sotheby's secrets went to the grave with him, for he certainly knew where most of the bodies were buried. His account of the Andy Warhol estate auction is mind boggling, so you will forgive him his gaucheries and his non-stop bitchiness. Another good story is how he auctioned off (for charity) the services of David Hockney who volunteered to paint your swimming pool, and how the film producer Lester Persky had to be shamed into bidding for what was on the face of it an incredible bargain. We all love auction stories, for they remind us that maybe someday we will find a bargain worth bragging about, whether in the world of the decorative and visual arts, or in romance, as I did when I married my present wife.	2005-01-05

It is stretching it, however, to call it a book of collected provocations.  More like the same old miscellany every writer eventually publishes--his speeches, book reviews, catalogue essays for exhibitions, \\"second thoughts\\" on his greatest hits, etc.  Provocations would describe about twenty pages of it, the rest would be ego.  As I made my way through the book I thought to myself, \\"Next we'll be getting his commencement addresses,\\" and then I turned a page and bang, there's one printed out in full.<br /><br />That's not to say that among the many, many pieces here aren't some with permanent value.  His review of Gabriel Garcia Marquez' novel CHRONICLE OF A DEATH FORETOLD imparts some biographical tidbits about GGM which you will find nowhere else (the two writers are chance acquaintances and are often called to speak together on panels about Latin American literature).<br /><br />He is also a trustworthy observer of human nature whose insights into the mysteries of the heart are usually spot on.  And his eye for other men's writing is very good.  I would never have read THE LIGHTNING OF AUGUST if not for his perceptive review of it in The NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW in 1986.  Even his analysis of Homer's Iliad has a weary sort of wisdom to it, the kind that Peter O'Toole wore so heavily on his brow in the recent blockbuster movie of TROY.<br /><br />I shouldn't play the September 11th card, not to poor old Ariel Dorfman, but he really shouldn't be playing it either.  he could have thought of some other title to sell his miscellaneous prose under.  But in a way I don't blame him, his credentials are what he has to sell, and after having read Dorfman's DEATH AND THE MAIDEN many will be anxious to see what he has to say about Al Qaeda and about the torture village of Abu Ghraib.  Good collection.	2005-01-05

Marc Taylor goes way underground to come out with the 60s story that could only have happened in Detroit, the saga of the marvelous Marvelettes.  Somehow he got the cooperation of the \\"tall one,\\" Katherine Anderson, and so at every turn we hear Katherine's version of events, always a little bitter and skewed, although she always prefaces her remarks with something like, \\"Oh, I didn't really mind, BUT--\\"  We take the whole tumultuous roller coaster ride from sleepy little Inkster, Michigan (remember on American Bandstand when an addled Marvelette claimed that \\"Detroit is a suburb of Inkster\\" and then she got laughed right out of the group?) to the disastrous final move of Motown to LA during the course of which the Marvelettes just got forgotten about and had to disband.  In the face of what seems like extensive drug, drink and mental problems of their lead singer, the \\"wanda-ful\\" Wanda Young, it's surprising they stayed afloat so long, not to mention being able to record such masterworks of the human spirit as \\"The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game,\\" \\"My Baby Must be a Magician,\\" \\"Don't Mess with Bill\\" (all written and produced by Smokey Robinson) and the divinely inspired cover remake of \\"When You're Young And In Love.\\"  Taylor takes us there every step of the way.<br /><br />Others have criticized him for relying too heavily on Katherine's jaundiced memories.  But what was the guy supposed to do?  She has a good and extensive memory and she seems to recall every slight and every hurt ever dealt to her, all under a cover of pretended indifference.  Besides, most of her stories get corroborated by others Taylor interviews, whether they be members of the Vandellas, or Brenda Holloway, or perhaps some of the mysterious Aldantes--the backup girl singers who wound up singing on 75 percent of the later Motown releases.

Corin Redgrave delivers a paper on his father's film work which makes one yearn to see more of Michael Redgrave's films.  There's a splendid article on B-movie production in the 1950s that focusses in on \\"Tympean Films,\\" and shows that B-movies can sometimes embody more of social reality than the A pictures because they do so more or less by accident.  Robert Giddings reads the Dirk Bogarde version of A TALE OF TWO CITIES in light of the Cold War, and Dirk figures heavily in Alison Platt's piquant essay, \\"Boys, Ballet, and Begonias: The SPANISH GARDENER and its analogues.\\"  Sarah Kasen gives a straightforward account of the place of film in the Festival of Britain, and Tony Aldgate shows the places in which the gay-themed SERIOUS CHARGE had trouble making it to the screen with all its bits intact.  One stupid note spoils the whole: The timeline appended to the volume shows that the only event in UK literature worth recording in 1955 was the publication of F.R. Leavis' \\"DH LAWRENCE, NOVELIST.\\"  i don't think so!  This bizarre anomaly is explained by the fact that one of the editors (Ian Mackillop) is the world's #1 Leavis expert and it is he who is charged with the uphill task of resuscitating Leavis' thoroughly torpid reputation.	2005-01-03

Siedell, has contacted seven scholars (and himself) and gotten them to write what amount to quite insightful essays.  The book could have been less skimpy and might have trawled its net a little wider, how many times do we have to hear from Gioia and Reidel again, for example?  However what each of them writes is good, although reading Reidel's article about the place of film in Kees' life is a bit of deja vu since everything he says in it (or almost) is said better in the biography.  Gioia contributes a nice straightforward account of the mysteries and revelations of Weldon Kees' posthumous reputation.  A lovely touch to the book was its display (in black and white alas) of many of Kees' paintings and drawings, which go far towards confirming the idea that some people have that he is a painter more interesting than many in his New York group, the Irascibles.  B H Friedman cites Kees as an example of a \\"polyartist,\\" one who is good at more than one thing (and the things have to be from different disciplines, not just someone who can writer both poetry and fiction).  All in all, it's a creditable survey of Kees' work in several fields, and places at least his artwork in context of other contemporary practitioners.  More could have been done to help explain the ways in which his poetry differs from that of, say, Elizabeth Bishop or Robert Lowell, two poets to whom Kees kind of lost the race for fame.  But in a way, moving to San Francisco rather sealed his fate, didn't it?  All of a sudden he was out in the sticks, gone provincial, and it seems to a certain extent he had sort of left poetry behind to become more of an all-around showman in films and theater.  Who knows what would have happened next had he not mysteriously vanished one night, apparently a suicide in 1955, jumping from our beautiful and melancholy Golden Gate Bridge?	2005-01-03

No, it was part and parcel of her personality, and can be seen in her writing as well.  Watson discovers that outside of the famous TALES FROM SHAKESPEARE which she wrote with her brother Charles (splitting down the corpus of Shakespeare by ignoring the histories, writing up the comedies, and leaving the tragedies to Charles), Mary Lamb wrote other books as well, which she makes sound perfectly fascinating.  I would love to read the \\"Mrs. Leicester\\" book and hope that Tarcher, which published this fine biography, will print a companion book of Mary Lamb's collected writing.<br /><br />She hints also that Mary was drawn to many men, including the romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who was so sexy that she just couldn't help herself when he was around.  Charles eventually had to ask Coleridge not to come around because a visit from him would find Mary going a little crazy.<br /><br />Watson brings us into the early 19th century world of the madhouse, which is a pretty creepy place.  Women with private means like Mary Lamb had their own rooms and own attendants, but still they must have seen some dreadful sights, making their lives very different from other women of their class who were in general protected from the seamy.  You can never forget however, that Mary killed her own mother with a knife, a crime so rare that people hardly ever run into it, even judges with long histories of criminal cases, even hardened homicide cops.  Why did she do it?  Watson provides a limited answer.  In my mind Mary Lamb's psychology was similar to Lizzie Borden's, except she was perhaps more lovable and had more of a humorous nature.  But both were brooders and both nurtured an unassimilable hatred toward the patriarchal structure of the family.	2005-01-02

But it's an important book for those interested in civil liberties.  CANDY was the subject of many lawsuits, some of which involved Americans' rights to read what they please.  The novel itself is a stinging satire on commercialism, consumer culture, and 1950s obsesssion with sex at the same time as hypocrisy reigned over all.  Terry Southern was a pioneer in bringing the satirical impulses of Horace and Catullus into postwar writing with his famous troika of CANDY, THE MAGIC CHRISTIAN, and the screenplay for DR STRANGELOVE, voted by the American Film Institute to be the third funniest film of all time.  Southern knew everyone, and his son writes down the names as fast as he can, but some detail is lost.  I was curious to read more about how Doris Lessing fit into the pot-smoking crowd of the Left Bank in Paris during the 1950s, but we get her name and little more.<br /><br />The reader feels sorry for the actress Ewa Aulin, who took the role of Candy and you would have think she'd have been prepared for anything, but it seems from Nile Southern's descriptions she was abused by Marlon Brando and had a nervous breakdown due to this abuse and the producers crassly decided to keep her going by stabilizing her with a pharmacopia of drugs.  Unfortunately Nile Southern treats this affair as though it were part of the rollicking story of his dad and Uncle Mason scamming the courts.  But it leaves a sour taste in one's mouth.	2005-01-02

RUNNING WITH THE BULLS seems to me a masterpiece of biographical writing.  Although she only knew him during his fial two years on earth, Valerie knew him pretty well, and he fell in love with her, showing her sides to himself that illuminated the rest.  He was not always the strutting, macho \\"old man,\\" not with Valerie Danby-Smith.  She was a young Irish secretary who wanted to burst out of the convent-educated world of high-echelon Guinness secretarial staff, so she went to Spain and met the actress Beverly Bentley (from Mike Todd Jr's SCENT OF MYSTERY, the first and last film made in \\"Smell-O-Vision\\" and eventually the Hemingway clan who were there for the bullfights.<br /><br />I loved the way she was able in a single page to shade in all sorts of information about Hemingway--the authors and artists he admired, the kinds of food he preferred, his difficulties writing what became THE DANGEROUS SUMMER.  She was in the habit, she tells us, of writing down notes every time she saw Hemingway, and she uses these judiciously.  I do feel she had some bone to pick about A E Hotchner, I can't make out what it was.  She has an agenda going on that's for sure, and \\"Hotch\\" is not on her happy list.<br /><br />It's really three books in one because not only does Valerie describe Ernest Hemingway (and to a lesser degree Mary, his wife and eventually widow) better than previous biographers, but she also tells us all about two other men in her life--the Irish playwright Brendan Behan, and Gregory Hemingway, the tragically transvestite youngest son of Ernest, whom Valerie insanely married some years after Papa's suicide.  He led her a merry chase all right, but they had four children and moved to Montana, eventually divorcing once Gregory turned dangerous.  He later had a sex change and became Gloria Hemingway, and died in a women's prison in 1995.

In the US Leo Lionni designed the catalogue for Edward Steichen's big FAMILY OF MAN photo show in the 1950s, and so blame it on Lionni--blame WE ARE THE WORLD on him too.  He gave Andy Warhol his start drawing pictures of women's shoes in advertising.  And he designed the Ab-Ex inspired US pavilion at the 1958 Brussells Worlds Fair.  He was a protege of Marinetti and felt a kinship with the Italian futurists, although he knew in his heart of hearts he was not a Futurist himself.  At the same time Fascism was descending upon Italy and Lionni knew too many Communists.  So he left his wife and little Mannie and Paolo and moved to Philadelphia.  Later, Paolo died under mysterious circumstances, a death so bitter and poignant that poor Lionni can't even tell the reader what happened in simple sentences, but I take it that he either died of heroin overdose, AIDS or suicide.  Nora was the name of Mme. Lionni, and she is pictured here as a saint, the perfect wife like Nora in the THIN MAN movies, plus sexy like Myrna Loy or indeed Nora Barnacle the wife of James Joyce.  In all the photos she is distinctively stylish, as befits one who has lived in Genoa and Naples and Milan.<br /><br />Among the interesting adventures of Lionni in America was his stint at Black Mountain College.  I've read a lot of accounts written by people who went to Black Mountain (in North Carolina) and his is among the best, for he met there Jean Varda and Jacob Lawrence, and the Gropiuses among others, all in one ecstatically remembered summer right after World War II.  Anyone interested in Black Mountain College might well go out and buy this book just for the chapter on BMC.  Lionni also has fond memories of Alexander Calder, and Leger, and Man Ray, which will take the bitter taste out of the mouths of Man Ray fans who were stung last year to find out that their hero might have worked in concert with the Black Dahlia killer (in the book BLACK DAHLIA AVENGER, a very good book but harsh on Man Ray!)  This book presents the human, funny side of Man.  Lionni was an okay designer and an okay painter, nothing to write home about, but evidently he bloomed when he started writing books for children.  Maybe the death of his own boy, Paolo, heightened his sensitivity to what children like and don't like.  As of this writing he is still going at age 94, still creating his precious little books for kids.  This memoir has its dull spells, but they are largely because Lionni's style is not really English at all, but some hybrid blend of Babelfish and Socialist cliches.ok presents the human, funny side of Man.

But Not As Much	ON SPEC is a novel very much of its time and place.  It had the misfortune of being released at a time when the US reading public wasn't in the mood for acidly funny satires of Hollywood development hell, not that most people care about that kind of thing anyhow, despite the recent book OPEN SEASON which purports to theorize that Joe Average knows about big box office.  But Rushfield is a warm, compassionate writer with a knack for creating humorous characters, a kind of Max Shulman of the 1990s, and his book should have done better.  Hell, even KENNEL BREAK wound up sounding like a good feature film.  Its writer, Stu Bluminvitz, gets treated terribly by everyone around him (except his Mom and Dad) and yet, like Candide, he just doesn't seem to notice.<br /><br />It's a book which makes you wonder--why write at all?  ON SPEC was advertised as being like Bridget Jones' Diary, but the truth is, it is more like a Terry Southern novel than anything written in the past thirty years.  Some have evinced the novels of Bruce Wagner, but Wagner is playing in a different ballpark altogether.  It is to Rushfield we turn to when we want to find how things were done under the desks of Hollywood bigwigs in the decadent days before 9/11.	2004-12-30

Andy, the old pig reprobate who lies dying while his wife watches, apparently devoted to him but inwardly nursing a whole different set of feelings, -- Andy is a lot like Andy Sipowicz of the USA network cop show NYPD Blue.  Ian Holm played the part in the premiere ten years ago and I imagine he was very good.  Or you can picture Marlon Brando playing in MOONLIGHT along the lines of his part in LAST TANGO IN PARIS.  Alas, those days are far behind us now.  The wife is very secretive and you know she hasn't had a happy life having to put up with Andy's incessant vulgarity and prejudice, not to mention the way he arranged their family life so that their two sons are at each other's throats.  The wife, Bel, bides her time and drops her bombshell just at the appropriate moment -- I don't want to give away any spoilers, but if you know Joyce's story \\"The Dead\\" you already know what kind of secret a wife can keep for many years.  MOONLIGHT is a wonderful play and a good one for college productions too, though I wouldn't recommend it for high school due to the rough language and the advanced themes of aging, disintegration, and death.  However many a young ingenue will thrill to be given the part of \\"Bridget,\\" a real Audrey Hepburn \\"Ondine\\" role if ever there was one.  A part Pinter is said to have based on the crazy mad Lucia Joyce.<br /><br />\\"Once someone said to me-I think it was my mother or my father--anyway, they said to me--We've been invited to a party.  You've been invited too.  But you'll have to come by yourself, alone.  You won't have to dress up.  You just have to wait until the moon is down.\\"  Thus begins Bridget's climactic speech, one of the greatest monologues in the modern theater.

Lindy Woodhead has donesome amazing research, can you imagine, she spent months kneeling on the floors of Krakow parishes to find just the right birth certificate for Helena (nee Chaja) Rubinstein--not an easy thing to do, especially given the fact that Rubinstein lied about her age by several years!  And in every case Woodhead goes the extra nine yards to try to distinguish what is true and what is false about her two millionairesses.  They were among the first to sell American women the \\"culture of beauty,\\" to insist that the cosmetics they sold would bring the consumer a whole zeitgeist of pleasure, not just individual beauty treatments.  To this end they conspired with Madison Avenue and devised decades worth of intriguing, perhaps misleading advertisements.<br /><br />In the end what lets us down is the feeling that perhaps the two women aren't actually that different, and it gets confusing trying to remember their slight differences--which of the two was four feet ten, while the other was five foot two?  A depressing business saga of how the mass public can be manipulated with great success, but they will pay you back in the most final way--they will forget you as soon as you're not alive any more.	2004-12-26

Editor Douglas Brinkley does a fine job putting this material into context, even if he makes overstated claims for it, and even if he seems so needlessly to kiss John Sampas' ass, even dedicating this book to him among others of his cohort.  We learn a lot about Kerouac from these journals, a lot that's valuable and a lot that shows us just why so many fell in love with his mind and his thoughtful, sometimes halting way of proceeding, always trying to do the right thing despite innumerable obstacles.  I think also he had a natural inclination to be sort of the bad boy, and then he had the spectre of his dead brother acting on him as a kind of good angel always steering him right.  With utmost seriousness he tried to plot out his life and his course of spiritual action; of course, as we see, women, booze, guys, and wanderlust got in his way, caused him to stray from the path.<br /><br />His very earnestness however is endearing: \\"This is why life is holy,\\" he states on pg. 211 (think of the irony on top of which such a statement would be laden today by Kerouac's so-called successors), \\"Because it is not a lonely accident.  Therefore, again, we must love and be reverent of one another, till the day when we are all angels looking back.\\"  He sounds an apocalyptic note: \\"Those who are not reverent now may be the most reverent then (in their other, electrical, spiritual form.)  Will there be a Judgement Day?  No need to judge the living or the dead: only the happy and the unhappy with tears of pity.\\"  Kerouac seems to have seen clearly what escapes all of us but the most enlightened, that we are all creatures of sorrow and of what he calls \\"electricity,\\" the charge that makes us human.<br /><br />But not all of WINDBLOWN WORLD is so solemn, there are some hilarious tidbits and routines, such as the curriculum JK develops in October 1949 (pp. 226-28) for a kind of \\"New College for Comedians,\\" with imaginary courses that might be given by Burroughs \\"How to Play the Horses\\" and Huncke: \\"Modern Drugs.\\"  His own courses were more poetic: \\"Riddles and Roses\\" and \\"The Myth of the Rainy Night.\\"  The requirements to get into the school?  \\"Sixty points in elementary realization, largesse, comedown, sorrow, and truest love.\\"a kind of \\"New College for Comedians,\\" with imaginary courses that might be given by Burroughs \\"How to Play the Horses\\" and Huncke: \\"Modern Drugs.\\"  His own courses were more poetic: \\"Riddles and Roses\\" and \\"The Myth of the Rainy Night.\\"  The requirements to get into the school?  \\"Sixty points in elementary realization, largesse, comedown, sorrow, and truest love.\\"	2004-12-23

Its subtitle, \\"A True Story of Crime and Art,\\" might as well have been \\"Nine or Ten True Stories of Crime and Art.\\"  You do the math--there are the two parallel sagas of the robberies at Russborough House, which apparently have nothingto do with each other and that's the point.  Then there is the story of the world's love of Vermeer, and how he above all other painters is venerated today.  Hart compounds the Vermeer story by showing how art restorers have come up with soome farfetched theories of how Vermeer painted, presenting them as newly-discovered facts rather than the wild speculations they are.  We also get the robbery of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum here in the USA and the finally the team that made away with THE SCREAM in Norway.<br /><br />Any one of these storylines could have made a good book.  I particularly liked the beginning chapters, which showed the political education of a British heiress and how she found herself deeper and deeper into the ideological clutches of the IRA; her story is worthy of Joseph Conrad, and Hart does it justice, even though he is forced to conclude it after only one or two chapters.  The personality of Martin Cahill, whom I remember from the awesome John Boorman film of THE GENERAL, gets some new shadings here too.  I imagine Hart had to be discreet in some places, both to protect his sources and to protect himself, as well, from libel suits, and the book is a splendid example of how to insinuate certain things without every having to come out and say them out loud.  I still didn't get the title, \\"The Irish Game,\\" might as well have called it, \\"The Norwegian Game.\\"	2004-12-23

The proceedings were filmed by the artist Bruce Conner, a longtime friend of DeFeo's, and assembled by him into a film called THE WHITE ROSE: JAY DEFEO's PAINTING REMOVED BY ANGELIC HOSTS (actually Bekins movers).<br /><br />After a few showings, the painting was stored at the San Francisco Art Institute and eventually plastered over to stabilize its shifting masses of paint and also to protect it from student graffiti.  For many years it hid behind this plaster and its absence became a giant statement.  DeFeo herself began to think of Conner's film as a kind of displaced substitute for her work, and Jane Green and Leah Levy, the editors of the present volume, are astute enough to let this fact speak for itself.  In a great act of showmanship, Lisa Phillips, a Whitney curator, not only restored the painting but bought it for the Whitney where it can be viewed today (sometimes).<br /><br />This book contains many essays by people who were close to DeFeo, as well as some by those who never met her.  Bill Berkson's essay imagines the 1960 \\"Sixteen Americans\\" show by Dorothy Miller (which featured DeFeo, as well as her husband Wally Hedrick, in addition to giving national exposure to the likes of Frank Stella, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg), but was missing THE ROSE, which DeFeo did not send saying it was not yet finished.  Lucy Lippard's essay considers similarities between DeFeo's production and that of her contemporaries Eva Hesse and the Lees--Lee Bontecue and Lee Lozano, relating her depressing years of inactivity (1966-1970) to the nascent women's art movement.  It is provocative to say the least.  The University of California Press has printed many fine photos to go with the book, including some color images which I had never seen.ver seen.	2004-12-22

But if you have read the revious five books you won't mind that some if not all of this information is being fed to you again--the series dilemma, I suppose.  Mark is the editor of a smallish city newspaper and usually gets involved not because he's a snoop but to try to extricate someone who's dear to him who's being suspected of a crime.  This crime is particularly difficult to solve and frankly, when I found out who the criminal was, I threw the book to the ground in disgust.  I don't think even Michael Craft knew the answer to this one till he pulled the solution way out of left field.  But it is a shocker!  What a pity that poor long suffering Mark has only one more \\"case\\" after this one, in the fantasticly written final volume of the series.

The hero is Liam, a photographer with a powerful sex urge and a deep melancholy who is trying desperately to get over the pull of his former boyfriend, Ray.  Almost accidentally he begins to answer personal ads in the gay papers like TIME OUT.  As an American reader, I didn't realize that the \\"small ads\\" must have some kind of sex connotation to them, the kind that \\"personal\\" evokes here in the USA (so this bok can be recommended for broadening one's vocabulary as well).<br /><br />It's been three years since Ray, and soon Liam finds himself in bed with a strapping young boy called Jack.  Sex rears its head and suddenly Liam realizes ehat a fool he's been all these years, wasting his time mourning a man who, perhaps, never really loved him any more than his nicely decorated apartment or collection of Pet Shop Boys CDs, no matter how gleamingly polished, did or do.  He takes out his camera and begins to photograph Jack's sleeping head, shoulders, ass.  You'd think he was happy but shortly afterwards, another day, the temptation to answer another ad seizes him.  And then it begins, the endless addiction to sex in the papers.<br /><br />Hartnett clearly has been intimate with a lot of men, and in addition Liam exhibits a keen interest in Dennis Nilsen, the gay serial killer whom some have compared to the USA's Jeffrey Dahmer (who apparently counted Nilsen as one of his role models).  I'm not sure what's going on with this aspect of the novel, but whatever it's doing, it works.  Those of you who love London for its seediness and for the availablity of every kind of man on its sex underground, will nod in recognition as you find yourselves portrayed in this book, as though in Huysmans' dark mirror.

But she's  spent a lot of time thinking about stardom and Hollywood and audience and appeal, and in MY LUCKY STARS she gives it to us without holding much back.  Her love affair with Robert Mitchum is presented as a Romeo and Juliet folie a deux in which the two of them entered a private world out of which they never really found their way back out.  When she became intimate with Yves Montand, even after knowing what he had done to Marilyn Monroe, his co-star on an earlier picture, you really have to wonder if Shirley has a masochistic streak.  (I suppose co-starring with Jerry Lewis, you'd need one.)  And frankly, her description of a sizzling sex affair with Danny Kaye didn't ring true.<br /><br />Far more solid is her recounting of Debra Winger's acting out on the set of TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, and in one of the very last chapters, \\"SAY ANYTHING,\\" Shirley really lets her hair down with a series of anecdotes about her fellow stars that are too hot to repeat; she protects their anonymity by not revealing their names, but their identities will be obvious to anyone who knows anything about Hollywood.  The story about John and Bo Derek is far more graphic and gruesome than anything you could have imagined.  Well, maybe it's not the Dereks, since Shirley doesn't name them, but hey, she does everything but draw their faces on the margins of the chapter.  Read it if you're in the mood for a good shock.<br /><br />By her own accounting, Mac Laine has now made three comebacks in the movies (with THE TURNING POINT, with TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, and with GUARDING TESS).  She might go on to do more, who knows?  You may not like her any more than you did before you started reading this book, but you'll have gotten a grainier look at Hollywood life than anything since the last Bruce Wagner novel.

I like the way Marion Meade outlines Ferber's life as a series of occasions surrounding the writing of a novel.  Plain and dumpy, Ferber was not the sort to inspire passion in men (or women I guess), except for the one ambiguous relationship with newspaperman William Allen White, old enough to be her father and who might have nourished more-than-fatherly feelings for young Edna when she became his protege.  Meade hints at this but admits the evidence is scarce on the ground.<br /><br />Yes, Parker, Millay and Zelda Fitzgerald had a lot more sex in their lives, but after reading about the way they each seemed to burn themselves out in the 1920s, I wound up with a bit more respect for the woman who stayed the course and kept on writing her novels right into the 1960s.  Yes, the underrated Edna Ferber.<br /><br />An issue of the NEW YORKER last month had some nasty things to say about Edna Ferber under the guise of reviewing the new Library of America volume of George S. Kaufman plays.  It's almost as though the reviewer was thinking, \\"It's open season on Edna Ferber and I can say whatever lousy things I want, because no one will call him on it.\\"  That's one clown should have his ass kicked but good.	2004-12-16

The two of them write very smoothly together, and My Goodness, did they have access--even the foreword was written by Frederic March, the venerable acting patriarch.  That said, the book is very dated.  A lot of it has to be read through the prism of inflation, for large chunks of it are spent in sober, and eye-opening accounts of financing Broadway productions, but of course today the figures don't mean anything.  We learn, for example, that it cost 17 million dollars a year to mount all he Broadway shows--&#34;less than it cost to wage one day of the Viet Nam war.&#34;  Today the figures would be much higher.<br /><br />It is also amusing to read about the long ago divas who are forgotten today, and also the author's predictions for who will have a longtime showbiz career--the stars of tomorrow, that is.  On the distaff side, they pick Blythe Danner, who did pretty well for herself but who, some think, never did as well as she was supposed to have.  For their male star of tomorrow, the authors focus on a young Nebraskan called Terry Kiser.  Who?  He sounds odious from the profile they make of him.  Maybe his personality caused his career to falter.<br /><br />The chapter called &#34;The Sexual Ethic&#34; focusses largely on the question of whether there is a secret homosexual cult that rules the world of Broadway.  The authors are not certain, but they suspect so.  Very few names are given.  It's not very edifying.  &#34;The counterphobia that underlies performance carries over into the actor's sex life and may cause perversity--group sex, mate swapping, promiscuity, bisexuality, obsessional sexuality, and homosexuality.&#34;  Whew, count me in!ity, and homosexuality.&#34;  Whew, count me in!	2004-12-14

I'm not sure exactly why author Shriver is telling her story in epistolary form, but it doesn't work.  Franklin, who Eva addresses in her letters, already knows half the things she painstakingly writes out to him, it's the clumsiest exposition I've seen in quite a while.  I know others have argued that Eva is not really writing to Franklin but more to herself, but in that case why not make it a diary, the whole device smacks of the kind of thing novelists used to write when they hoped their book would be featured on the Oprah Winfrey program.  Now that Oprah has turned her attention to the classics, perhaps contemporary fiction will turn away from the marketing principles on which it is currently organized.<br /><br />Other reviewers have suggested that perhaps Shriver knows a \\"Kevin\\" (i.e. a sociopath) or has personally had the misfortune of knowing someone like that in her own family or among her circle of acquaintances.  I hope not, but in any case I don't think so, the whole thing smacks of research to me.  But perhaps she did know someone named \\"Kevin\\" who did her wrong when she was a girl or something.<br /><br />It is a bitter, twisted, curiously compelling novel but it is much longer than it has to be.  I don't mind books being long, but come on, Alice Munro could have told this story in 30 pages and it would have been great.	2004-12-14

He has many moods, but you might catch him in his Arizona version of Mark Twain mood, where word leaps up on word to outdo everything that has gone before, for a a folklorist of the fabulist he has no peer.  Then to turn to the tales collected in AT THE JIM BRIDGER is to fall into a trap of melancholy and missed chances that will remind you of a more varied sort of John Cheever.  The suburban outlook is unmistakable, but in Carlson it is endearing.  One story, \\"The Potato Gun,\\" is haunting as anything ever written by Andre Dubus, while \\"The Towel Season\\" is like something Nabokov might have written had he a household full of kids.	2004-12-12

But I was disappointed on opening the book to find out that your only advice in MOVE WITHOUT THE BALL gets repeated in innumerable ways for about 150 pages too long.  Yes, it is for student athletes, but I don't think any of them would profit from your tips.  This time you are moving with the ball, it is clenched between your arm and your ribs and it seems you are frozen in one rhetorical posture.  TEENS CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN was a livelier book with more of an edge, and seemed to capture the dynamism of your speaking style.  My mother always used to say, \\"Listen to Stedman Graham, because any man who could woo and win Oprah Winfrey must have a lot on the ball,\\" and Mom is always right.  However, the writing in MOVE is very flat and limp.  You profile a lot of athletes and never hint that any of them are leading less than a perfect life.  We know too much about the pains and troubles of life to believe you, life isn't easy even when you're moving without the ball.  I believe you would like to boost the success ratio of kids, but empty words and promises are not going to do it.  \\"Be honest,\\" you say (on page 102).  Why not tell that to Barry Bonds and Jason Giambi instead of to the young people who have never lied to you or to the American public.  \\"Do the work that is required,\\" but Stedman, we all know plenty of kids who do the right thing all the time and yet they are treated wrongly by the systems that prevail.<br /><br />I like one piece of your advice, \\"Take the time to see things through,\\" and I advise you to take more time, before you produce your nest best-weller, for my gut feeling is you are trying to write too many books too fast and the quality is suffering.  You can't churn a book out like a tub of butter.<br /><br />Your fan, Kevin	2004-12-08

I remember seeing him many years ago, perhaps in 1998 or 1999 reading for the Poetry Center at San Francisco State University, where he was then celebrating the release of his famous first book FRESH KILLS, but also as some poets do he went on to give some \\"sneaky peeks\\" from a forthcoming book that he was then just starting work on.  I remember him reading a poem, \\"Growing,\\" that has the line in it, \\"She was a lighter and I was a cigarette,\\" and right away I knew, his rough, easy to love delivery marked him down as a present-day Walt Whitman, with one eye on the circumstances of the everyday and the other on the vatic and holy.<br /><br />Now \\"Growing\\" and many more poems have been assembled and published by New York's fast-growing Soft Skull Press.  The book may be a little long but you have to remember it contains the work of many years of sowing, reaping, and harvest.  After the ill-conceived tribute to Gerhard Richter he produced last year for the San Francisco portion of the Richter retrospective (ESCAPE VELOCITY is dedicated to Gerhard Richter), I thought that perhaps his sense of humor had left him, but no, it is here and more, squared, from the front cover portrait of four black prisoners on a turn of the century chain gang, to the back cover which has four black men playing music, standing around, and dancing, and the blurb by Bono, perhaps the same one from the band U2.  Anyhow, there's another funny poem in the book called \\"Rated X,\\" Breskin's philosophical meditations on what happens to women who decide to chop off the \\"members\\" of their boyfriends who did them wrong.  \\"Take him home in a doggy bag,\\" it concludes, in a wry burst of wit.  Guys who are sensitive about this sort of thing, you can skip the two pages 32 and 33, and go on to other poems in the book.  In \\"Today's Place Crash\\" you will read a chilling poem that will inevitably remind you of the twin towers going down on 9/11, as Vreskin borrows his Thomas Lux voice to intone grimly, \\"The black box tape reeling sticky impact/ of quickening terror is the jokester.\\"<br /><br />His jokes are sly and usually subversive, and his images are lovely, like the \\"trampoline of waffles\\" counterposed to the \\"bad boy's erection.\\"<br /><br />I love the names of his children, to whom he dedicates his most heartfelt poem, a girl called, \\"Billie Miro,\\" and a boy called, \\"Theolonius Blue,\\" kind of jazzy names and certain to cause talk in the playground.  So, if you get a chance to hear Breskin read, run, don't walk, he is earthy and intense, and makes you feel you have a laser beam going from your ears into his heart.ably remind you of the twin towers going down on 9/11, as Vreskin borrows his Thomas Lux voice to intone grimly, \\"The black box tape reeling sticky impact/ of quickening terror is the jokester.\\" <br /> <br />His jokes are sly and usually subversive, and his images are lovely, like the \\"trampoline of waffles\\" counterposed to the \\"bad boy's erection.\\" <br /> <br />I love the names of his children, to whom he dedicates his most heartfelt poem, a girl called, \\"Billie Miro,\\" and a boy called, \\"Theolonius Blue,\\" kind of jazzy names and certain to cause talk in the playground.

The building was once a hotel, then a school, and the odd thing was, as More reports, that guests at the hotel never reported any sense of well being, in fact they had disturbing experiences staying there that ultimately, he hints, led to the financial failure of the hotel and its sale to developers after World War II.  At the same time, there was a terrile flood in 1952 which decimated the entire neighborhood, and the \\"Friends of Lee Abbey\\" sprang into being to raise money and awareness to restore the huge crumbling mansion, which looks like an old castle from the legends of Tintagel.  People who like Wagner will appreciate that the story of Tristan and Isolde took plsce not too far from Lee Abbey, as the crow flies, many hundreds of years before its purchase by Christians.<br /><br />When you go there, and this soothing little companion book will make sure you do, you will find relatively unchanged a scene right out of the early 1950s.  No expense has been spared in making this one of the top spiritual retreats in all of Western Europe.  For those of you who cannot afford a pilgimage to Mecca or to Jerusalem or to the Vatican, and yet want a top-flight religious experience, check out Lee Abbey today, and you will want to bring this little handbook with you on your stay.  It makes you feel good all over, from the tips of your toes to the tips of your angel wings.	2004-12-08

It's the story of Sara, a young girl of ten years old in Florida who is constantly being ignored by her parents and her sister, sexy, willful Alison Chapman, who must be a junior or something in high school.  No matter how Sara begs, no one in her family will come to see her play in any athletic events, and sports is the only thing that she excels in, it's not like she's beautiful like her older, preoccupied sister.  Alison is having some romantic problems because she's fallen in love with the bad boy biker Sam Cody, who's new to town.  Gossips at the high school claim that Sam is the illegitimate son of Alec Baldwin.  He (Sam) looks like a cross between Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt.<br /><br />Alison has another friend, Isabella, whom all call \\"Izzy,\\" and in a twist worthy of Henry James' THE WINGS OF THE DOVE, Izzy gets cancer and trying to hold on to life, develops a mad passion for Sam Cody, the bad boy biker.  Sara watches all of this teenage intrigue with the dumb desolation of a puppy dog who doesn't really understand what's going on but who feels the bitter pain of the ignored and forgotten child.  Over and over again Alison forgets that Sara is a person too.  But eventually everything works out for Sara, in a mad chase to Miami in a purloined Cadillac, with four dogs and a parrot, as she realizes that \\"sometimes things happen.\\"<br /><br />This book is a little lacklustre but it is to be recommended for its portrait of a lonely little girl, similar to EDITH in THE LONELY DOLL, but more athletic.  I wonder if Katherine Applegate had an older sister who ignored her, she certainly nails the emotions of the passed over and neglected.  This isn't the best of all her books, but it is the one boys will like because of the constant depictions of Sam's motorcycle and other vehicles.	2004-12-07

The mystery set-up was well worked out and beautifully written, but a child could have guessed it all things put together.  Matt Duncan and R. Joseph Harrigan are standing there playing croquet on the lawn outside the study of Joseph's brother Wolfe, an arrogant, yet charismatic investigator whose specialty is exposing fraudulent religious cults.  Matt sees pretty clearly through the glass that what seems to be a man in a yellow robe is standing over Wolfe's desk.  When Matt breaks into the study, he finds Wolfe's dead body streaming with blood and gray brain matter, but no yellow robed figure!  And a devout, pious woman, Ellen, has been sitting keeping guard at the study door and she swears that no one has come in or out.  Obviously Boucher made a study of locked room problems before he started writing this novel, and amusingly enough Matt Duncan and Lieutenant Marshall run the murder through all the principles of Dr. Fell's famous \\"Locked Room Lecture\\" from John Dickson Carr's crime novel \\"The Hollow Man,\\" but all in all, the solution does not have the snap of one of Carr's, I thought it was ludicrous, and the solution to the mystery of how the yellow-robed man could appear in two places at one time was severely laughable.  On the other hand, the homophobia of the LA police towards gay men was, I thought, pictured extremely honestly, without any of the usual liberal sheen that some detective writers would put over their heroes to make them seem sympathetic.  Here, Marshall and Duncan sneer every time Robin Cooper, the doorman to the Temple of Light, opens his effeminate mouth.  This book is interesting in several ways, and even though it isn't the best detective story you've ever read, it is a corker of a document for all the wrong reasons.	2004-12-06

FS&G are promoting this book (well, sort of, actually they are sneaking it in under the radar) as though it were the work of an underground genbius like Bill Hicks whom they are magically bringing into light, but the truth is that many poetry readers have been familiar with Knott's work for a long, long time.<br /><br />Unlike the reviewer from Publishers Weekly, I thought the best part of the book was its last section, entitled \\"Poems After,\\" each one inspired by a poet who has gone before -- most of them now deceased.  Knott has a thick, rich, whiskey-soaked voice and his various tributes and homages or \\"profiles\\" as he calls them are generally pitched in a lower key than the original.  I liked especially his poem called \\"On The Road\\" in which he takes the characters and zeitgeist of Kerouac's poetic novel and castigates them for doing too much driving and using too many fossil fuels: \\"faster faster never slow/ on the road to ecocide.\\"  It's not something I had ever thought of before.<br /><br />Knott has wonderfully thorny poems about the difficulties of growing up and growing older, and one of the best in the book is his memory poem about grade school called, \\"Mrs. Frye And The Pencil Sharpener\\" which I wish I could quote in full to you.  He is endlessly quotable, and he embodies some of the lessons of transparency that the Russian poets like Mandelstam and the South American fictionists like Borges were so good at.  When he is clumsy and awkward you often feel that he meant to be so, for some unspoken yet unchallengable reason, like John Wayne's acting.	2004-12-06

I'm surprised that his movies have been so neglected, but he did have a famous flop which killed off his studio career with THE HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT.  After that, no studio wanted to touch him.  His wounded pride found solace in thinking he was still the #1 radio star and he was soon to start a great new television career.  And in \\"concerts\\" he and his violin were always popular.  Remember his theme song, \\"Love in Bloom?\\"  Well, if you are under 60 you probably don't.<br /><br />I liked this biography, but at times it crept close to the tasteless.  Maybe back in the day the routine was funny, but in print the account of how Benny and Greg Peck traded laughs and quips over who beat their wife more often is crass.  And I didn't like Mary, she comes across in this book (which she helped to write) as egotistical and driven.  Her biggest laugh on radio came with a bit where Jack is talking on and on about something and Mary finally turns to him and says, \\"Oh, shut up!\\"  That brought the house down, she reports.  Most disgusting of all is the joke that Armand Deutsch tells about his youth, when as a child he was the intended victim of the pedophiles Leopold and Loeb.  In the locker room at the golf club, Jack asks Deutsch what it felt like to know one came so close to being raped and mutilated by two killers.  \\"Well, Jack,\\" he says, \\"after the way I putted today, I kinda wish they had gotten me!\\"	2004-12-06

I mean, like it or not, Jennifer Lopez has millions of fans, as does Christina Aguillera.  Intriguing are her portraits of Hollywood's Latin stars of days gone by, from the dashing Gilbert Roland to the gay superstar Ramon Novarro, and the answers to trivia questions like Olga San Juan.  But she has some facts wrong, and it makes me wonder if even I, a non-Latino, can pick up some mistakes she has made, who knows maybe there are even more I don't know about!  In her article on raquel Welch, first of all she deplores the fact that Jo Raquel Tejada was forced to change her name to Welch.  She says that \\"Welch was another name in her family.\\"  Every fan of Raquel's in fact knows that \\"Welch\\" is the name of Raquel's first husband, and she didn't \\"steal\\" it or anything from some other member of her own family.  Rodriguez also claims that Raquel made her screen debut in the call-girl melodrama A HOUSE IS NOT A HOME, when most historians credit her in appearing in the Elvis programmer ROUSTABOUT way before AHINAH.  But, all in all you can't go wrong with Rodriguez (except when she goes wrong), and I love her description of Anthony Quinn as having the  greatest gift of a screen actor, the ability to make audiences think they have known the character he is playing in any particular picture, that they have known him for a long time.  It's a quirky observation, but a valid one, and a valuable one to boot.	2004-11-30

From American shores we find it difficult to see why Stefan George attained the eminence we once did, but Norton does his very best to penetrate two mysteries--one is the mystery of George's decline in reputation--and the other is, what made him the extraordinary character he was, and what is it about Germans that makes them need heroes and leaders so badly?<br /><br />George was a talented poet, and apparently a homosexual, and early on he fell in love with the brilliant young poet Hugo von Hoffmanstahl, who drew back when confronted with the full force of George's love, and later became Richard Strauss' favorite librettist and the author of, for example, Der Rosenkavalier, a work that has lasted longer than any of George's own poetry.  But, in the US, George has always been shrouded by a mist of romance and also by suspicions that he was somehow a proto-Nazi.  His sympathizers say that he was resolutely anti-Fascist and anti-Nazi, but his case was not helped by his insistence on showing the swastika under the impression that its use could distinguished as separate from that of the National Socialists.  Stefan George drew a cult around himself, and around the image of his boyfriend, known as \\"Maximin,\\" who died early and young and thus became, for the George-kreis (or circle), an image of national and personal purity and unrealized potentiality.  It is a sad story and Norton gives us a Stefan George who seems almost human, if a bit over-rated.  It is hard to believe that eighty or ninety years ago people thought of him as they did Lenin.  It has been a long time since a mere poet attained that kind of status in world affairs.	2004-11-29

Hughes bestseller of a bygone era, IN A LONELY PLACE.  I think GETTING GARBO, coupled with the simpering face on the cover of this novel, will lead some readers into thinking the book is a romance which it definitely is not.  Well, maybe it is in an ultra-perverse sort of way.  Young Reva, a member of the Secret Six society of autograph hounds, has always had an unspoken affinity to up and coming screen star Roy Darnell, who has a TV series from Warner Brothers called \\"Jack Havoc.\\"<br /><br />Roy and Reva alternate chapters between them, and author Ludwig nails down both characters beautifully, as well as giving us a full scale, Edna Ferber-like picture of show biz life both in NY and Hollywood.  It's almost a Kenneth Anger \\"insider's\\" look, but one that has a gentle, sepia tone to it, even in its courscating scenes of violence, ruthless ambition, and horrible bloodshed.  Though this is not a book for the faint-hearted, adventurous readers will appreciate the trip back to the days when \\"Confidential\\" was both a threat and a treat to stars and their fans alike.	2004-11-29

Winans came to know the Los Angeles rabblerouser Charles Bukowski?  In this book you can find out the whole in and out of their relationship, in which they were sort of like the Hemingway and FitzGerald of a nascent poetic movement which Winans has called, \\"The Second Coming Revolution,\\" after his own magazine, the long-gone, and sadly missed, \\"Second Coming,\\" which might be said to have started a revolution in letting the common people speak in the language of the human tongue.  But maybe \\"revolution\\" is the wrong word.  Plenty of fine photos stud this book, some of the talented San Francisco poet Harold Norse, and other figures around the legendary 50 year old bookstore City Lights on Columbus Avenue (San Francisco), where \\"Hank,\\" as his intimates called Bukowski, made some of his most colorful public appearances.  But A.D. Winans got to know \\"Hank\\" in private too, and some of the most telling stories in the book comcern the way Winans counts it up and realizes that actually, he only met with Bukowski a handful of times, and that he got to \\"know\\" him mostly through his letters and through his many volumes of verse.<br /><br />There is also an explanation of why Winans is bitter today, for rightfully so he feels ignored, and plus he had a spiked drink some time ago and was jailed by malicious SF cops who put him in a cell with deadbeats and dangerous felons, and subjected him to a nude body search which was humiliating.  But, he survived his ordeal and has since then written over two dozen books.  Thought Bukowski is dead now, Winans lives on to dare to dream the visions of glory dreamt by the knights of the round table who wanted to find . . . \\"the HOLY GRAIL.\\"	2004-11-29

The memoir's title will remind some readers of Theodore Roethke's poem about the son \\"waltzing\\" with his father, but Keeler, a long time friend of Richard Brautigan, means it metaphorically, although the two men were so close that sometimes Keeler wondered whether Brautigan was perhaps coming on to him sexually, for some of his pranks were sexually ambiguous, to the point of joining Keeler on a bed and asking him, what should we do next?  There were some stolen kisses, that could be seen as outrageous public goofs.  And there's a photo of Brautigan pulling his slacks down and baring his ass to the camera, which Brautigan handed to Keeler, again to Keeler's puzzlement.<br /><br />But in general Brautigan was a horndog or so it sounds like from this loving, rollicking memoir, some of which I had read already and relished in Kevin Ring's remarkable UK fanzine BEAT SCENE, and so I was looking forward to reading the whole of Keeler's memoir, and now it is here, replete with the lyrics to many amusing Keeler pop songs, and some enchanting line drawings in every chapter, executed by Keeler himself.<br /><br />Brautigan fans have hitherto been able to discover a bit of him in his daughter Ianthe's memoir of a really bad Dad, and in Keith Abbott's memoir of a somewhat earlier portion of Brautigan's life.  The novelist William Hjortsberg has been writing a full-scale Brautigan biography for many years, and I look forward to that book when it is completed.  Until then, Greg Keeler has given us a warts and all picture of Richard Brautigan in decline.  The full facts of his herpes condition are here exposed in way too much detail.  And within the pages of this book he scams a university into giving him many thousands of dollars in exchange for a few appearances.  He spends 100s of dollars at a time in a Montana bar where shots of Scotch are 50 cents apiece.  He makes fun of his famous friends like Jimmy Buffett, walking around the dining room table shaking everyone's hand and greeting them warmly by saying, \\"Hi--I'm Jimmy.\\"  In some ways Brautigan seems terribly insecure, in other ways, he was a balls out maniac!

Yvonna Sandstroem doesn't do him many favors, either here nor in the poetry she's done, everything sounds really weird, almost the way the members of ABBA pronounce English, as though at a distance.<br /><br />In Funeral Music the narrator tells a kind of ABBA tale (think of \\"The Winner Takes It All\\") about the melancholia of having once been young, and now the freshness of youth, its dreams and hopes, is all swept away.  Set in prison in a dingy African cell in Senegal, the narrator remembers how once he had a wonderfully talented soprano girlfriend, Ann Marie (as well as a number of more sexual adventures with white and black men and boys) -- women are theology, he says, men are philosophy.  Their youth together was filled with promise, and now their lives have fallen apart--cue up the ABBA tune, \\"Knowing Me, Knowing You.\\"  I really enjoyed the book, but it isn't half as original as some of Lars' other titles.	2004-11-29

She's a little bit rough and tumble and also feels loved less than her other siblings.  She's vulnerable when Brendan meets her, and vulnerable when he next takes up with her sister.  When Brendan does something terrible to her little brother, Troy, her anguish knows no bounds.  You have to love her!  Especially when she starts showing some gumption and begins, slowly at first, to fight back against the face of evil.  It's always good when they start fighting back, especially when this involves putting one's clever hat on and going back to investigate the secret past of the enemy.  In Brendan's case, there is no end to the horror of his being.  But by this time Kerry is wise enough to deter the serpent . . .<br /><br />It's amusing to see some of our Top 100 reviewers accidentally revealing themselves with this book.

They discuss the part of the plot that was on the book jacket using the wrong spelling of the name!  Oh well, what do they say, \\"marry in haste, repent in leisure.\\"	2004-11-28

When you think of Sarah Lawrence and you think of \\"poetry\\" your mind stumbles on the name of Thomas Lux, for he's been there for so long that some younger students weren't even born when he started his lucrative tenure there.  He can be hilarious, as when he describes humans as being the only animal who makes quotes marks with their fingers to indicate sarcasm, \\"bewilderment and awe.\\"  The young, in particular, warm to Lux because he sees the world from their point of view, as an infinitely strange arrangement of pleasures and tribulations, never to be exhausted.<br /><br />This volume took six years to write, and it shows in the repeated thrusts and mechanical coughs of the verse style.  Contrary to previous reviewers, I did not find Lux's language always specific.  Sometimes it seemed vague, as though he were trying to describe dreamlike experiences or states of feeling for which language does not suffice.  Have you ever read the German poet Stefan George?  Sometimes, or so it seems to this reviewer, George was born again in upstate New York or wherever it was and suffered through the typical milkman's son's life until he found Sarah Lawrence the way george found his Maximin.  His writing is filled with violence, like \\"Rommel's Asparagus,\\" the punji-like sticks which ripped the underbellies out of enemy pilots.<br /><br />All in all, he should stop it with the long hair, that makes him looks like he was part of ABBA.	2004-11-28

The author goes on and on about how she has solved the decades old Lord Erroll murder in Happy Valley (Kenya), which is the case that James Fox wrote WHITE MISCHIEF about.  She claims that James Fox was absolutely wrong and had a fact wrong on every page, and that through thorough detective work she has come up with the correct answer.<br /><br />Well, Errol Trzebinski has written other books, some of them published in the US, and some of them have been international bestsellers, but I can see why American publishers are shaking their heads and murmuring, \\"No thank you, we'll pass,\\" about this manuscript.  It just doesn't add up.  When after slogging through the whole book, I finally found out who she claims committed the murder, and why, I threw up my hands in disgust.  It was the most far-fetched solution in the world, not even a child would believe it, a very gullible child.<br /><br />For Errol Trzebinski, there is no such thing as a bad person, especially if they sport a title and have good looks like Princess Margaret.  Idina, Diana, Joss, the whole lot of them are martyrs in her book.  These wretched human beings carried glamor and swank from England into their own giant corner of Kenya, and that's enough for Errol Trzebinski.  I don't want to give the spoilers away, but rest assured, no one with a title committed the murder of Lord Errol.  Instead it was someone hitherto unknown to history, some commoner from another country.<br /><br />The photos are nice and if someone proposed having a museum exhibition of the photographs she has gathered, I would be the first to say, what a smashing idea!  But if someone offered me 100 pounds and a trip to Happy Valley to read another trzebinski potboiler, I would decline with thanks. I'm adding a star because I don't want to be unnecessarily cruel to a person who is trying to be loyal to her former friends.	2004-11-28

But then she fell in love and got married, in the middle of World War II, and the next thing you know she was living among her in-laws, a mixed blessing at best.  This is her memoir of her years in what amounted to another country for her, a time when she learned a lot about a simpler life and a more arduous one as well.  For if America changed a lot between 1943 and the beginning of the \\"New Frontier,\\" it never changed as much as for people living on stock ranches like Marjorie.  She never thought she'd be killing animals, much less ones she had gotten to love as pets and friends, but the hard way of the farm got her used to it.  At bottom she remained the same endearing, enchanting woman she had started out with, and you know what?<br /><br />She came out of her experience a whole lot smarter and with more of a natuve wisdom about the way things work, not only on the farm but in the secret chambers of the human heart.  If you like Mary Gaskell's novels of 19th century farm life, you will enjoy this true account, s beautifully written, of one'woman's farm wife experience, and you will grow to love her husband, \\"Don,\\" and understand why a man like that could make a woman leave her former home and follow him even unto a farm not much removed from the famous COLD COMFORT FARM.  Highly recommended for both city and country folk.	2004-11-27

Unlike a previous reviewer, I never once thought of the word, \\"percepticide\\" when I read through this career-making book, but I agree it's an interesting idea and it would be a good prism through which to examine Alice Fulton's poetry.  Even the earliest poetry, where she was writing Plath-like, resonant dirges about her father, had to it an abundance of culture.  She is the supremely cultured poet, as Wallace Stevens was to a previous generation (he died in 1955).  What we get in CASCADE EXPERIMENT is a willingness to try to listen to the other party, which I do agree, would have been a valuable lesson to learn from Abu Ghraib.  Like the training bras she speaks of in her poem, \\"Cherry Bombs,\\" asking, \\"What did training bras train/ breasts to do?  Hadn't I been told/ when stranger offered dirty candy/ /to say no?\\" she deplores our culture in which we just don't talk to each other often, and when we do, we mistake for hostility or aggression the other party's point of view.  Without other people in our universe, and more important;y their voices, we would be nothing but trophies on the wall--brass emblems of which Fulton writes, in another important poem, \\"Brass wombs/ they bear transcendence/ without blood, pus, piss, spit, snot, or come./  Like children, they cry, I won.\\"  She sees clearly that children can often be cruel, but that it is not the same thing as adult cruelty, the children are still trying to make it into the mirror stage, feeling themselves unappreciated because they see ow way to distinguish themselves not only from their peers, but from the entire surround.  I think poets sometimes feel this way as well.  In \\"Art Thou The Thing I Wanted,\\" Fulton tries to distinguish her priorities, to take stock in middle age.  \\"Everything happens to me, I think,/ as anything reminds me of you: the real estate/ /most local, most removed.\\"<br /><br />She is both local and removed, and also real, like the \\"real estate\\" through which the bourgeoise attempts to maintain its grip on society and ontology.<br /><br />In some ways she is even better than Ammons, who never cared a fig for questions like these.Everything happens to me, I think,/ as anything reminds me of you: the real estate/ /most local, most removed.\\" <br /> <br />She is both local and removed, and also real, like the \\"real estate\\" through which the bourgeoise attempts to maintain its grip on society and ontology. <br /> <br />In some ways she is even better than Ammons, who never cared a fig for questions like these.	2004-11-27

The Knight and Peabody books were, of course, groundbreaking collections but their definitions of who was Beat and who wasn't were so different that a reader could wind up arguing that Simone De Beauvoir was the quintessential Beat woman author.  In an illuminating intrroductory essay, the editors aregue that some of this confusion has been caused by the fact that there are actually three generations of Beat women writers.  The first generation (chronologically) are those born around the time of William Burroughs, and who thus anticipate the Beate writing sof the 1940s and 1950s or who were  writing contemporaneously to the first work of the three men most definitely tied into the Beats--Burroughs, Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg.  Women of the first generation thus include Jane Bowles and Helen Adam.  A second generation grew up, the same age as the younger Beats (such as Ginsberg, Lew Welch, McClure, Corso).  These women include Lenore Kandel (b. 1932), the late Elise Cowen (1933-1962) and Joanne Kyger (b. 1934).  Finally there are two women Beat writers of a following generation--the age of Bon Dylan.  These are Anne Waldman and Janine Pommy Vega.  This last generation seems oddly underpopulated, as though Waldman and Pommy Vega were playing some kind of version of \\"I Am Legend.\\"<br /><br />Kristin Prevallet, Tim Hunt, Barrett Watten, Tony Trigilio and Linda Russo have written first class essays for this book.  It has a very high proportion of interesting work in it.  Wouldn't you know it, the San Francisco Public Library does not own a copy of this book.

I found it an enlightening and well-written book that delivers a non-partisan message, but it is written by someone who truly admires Shelby Foote.  What's wrong with that?  Foote is a wonderful historian, even though as many have said his volumes on the Civil War tell the story almost entirely as one of big battles and great men.<br /><br />Chapman does not let his reverence for Foote's writings get in the way of telling a good story.  And what a story!  He came from the long-ago vanished South of the aristocrats, and along with his boyhood friend Walker Percy, who later became a celebrated novelist, the two of them tracked the changes in Southern society in their novels and other writings.  Foote had his faults too, as Chapman notes ruefully: he exaggerated the depth of his friendship with the man he idolized, Nobel winner William Faulkner, who lived but a hundred miles away; he was a womanizer who just couldn't keep it in his pants; his relationship with his daughter Margaret, who became attached to the Seattle rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix, was troubled to the point that he denied they were related; and his position on race relations wasn't a very activist one.  Even his relationship with Percy was strained by the two men's seesawing careers and who was up. who was down, at any given moment.  The Ken Burns thing happened at exactly the right time for Shelby Foote, and from now on, people would no longer be confusing him with Horton Foote--no relation.<br /><br />Chapman's \\"LIFE\\" makes me curious to see the publication of \\"TWO GATES TO THE CITY,\\" the novel on which Shelby Foote again and again dashed his hopes, an unconquerable manuscript that was worth its weight in tears.  Maybe someday we will see some version of it.  Until then, we have all his other books to read and re-read at leisure.	2004-11-27

His previous book on the life of Ian Fleming raised the bar for James Bond studies and I am not surprised to see that his life of Thomas (who like Fleming cut his own brand of swaskbuckling throughout the English speaking universe) is also something of a triumph.  It is the first biography of Thomas to set out properly his confusing travels to California (where I live)--his sojourns to San Francisco and LA (where he met Chaplin, Shelley Winters, Isherwood, etc) finally make some chronological and emotional sense.<br /><br />Lycett is also good, as he was with Fleming, at showing particular moments in each man's career where popular enthusiasm brought their work to a new level of acceptance.  For Fleming, of course, the filming of the Bond stories brought him an attention he had craved for years but then decided he didn't want.  For Thomas, it seems to have been the publication in 1946 of DEATHS AND ENTRANCES that shook him up and created in a fiery fogre of fame and alcohol, a new Dylan Thomas, one cockily confident and supremely able to go about life with only a smile and a vast adoring public to sustain him.  And, in each case, Lycett also sketches \\"the wife\\" tidily, so that we see how Ann Fleming and Caitlin Thomas pulled the strings--or failed to.<br /><br />Hooray for Andrew Lycett, can't wait to see who you turn your sights on next.	2004-11-27

Pecan Springs is a small town, filled with small town folk and lots of good eating.  In the ten cases assembled here, China solves the problem of who wtole the cookbook of out the Guild, and what happened to the cat, cutely named KHAT.  When she does, she discovers a new member of the community, Ivy O'Toole, who is sort of a heavyset woman but one who knows a lot about herbs.<br /><br />There isn't that much in the book about Mike McQuaid, China's new handsome hubby, but readers who like Mike will appreciate the glimpses we get into his private life.  There is a more \\"adult\\" case about a man who feels he has been \\"stalked\\" and whose answering machine turns into a valuable clew in the mystery of the poisoned brownies.  It is sort of like FATAL ATTRACTION, with a Pecan Springs twist.  In addition, there are lots of little sidebars about herbs and how herbs can make your life better.  As China suggests, planting a fragrance garden near your porch is a nice way to let their fragrance comfort you in times of loss or inspire you to help out a neighbor or two.  She suggests planting carmint, chamomile, clove pink, lavender, lemon balm and nine more, winding up with violets (alphabetical order, but i think they'd look pretty that way).  When spring comes there I'll be on my knees outside my porch, learning to live again.  These tales, some of which were originally available on the internet, are here expanded and made a lot better by SWA's indefatigable storytelling flair.	2004-11-27

Although the two writers had been living together for many years, Valentine had found herself dangerously attracted to a woman called here only by an initial, \\"X,\\" an American woman who was nominally straight but who liked the way Valentine succumbed to her.  Big hearted Sylvia then offered to let V and \\"X\\" live in \\"Frome Vauchurch,\\" (don't you love these names?)-- the house she herself had restored as a lovers getaway.<br /><br />What Valentine had secretly been hiding was an addiction to alcohol that made Spencer Tracy look like a teetotaller.  This book is sort of like a really good AA tell-all, compounded by snatches of writerly conversation and fraught behavior.  Sylvia was a better writer than Valentine, but Valentine certainly knows how to steal center stage.  If you like the Lesbian novels of Mary Renault I can almost guarantee you'll like this one.  It has some wonderful scenes in it, as Valentine tries and tries to be perfectly honest with her soon-to-be-ex girlfriend--(actually she relented and stayed with Sylvia for years and years)--a painful act of stripping away illusion and getting to the root of things, like dentistry of the emotions.	2004-11-27

And then as it happens you open up your daily newspaper and find out that the author has died, died even perhaps as you were reading and admiring her prose style?  I first read \\"Swimming in Mojave\\" two years ago in the magazine ORION, and I laughed out loud thinking of the author trying to beat the desert heat by swimming across the sands, like a John Cheever character, in every swimming pool at every motel and resort her family could find.  Recently I found this book, THE ANTHROPOLOGY OF TURQUOISE, and settled in for the pleasure of a whole collection of essays, and some well-researched bits of historical fact and fancy about the mineral turquoise, another hobby of mine.<br /><br />The book took me over two weeks to finish, as I kept putting it down to admire the author's flights of fancy and beautiful language.  There wasn't much of a story, but as I read it now, and think about the different essays from The \\"Deeds and Sufferings of Light\\" to the final chapters of \\"Brides of Place\\" and \\"Passing through Green to Reach It,\\" I see so clearly how her words speak to the drive in every one who lives out West to stay alive and to see the possibility and grandeur in all of the things God or the Devil created.

No, not the famous Sherlock Holmes story--oddly no one notices that the poor starlet has taken her screen name from Conan Doyle--in this story Gloria Scott is a shrewish, ambitious, obsessed young woman who resembles Eve in ALL ABOUT EVE, only she comes to an end worse than that endured by Eve and eventually Fen and others realize that, bad as she was, she didn't deserve the rough treatment dealt to her by this one family prominent in UK films--a screenwriter, a leading lady, a director, all brothers and sisters, all of them poisonous, and each one then dealt a blow of revenge by someone who, or so it seems, seeks to avenge himself for the way the unfortunate Gloria Scott ended up--throwing herself from a bridge in full view of dozens of people, including apparently the murderer.  The film studio seemed like it was based on Gainsborough Pictures, and the kind of movie they were making could have starred Dirk Bogarde, James Mason, Margaret Lockwood, Phyllis Calvert, Patricia Roc, and that these were the stars who made walkthroughs into the plot of FREQUENT HEARSES (changed a bit due to libel laws).<br /><br />It is a very grim story, and the little bits of humor that surround it don't fit in especially well with the downbeat storyline.  I felt that Crispin was trying very hard to make a satire on the way that film biographies frequently depart quite far from the realities of the life of the person they're supposedly attempting to capture, and then there was this other sort of Zola story of Gloria Scott, and the two elements of the story never really matched up for me.  But that's my personal view and others may admire Crispin's indisputable urbanity and cleverness.	2004-11-15

An inquiry	As others have noted, Hilary Spurling really hits you over the head with the unsavory reputation of her subject, Sonia Brownell, \\"The Girl from the Fiction Department.\\"  While seemingly a friend's generous attempt at salvaging what she could, it seems to me that she might have downpedaled how awful most readers think Sonia is.  At least then she wouldn't come off as sounding so defensive.<br /><br />When all is said and done, it sounds as though Sonia did a heroic job protecting the estate of George Orwell, but it might well have done just fine without her.  She never quite lived down her status as the woman who married Orwell in extremis, and she never will, not as far as I can see.  My hat is off to Hilary Spurling insofar as her loyalty to pal Sonia, but I think she went about it the right way, and after a while, you get tired of hearing about Sonia's beauty and distress and boyfriend after boyfriend, for a short book it has many longueurs.  There are tidbits about the famous (Marguerite Duras, Lucien Freud, etc) and these perk up a sad story.  But the reader longs for the unadulterated vemon of something like David Plante's memoir of the difficult women in his life.  If you want to read a good book by Spurling, about another of her neurotic friends, read IVY instead.	2004-11-15

She told us that she never thought of getting this book published, and described how differently she thought of it as a project than her previous four books, and indeed how she, a former ballerina, thought of herself now as a writer first and a woman second.  Then came the man she calls \\"A-Man\\" and the rest is erotic history.  The moderator asked her if she thought Anais Nin an important influence on her style, and Bentley replied that Nin was one of many who had helped her attain the honesty she sought in writing up her own erotic adventures.  She acknowledged that Judith Regan was taking a big chance on a book which, only a few years ago, might never have been published.  Some have suggested (she reported) that the success of the French book \\"Sexual Life of Catherine M' might have been a factor in Regan agreeing to publish her book, and also that the HBO show \\"Sex in the City\\" played a part in expanding the boundaries of what women might say and feel in our modern era.  The audience hung on her every word.<br /><br />We were astounded to hear her speak, and her humor and the slight huskiness in her voice made her seem very approachable and a delighful conversationalist.  Once I had started reading the book, I could not stop, even though to a certain degree it was a bit repetitive.  But there is something Apollonian about Toni Bentley's writing, almost as though the spirit of her former mentor George Balanchine lingered at her elbow, guiding her through the Scylla and Charybidis of porn and erotica.  I am looking forward to her next project, something very different she said, a personal memoir of knowing Lincoln Kirstein the balletomane and entrepreneur.	2004-11-11

Before reading it I had never so much as heard of Palm Springs, and now I feel like I live there.  He tells you which famous people live in which house all the way down all the roads in Palm Springs, so that if you want to, you could write to them and ask them for their autographs.  In a way they're vulnerable now, having their addresses published in this book but i suppose when you move to a town like Palm Springs, with its reputation for scandal and overt sexuality, you don't really care about things like that.  While some residents oof the town, past and present, were religious people, often a lot of them are not religious by any means, and there are any number of free-thinkers living there.  It's a beautiful city with a stunning climate, and the real estate can be pretty pricey.  People who love hearing the stories of other people's bargains will enjoy Johns' account of how Charles Farrell and Ralph Bellamy bought the whole Racquet Club and dozens of surrounding acres for the equivalent of a few beaded necklaces.<br /><br />Some will object to Johns' continual prurience, and I was a bit taken aback when he referred to Marilyn Monroe going down on Johnny Hyde, but then again, if you pick up a book called PALM SPRINGS CONFIDENTIAL, you're just as implicated as he is, so get over it already.  There isn't much of a narrative line either, just a visit to all the different houses and him telling you what old time stars and present day porn stars live in each one, but the dirt you'll hear will make the hair stand up on the back of your neck.  It is like having someone with a wonderfully dirty mind stand behind you and whisper sexy suggestions into your ear.	2004-11-11

Okpewho's heavily accented Oxfordian English was elegant and precise, like the man himself.  I expect he must be in his sixties today, and his new book has a sort of weary feeling to it.  It has a surprising story which begins sort of like The Exorcist--an American man starts speaking in long lines of what seems like gibberish to his family and friends, a language he cannot account for himself, an experience like the famous \\"speaking in tongues\\" of evangelistic Christianity.  Instead, linguists identify this language as the tribal dialect of Central Africa!  One further note, the book takes place in the glory days of the Civil Rights Movement (the 1960s) and occasionally Dr. Okpewho seems to have forgotten how to bring this era alive, so that his protagonist's sttruggle has the dusty effect of an episode of AMERICAN DREAMS.  But all in all, the author of The Victims (1970), The Last Duty (1976), and Tides (1993) has created a wonderland of a new novel.<br /><br />The plot is intricate and extraordinary, bridging the gap between the USA and Africa as very few novelists are prepared to do, and very few readers ever get to understand.  At the heart of the book is the simple cry of a man who is lost here and finds himself there, only to find his way once again back here in America, a country that sometimes seems as benighted as the Middle Ages, while flashing all kinds of high tech gimmickry.  This novel is old fashioned in some ways, but it's a mind trip!	2004-11-11

Now at long last, we get the \\"Ariel\\" we deserve.  Plath's admirers have been waiting a long time, since at least the early 1980s when Ted Hughes first revealed that he had changed the order of the poems in his wife's final manuscript.  He had added some poems--the final, freezingly depressing ones--and then re-arranaged the bulk of the book to leave an impression of a woman gone over the brink into a chilling fugue state.  Now Frieda Hughes, Plath's daughter, 2 when her mother killed herself, has performed a ritual act of atonement to her mother's memory, and given us the original, \\"happy\\" (relatively speaking) ARIEL which we have never been able to see.<br /><br />At $24,95, the book's a little expensive, but it feels as though money had been spent on its planning and execution, so you don't feel rooked.  In one section, the gray paper on which the facsimile materials are printed is easy on the eyes, aiding the eye as it struggles with Plath's numerous emendations.  We get the notes Plath wrote for her own use when she had to do that reading at the BBC towards the end, the more-British-than-thou reading we have grown to love and hate at the same time.  Frieda Hughes contributes an interesting and contextualizing introduction in which she seeks to reconcile the differing viewpoints of her mother and father--a challenging task, but she's up to it.  The book ends up with four of the bee-keeping poems--and another in the appendix, \\"The Swarm,\\" which Sylvia kept changing her mind about including.  Should she leave it in?  Take it out?  The title is in brackets.  Thus the book ends with a hopeful note, with the freshness of Devon instead of the bleak London winter.  It ends, pleasantly enough, with the words, \\"They taste the spring.\\"	2004-11-09

Sometimes it takes a great actress to make us realize the incredible difficulty of making it from day to day, but the journey from dawn to dusk is often the hardest journey of them all.  Still we've all got a chance if Tatum found hers.  Not once but three times she found the bottom of the barrel and each time she scraped up the courage to start again.  Movie fans loved her in PAPER MOON and LITTLE DARLINGS, and I thought she was great in the remake of NATIONAL VELVET, ultimately triumphing at the Olympics against all odds.  When you watch INTERNATIONAL VELVET today it's a little bit eerie with the heroine's strange relationship to her dead parents, and Nanette Newman's heartbreaking attempts to understand where Tatum is coming from.  The two grow closer over their devotion of horses of course, and finally Tatum gets to win the prize that Velvet almost won.  Unfortunately in PAPER LIFE Tatum glosses over the making of this film, as well as her work with Julian Schnabel and Jules Dassin, which I would have liked to hear more about.  Two other of my favorite actresses don't come out looking too good in this book--Farrah Fawcett and Melanie Griffith, but perhaps they are even now preparing their own memoirs in which they will blame their bad behavior to Tatum on the endless cycle of abuse each might well have grown up with as apparently do all Hollywood personalities of note.  I find it hard to judge either Farrah or Melanie without knowing more about their past lives and their mental and moral crises.<br /><br />Surely Melanie used to hold the title of \\"Little Girl Lost\\" before Tatum and Drew took it away from her.  But this is a book all readers should go out and buy, read it for yourself, and see if you could possibly surmount the awful difficulties that Tatum has.  Just growing up with Ryan O'Neal must have been dreadful--though again, one awaits his memoir with some interest because as we now know, it's all part of a dreadful family heritage that makes the Eugene O'Neill family look like the Bush dynasty.must have been dreadful--though again, one awaits his memoir with some interest because as we now know, it's all part of a dreadful family heritage that makes the Eugene O'Neill family look like the Bush dynasty.	2004-11-04

Farrell	Books	4	9	10	N	N	Landers to the Rescue	Farrell is a remarkably underrated author, and here come Robert K. Landers of the Wilson Quarterly to the rescue.  He doesn't think much of many of Farrell's novels, or so it seems, but he thinks that the best of the bunch are among the masterworks of American literature.  Unfortunately, his critical skills aren't flexed enough in these pages, and so I wound up severely unimpressed with Farrell as a writer, though as a personality, bon vivant, speed addict, lover and Communist he had few if any peers.  Landers is especialy strong at telling Farrell's story through the eyes of the three prominent women in his life.  Perhaps the most intriguing of these strong women was Farrell's first wife, Betty, with whom he went to Paris as a very young man and figures in this life as sort of the enduring blazon that \\"Hadley\\" was for Hemingway.  Sifting through the information gingerly, for I take it that she was still alive when he was writing this book, and still very insightful even though quote old, Farrell paints her as a liar or anyhow an exaggerator who piquantly enough crossed the color line before such things were done, and paid the price when her affair was publicized in Jet magazine or Ebony.  Farrell's second wife, the talented actress Hortense Alden, is also a fascinating woman.  What I thought was odd is the way that at one point, when she is introduced, Farrell says that she worked with the Lesbian actress Nazimova and \\"may have been\\" sexually involved with her.  At a later date, after she married Farrell, Landers says they went to visit Nazimova, \\"Hortense's former lover,\\" with no conditional mentioned this time.  Copy editing?  Or is it a sign of something more slipshod?  The third woman, Cleo, gets nothing but praise, even though he wrote nothing interesting when he was with her, but Landers credits Farrell with prolonging his life and making him happy when he was with her and, according to them both, she didn't even realize he had become addicted to dexedrine.  I wish there had been more in the book about Celo's editorship at AMERICAN GIRL magazine, one of the most influential and in retrospect interesting house organs of the period.  He's good about Trotskyism, and explaining who was in and who was out at the PARTISAN REVIEW, but he elides over AMERICAN GIRL as though it were nothing.  I suspect that, thorough as he is, he didn't read many issues of AG, too bad.<br /><br />All in all, AN HONEST WRITER is a fascinating read that you won't be able to put down until the whole sad story is done.

The Welcome Table: A Lifetime of Memories with Recipes	Books	4	52	57	N	N	A Poet In The Kitchen	Here in San Francisco folk with educated palates still talk and reminisce about Maya Angelou's stint cooking at the Creole Cafe, back during the heigh of the Creole movement westward bound.  A wandering people had reached the blue Pacific but hungry Louisianans still yearned for a little bit of home.  Of course Angelou was not from Louisiana herself, as we all know she is from Arkansas which is why Bill Clinton asked her to read \\"On The Pulse of Morning\\" for his first inauguration, but her family's recipes saw her through some difficult times.  And when times got tough for her, San Francisco diners reaped the benefits.  Now, sixty years later, she finally reveals the secrets that made her own brand of Creole food so good.  (Our local columnist the late Herb Caen wrote about Angelou first as a cook, later as an exotic dancer and singer, finally of course as a famous poet.)  The truth is, she did a little bit of everything and you can taste it in her cooking.<br /><br />I tried the home-made potato salad, and found that, for me, speaking personally, there was maybe too much parsley and not enough pickles, relish, or celery, but it had a delicious flavor nevertheless and I'm not surprised she has called it her favorite picnic food.  Brian Lanker's photographs of the food she made herself decorate nearly every chapter, and he is of course the famous LIFE magazine photographer who made the award winning documentary about artists who work for the US government (and independently) in combat.  Here his photographs are nore relaxed, though still gritty and reliable.  He is a firm photographer, with definite slants to his insight, and so he is a good match up for Maya Angelou, who now must be nearly 80 and with a lifetime of achievement to look back on.  Even the famous food writer MFK Fisher gave Maya Angelou a great compliment, saying she is one of the ten best cooks she ever met.  (Both women were Bay Area residents during the 50s and 60s, and were quite fond of each other, odd as it seems.)  There is one recipe here for every year of Maya Angelou's life, and I hope that the success of this volume calls forth for a sequel, one in which the recipes are arranged seasonally, and perhaps a few fewer tales of compliments that guests gave her, because it does sound a little vain, as though she were patting herself on the back in the pages of her own book.as it seems.)

No more Mae West, Lubitsch, Jeannette MacDonald.  But she helped raise morale considerably with her beautiful face and huge deep eyes, and that crazy sarong she \\"wore\\" to placate the boys.  Often enough she was co-starred with Paramount's two leading stars, king crooner Bing Crosby and British-born lovable twit Bob Hope, so that gave her a huge break as she readily admits in this lovely autobiography.  Her evocations of Hollywood gone by make this a book to remember, and it is surprisingly heartfelt.  I liked her account of the many different women in her life named Dorothy, and how the death of one of them, the Ziegfield beauty Dorothy Dell, really affected her in a dramatic way.  And her story of acting in the neglected A MEDAL FOR BENNY written by none other than John Steinbeck makes you wish this picture was more often seen today, instead of existing in that gray-list waste land.  She is often very funny, and she provides a humorous list of the names of the \\"native\\" Polynesian or other characters she was assigned to play--Luma, Uma, Tamara, Moana, and many more--that's a work of art as well as a rueful commentary on the typecasting practices of the studio system.  Lamour also claims to be the first star to go out selling War Bonds in WWII, selling $30 million dollars worth in 4 days.  She was intensely patriotic too.  I liked her picture of \\"Pappy,\\" John Ford, who starred in THE HURRICANE and years later in DONOVAN's REEF.  She made him seem less threatening than did Maureen O'Hara in her recent memoir--not to say that one actress is correct and the other wrong, because Ford was a complex man with many sides to his personality.  The pictures are wonderful as well.  If you get a chance, you might try to boy a copy of this book and read it right through.  You won't forget it.rough.  You won't forget it.	2004-11-01

I suppose the idea is to suggest that the poet brings us messages from another world as does the medium.  Amy Gerstler has written a number of fine books but this is perhaps the best she's ever given us, partly for the reason that she seems so invested in exploration of this concept.  Not only does the concept allow free rein to her trademark humor and irony, but she allows something genuinely chilling to creep into her work and thus, I disagree with the Publishers Weekly review printed above, I don't think that Gerstler has a Billy Collins problem at all, although I can see why the reviewer battened on this aspect of her cultural production.  Not every poem, after all, is as successful as the best of them, but here she keeps her readers happily engorged in a very high average, and the poems are not just simple one trick ponies, she has earned our esteem with some quite long and complicated sorties towards what might be called her version of the \\"serial poem.\\"<br /><br />\\"Listen, Listen, Listen\\" is an extended meditation on the nature of sound, its manufacture and reception.  Gerstler has always been a poet of exquisite verbal interplay, and now she parts some of the obfuscation to examine close-up the way her effects are born.  In the same vein, \\"On Wanting to See Ghosts\\" reflects not only a cynicism and resistance to the mystic, but a tender vulnerability and a deep appreciation of human nature and our need to reach out and find more on the other side of death.  Ectoplasm is comical, let's face it.  \\"What's that stuff erupting from her mouth now?  Wadded up wedding veil?  Celestial drool?  One of heaven's tiny geysers?\\"  Many of Gerstler's poems have a dramatic edge to them, as though Browning were leaning in on that planchette too, whispering in her ear.  She is half a novelist and the book is filled with stories told as vignettes, end-rhymes, enjambments.  GHOST GIRL reflects the way metaphors of poetry and of femininity are deeply embedded into popular discourses of spiritualism.<br /><br />And the implications are staggering.  I love the way Gerstler hints that the practice of poetry is now being delimited by \\"professionalism\\" among poets what with the rise of MFA programs and the increasing competition among poets for a handful of positions \\"teaching poetry\\" in the AWP: \\"Only mediums who have been investigated and found conscientious and reliable,\\" she writes wisely, \\"may advertise in these pages.\\"<br /><br />There will be few books in this decade with the eclat or the brilliance of GHOST GIRL.

Resin whoever he may be has a cunning way of seeing events from a Chiahuahua's point of view.  I enjoyed the different chapters about filming THE SIMPLE LIFE and the discovery that Paris had made a sex tape, and how her handlers were going to spin that for maximum publicity density.  Resin understands as few others do that people like Paris not because she's socially aware, but because she treats life like a game and she always seems like a good sport.<br /><br />Tinkerbell complains about the Pomeranians who live with her in the LA house.  She explains how you have to be extra patient with Pomeranians because they're so dumb.  And she deplores the way people associate Chihuahuas with Pomeranians.  \\"Unfortunately, because they're small, yappy, and ubiquitous, they're the ones most people picture when they hear the term 'toy dog.'  Real fond of barking at nothing and getting freaked out by their own tails.  Not exactly Lassie,  In fact, if they had done that show with a Pomeranian dog, it would have been much simpler: Timmy would fall down the well, lassie would furiously lick itself for forty minutes, and then Lassie would turn arpud and psychotically challenge a small rock to a fight, which it would ulimately become intimidated by.\\"  Needless to say, Paris isn't likely to use the word \\"ubiquitous\\" in a sentence any time soon, nor has she probably heard of Lassie.  She's great, and as Tinkerbell points out, she has a \\"slack, blank, almost Zed sort of ease that's like wallpaper to read\\" but is sublimely easy to get along with.  I hope that instead of being ashamed to be seen reading this book, as most people doubtless would be, more people pick it up and give it a good read.  Virginia Woolf wrote FLUSH on much the same grounds, she wanted to paint a picture of a famous person (in her case Elizabeth Barrett Browning) from the point of view of her kidnapped dog.  If it worked for Woolf, why can't it work for Resin?  I say it does!esin?  I say it does!	2004-10-25

It would be enough if we had a slower story with the hero trying to deal with the onset of Parkinson's.  It would be enough to read a novel in which the middle-aged hero has to come to terms with his surgeon father's apparent indifference, if not hostility, to his own practice as a psychoanalyst.  It would have been an interesting story to hear of such a man's affair with a former prostitute.  And then on top of all of this we are given an nastily complicated serial killer story, a tale so convoluted the word \\"Byzantine\\" may be properly used to describe it.  And an inspector (Ruiz) who treats our hero (O'Loughlin) with the same fierce intensity of Inspector Javert in Les Miserables.<br /><br />Julianne, the beautiful and accomplished wife of the psychiatrist hero, was at one time the object of his best friend's affections, so that Joe and Jock are in a love triangle battling for Julianne's affections.<br /><br />By the time one hundred pages are done, you start wondering what incredible pit of complication you've gotten into ankle deep.  Before you know it, you're up to your ass in confusion, but due to Robotham's infinitely painstaking plotting, and the narrator's wry humor, you wind up liking the state you're in.  I can't see this book being the first in a long-running series with O'Loughlin, but I am very happy to hear that Michael Robotham is writing another book.  This one already will win him legions of fans, both here in the USA and abroad.	2004-10-25

In any case, though he isn't quite as good as Levin, Abrahams is very close to being so, and that's a tall order I wouldn't have believed any other American suspense novelist to be capable of.  In Abrahams' case, his plots are a little less organic than Levin's, not quite so high concept, but he is twisty as all get out and his characters are amazingly real.  You really get caught up in their dilemmas even if some of them are just plain bad apples.<br /><br />Francie is having an affair with Ned because, well, just because.  Roger, her husband, is so weird and cold that in a way you don't blame her, and yet on the other hand, as she comes to realize, she is hurting an innocent woman by sleeping with her husband.  She gets hung up on this infidelity thing, as her natural decency kicks in once she befriends Anne at the local tennis club.  I don't even like tennis but Abrahams is great at evoking the kick of it, the primal tensions it releases, how the game can hook you in and take you to a place you've never been taken before.<br /><br />I didn't really buy the part about Whitey Truax and why Roger thought he could possibly control him, but to be fair Abrahams builds Roger up as kind of a Nietzchean superman who's dumb as a post, so I guess it fits.  Whitey makes you squirm he's so vicious and horny, but there's also a lot of class resentment between Whitey and Roger that's perfectly done, worthy of a Henry Roth or a Zora Neale Hurston.  Abrahams is a literary artist, and each of his books presents another technical problem he solves with the assurance and inventiveness of Flaubert.  Here, in A PERFECT CRIME, he approaches the heights of THE TUTOR, not only his own TUTOR, but that of Henry James.	2004-10-25

Laura Shapiro's new book SOMETHING FROM THE OVEN argues convincingly that this generalization has been absurdly overstated and that none of it is true in the least.<br /><br />Her previous book PERFECTION SALAD was good-the rise of \\"white foods\\" at the turn of the century, the moment when cook books started specifying amounts in their recipes as \\"science,\\" or an absurd version of it, became desirable in the kitchen.<br /><br />But SOMETHING improves on PERFECTION, as it were.  Shapiro plunges right in with the invention and promulgation of frozen foods, showing how American housewives took to them slowly and with the utmost discrimination, rejecting the ones that didn't taste good.  She shows how serious chefs like James Beard and Dione Lucas started out scorning convenience foods but they, too eventually came to approve of some of them, using the same intuitive responses as the mass of US housewives.  She then opens up the story by writing a gimlet eyed account of the original Pillsbury Bake-Off, showing how marketing and drive made the Bake-Off a double-edges sword, by promoting Pillsbury's convenience food but also showcasing the creativity and ingenuity of US home cooks.<br /><br />Shapiro also reminds us that the 1950s was the age in which Alice B. Toklas published her famous cookbook.  A sequel was prepared with the collaboration of the food writer Poppy Cannon, although it didn't do too well.  Poppy Cannon, one of the enigmatic personalities of the food world, is given the big biographical treatment.  Married to Walter White, the light-skinned head of the NAACP, Poppy Cannon led her own kind of double life for many years, and Shapiro really digs in and devours every nuance.  Shapiro is also good at discussing the family comedy writers of the 1950s, who balanced home-making with feminism, including often ignored writers like Jean Kerr, Ernestine Gilbreth Carey, Peg Bracken, and the one and only Shirley Jackson.  By viewing these women as integral to the story of food and food writing in the 1950s, Shapiro does us all a huge service.

It's a salmagundi of commissioned pieces and articles that originally appeared in a variety of slick and gay magazines.  Taken them all together, and you get a lot of insight into White's own irresistible personality, even more so than in some of his celebrated autobiographical novels and memoirs.  Plus, it's like being at the same party with some of the most intriguing personalities in the world today, as well as some dead immortals.  White's style when he profiles these luminaries is never fawning--well maybe once or twice, but he does it so well you forgive him anything.  He's fearless, and asks the people in question exactly the kind of questions you think you'd ask yourself, if you were there on the scene and you had balls of brass.  Cleis Press is to be commended for bringing out this jumbo volume.  I only wish there were more.<br /><br />There's just enough of a selection of White's writing about art to make you wish he'd jump in and write a whole book about the art and artists he admires.  It's hard to find anything new to say about (for example) Jasper Johns or Robert Mapplethorpe, but after reading White's articles on both you will be viewing their work with new eyes.  And he provides wonderful introductions to artists whose profiles may not be quite as high as these guys--Rebecca Horn, perhaps, or Steve Wolfe.<br /><br />One after another of these articles are stunners--there's a fine piece on the half-forgotten French New Novelist Alain Robbe-Grillet, which takes you back to the day in which he was regarded as a wunderkind of depthless talent, and then shows today why he is still a writer worth studying.<br /><br />White is not always Mr. Goody Two Shoes either.  In one case, the Ned Rorem profile, you watch in helpless delight as Rorem gets skewered on the high kebab spears of White's erudition and wit.  I also thought that printing a brief review of James Baldwin's \\"Just Above My Head\\" and labeling it \\"James Baldwin\\" leads the reader to think JB will be getting the full-blown profile treatment and instead it rebounds and just  akes the review seem skimpy.  And in some cases the reader will disagree, perhaps violently, with White's assessment of this or that subject, and you will still feel he has won the right to deliver it.  I don't believe for an instant that James Merrill is the equivalent of Cavalcanti crossed with Noel Coward, but it's amusing to hear someone say so.<br /><br />By and large these essays are compelling, entertaining, and wise.

Physically it is a luxury object.<br /><br />And it certainly tells us a lot about Hemingway, particularly a facet of his life that I had never cared to peer too deeply into, thinking that his mania for hunting game revealed a side to his character even more contemptible than the others.  But oddly enough reading this book had the opposite effect, and one winds up with a queer sympathy for Hemingway, and his adventures in the wild both during his early (30s) trip with Pauline Pfeiffer his second wife, which resulted in the stories, \\"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\\" and \\"The Snows of Kiliminjaro\\"--and then much later (20 years later), he and Miss Mary embarked on an ill-fated sequel to this safari that caused them both much grief and physical pain and he wound up writing the God awful TRUE AT FIRST LIGHT and during which he clearly went a little insane.  All of this Christopher Ondaatje followed, the exact same footsteps, and his journey into the heart of Africa seems to have caused him no cavils at all.<br /><br />I expect you'll like this book.  It reveals a lot of truth and a lot of delicacy of perception.	2004-10-17

His letters to his friend Bob reveal, step by step, how he entered an uppermiddle class world of black society in Washington during the days of the 1920s, during Prohibition, and how he found acceptance in the household of a beautiful widow and her two exquisite daughters--one of them, Genevieve, ladylike and stunning, the other, Caroline, a true product of the Jazz Age, flirtatious, fun, and slightly scandalous.  Davy's growing interest in Caroline is concealed even from himself, he seems like he's the last person in DC who can figure it out.  Is it because she is so much younger than he is?<br /><br />The editor, Adam McKible Ph.D., hints that this state of affairs parallels Williams' own interests in much younger women, coeds in the great universities in which he served as a librarian, and he quotes from Zora Neale Hurston's memoirs of him flirting like crazy back and forth with young girls.  McKible seems a little too taken with his own discovery of this novel, which is no masterpiece by any means, but let him pat himself on the back if he feels like he deserves it, he certainly has given us all some amusing moments and some poignant ones too.  I'd like to see a movie version of this book, perhaps with Beyonce as the flirty Caroline and with Angela Bassett as the older and more dignified sister, Genevieve, and to play Captain Davy, who else but Samuel Jackson?	2004-10-17

When Joann was a teen, for example, her aunt told her a story of World War II hijinks on top of the Great Pyramid.  There had been a competition, Joann was told, in which her uncle and his army buds had participated.  Each would mount the Great Pyramid and attempt to hit a gold ball off the Pyramid and clear its sides.  None of them could do it, even the most vaunted of sportsmen.  In this way Dr, Fletcher really helps us to visualize the vast scale of the Pyramids.  She's no Ivy Compton Burnett when it comes to dialogue, but you do get the picture of a young woman who's deeply in love with archaelogy and with the romance of discovery.<br /><br />If the mummy in question turns out to be the legendary Nefertiti, then we will all have greater access to one of the most romantic figures of all time, one who had a great influence on 20th Century fashions.  Think of Liz Taylor in Cleopatra!<br /><br />I am no expert on ancient Egypt but after reading this wonderful book I feel I have a better grip on the issues that surround archaeology at the present time, and you can't take that away from every book.  This one is a lavish and thoughtfully produced history of two women reaching out to each other from across a distance of centuries and cultures.	2004-10-14

Lew Archer cuts through the landscape like a hot-rodder with the devil driving, and his sad journeys from one California town to another tie the book together as if it were some kind of Canterbury pilgrimage.  Everywhere he looks for the truth, and he balances out with what is right.  And everywhere he goes, Ross Macdonald finds beautiful ways to tell us what he sees and how he feels.  He was a student of W H Auden's, and it shows up in some of the language and the metaphors.  Here, for example, is the beginning of the convoluted \\"Wildgoose Chase.\\"<br /><br />\\"The plane turned in towards the shoreline and began to lose altitude.  Mountains detached themselves from the blue distance.  Then there was a city between the sea and the mountains, a little city made of sugar cubes.  The cubes increased in size.  Cars crawled like colored beetles between the buildings, and matchstick figures hustled jerkily along the white morning pavements.  A few minutes later I was one of them.\\"<br /><br />It's not only the imaginative power of trying to describe a topos steadily increasing in size, but the purity and exactitude of the analogies, \\"white morning pavements,\\" \\"colored beetles,\\" etc.  Macdonald's a poet and if, at the other end of his practice, he becomes sort of a Johnny One Note--always mourning his daughter--we forgive him anything because of the way he says and does it.<br /><br />PS, In \\"The Name Is Archer\\" there's an awful lot of crypto-gay men, aren't there?  Painters, hairdressers, shadowy nightclub gunsels, always teasing Archer with hints of depravity and annoying him with their general uselessness.  Had Macdonald some kind of gay problem I wonder?  It's hard to miss, especially in the first half of this book.  Maybe all of these men are just background to make bachelor Lew Archer appear more manly by contrast.	2004-10-13

Moore's introduction to the volume hits just the right notes and she is perhaps the ideal candidate to tell us why we should bother ourselves in the work of one of America's natural-born plutocracy who literally never had to work a day in her life.  Despite all her advantages, Lowell was from the first interested in the ongoing \\"revolution of the word\\" that Pound, Flint, Hulme and others were promulgating, first overseas and then, bringing it all back home, here in the USA.  And Lowell was ready every step of the way, not only with her money but with her amazing talent.  Lowell's best writing is scintillating, sharp as anything Pound did in the way of Imagism, and yet she had something Pound lacked, perhaps a heart and certainly an openness to writing about sex experience that Ol Ez shied away from.  Ezra Pound could never, for example, have written the poem Honor Moore includes here by Amy Lowell from 1919, called \\"Balls.\\"  At times Lowell and Pound seem to be occupying the same cultural space, as when Lowell proffers her own version of the Ballad of the Fisherman's Wife, and when set head to head, Lowell seems to be, well, not quite as smart as Pound, but in her own way she is just as splendid and her life was terribly cut short when she was still (as these things go) sort of young, and it's interesting to speculate on what would have happened to an American poetry in the 1930s that had Amy Lowell working in it!<br /><br />The book is very handsomely done and I can't think of anyone who won't walk away from it with a new respect for Amy Lowell, and a renewed puzzlement over the byways of publicity and mania that make Robert Lowell (say) so well known and his cousin Amy (say) kind of a relic from out of the closet.he closet.	2004-10-10

For this some people are up in arms, and in a way i don't blame them, for the story of Lincoln and Amelia is like a very fine fine, and it gets you hooked, and plus their interwoven plot just keeps getting more and more interesting as Mr. Deaver learns more about their characters.  But anyhow he brings all his skills as a writer (and shows off some new ones) in this wonderfully inventive novel of 1936 Germany, GARDEN OF BEASTS.  As another reviewer wrote, you will think that you are there.  As a sidelight, if you eever get a chance to see CHARLIE CHAN AT THE OLYMPICS, you will find some location footage shot at the actual Olympics by 20th Century Fox personnel, and it wouldn't surprise me to learn that Mr. Deaver had ordered a private showing of the Chan opus, for his details are spot on and so vivid.  Of course he probably also saw Leni Riefenstahl's controversial Olympiad, in whicb despite herself Jesse Owens emerges as a powerful charismatic runner.  But Deaver's characterizations are, as always, intense, though here everything is turned on its head.  If you have ever read Victor Hugo's LES MISERABLES you have read the prototype for this kind of novel, a determined, some say obsessed policeman, vs. a \\"criminal\\" who in some respects is better than the society he offends.  And then there is a delicious love interest in this book for the prizefighter turned hit man Paul Schumann.  \\"Too many men,\\" she says, \\"don't want that.  They WANT to fight.  They WANT to destroy because it gives them pleasure.\\"  Dense silence between them for a long moment.  Then, her voice softening, she said, \\"Ach, Paul, please forgive me.  Here you are, being my companion, doing the town with me.  Which I haven't done for so many months.  And I repay you by being like a shrew.  Are American women shrews like me?\\"<br /><br />Paul is tender in responding to Kathe, tough but tender like an old time movie hero, someone like Bogart.<br /><br />Hooray for Mr. Deaver, long may you write the novels you want to!re American women shrews like me?\\" <br /> <br />Paul is tender in responding to Kathe, tough but tender like an old time movie hero, someone like Bogart. <br /> <br />Hooray for Mr. Deaver, long may you write the novels you want to!	2004-10-10

It used to be that people scoffed at John Wayne's acting, but in recent years the circle has come around and i think we all know he wasn't a bad actor but an incandescent performer with infinite gobs of star quality radiating all around him like shooting stars.  And yet the biographies of him lack his moral depth and complexity.  Invariably they are written by people like Michael Munn, an okay journalist but a man with too many irons in the fire (18 previous books, including lives of Gene Hackman and Sharon Stone) to afford himself the luxury of time--the precious time it would take to write a first-class biography of this great, iconic presence.  Munn has interviewed a lot of people, all of whom sound pretty much the same in his chatty transcriptions, and he has gotten close to many who were close to the Duke, and the book is readable enough, but it doesn't come close to conveying what happens to an audience when they sit through a John Wayne picture, the intense identification and mythologizing of his screen character as it moves from frame to frame, decade to decade.  Munn also in British and gives Wayne through the British  tabloid lens, when as we know Wayne was American as apple pie.<br /><br />And he brings a lot of rumors to the book, particularly those which emphasize Wayne's right-wing political views and his proud conservatism.  All very well and good but to make Wayne a hero on the basis that Joseph Stalin put out a fatwa on him is just ridiculous.  If Stalin had wanted Wayne assassinated (for what reason?) wouldn't it have been taken care of during Stalin's lifetime?<br /><br />Munn also fails to gloss over Wayne's miserable personal life.  In fact the way he lingers on it makes you think he enjoys seeing the Duke brought to his knees by the women around him and by his troubled, semi-nutty mentor John \\"Pappy\\" Ford.	2004-10-10

To be fair, you can't call Siegfried Sassoon forgotten, since Jean Moorcroft Wilson has spent twelve years or more researching every known fact of his life.  And because he lived into the era of VietNam and the \\"summer of love,\\" an astonishing number of people who are still alive remember him.  She has done a wonderful job combing through his papers and coming up with real, solid evidence about the facts of his life, the emotional, sexual and aesthetic complexities of the man.<br /><br />And yet at the same time, one thinks that she is making slightly a mountain out of a molehill when it comes to her failed attempt to build him up as a writer of permanent interest.  Sassoon interested the generation of Georgians who followed the dictates of taste that Edward Marsh laid down, yet at the very moment of his ascension, a counter-revolution in taste, fomented by the American poets Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot, and their Irish colleague W. B. Yeats, were spreading modernism all over the critical map.  And even though modernism has lost its iron grip over the popular imagination, the tide has not turned back to the days when a versifier like Sassoon is once again on top of the heap.  He was talented, he was tormented, he went to bed with the handsomest men in the world, but his writing isn't all that.  Too bad.  Still, the book is a fine one and will give you a wonderful sense of period detail--of several periods--in British history since World War I.	2004-10-10
494986:US	46134316	R39G2MVN4LUK53	0312293216	569681168	Hollywood's Stephen King	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Red Blooded Criticism	Magistrale is one of those academics who has made a whole career writing about the work of a living author.  It must make the author awfully uneasy thinking of all those people whose living literally depends on the products of one's brain.  King must respect him, however, because he gives him his time and an awfully frank interview which opens up the book on a happy note.  King has been treated both well and badly by Hollywood, and he must know that some of this bad treatment is his own fault.  Though some fans think otherwise, people who like movies know that when King is in charge of adapting his own work (or even worse, writing originals for the screen) the results are almost always dire.  Can't figure it out, how a man whose writing is so perfectly \\"cinematic,\\" whatever that means, can have so literal and unimaginative a film sense.  Oh well, at least we have the novels on the one hand and Rob Reiner, Brain De Palma, Stanley Kubrick and Frank Darabont (among others) to re-imagine King's work and make it come alive on the big screen.  Save us from the Mick Garrises of the world!<br /><br />Magistrale manages to make sense of some of the complexities of the film universe, and he can explain in high toned English why a film like CARRIE might be good and THE MANGLER unredeemably mediocre.  I like the way he arranged the films into different categories, so there is a body of proto-feminist films, like DOLORES CLAIBORNE, and then a body of \\"high-tech gone awry\\" films like CHRISTINE and the beyond belief bad MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE.  Magistrale is a highly intelligent man and his writing is not pretentious at all.  He is the type of writer you'd like to know as a friend.	2004-10-10

Christie shrewdly paints a portrait of two cousins of very different sorts, Susan Banks, the charming, shrewd, business type, and Rosamund Shane, the sultry, ditzy actress, and we watch the two of them square off regarding their men and in battle for a green malachite table from their Uncle Richard's estate.  Both girls are convinced that the table should rightfully belong to them.<br /><br />I enjoyed hearing Hercule Poirot compare the events of AFTER THE FUNERAL to those of LORD EDGWARE DIES, a long ago case of Poirot's from the 30s.  That clue should have given readers with long memories good reason to suspect that the solution of this case had something to do with a dazzling impersonation.<br /><br />The strange behavior of Gregory Banks, the nutty pharmacist husband of Susan, the man who brags about how he was stricken people down with his prescriptions, make you think almost immediately that he is the killer.<br /><br />Everyone's a wee bit suspicious but with Greg, Agatha Christie really lays it on thick.<br /><br />The best scenes are those with Susan, who could have been the heroine of a Christie play (in 1953, when this novel was written, Christie was square in the center of her theatrical triumphs).  Both the scenes at Cora's house when Miss Gilchrist receieves the mysterious slice of wedding cake, and then later on at Enderby Hall when Susan and Rosamund fight over the malachite table, could have jumped right out from one of the best 50s plays.<br /><br />Weren't you surprised to hear that in 1953, if you had two thousand pounds, you could buy a Vermeer?  Now the figure must be infinitesimally larger.  Perhaps 20,000,000 pounds?<br /><br />No longer do we have to read this novel under its ersatz American title, which always reminded me of a title by A A Fair--\\"Funerals Are Fatal.\\"<br /><br />All in all, a nail biting thrill ride of terror and chicanery.	2004-10-07

The case of Alma Rattenbury, the most poignant of all classic murder cases, and one which was treated with great depth and honesty in Terrence Rattigan's late play CAUSE CELEBRE, is here just another boring story of adultery and murder, not even worthy of a Lifetime Channel for Women miniseries.  F. Tennyson Jesse is better at telling the story of Madeline Smith, and the man who drowned all his brides and inspired the Chaplin film MONSIEUR VERDOUX gets an elegant summing up by Eric Watson, a writer new to me.<br /><br />Crime is a funny thing and I suppose they asked John Mortimer to edit (or \\"select\\") this volume because of his reputation for writing the famous Rumpole books and his expertise at the law.  He is one of the world's most overrated writers so he doesn't really add anything to the book, just gets his name printed in huge letters much bigger than those of the real editors.  One of the ironies of today's push for big marketing is that the people who really do the work are often ignored.	2004-10-06

To be fair, what it lacks in surprise, it definitely scores on plausibility.  You don't feel he's pulling a solution out of his ass as in many other modern-day re-tellings of classic British crimes.  He even tells us that, in the early 60s, when many of the survivors of the case were still alive, he tracked Grace Duff down and accused her of the poisonings, and she spat back at him that she was mad and that he'd better be careful or he'd wind up dead himself.<br /><br />It reminds me of the books by Boze Hadleigh like \\"HOLLYWOOD LESBIANS\\" in which many years after Barbara Stanwyck's death, Boze will casually reveal that oh, yes, he did interview Barbara about her lesbianism and oh yes, she was fine about it.  Now that all of the characters have passed on, you would think the truth would reveal itself one way or another.  Presumably some of the next generation might be alive and might object to the portrayal of Grace as a demented nymphomaniac and of Edmund, the first victim, as a stupid spendthrift who, when he became sexually excited, couldn't help but bruise his wife's shoulders.  To me THE RIDDLE OF BIRDHURST RISE does not tell us the last word about the case.  I still feel there are some mysteries outstanding.  Nor do I feel that Grace could possibly have been as bad as Whittington-Egan paints her.	2004-10-04

It belongs to the non- or semi-road movie tradition of AMERICAN GRAFFITI, TAXI DRIVER, and SPEED.\\"  These are movies, he tells us, in which the characters drive all the time, but \\"within city limits.\\"  To qualify as a real road movie you have to go somewhere.  The genre began in earnest in the late 1960s, sort of as a cinematic aftershoot of the epochal road novels of the 1950s, including Kerouac's ON THE ROAD which itself oddly has never been filmed.  However, you can find precursors to the road movie in the American cinema of the 1950s, 40s, 30s, and even earlier, because it seems as soon as people started hitting Route 66, filmmakers had the idea to restage the old quest legends, or pilgrimage stories, in a Model T or a Thunderbird.<br /><br />Laderman points out it is not strictly an American genre and there are plenty of road movies from other continents--look at Mel Gibson in THE ROAD WARRIOR for example, or even something like WEEKEND by Jean-Luc Godard, in which most of the characters get stuck in a mammoth traffic jam--quel ennui!  Laderman links the road movie to a variety of sources such as the picaresque novel of Defoe or Cervantes, the novel of social realism (think of THE GRAPES OF WRATH and how it moves slowly across a vast, devastated and dusty America), or the visions of Europeans coming to America and seeing it as one big highway--Nabokov with LOLITA, Antonioni with the bizarre and underrated ZABRISKIE POINT.  In between he treats everything from EASY RIDER to DETOUR, BADLANDS to SUGARLAND EXPRESS.  Gay and indie cinema are not neglected either so expect plenty on MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO and STRANGER THAN PARADISE.  I wouldn't drive and read this book at the same time, but outside of that, ready, set, go!	2004-09-26

I liked her first book A HABITABLE WORLD, but missed a personality behind it--it was too careful a book for a melodramatic West Coast reader like myself.  OVERBOARD makes up for that, with a series of Poe-inspired sequences of terror and distress, the mental kind mostly, and a way of expressing herself that puts me in mind of the cold cruelties of Isak Dinesen on the one hand, and on the other, of the warm generosity of someone like Anna Magnani in her films by Rossellini.  Check it out!  One of the poems, \\"A Locked Room,\\" has an epigraph by John Dickson Carr, the anglophile US thriller novelist who specialized in impossible crime novels and whose work haunted some of the best poems of the  wonderful, now deceased, contemporary poet Gerald Burns, who loved Carr with a low, pure passion.  Anderson has a quieter approach than either Carr or Burns, but she makes up for it by a solid underpinning of romantic, even passionate, syntactical and diagetical reference and recusal.<br /><br />A long poem, \\"Hazard,\\" anchors the collection in the kind of higher-than-thou mastery we associate with the late style of John Ashbery, it is the kind of poem you can't believe anyone would dare attempt in today's modern world of short attention span, and let me tell you, as a poet one has to have enormous confidence to embark on such a lengthy voyage, and yet she goes from strength to strength in the way of Hart Crane and his poem, THE BRIDGE.  It's nautical too (just like the Goldie Hawn/Kurt Russell sex comedy from which Anderson draws her title): \\"Proof is like a cord tied to the dock by/ someone who cannot matchs knots with/ their names.\\"  Ahoy, yo, there is a great shining liner on the horizon and it is the SS Beth Anderson.	2004-09-26

Like many modern novels the characters are more cartoon-y than anything in real life and few readers will actually believe the \\"reveal\\" about what Jared Chiziver does for a living, for it was invented solely to make a movie out of it.  I say that \\"few readers will care\\" because Adam Berlin, despite himself, is a poet of New York, like a modern day Lorca, and can make you read about and care about people far distant from oneself.  \\"The World Trade center had once broken the view, holding solid, looking like two steel pillars thrust into Manhattan to keep it from floating away, but they were gone.  The horizon became both more open and less open and my father continued to meet women.\\"<br /><br />He is a wonderful writer.  The scene where the boy, Ben, meets another teen boy and has sex with him on the street is extremely powerful and one of the sexiest scenes of its kind ever written.  But like the old days, their moment of ardor is punished by a terribly brutal beating and from this point on, the book becomes a sort of male version of the old rape revenge plot of 70s horror movies.  Reading what happens to poor Ben, and then reading what Jared does to Ben's attacker, leaves the reader feeling sick in an almost physical way.  No male reader can read those scenes without feeling that he's been punched in the balls.

It has hundreds upon hundreds of pictures, cinema stills, candid photos, Rank Studio glossy glamor shots, and even a few that are totally unclassifiable.  It was written before Bogarde came out (even if really ever did come out) and this Margaret Hinxman and her collaborator, Susan D'Arcy, allude to his romance with the tempestuous Capucine, almost as if they really believed there was anything between these two but studio fakery.  The two met, of course, on the set of George Cukor's SONG WITHOUT END, a film famous as Nazimova's SALOME or Otto Preminger's LAURA among gay and lesbian filmgoers, for each movie is packed to the gills with closeted gay actors and actresses.  And of the three, SONG WITHOUT END isn't the worst, because both Capucine and Dirk Bogarde are really trying.<br /><br />Margaret Hinxman later found a measure of fame as a crime novelist, whose books are too cute for my tastes, but she was really good writing up her passion for Dirk.  And the captions and the synopses of his many films make you long to see more.  Oddly enough, as the prestige of the movies increased among the art crowd, his acting became more stylized, to the point that today I think I'd rather see one of his famous, lowbrow DOCTOR movies than to sit through another turn under Fassbinder or Resnais.  It was as if he thought he had to prove something to the world, I wonder why?  There's a wonderful photo of him embracing Kay Kendall that shows, at heart, how warm he was and how little like the icy Visconti frump he became.  Dirk, we hardly knew ye, but there will never be another like you.	2004-09-25

Now fully grown, and blessed with a deep serenity of spirit that is not given to those pampered in youth, he has remembered it all, and told it all, with the assistance of an amanuensis, a man who seems remarkably skilled at giving us Mitch's innermost thoughts and expressions of his pain.<br /><br />I don't know anyone who was at Treblinka but now, through the miracle of one man's honest recollections, I feel that one of my friends was indeed there and it brings it all home to me, both the horror of human evil, and the shining benignity of those who have suffered and died, as sentence by sentence Mitch Garwolinski's honesty shines through the misery, like diamonds hidden by and engendered by manure.  I would recommend SILENT SCREAMS OF A SURVIVOR to anyone interested in human behavior, as well as in Holocaust issues.  Now, in our current atmosphere of world crisis, the lessons the book teaches are just as timely, if not more so, than the half-century of time that divides us from the Nazi period.  There was a time when it seemed that evil had triumphed.  And even though Hitler was defeated, has all trace of his depredations been removed?  Far from it!	2004-09-22

Or if any more have been discovered since the publication of this book, which might have been almost twenty years ago.  Surely in all that time a few might have been discovered in a crate, trunk, or archive.  I would love to have  whole book of them published, as we Ellery Queen fans haven't had anything substantial to chow down on since the publication of the TRAGEDY OF ERRORS outline a few years back.  THE SOUND OF DETECTION is such a great book, makes you hungry to hear some of the scripts being acted out by the great character actors of the radio.  It's literally haunting.  I love the way the actress who played Nikki Porter got married to the producer of the show, Zachary, and then found her parts getting bigger and bigger--a la Irving Thalberg and Norma Shearer.  And the cannibalization of Dannay and Lee, always feeding back on the prior products of their mind, is almost painful to read about.	2004-09-21

However, Branwell was able to blackmail his way out of the morass until he was stopped from further blackmail by being poisoned by the sexually attractive, Byronic anti-hero, Arthur Bell Nicholls.<br /><br />Well, some people may think so, but I don't.<br /><br />It is curious that the world lost Branwell, Emily and Anne within a matter of months.  A terrible fact of literary history.  And yes, Tully does well when he points out how their symptoms were all terrifically suspicious.  But I personally do not think eirher Charlotte nor Arthur had anything to do with their deaths.  Charlotte loved Emily (and Anne too, if not so much) the same way Anne loved Branwell, and I think if anything, it might have been Martha Brown who committed the murders--<br /><br />IF there were any murders; and<br /><br />IF there was really a Martha Brown.<br /><br />Also, I do think that the parents of one of the boys whom Branwell seduced might have tried to get revenge on him by murdering him.  But then again, I doubt he was murdered.  He just seems to have had a weak constitution and as we know, it was not healthful in the UK to live on the Moors in the 19th century, anything could carry you off!	2004-09-21

I tried to read the book from cover to cover, but along the last eighth or so of the book I realized, it was more trouble than it was worth.  A shame, because Larner has a great story to tell and initially at least, he tells it well.  I had never realized the extent to which Gutzon Borglum patronized the Ku Klux Klan and the way he conceptualized the carving of Mount Rushmore as a defiant cry of fraternity for the white brotherhood, who had conquered the Indian tribes to claim all of the land in North America for themselves.<br /><br />I will never look at our beloved landmark in the same way again, not even when I watch Hitchcock's thriller NORTH BY NORTHWEST in which the iconography of Rushmore is also played with in an ironic way.<br /><br />However the writing of the book is all over the place, and Larner can't make up his mind whether he is writing a psychobiography (on the Erik Erikson model) of Borglum, or an expose of Parks Services politics, or an insiders account of the American Indian Movement.  Certainly one could combine these accounts successfully, but Larner fails to do so.<br /><br />I did not know that the Lakota tribe actually said, \\"Hau\\" to greet a stranger, giving rise to the Hollywood Zane Grey \\"How\\" to stereotype an Indian's stoic passivity.  In this way, and in many others, the book is worth reading, but be warned, you will be skipping like a schoolgirl through the endless saga of pages.	2004-09-21

Rel plays Dr. Seuss the ultimate compliment of treating him as a serious poet as well as one of the 20th century's most interesting visual artists, and after reading his book I decided that a trip to the Mandeville Collections of the library at University of California in San Diego was in order, so I could visit some of the incredible Seuss/Geisel holdings they have there.<br /><br />There's almost too much to take in, for, like William Butler Yeats, Seuss led a career that constantly shifted and metamoprhized itself to meet new historical and political cirsumstances, so he seems to have been both a leftist and a conservative at different junctures of his career, both in politics and in art.  As Nel shows us, he was once a cartoonist for the fabled PM magazine and, like Andy Warhol, he served his time slaving in the ad business too.  All was in the service of amusing and broadening the minds of US children.  Nel doesn't hesitate to administer a sound spanking to the Seuss industry that, since his death, has seen fit to license all kinds of awful products including the recent CAT IN THE HAT film with Mike Myers.  Oh, what a cat-astrophe!<br /><br />The book is great and I can especially recommend the work of the picture editor who has given us a bounty of good illustrations.	2004-09-21

I don't believe the Zapruder film, even as Wrone shows us where it was from the moment it was created, was edited by other hands, however, there is a possibility that the people at TIME LIFE did so.  Certainly the frames damaged during processing have made a lot of people suspicious over the years.<br /><br />Wrong writes carefully and skillfully, but he seems to go slightly ballistic when one or another of his King Charles' Heads are mentioned.  Jim Garrison for example--or the film Oliver Stone made of Garrison's book.  You can feel the steam heat arising off the pages of THE ZAPRUDER FILM when either of these subjects is mentioned.  It's a little comical.<br /><br />I also question why, if he's so convinced that Oswald is completely innocent, then why oh why doesn't he tell us who he thinks is guilty?  Maybe he doesn't want to offend either the left or right wing of this country?  Or maybe the killer is still a powerful force in our nation today (or his children are) and he, Wrone, is afraid of him?  Many skeptics and believers have used the disparaging nickname, \\"Wrong,\\" instead of \\"Wrone,\\" to sum up what they feel about his thinking and his conclusions.	2004-09-21

We never manage to lose the thread of either man's life, but both Grant and Twain are given plenty of room on their own, like two kites that keep criss-crossing in a Currier-and-Ives print.<br /><br />I don't believe that Twain influenced the writing of Grant's PERSONAL MEMOIRS.  If you've read Jean Edward Smith's life of Grant you can see him working towards becoming a great writer from the time he was very young, deep in his subconscious where he found most of his convictions and truths.  Julia Dent, too, made an impression on his aesthetic mind that, I think, comes out in the telling of his life story on such a grand scale.  Grant was an unusual writer, particularly for an American president.  We think of Jefferson and Lincoln as being particularly good writers, but neither of them gave us anything like Grant's MEMOIRS, with its peculiar combination of novelistic insight and sweep, with a kind of Hawthornean sense of all of US history in every page.  Anyhow you can't imagine any modern president, from either party, being able to write a book that's good.<br /><br />Perry's book also tries to show us that Twain, stuck for the ending of HUCKLEBERRY FINN, used the example of Grant's life and career to give him his EUREKA moment.  It's possible, especially when you think of the way he absolutely idolized the former president, but I'm not convinced.	2004-09-21

Its tiny beginning, practically a mimeo magazine, blossomed into the most important journal of African-American writing ever published, and 25 years later it is still going strong, although perhaps it's not quite as exciting as it once was.  The anthology, unfortunately, doesn't give you a good picture of what the magazine is like, by eliminating all traces of its critical edge, its portfolio of visual artists, and any sampling of the drama, which right now is its strong point, all serve to remove some of the \\"ingredients\\" to the \\"Callaloo\\"  which makes it such a tasty stew.<br /><br />Nevertheless in the poetry and fiction departments, which are all that are represented in this anthology, Rowell has selected some classic tales and poems, including Ralph Ellison and Alice Walker.  We don't get much of a sense of progression, however, because Rowell has unaccountably ordered his contributors by alphabetical order rather than chronology, so we have no sense of Harryette Mullen growing out of Sonia Sanchez or whoever, indeed it's pretty much the reverse.  That caveat aside, the book is exemplary in every way.	2004-09-21

Berling's own \\"God Bless America,\\" which became one of the great hits of the wartime era, was actually written at a time slightly preceding the entrance of the US into World War II.  Kathleen Smith, the author of this study, whose name oddly enough suggests that of Kate Smith, the moon-faced and wildly popular radio star who made \\"God Bless America\\" a monster sensation, suggests that the reason for this is that, enraptured by swing music, the teenagers who controlled the chart did not want to buy martial tunes.  They wanted love songs and they wanted music they could dance to.  In this way the era seems oddly close to our own.  The book's accompanying promotion materials suggest that a similar situation has transpired today, after 9/11 American musicians wanted to create a hit that would show the Al-Qaeda that we were unbowed, but despite the best efforts of everyone from Paul McCartney to Bruce Springsteen and back around again, from all shadings of the right and left, the song that is most mentioned as a result of the terrorist destruction of the World Trade Center was that country number by Toby Keith about the red, white and blue, with the pugnacious lyric, \\"You'll be sorry that you messed with the U.S. of A./ 'Cause we'll put a boot in your ass/ It's the American way.\\"  Some of the WWII would be hit songs expressed similar sentiments against the \\"Nips\\" and \\"Krauts\\" of Axis fame.<br /><br />Smith is an okay writer but her book is somewhat padded, and Kentucky should hire a proofreader, it is trying indeed that Melvyn Douglas and Ralph Bunche both have their names misspelled.	2004-09-12

Nicholson in particular seems like a true mensch, though he's ready to move on if you're in a jam.  Streisand also gives as good as she gets.<br /><br />The problem with the book is that it is horridly written and gives us no idea of what crimes Tod Volpe committed to find himself in a jail and dead broke.  You'd think he'd be able to give detailed descriptions of what frauds he committed, but he is not able to, I suppose if he confessed everything his life wouldn't be worth a penny, and also many collectors would discover that the objects that are the jewels of their collections are faked or faked up, and this would ruin the art market for everyone.  The only thing of interest is Volpe's account of the way in which he and a few other enthusiasts (not yet crooks) built up a new market foor the previously underrated American Renaissance furniture like Gustav Stickley.  Otherwise he is too discreet, he won't even name the Hollywood actress to whom he was engaged, perhaps not wanting to embarrass her any further.  In one anecdote he tries to escape customs duties by bringing in a number of Cartier watches by concealing them between the cheeks of his ass.  All you can think of is, how many watches is that?	2004-09-12

That's how convincingly he draws you into the story.<br /><br />Most writers have no idea how to integrate the working lives of their characters into the give and take of a thriller.  Here I was totally taken in by Barry Schulman's working world in the high concept life of a biotech company, by Lynn's photography and the way a reader could actually visualize many of her best pictures, by Mike's life as a small town detective with a big city style crime to solve.<br /><br />There was a lot of class stuff too, which again most American novelists can't handle.  And most of all, the suspense which got to be so overpowering I didn't want to do anything but finish the book.  The 9/11 material was handled with distinction; I liked Barry falling all over the commuter who, because he wasn't seen on the train for some time, was believed to have perished at the World Trade Center.	2004-09-09

He has the finer feelings of the writers of the Enlightenment, plus wedded to them he has passion, like a modern-day Federico Garcia Lorca. His stories always tell of something new, or something that hasn't yet been born. And yet when I heard he was writing a novel I wasn't sure what to expect, because we all know of fine short story writers whose novels are duds, somehow the writers overextend themselves and their talents turn out to be spectacularly ill-suited to longer forms. Oh, you know, something like BULLET PARK by John Cheever. But as you have guessed by now Tom House's novel is the exception to the rule, and it is one of the great things to happen to writing at the beginning of a new century.<br /><br />Other reviewers have told you the plot, a little boy in the godforsaken town of East Islip (Suffolk County), attending an awful parochial school who decides to write himself the starring role in a passion play. Same impulse as Mel Gibson must have had. But in little Danny's case, he lacks Mel Gibson's social skills and he definitely came up short on looks. He, his mother, and his teacher Liz, play out an unholy game of misunderstanding and pride that turns into a debacle for all concerned. It's like watching an accident in slow motion. From page one you know something terrible will occur, and you just don't know how or when. Boys who have grown up to survive great shame will identify with Danny Burke and his propensity for being his own worst enemy. You want to shake him on every page, to reach into the pages of the story and tell him, no, no, no. But at the same time you know he's on his own irrevocable collision course and that his failure is predetermined. And yet, through some mastery of tone and technique, the story is hilariously funny even when it's at its most painful.<br /><br />Danny develops an imaginary friend from out of the pages of his family's illustrated Bible, a young olive-skinned, naked boy who delights in playing mischievous sex games with him. Little by little Arram takes over a large chunk of Danny's personality, convincing him to go nude too, outside his parents' suburban house and through the lawns and gardens, again like Cheever in The Swimmer, but with even more delicious possibilities of detection and apprehension.<br /><br />Your face will be hurting from laughing so much by the time you're on chapter three. From there on in you won't be able to contain yourself, nor will you be able to give up reading. The book isn't very long, but it's written in sharp, excruciatingly observed paragraphs that amount to a rough Long Island poetry. House has set the whole story back to the days of the early 70s, for what reason I'm not sure, perhaps to accentuate that mythic feel of something that happened so long ago it has attained the status of a gospel all its own. If you liked A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES, you will be sure to enjoy this look at a very different sort of misfit.

As the title suggests, one exotic locale is pretty much the same as any other for Brad Leithauser, as long as you get mail from it.  The messages that come through tell little stories, almost as though they weren't big enough to be used as the raw material for his novels.  Four pythons sit in pretzel-like knots on the floor, daring the viewer to make sense of whose body belongs to who.  Leithauser's verse line is sinuous, like one of those pythons, and looks beautiful glittering in the night, its dumb eyes staring forward without a thought in its head.  In Iceland he goes for a brisk walk and encounters a \\"grim-/ eyed, wide-shouldered, skewbald ram\\" with whom he locks glances.  It's a book of many encounters, and in most of them Brad wins out, largely because he is so good at writing he makes the other party seem ridiculous or learns a lesson from the encounter which he tries to parlay, like Aesop, into a poem.  In the case of the Icelandic ram, we learn that \\"no place is out-of-the-way to the creature/ grounding its livelihood there.\\"  It's a sentiment worthy of the ecological poets like Gary Snyder, but he'd be more oblique about it.  They say that Leithauser was one of the favorite poets of the late James Merrill.  By the way, he's great to look at too.	2004-09-08

Garry Essendine, the hero of PRESENT LAUGHTER, is almost transparently Coward's idea of himself as the complete theater man whose life depends, in a odd twist of dependency itself, on the loyalty and cooperation of a vast staff of employees, most of whom know better than he what he is like and what he needs to go on.  These include Monica Reed, his beautiful, devoted secretary who sees right through him llike Bette Davis seeing through Sheridan Whiteside in THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER.  Then there is Liz, Garry's wife who left him but never managed to divorce him, which allows him to play loose with all the young ladies who have fallen for their aging matinee idol.<br /><br />In Coward's case, the reason he needed a bulwark to fend off young female admirers is because he was gay, and in PRESENT LAUGHTER, the characterization of the young pretentious playwright Ronald Maule, who becomes a slave to garry Essendine through a bit of ill-advised personal contact, is surprisingly frank for its day (wartime UK).  The whole play is filled with Coward's trademark dialogue, as Garry is constantly false and hilariously hysterical, while all the other characters continually deflate him with their loving barbs.  If it is not Coward's best play, then I don't know what is.	2004-09-06

Naysayers accuse the committee of bending over backwards to achieve a non-partisan approach (that runs to NOT indicting Clinton's Democratic administration for security breaches, and NOT condemning George W. Bush's Republican administration a la Michael Moore's FAHRENHEIT 911) so that as a reader, my final impression is that of a grave, sorrowful voice somewhat like Abraham Lincoln's.<br /><br />We are still in a time of national mourning and understandably, feelings still run high.  All the more reason for the commission to take a measured approach.  As the nation's eyes turn to the space at Ground Zero where the felled towers tumbled, and to the rebulding of the Pentagon, and thinks of a way to commemorate the passengers of Flight 93 who hurtled to death at the hands of the terrorists of 9/11, perhaps something of this somber reliquary will remain in our thoughts and prayers.	2004-09-06

I didn't think that there would be enough interest in a sequel but i'm glad to hear I was wrong.  Maybe the author, J Minter, will explain the attraction between David and Jonathan, whose names are taken from the story of the Bible's most famous and homoerotic friendship.  Or we might hear more about Flan Flood and her zany family of oddly named, but beautiful strangers.  I think that J Minter should tone down the way Jonathan has a shoe fetish.  It is something that sits well on Carrie from SEX IN THE CITY, but when it happens to a guy, it just sounds like he's a nitwit.  However, it may be that Minter is tapping into a deep;y felt nerve and that a lot of guys and girls want to find out about a boy who has so much money he gets another pair of shoes every Friday as a sort of ritual.<br /><br />Maybe in the sequel the British painter who made hearts a-flutter in book One will return from England with a new exhibition of paintings, and himself.  He is kind of like Damien Hirst, but cuter and younger.  Maybe the sequel will be even more of a rip off of Catcher in the Rye crossed with Gossip Girl crossed with Less than Zero, that would be hard to do but if anyone could do it, it might be J Minter, who speaks to young people like a style guru.	2004-09-05

William Stoner, a farmer's son in the Midwest, travels by foot and buggy to the University where his entire career will take place.  The little things add up, an understanding mentor, a pair of young friends (one of them dies in World War I), a sadistic and seemingly homosexual rival, Lomax who, oddly enough, reminds Stoner in some ways of his dead friend David Masters.  Stoner's tragedy is marrying Edith, the spoiled daughter of a wealthy man who loses his fortune in the crash of 1929.  Here's where Williams, who died in 1994, loses me.  Edith is beyond a doubt the most horrid caricature of a woman, wife and mother ever created by any American novelist.  Did Williams, and the male novelists who continue to recommend STONER as an example of realism's quiet virtues, ever realize what precisely they are vouching for?<br /><br />It is not enough that Edith is so foul she makes Martha in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf seem like Mary Pickford.  No, it is that she is awful in so many different ways.  She's frigid; then again she's sexually passionate.  She's over- devoted to her daughter; then again we find out she really hates her.  She won't let Stoner have a moment's peace in his entire life.  I do not regard Stoner as an ordinary man with an ordinary career.  He is an illusion of patience created by a novelist with severe problems towards women.<br /><br />All in all, it is a page-turning expose of the bottom feeding of academic life, coupled with a misogyny that could have come out of the worst of modern rap lyrics.	2004-09-05

I feel the book is a greta evocation of Swinging London of the 1960s and that it should have been filmed back then, maybe with the following cast, Rita Tushingham as poor Norma Restarick; Tom Courtenay as Dr. Stillingfleet, her psychiatrist who falls in love with her; Vanessa Redgrave could have played Frances Cary; Terence Stamp could have been David Baker, the \\"Peacock.\\"<br /><br />I wonder if Christie ws thinking back to her own early vocal training when she gave NORMA and LOUISE their names, because of course they were famous French operas at the time Christie was studying in Paris.  \\"Louise\\" was written by Charpentier, and that becomes her last name, a coincidence no one remarks about in the novel itself.<br /><br />It is a book in which Christie seems to be reviewing her own astonishing career.  Mrs. Oliver suggests that she might write a book in which a child commits a murder: \\"Not meaning to, but just by her father telling her to give her mother a drink made of pounded up box hedge,\\" thus neatly conflating the plots of two much earlier novels from the 1950s, CROOKED HOUSE and A POCKETFUL OF RYE.  I thought also the glamorous fresco painted on the living room wall of the flat where the three girls live, a harlequin leaping into space, harked back to one of Christie's famous characters, Harley Quin from THE MYSTERIOUS MR. QUIN and may have provoked Christie to think further about Quin, because as we know she was soon to return to him after not having written about him for 30 years, in THE HARLEQUIN TEA SET.	2004-09-05

What a challenge editor Murat Nemet-Nejat has faced, trying to introduce a whole new world of writing to an American public whose appetite for the new has been proven to be, to say the least, a spotty one.  And yet he faces his task with an admirable optimism, zeal and undeniable skill.  Not only does he select most of the poems involved, but I would estimate 85 or 90 percent of the translation work is his as well.  As an estimable poet in English, Nemet-Nejat's translations are seamless, and remove from the texts that sense of displacement, of \\"foreignness\\" which bugs most Americans so that they won't give most world poetries a chance.  Well we won't have that excuse to fall back on this time, because as a result of his work, Nemet-Nejat has assembled a book of writing which could have been written right here in the USA, so contemporary is its panache.  Among my favorite writers in the book are Seyhan Erozcelik, who writes (in \\"Platonic\\"):<br /><br />The evening folded<br /><br />blind, plato blind<br /><br />folded.<br /><br />Someone writes rain<br /><br />rain<br /><br />writes<br /><br />rain rain.<br /><br />A poem where you can see its own writing reflecting back at you like a dark mirror, that seems to make itself as you watch (and participate).  Erozcelik's writing is expansive and generous, with a line occasionally too long for the confines of a page, so that it is printed sideways like some of Doug Powell's writing.  This poem has a Powell-like title too . . . \\"Coffee Grounds.\\"<br /><br />I could write on and on about all the different writers, only one or two of which I thought were duds, but the best thing to do is to order a copy of this book for your own.  Get two, give one away and you will have made a friend forever.	2004-09-04

I picked up DIVE and, well, kind of dove in.  It was lying around the coffee table here for quite awhile.  Dive is quite an arresting novel.  In its own way it reminds me of the farflung expansivenss of something like the late Ken Kesey's SOMETIMES A GREAT NOTION.  Its two main characters see the worst in each other, and the best, and opt out for somewhere in between.  I liked the way the city of Los Angeles turned into one of the main characters as well.  Ray is sort of difficult because you spend the whole book from the very first page knowing he's a killer on the run.  Teasley performs the difficult task of making us feel empathy for a killer, kind of like a Jim Thompson novel, except Lisa Teasley's got such a feel for action sequences, she makes Jim Thompson feel like Ivy Compton Burnett.<br /><br />Here's one tense part where Ray is trying to save Ruby (his love interest) from drowning.  \\"Superhuman reflex catapults Ray into the water less than a moment after Ruby dives in.  He couldn't be sure that her head would strike the piling at two feet under, but she is unconscious, dead weight.  Though his own heart throbs up the back of his throat, seamlessly he lays out her small, baked cinnamon body, slick and wet as a seal, the thin clothes sticking to her as if melted.\\"  That's just a sample of action from a book whose suspense and nerve-wracking tension never let up all the way to the end.  And, there's some interesting family stuff too.<br /><br />I hope they make a movie out of this book.	2004-09-01

Would any district attorney, even in Manhattan, try first a man, then his wife, then his son, for the same crime?  I don't think so, even though one marvels at the way Ellery Queen, or whoever wrote this potboiler, ultimately does his best to make it seem possible if not plausible.<br /><br />The plot turns on a particular sexual quirk of the victim, a fashionable New York coutierere called Sheila Grey, that not many will find convincing, and it also depends on the way everyone is willing to believe that the millionaire dad, Ashton McKell, is actually impotent.  I suppose the point is that no man would ever say anything like that about himself unless it was really true and he was backed into a corner?  McKell's wife, Lutetia, is from the old school but I do not believe that any woman, even one who seems to have stepped out of Edith Wharton's imagination, would be reading, in 1965, a novel by \\"Mrs. Oliphant.\\"  Give me a break.	2004-08-31

THE HOLLOW is one of Agatha Christie's best postwar thrillers when she seemed to be trying out a new style of close psychological observation, a very delicate kind of character portrayal that was a carryover from her \\"straight novels\\" written under the pseudonym of Mary Westmacott.  Another good example of this postwar style would be TAKEN AT THE FLOOD.<br /><br />I loved the story of Henrietta, one of Christie's few female visual artists, ruthless and driven, like Amyas Crale in FIVE LITTLE PIGS, always sacrificing everything to the good of their art, even their most basic human relationships.  Over and over again Christie uses this theme, and I suspect she must have somehow identified herself with this driven artist figure.<br /><br />The other story that is so appealing is the love story of Midge Hardcastle, the \\"poor relation\\" of the Angkatell family, who gets to spend her weekends and holidays at the family mansion, but when the weekend's over, she has to go back to her life of genteel poverty selling clothes for a fashionable modiste who values her only for her society connections.  No matter how many times I read THE HOLLOW, my throat clenches up when I reach the richly satisfying end of the book, when poor Midge gets her Cinderella wishes granted.  It's very affecting, just like the end of AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN.<br /><br />Veronica Craye is very good too.  Obviously Christie was using the real life Veronica Lake as the model for Craye, just as in the 1960s she used the real life Gene Tierney for the actress in THE MIRROR CRACK'D.<br /><br />All in all, a book filled with wonderful female characters.  Though the men aren't bad either!	2004-08-30

MacCabe, who has written interesting books on Warhol and Nicolas Roeg, explicates the progression of a great artist from enfant terrible to a man most think has died.  The chapter about Anna Karina is wonderful, and we get the impression that Karina remains for MacCabe one of the icons of femininity, whereas he is cool and respectful towards Anne-Marie  (Godard's frequent collaborator) you get the feeling he's not turned on by her the way he is by Karina.  Also, we see him being tremendously gallant I think, towards Jane Fonda, with whom Godard made a film TOUT VA BIEN and then after it failed, he turned on her with the vicious \\"cinema portrait\\" LETTER TO JANE, castigatig her for her vanity and her foolish liberalism.  MacCabe delivers a reproof to Godard and Gorin that says it all.<br /><br />I do agree that Godard has made too many films for any one critic to account for.  It is not MacCabe's fault exactly, but he might have written two books, one on Godard's international career as auteur in the 1960s, and the other of the virtually unknown films.  He makes you want to see them on the one hand, but on the other hand one realizes with a sinking heart, well, life's too short!	2004-08-29

The same children reappear, Kip, Lydia, Laura, Gordy in an upscale suburban neighborhood something like Scarsdale, NY or Greenwich, CT.  Children love this book with its search for magical wishing wells, as well as trying to figure out Eager's clever puzzle--are the things that happen to them the result of their wishes, or is it all just a coincidence?  Adults will like the spectacle of the different John Cheever-ish neighbors being lampooned in a variety of smirky ways.  One added bonus is that, his character Madame Salvatini, the retired opera singer, reminisces of the days when she was young and she was just \\"plain Maggie Smith.\\"  This book was written well before Maggie Smith became an international star.  \\"No one gave a hoot about me when I was plain Maggie Smith; but they drank champagne out of Madame Salvatini's slipper!\\"	2004-08-27

It takes forever to get going, and the reader is trying to hold on to all these characters through re-caps (Max, Billy, Sherry and Nate) all of whom, as far as i could tell, had far more fasicnating things happen to them in previous volumes of the series, to which King alludes again and again.  I found the whole thing far-fetched and the preciousness of the conceit, that these mysterious letters from the past, which hint at much but stop just short of saying anything definite, is the modern-day equivalent of the \\"dying message\\" popularized by Ellery Queen during mystery's Golden Age.  Yes, there is a lot of local color and the Everglades is an interesting site, filled with colorful characters.  But I didn't find anything new in this book, just a lot of warmed over second rate James Lee Burke-isms.  However, the story gets better after the first hundred pages and by the end, you can't help but applaud as Max goes out on a limb to help Mark Mayes and to see justice done, while Sherry ponders what to do about a female colleague who's getting beat up pretty bad by another cop.	2004-08-25

And he hadn't even written POLITICS yet at the time he got the nod.<br /><br />Well here it is now, in a high-profile type of dust jacket that is cut off halfway down the jacket, to make it stand out from the other novels on the table at Barnes and Noble, and I bet it does very well.  When you read POLITICS it makes you realize just how accomplished a writer Milan Kundera is, for in Kundera's hands this same storyline turned into THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING whereas when Thirlwall does it, it just sags down with the insecurities of the privileged girl at the center of the tale, the randy boy who wants to spice up their sex life with a menage a trois, and the kind of hapless actress, Anjali, who becomes the \\"June\\" in their own version of HENRY AND JUNE.  Thirlwell is great when he's describing food, fashion and couture, and when he's telling stories about writers from the past he admires.  And he does know quite a bit about the hoydenish behavior of young women desperately trying to please men unworthy of them.  But all in all, even though the book is hot pink, and one's hands are drawn to touch it, hold it, caress it, make love to it, do yourself a favor and put it back on the shelf, uncut.  Even a copy of GRANTA will prove more rewarding.	2004-08-25

The book is good, but it is the book of two men, a young and an old, who are not the best of collaborators.  I think the young man to whom most of the adventures happen would have been more gossipy and excited about things were he not held in place by the distinguished older gentleman Ted Chapin of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization.  For example, if you read between the lines, it seems pretty clear that the young Ted was pretty much crushed out on the glamorous Hollywood hasbeen Yvonne de Carlo, who came to New York City in full glamor mode and took Ted out on a series of dates to the Stork Club et al, and that when she left his life she left a big hole in it.  But the older Ted sees ruefully that if it was a romance at all, it was pretty one-sided and potentially embarrassing.  So the issue is tabled.  I loved hearing all about how Sondheim created the score as the show was in tryouts; when it began only perhaps twenty minutes worth of music was finished, and the rest was created under intense pressure on the road in hotel rooms and coffee shops.  I liked hearing about Mathilde Pincus, the music copyist, and the book gave me a new word I had never heard before.  \\"She [Pincus] used a flat pen with black ink and wrote on 11\\" by 14\\" sheets of opaque paper called deschon, which had the musical staff lines printed in reverse on one side.  Writing with ink on the other side allowed for errors to be erased without affecting the staff lines.\\"  I guess I had seen 'deschon\\" but never knew what it was, just like I went to see \\"Follies\\" with De Carlo, Smith, Collins, several times, and never really knew how it came to be created.  Thank God for Ted Chapin, the young one and the middle-aged man as well.	2004-08-25

She and her husband converse about the best way to attack this problem.  She is an overweight woman over fifty years old, so she prefers to do things the easy way.  She leaves Australia and hooks up with another Australian woman called Gerry, and the two of them start driving through the West Coast of Canada on a \\"Thelma and Louise\\" style trip.<br /><br />Gerry is an unusual character and, if Pybus can be believed, at first she seems like she's charming and quirky, and only later does Pybus realize she has been saddled with the road-trip mate from Hell.  And things get really tense when Gerry, the Amazon who lives on horrid junk food, picks up another girl, Lisa, who apparently is bulimic.<br /><br />Their three-corner adventures make up the heart of the book.  It's not so much a travel book but a relationship story about two women not really understanding each other, and the hurt feelings and missed opportunities that result.  You want to scream at them, \\"Get over it!\\"  Meanwhile Pybus finds less and less evidence that Lillian ever did go to Russia.  After all these years, there really isn't much trace of her.<br /><br />It is kind of like Krakauer's INTO THE WILD, except so long ago there are no longer any witnesses.<br /><br />We are left wondering, why did Lillian make the long trek to Russia?  Maybe she was just stupid.<br /><br />Cassandra Pybus doesn't do herself any favors either, painting a self-portrait of a whimsical, bohemian layabout who can't get along with other women but who loves the Alaskan men she meets.  She sounds like she'd be the last person on earth you'd want to take a ride with.<br /><br />Still, she can write, and if you haven't read INTO THE WILD, Pybus provides a lot of spoilers for that book so it's kind of like two books in one.hat book so it's kind of like two books in one.	2004-08-24

Lawrence wrote an OK biography of Jerome Robbins, and an as told to \\"by\\" Gelsey Kirkland which was good, but this book is terrific fun.  The only thing is, aren't Kander and Ebb a couple?  Or was that something they didn't want to talk about?  Maybe they're not, who knew!  But discussion of their personal lives is totally not on the menu here.  Maybe after they are dead the whole story will come out.  They tell some great stories here about working with Bob Fosse, maybe the best sustained account available of the great choreographer's ambitions, dreams, desires, and mania.  I like the way that Liza Minnelli and Harold Prince also jump in to give their two cents here and there from the bleachers.  It's a technique you often see in journalism, and here it works just fine.  Liza is subject #1 of Kander and Ebb's discussions.  They are always trying to make her look good, or rather to bring her natural talents to the fore.  But in doing so they paint a picture of a talented actress who was thwarted by the commercial failure of THE RINK and therefore never tried to be anything but \\"just Liza\\" again, and being \\"just Liza\\" is pretty messed up what with having a mother who tried to take over her life in a drunken haze and at least one boyfriend (Martin Scorsese) who attempted to direct a whole show for her (THE ACT) via Moviola.  Kander and Ebb also discuss writing for Lauren Bacall and the differences that affected WOMAN OF THE YEAR when Raquel Welch came in and replaced Bacall.  It's all very illuminating and will make you laugh out loud as well.  Their post mortems for their flops THE RINK and STEEL PIER, which they consider among their best shows, are not convincing, but their account of work with a sour kvetching Frank Sinatra and a controlling Barbra Streisand have the bitter ring of truth.  This is not a particularly light-hearted book but I think anyone who's interested in musical theater will get a charge out of it.<br /><br />I wish there had been more in it about the mysterious ingenue Jill Haworth who, after a strong of movies for Otto Preminger, took the Sally Bowles part in CABARET and got crucified for it--and had a \\"thing\\" with Sal Mineo (!!!) -- and then left show business.

Squeezing The Poet into the world of Harry Bosch meant that the Poet plot had to be drastically curtailed and stripped of interest.  It's just there, the Poet is back, Harry is charged with catching him, that's it.  In THE POET the killer was scary, nearly terrifying.  Here he's just a faceless blob who pops up to kill six people here, six people there, for no rhyme or reason.  By the end of the book the reader tires of his ways.  On the other hand, page by page the book is one of Connelly's best written, and despite itself, the story succeeds, although nothing will make me believe that Rachel ever develops the least bit of interest in Harry.<br /><br />Didn't we already read this plot (disgraced FBI agent is summoned back to the center of the action by the serial killer she tracked down) in Thomas Harris' novels?  On every page of THE NARROWS I kept thinking of Rachel Walling and how she was just a pale imitation of the way Clarice Starling was mistreated by her superiors in HANNIBAl.  Too bad the Poet didn't swoop in and boil the brains of Rachel's asinine bosses.	2004-08-23

The other characters were a bit more murky.  I wondered if we were ever supposed to question whether Max, the young Tadzio boy on whom poor Jeremy is so crushed out, is actually telling the truth or lying when he accuses another counselor, Jeremy's friend Charlie, of molesting him.  Jeremy accepts Max's word on this awfully quick.  I expected a few more Kobe Bryant-style defenses from Charlie (and from Jeremy for that matter, who accepts this shattering revelation awfully quick for such a purportedly good \\"friend.\\")  But, as Lowenthal cleverly reveals, Jeremy has had a long-ago buried grudge against Charlie from the days when they were both boys.  Thus the question is moot (whether Charlie is guilty or innocent) and I would just say, look, if you don't want people to think you have an unholy interest in young boys, get a job somewhere else not in a boy's camp.<br /><br />At the end of the book, Jeremy is a sadder but wiser individual, implicated in the very machinations of society he had hoped to avoid.  Every sentence, every paragraph of AVOIDANCE is alive with lived experience and with the joy of metaphor and seeing.  Lowenthal has a poet's eye and can condense what one is seeing and feeling into a single enduring and striking image, so that at every turn we are diverted, thrilled and seduced by his language.  Some readers may be put off by the ambiguity of a storyline that seems to contradict what its first person narrator seems so anxious to convey, but I applaud its daring and the courage of its author.	2004-08-23

It is very much a VietNam Era story, and it is extremely interesting for those who like to read novels about the aftermath of the terrible war.  Terry Foxway, a young man from the surf culture of Southern California, returns to high school after two years of distinguished service in VietNam.  He lied about his age to get into the service, and joined up when he was 16.  We get the picture that his recruiting officers suspected he was underage, but they were so hungry for warm bodies they took him anyhow.  While in VietNam he became a killing machine, and now he's back at a school rather like the one attended by the young people of the current TV drama THE O.C., where he meets Nina, a young woman with long dark hair and a fantastic figure who becomes attracted to the young junior.  The two of them embark on a torrid affair.<br /><br />In 1971, I imagine that if a film was made of this novel it might have starred Richard Thomas as Foxway and Barbara Hershey as the beach chick, Nina.  The book is a savage anti-war parable and reminded me of the mixed messages of Jerzy Kosinsky's BEING THERE.<br /><br />In one part a group of rapists try to attack Nina while she lies embracing Terry on the beach, and he uses his commando training not merely to escape, but to kill all four would-be rapists within seconds.  In a way he's like Rambo, but so much younger he resembles one of the dead-eyed children of VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED.	2004-08-20

Now Sylvia Plath is shown going the same route at about the same time, and for the first time her affair with the mysterious Richard Sassoon is given center stage and explored as perhaps the central love relationship in her life, which makes for a change from other biographies which dwell on Ted Hughes' inadequacies (or conversely on why Ted was so much a better man and poet than Sylvia was a human being), or on Sylvia's fear of Otto and her love hate thing she had with Aurelia.<br /><br />Paul Alexander's National Enquirer-style reporting may turn some heads, and may startle gentler souls, and in fact did we really need to hear all this about Sylvia's sexual masochism and taste for spanking?  When it comes to moving to England, the book goes kind of Lucifer Rising with its deep focus on Ted's zodiac mysticism and Sylvia's picking up ghostly reverberations and getting her poetry from out of the air, like Led Zeppelin's Houses of the Holy cover or a leftover chapter from Cold Comfort Farm.

The other version just isn't that good.<br /><br />Nancy tries to figure out who is responsible for giving birth to the two babies adopted by the Blairs, a wealthy couple very much involved in the arts (she is a famous actress adored by all her fans and everyone in River Heights is thrilled to death that she is living among them, while her husband is an erudite director on the model of Erich Von Stroheim).  The babies though, were not only adopted but practically stolen from a young desperate mother of twins who took a locket and broke it in half to be able to prove the maternity of her two beloved babies.  This book will shock you down to your soul with its revelations of the way some people just adopt babies for \\"show.\\"  I wonder if Joan Crawford had the chance to read this book in the 1930s and that's where she came up with the idea of adopting the twins in real life!  If so, she probably was very sorry eventually.  Was there a broken locket in the Crawford case as well?	2004-08-20

It's not easy being the son of a powerful father, and taking up his trade puts added stress on the relationship.  These metaphors for the distance between the First and Second Persons of the Trinity resonate throughout F. Wright's poetry as they do in Spencer's Mountain or Tammy and the Doctor.

Well, in my opinion, Jim Morrison is inherently more interesting than the boys of Led Zeppelin, though both flirted with the dark magic of Kenneth Anger.  And also now, because Morrison is dead, Davis doesn't need to concern himself much with libel laws, except to protect thr reputation of the innocent who are alive.<br /><br />His focus is on the paradox of ontology, of Morrison's being, and why is it that a boy who on the surface led a pretty privileged suburban life wound up living as an adult a life of creativity, unhappiness, and mystery.  No other writer has come close as this to explaining Morrison's art in terms of his childhood and his background, and partly Davis' success stems from his finger on the pulse of US and world history during the 1940s and 1950s.  We see Morrison very much in tune with contemporary developments in music, poetry, art and cinema, showing that he was not some isolated genius, but part of an interweb of action and reaction that accompanied the Cold War and its discontents.  If, as Davis alleges, Morrison was the victim as a teen of sexual abuse by someone within his own family, a military figure at that, it would go a long way towards explaining how \\"The End,\\" etc, came to be written.	2004-08-17

Shameful, I guess, but what can you do?  In the movie, Ian Holm mans a Scottish weather station in the days after warming reaches boiling point and results, paradoxically, in a new Ice Age approximately 2.5 times worse than the original one that formed the icebergs and firmed up the glaciers.  What Gelbspan does is to show us that this very catastrophe is not far off, indeed he says that it (or something akin to this scenario) is almost 100% likely to happen, and much sooner than we think, due to the way the oil and coal industries are forcing the government to legislate unfair laws.  The government of Bush, he states flatly, is in the pocket of these multinational corporations.<br /><br />Other countries have fought back against global warming and the depredations of the oil companies.  But not America.  This book asks one question: why not?  It's a long book, filled with dense explanation, but despite everything it must be read for the sake of our children and of all life on this fragile planet.	2004-08-17

Her diary is ably edited by Leon Edel, and contains a lot of shrewd portrait-painting of her brothers (including the third, not-famous brother who sparkles throughout this diary, even though he left this life without a shadow), as well as some general philosophy.  She is ever ready to remind herself that she is a child of privilege, and yet a trace of self-pity remains, like some stubborn stain that proves unexpectedly difficult to scrub out.<br /><br />\\"What an awful loss it is that we can't see our own follies,\\" James writes, \\"they must be so much more exquisite than any one's else, but as vanity is what keeps the world agoing, after one or two convulsive laughs, the game would certainly be up!<br /><br />\\"Shall I ever have any convulsive laughs again!  Ah, me!  I fear me not.  I had such a feast for 34 years that I can't complain.\\"  Anyone who wants to know about American writing at the turn of the century should get a copy of this book.  \\"What difference is there in the spiritual essence of two viragoes fighting on their door-steps over a coal-ticket, left or not left by the district visitor and that of two great ladies at daggers drawn over their seat at some function or other?--all simply scrambling for something they haven't got.\\"	2004-08-16

Clive is a mystery man she meets in a seaside town in the days just following Dunkirk.  Is he in the service?  Hard to say.  She is, and it's a bit of a culture shock for her having to mix with women from all social classes, their loudness and vulgarity drive her half mad.  Clive is from the opposute end of the social scale, but his rough taciturn manliness inspires Prue to do something terribly daring, she takes a forbidden sex holiday with him and checks into a beach hotel for an extended plkeasure tour.  For who knows when they will meet again and in the shadow of the Blitz lovers must cling to each other now or never.<br /><br />THIS ABOVE ALL became a successful film during the war, with Joan Fontaine as Prudence.  She was perfectly cast in the part and helped make it a huge success.  For modern readers, THIS ABOVE ALL is what my wife's Dad used to call a \\"talk you to death,\\" but there are many interesting parts, and the book as a whole is embedded with a social consciousness that Hollywood made light of, the world Clive hails from is the brutal, violent, surly world of lower class Britons in the days following the General Strike, the world Orwell hinted at in his early novels and one which our contemporary Pat Barker strives to illuminate.  You may love this book as millions did way back when.	2004-08-16

Davy's heavy-drinking mother then takes him in to her Manhattan apartment and tells him he can't bring Fred.  No way, Davy rebels, and eventually the mother relinquishes, but it's clear from her tone that Fred is only there on sufferance.  Poor Davy has to live in a bedroom done up by an interior designer for a five-year old, with a teddy bear on his pillow.  Then he has to start a new school and makes a \\"New York enemy\\" within his first two hours of his first day of school.  However, this has unexpected consequences because a strange friendship develops between the two boys.<br /><br />I won't give away the rest of the plot but some pretty terrible things happen, and some wonderful ones too.  I first read this book when I was about the age of Davy Reed, maybe a little bit older, and identified with him totally, even though my life was very different.  Reading the book now, I'm overwhelmed by how talented Mr. John Donovan is as a writer.  Had he pitched this book to an adult audience, I feel sure he would be celebrated as one of the best novelists of the 1960s.  His toughness and lack of sentiment makes Richard Yates look like Danielle Steel.  Simply put this novel, so shocking in its own day, is still a miracle of construction and discipline.  If Donovan is still alive, I hope he continues to produce other great books.	2004-08-15

I found it all to obvious that a young man like Joey would find himself at odds with society, and yet there's a comic edge to this writing that was missing in his earlier novels, and that imparts a soft, cotton candy feeling to the book which is nice, and makes the reader feel as though the sights and sounds of a small town in Northern Ireland were drifting through the air like a dreamy Maeve Binchy novel, but for men maybe.<br /><br />The extreme FIGHT CLUB like violence of BUTCHER BOY and the implausible gender hijinks of BREAKFAST ON PLUTO take a back seat now to gentle, Philip Roth style light comedy about a pathetic wanna-be and how he gets to be the way he is.  We've all seen the stereotype of the lazy Irish bum with desires bigger than his abilities to satisfy them, blowing bubbles in the air, prone to a large fantasy life, and not much good with women.  Now McCabe gives us that character writ in neon letters in this tiny masterpiece of precious prose.  One of his best, maybe THE best, and I'm looking forward to the inevitable Adam Sandler movie they make out of it.	2004-08-13

Like TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, this haunting novel explores the nature of prejudice and the clannishness of family and race in a USA changing too fast for its characters to adjust in.  An-Jing has come over from China all the way to Brooklyn and she takes to it like a duck to water, but she is hampered just like the girls of olden times whose feet were hobbled, hampered by her parents' myopic insistence that she live her life as a \\"good Chinese girl,\\" one whose eventual marriage to a man picked out by her mother and father will profit both families.  Well, An-Jing doesn't like this state of affairs, especially since her little brother can do as he pleases, and her older brother gets caught up in the easy-come, easy-go lifestyle of Brooklyn, where drugs are cheap and the living is on the down-low.  Joey is a nice young American boy, but the way An-jing's parents would react if they knew she was dating him, they would die of shame and indignation.  Of course this Romeo and Juliet story wouldn't progress very far without a \\"Nurse,\\" and in this case, we get An-Jing's Americanized aunt, who sympathizes with the young girl who only wants to be called \\"Cathy\\" and to be able to date the boy of her dreams.<br /><br />This whole stew is warmed-over Flower Drum Song, but Megan Meacham has a writing style that brings you THIS CLOSE to An-Jing's innermost thoughts, dreams and desires.	2004-08-13

She was often lonely, her memoir tells us, and the signal event of her childhood was stumbling across a copy of a lonely hearts club journal to which a kindly school teacher allowed her to subscribe, even though she was obviously underage (12).<br /><br />By the time she came to write her memoir, \\"Call Me Mistress,\\" she had figured out not only the obvious ways to hook up with men, Welsh or otherwise, but also some not-so-obvious ones, including talking on an open switchboard and pretending to be all excited to hear men whisper dirty things to her, while doing her nails or whatever on the other side of the phone.  If you like intimate descriptions of British people having phone sex in grotty bedsits, this book can't be beat.  I couldn't help thinking of our own American Natalie, the starlet Natalie Wood, and thinking of how her life differed in many significant ways from that of Natalie Rhys, and how she never became a phone sex performer at least for pay.<br /><br />At the end of the book she has passed through the gauntlet of embarrassment and plays in the garden of hope.	2004-08-13

Stevenson, the prolific novelist, is an ideal Boswell for Halbert's yakety-yak lifetsyle as she tells more than her share of difficult moments at the bar.  Defending a murderer--how do you get your mind around that?  It isn't easy, Halbert avows, but at the same time she feels that everyone is entitled to the best representation they can possible scrape by with.  Even more heinous a crime for a feminist like Halbert is the ugly crime of rape, and she has defended several men on the charge that did in, say, Fatty Arbuckle.  Halbert and Stevenson spin their webs of magical prose, evoking the mid-70s New York, tired and dirty and yet the most exciting place in the world, with effortless ease, and at the same time they sensitively detail a typical day in the life of a selfless advocate.  If any of you have ever seen THE VERDICT, with Paul Newman, and wished to read a true life version of that story, except with the sexes changed and also if it was a true story instead of Lumet's fantasy, this is the book for you.<br /><br />Back in the mid 1970s, no New York publisher would touch this book, and it fell to Philadelphia's Lippincott to give it the light of day.  At the time, there were whispers that high level New York capos had forbidden the publication of Halbert's tell-all expose, and that all the big NY publishers caved in, like so many pinatas filled with hot air.  Lindsay Wagner wanted to do the movie version, wonder if she's still interested?	2004-08-13

I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.<br /><br />People say that Ellen De Generes based the characterization of her forgetful fish in FINDING NEMO on Anne Heche when the mental illness made her forget things (such as if she was heterosexual or not), but in this book Anne Heche sets the record \\"straight\\" as it were. She is never less than candid, but I wonder if someday she'll look back on this book and ask herself, did I just write this to make money?

Expect parallel interest in CALL ME PAT, a title from about ten years ago newly re-issued to meet the boom in Hughes studies.  Hyland was a Navy radioman and a brave sailor indeed, whose exploits in the service deserve even more expansion than they merit here.  Funny how the patriotic among us get short shrift while the merely wealthy, like Hughes, garner all the attention.  By the end of the 1950s, Hyland (charmingly called \\"Pat\\") had taken over the operations of Hughes Aircraft while his boss, HH, was battling it out on every front with his movie star wife, Jean Peters.<br /><br />Until 1980 this remained Hyland's job, not only his vocation, but his avocation.  Between him and Hughes a mysterious bond remained.  Hughes had stepped away from the glamorous, Hepburn and Gardner and RKO life by the time Hyland became CEO oh Hughes Aircraft, and so this wonderful book will be a kind of sequel to the Scorsese effort, which insyead concentrates on the less dismal, exciting and earlier Hollywood years and features a cameo by Gwen Stefani of No Doubt as Jean Harlow, the tragic platinum blonde whom Hughes directed in HELLS ANGELS and sought to dominate elsewhere.	2004-08-13

We were there, simply enough, praying in thebold Cathedral at the top of Nob Hill, having just stopped in to get out of the chilly fog on a windswept afternoon. People with dark suits and lengths of lavender ribbons were festooning the nave and aisles of the church with color and flowers, and placed a large jar of proteus on the podium floor. We later discovered that proteus was the favorite flower of Thich Nhat Hanh, and you can hear him croon with pleasure on the tape about the flowers, and if you do not understand the reference immediately, he's talking about how he sees proteus all over the world, so it's like a universal symbol of love.<br /><br />We soon found out that Thich Nhat Hanh and his organization had sold tickets to hear this lecture but miracle of miracles, they did not kick us out, but allowed us to stay even though we did not pay the minimal fees charged. And what a lecture, filled with poetry and the pedagogy of love. By the time we went outside, the sun had burst out, and you could see a rainbow towering over Nob Hill with one end buried in the Mission and the other by Coit Tower. Afterwards we saw Thich Nhat Hanh, accompanied by two children, scampering through the famous maze in the pavement in front of Grace Cathedral. With glee they negotiated the twists and turns that baffle Western man.	2004-08-13

The various essays and rants he embarks on tell the truth from the deeply hurt and abandoned perspective, one to which I relate deeply. Anyone who has a heart will respond when Henry goes off the deep end and gets one of his visions, like where he compares humans to automatic vending machines like ATMS, programmed by society to interface with others on a superficial level, perhaps dispensing money (or \\"love\\") but at what a price. MEKANIK men and women populate our lives, sometimes we look around and that's all we can see, these fake robotic creatures with hypocritical smiles the color of liver. For most of us, eventually society inserts its slimy tentacles into our brains and cortexes and yanks them tight. So that we become mechanical as they are. If you've seen the movie THEY LIVE then you've seen a good deal of the philosophy Henry lives by.<br /><br />Henry has a great writing style, filled with puns and anagrams and other signs of good humor, but all this capability is marshalled to one effect, punishing his enemies and clearing his own mind from the terror and humiliation issued him by others.

It is, among other things, the inside story of the most remarkable child actress of her day, and of a strange career that included Broadway stardom and the Academy Award for THE MIRACLE WORKER, as well as the punishing, grueling TV treadmill called THE PATTY DUKE SHOW, in which she played two lookalike cousins with such consummate verve that many children who watched the show thought there were actually two different actresses playing the parts, and of course the divine dreck of BILLIE, \\"Funny Little Butterflies,\\" and VALLEY OF THE DOLLS.<br /><br />Indeed it's a book that has everything, everything, including the details of her feud with Lucille Ball and her days counting her fingers to figure out if John Astin or Desi Jr was the father of her baby.<br /><br />Her star has sunk in later years but she is still one of the incandescent acting personalities of our time.	2004-08-12

Nowadays, everyone is in on the Melville revival but in the immediate postwar years Melville had only really been in the canon for twenty years or so, so Olson was working out something new and undone in American literature.

It seemed as if he had everything: wonderful talent, a devoted family, a gift not only for musical comedy but for drama too, as his turns in The Country Girl and Going My Way indicated.  Though filmed considerably later than the period he describes in this book, \\"der Bingle\\" did a great job as a serial killer in Ira Levin's medical thriller, Dr. Cook's Garden.  Bing had a warm, jazz-inspired delivery that wrapped itself around air like it was filled with honey, he was surely the warmest singer who ever lived.  If his private life was more complicated than the Saturday Evening Post was then willing to print, what we have in CALL ME LUCKY is another side to the many-faceted Bing Crosby, a construction of grit, daring and tenderness that remains remarkably durable twenty years after his death.	2004-08-10

Ben Elton's spoof show, HOUSE ARREST, is so similar to the tripe on TV you'd think he had been a contestant himself on one of those awful, shameless shows.  So some of the elements may be satiric (surely no producer could be that banal and greedy) but otherwise it sticks close to the bone, and some of the characters are hilarious in their ignorance and their shameless self-promotion.  To me it seems that at least one of the characters, the classical actor turned porn star, would have done anything to get out of appearing on TV for fear of recognition, but maybe in Britain audience recognition is somewhat different than here in TV.<br /><br />Best of all, you will not guess who killed poor Kelly.  I tried afterwards to work it all out in my mind how it was done, but as I say Ellery Queen would have taken off his hat to Ben Elton.<br /><br />By the way, the hot tub scene during which the murder was done turned out to be very sexual.  BIG UP to BEN for that.  Is this the same Ben Elton who wrote the musical for Andrew Lloyd Webber and the other one with all the songs by Queen?  He's a boy with many strings to his bow.

In these cases we see the social snobbery that was Wentworth's speciality, prismed through the acutely keen gaze of Miss Silver, a relic from the Victorian era even more imaginative and superstitious than Agatha Christie's Miss Marple.  \\"Miss Ora fingered the pinke edge of her shawl.  'Very interesting things can happen in a village,' she said.  'And you get to know about them, which is what makes them so interesting.'\\"  This story THE WATERSPLASH is a pale imitation of Christie's similarly plotted EASY TO KILL, but it has charms of its own.	2004-08-09

Too bad Hugh Kenner isn't around to make use of the material that Ferguson has dredged up.  Though no full length volume by Hulme had been published or even in the works when he died, sympathetic friends pushed one forward and SPECULATIONS, a selected works, became one of the key texts of the emergent movement he himself labelled, \\"Modernism.\\"  Along the way he helped to found Vorticism and Imagism, and became one of Ezra Pound's cornerstones, a trusted friend, and a bitter enemy of Wyndham Lewis, who attacked poor Hulme in a knockdown dragout fight worthy of a mid-period John Wayne movie.<br /><br />In a way the book is also the biography of Hulme's last love, the milliner Kate Lechmere, who served as a handmaiden to modernism and who elicited some pretty wild letters from Hulme, from the trenches and elsewhere, which are now at the Harry Ransom HR Center at Austin in Texas, where all good things go when their owners die.  You'll like reading the story of Kate Lechmere as a kind of added bonus to this book.	2004-08-08

That was nice as it illustrated the unexpected depths of friendship between two boys.  Trying to bring him back from the life of a mute, Connor did something few would even try to do.  Bran's incipient sexual feelings are also handled delicately.  However, given that darling Nikki, the young infant sister of Bran, has just been nearly shaken to death, I think he should have just dealt with his red face and sucked it up and gotten on with life, especially with the prosecution of the real batterer!  No one would ever clam up to such a degree just because one is embarrassed about being aroused.  Now, finally, I also feel that Vivian, the au pair girl, and her boyfriend, Morris, did not get a fair shake.  I believe that they were used as an excuse by an author who obviously believes women should stay home with their kids and that care providers cannot be trusted!  In this way Silent to the Bone is a bone-headed book, not only for kids, but for anyone with a clue about what's going on today.	2004-08-07

He is endearing, always saying and doing the exact wrong thing, and managing to alienate the shallow people he wants to impress.  His account of meeting Eleanor Clark and her rudeness to him is very well written.  She is a monster in human form, even down to having a face with a tragic flaw in it which made her look as though she were sneering all the time.  Eventually her personality came to match her face (according to this book, there may be another side to the story).  And Mewshaw's account of the Southern writer Peter Taylor is another prize.  What a terrible person!<br /><br />When he gets to Rome, he tries repeatedly to impress the once-famous novelist Anthony Burgess, who wrote A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.  Instead he has a hilarious eight-hour encounter with Burgess' wife, an excitable and grasping Italian, and their little boy of 7, a wild child with nothing but id.  In this context we come to admire Harold Robbins, the lowbrow best-seller.  He may not have been esteemed to critics, but at least he was generous to Mike and Linda!	2004-08-07

She had some literary pretensios herself, but did little but kvetch at him while he labored hard to help create--not only create but define--what was in the 1950s a totally new literary field--important American writing was for the first time predominantly Jewish.  His great friend, Philip Roth, continues to write great novels, while some of the other fellows of the period have been forgotten save in memoirs by their friends, like this one.<br /><br />But, it was a trenchant time in American writing, and one which will not soon be forgotten, even if some of the magic names seem to dwindle away even as he writes about them, all over, anew.  Meanwhile Lynn goes from bad to worse, even as Solotaroff gives her at least the virtue of being extremely sexy and alluring.  At times we can see why he stuck it out with her.  His father, on the other hand, was a pig.  There should be more books like this one, books in which we can see a literary movement being born 9and the machinery required to make one happen).	2004-08-06

Even in 2004, the 1999 Cathy looks as controversial as ever.  No wonder so many hate her and so many love her.  Her creator, Cathy Guisewite, marches in and takes no prisoners in the battle of the sexes and even more importantly, in the Ingmar-Bergman like drama of love and hate that exists between mother and daughter.  Poor Cathy, we always think, when she is forced to listen to more abuse from her mother, and yet, she seems to enjoy it in a way, perhaps she really wants to have children herself.<br /><br />The way she tries to fit into unsuitable clothes was obviously borrowed for another 90s sensation, the over-the-hill scenesters of ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS, and this collection in turn tips the hat right back by alluding to the UK-made TV sitcom in its title.  Guisewite has made a million variations on a very limited palette of character types and her drawing isn't the greatest in the world, but she's got angst going for her and an international fan base as well.	2004-08-06

It was this way for World War I (the GREAT WAR of Modris Eksteins' amazing book on this very subject) and it was this way a year ago, in Iraq, this spring, so that when in our gardens in America crocuses bloom, great clouds of smoke billow over Baghdad as they did in the No Man's Lands of France and Belgium ninety years ago now. What Modris Eksteins does is to show how modernism, and its kinship to primitive worship, created a free basin for war to fill up in, created the zeitgeist in which vast Wagnerian fantasies of brutality and mass suicide could enact themselves out.<br /><br /> This is a very fanciful idea, and the great thing about the book is that, very near the end, Eksteins just about convinces you that he was right. The spirits of T E Hulme, Gaudier-Brezska, and Ezra Pound haunt this book. Eventually modernism won, but at what a price! Was the price too great? Read &quot;The Waste Land&quot; for T S Eliot's rueful meditation on just this issue.	2004-08-06

Some of the poets she asked to contribute are already no longer with us, so their comments here have a slightly valedictory quality which makes this book even sweeter now, than when it first appeared three years ago.<br /><br />It is also a good book to share with your own children.  What's nice to know is that, in the middle of today's crazy world, young people are still stumbling across their very first poem, and again are succumbing to the pleasures of the word.

To all three of these groups the Jays, a pair of strong advocates for recovery, urge us to love them first.<br /><br /> I have seen my share of alcoholics who have finally seen the light and attempted sobriety, and it is very striking how what we read here (that you don't have to &quot;hit bottom&quot; to want to be helped) is often seen in life but seldom seen in the literature. It's always drama, drama, drama and &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; in other recovery literature. Thus LOVE FIRST is a rather genteel approach to recovery, but I'm sure it will have an impact all across America, wherever people are honestly trying to change their ways. And, in addition, this book and the program of the Jays will bring solace to suffering families of all ages, right through the generations.	2004-08-06

Is it any wonder this young girl grew up to be a poet, a novelist, and a taker of incredible artistic risks? As her talents grew, she began to think of herself as belonging, oddly, to two nations, a Northern and Southern hemisphere that corresponded to her own fluidity, her ability to change genre in the middle of a sentence.<br /><br /> Ortiz Cofer has long been one of America's cultural heroes. Now she strips back the legends of her youth to help us see the seeds of creativity which, or so some day, we all have been born with, even when obscured by circumstance. After reading this collection, you will be moved to do some &quot;silent dancing&quot; of your own.	2004-08-06

David Skal, the esteemed historian of B movies, has tried to trace this slippery trail from Lon Chaney all the way to the present.  As he points out, Hannibal Lecter is today's version of this old, satisfying trope, and Lecter's experiments with moths and menstrual blood can be seen as modern-day versions of the bizarre dreams of Dr. Frankenstein.<br /><br />Standing slightly outside of society, although given cultural equity in the name of university educations, the mad doctors and scientists who people our movies are always judging us, until the time comes when they get judged themselves (see Franju's EYES WITHOUT A FACE).<br /><br />What's all this heckling from other reviewers about Skal's scattershot approach?  Cut him some slack, he's trying to entertain and educate us at the same time, that calls for a bit of digression here and there.	2004-08-06

They say that one's first book is always going to be a preparation for the second, and the book, Marine Sniper, that I read about Carlos Hathcock, just warmed me up for this second go-round of Hathcock adventures.  In a way the two books were very similar, since it says in the introduction that they were carved out of the same UR-manuscript and written before Carlos' death five years ago.<br /><br />SILENT WARRIOR gives a deeper perspective on some of the events and personalities depicted in MS93CK.  The drawback for me is that I think to give the book more weight, Henderson resorts to some dubious devices to pump up the volume, including imagining what Carlos was thinking at such and such a time, and also frankly the worst offenders of the story, APACHE and PHILIP METZ, are turned into super-villainous caricatures that Ian Fleming might have dreamed up to torture James Bond.  If they really existed, and Carlos killed them, good for him.  But the writing is so over the top it's hard to be sure.<br /><br />This would be a good introduction to the life and death of a great Marine, but we already had the other book which is also a good introduction, so it's a draw.	2004-08-06

Well, number one, they're having a hell of a lot of fun and you can see the results in Nathaniel Welch's book SPRING BROKE.<br /><br /> One girl has a T shirt that says, &quot;I'm not an alcoholic, I'm a drunk. Alcoholics go to meetings.&quot; She looks a bit like the very young Cybill Shepherd, with Shepherd's cockeyed superiority, as though she were in on the joke, even if the joke was on her. Welch is a fine photographer and one wonders how he got releases from some of his subjects, especially the two boys and three girls he photographs making out in the shower. The girls are wearing thongs, I guess to preserve decency, but the one boy's just wearing a backwards baseball cap. When they're US Senators will they be trying to suppress these photos? Who can tell, in another twenty years spring break may be happening all year round and maybe even in the senate chamber.<br /><br /> The funniest photo may be the one of the tiny hotel refrigerator completely filled with alcohol, beer and mixers. You couldn't even fit in a radish if you wanted to.<br /><br /> Potentially an incendiary book, SPRING BROKE plays it cool and doesn't take sides. You have the feeling that Welch, who must be nearly forty by now, has a true love for these kids akin to Larry Clark's. Good work all around.	2004-08-06

It is a hefty book, packed to the gills with technical details, and enough names to make you think that thousands of small towns and US cities gave their entire citizenry to sub warfare. And in some towns this was almost the case. Many people think that the sailors and other personnel who served on submarines were chosen because they were physically smaller than other fighting men. Not so, and for proof you could do no better than look at author Blair, who in his prime stood a good six feet three, longer than many submarine bunks. He is modest about his own service and prefers to take the larger view.<br /><br />The drawbacks to the book is that it is heavy and even though it's a quality paperback, you have to use it with care. But the brave men who died on their various missions to defeat Japan live on in this book, and thus every time you consult this book, you light a little vigil for their souls.	2004-08-05

This time around Bill, a documentary filmmaker with an interest in Silicon Valley technology and bioscience that I'm too dumb to understand, must let Rod, the CEO of an emerging company, cry on his shoulder, much in the same way that in THE LONG GOODBYE a good fraction of the action happens in the bonding between Marlowe and Terry.  Rod's upset because Alissa has disappeared--Alissa, the enigmatic escort procured for him by Silicon Glamour, Inc.<br /><br />ABOUT FACE will remind you of Laura, the Otto Preminger film about a detective obsessed with the oil portrait of the woman whose murder he is supposed to be solving--or so he thinks.  From another angle, it is Calder's tribute to VERTIGO, and Rod and Bill both must face up to the possibility that their angel-faced Alissa wasn't necessarily the paragon of sex perfection she's cracked up to be.<br /><br />James Calder peoples his  romantic thriller with low lifes in high life and low, people who are truly the bottom of the genome barrel, and the result is a quantum leap over his first novel, which was in itself a very fine book.<br /><br />What other detective novel would use at its finale the clue of a bowl of carpaccio?  It's emblematic of the insanely privileged, harshly competitive world in which Bill Damen makes his living and which shatters his illusions . . . about women, about money, about glamor.  Put aside the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" and spend a few hours with code-breaker Bill, you'll be glad you did.<br /><br />There are also some echoes of Billy Wilder's FEDORA, and those who saw that wonderful film will know exactly what I'm talking about.  I don't want to spoil any more of the twists and turns of this remarkable bundle of suspense, so I'll stop here, wishing there were six stars I could give this book.	2004-08-05

It's always fun to see who gets to be picked by the committee and each time they roll around with the announcement, it is always a delightful surprise. No more so than in the case of Ms. Taylor, who has been an inspiring speaker for many years with speaking engagements in many places of worship from here to Hattiesburg and back.<br /><br /> In these lectures, which are, after all, aimed toward her fellow practitioners, she asks us, what happens when the words dry up and when God seems to turn His face away from the mess that we humans have made of our world? What does the preacher, a man or woman who depends on His word in the original sense of the word &quot;depends&quot; (i.e., hanging from, like a pearl earring hanging from the girl in Vermeer's painting) what does the preacher do to be able to give something to the folk assembled to hear him -- or her of course? Is there a recourse in silence, or music? In Lecture II all of these elements come together and Ms. Taylor really starts to (to use the lingo of jazz which she loves) &quot;cook.&quot; And she doesn't turn off the heat until she's out of the kitchen! Now, sometimes God is silent, or SEEMS to be, but happily, usually He is NOT SILENT.	2004-08-05

He responds with a series of hilarious non sequiturs and light-headed nitwit-isms, even when conversing with the locquacious and flowery characters of Lovecraft's most overwrought dialogue.<br /><br />The humor of these three tales is all in the contrast between the styles of the two masters, who must have been contemporaries of a sort, but who hailed from such different worlds.  Peter Cannon takes this running joke about as far as it can go, borrowing liberally from the plots of several of HPL's most famous chillers, while Bertie supplies all the jokes from soup to nuts.	2004-08-05

A dragon will be born that will destroy the entire universe. Epic journeys are nothing new to Jordan fans, and everyone should enjoy the way the master storyteller counterprograms two of them at once, in opposing directions, so that the two stories criss cross and entangle like braids being pulled on LOL.<br /><br /> So what's the beef? Well, first of all I wanted to know what was going to happen with the main, WoT, story before getting launched into the NEW SPRING WoTP prequel saga.

Thus Lina (Carolina Santoro) winds up following Persephone's footsteps down to hell, the underworld, the kingdom ruled by Hades. As P C Cast tells the story, borrowing a little bit from the legend of Eros and Psyche, and Psyche's journey to the underworld concealing the cakes in her mouth to get by Cerberus, Hades is re-envisioned as a hunky romance hero with a dark side, kind of reminiscent of Heahcliff in Emily Bronte's WUTHERING HEIGHTS.<br /><br /> We love P C Cast's way of making the most outlandish events seem normal! GODDESS OF SPRING is a romantic novel, a sexy one to be sure, but it also has some comic underpinnings that remind one of the 60s sitcoms which reversed reality such as BEWITCHED, I DREAM OF JEANNIE, and MY MOTHER THE CAR.

The book also takes us back to pre-war times, to the early part of the American century, the part that was stifled due to depression and national disunity.<br /><br />David is a great character and, like many of Dickens' heroes, he's born in an orphanage and raised in the poorhouse.  Like 30s social realism, we discover that actually life raised communally isn't all that bad (see the kibbutz lifestyle promoted by Michener's contemporary, Leon Uris, in EXODUS) because of the parade of colorful characters, some nasty, mostly loveable, that people David's life with wisdom.<br /><br />And then when he reaches puberty, his body awakens, and between his legs burn the fires of spring!  And here Michener brings us a gallery of different kinds of women with different attitudes towards the body and towards sexuality.  In some places rather risque, even by today's standards, THE FIRES OF SPRING is an astonishing and heartrending book.  One of Jim's best.	2004-08-05

To me it's getting harder and harder to remember what differentiates one Sandford novel from another. I used to go by the titles, but since they all have &quot;Prey&quot; in them, I depend too much on whatever the other word is. The first novel in which Lucas whipped Bekker was easy to remember, because of Bekker's obsession with eyesight, vision, eyelids, and the sightless gaze of the dead, so I can see why John Sandford called the book &quot;Eyes of Prey.&quot;<br /><br /> So far so good, and when I heard that Bekker had escaped from police custody, I was thrilled, and worried of course, for I assumed that he would seek revenge on Lucas. And when I saw the book was called &quot;Silent Prey&quot; I thought perhaps he would change his MO and cut out the tongues of his victims, the way he had previously severed their eyelids. Was I ever surprised to find out that there's really no reason that the book is called &quot;Silent Prey&quot; at all! But, it was nice to have the wonderful and alluring LILLY back in another Lucas book. One of these days, I hope Lucas settles down, he is getting too old to be playing the James Bond part, and even Sandford probably knows it by now LOL.	2004-08-04

It's a simple, elegant geometry, and Shulsky knows it better than LeCarre. I came to this text hoping to find out more about the world of intelligence. I figured, there's got to be more to it than the cartoonish figure than Kiefer Sutherland plays on TV's 24, surrounded by his loyal staff Tony and Michelle.<br /><br /> And there's got to be more going on but if so, how did the USA land in such an awful dilemma as to depend on its intelligence committees which suggested that, for example, there are WMD's in Iraq when as it turns out, if there ever were any, there don't seem to be any now. As Shulsky points out, there's almost no blame-sharing protocol within intelligence agencies. It's as if God made them and then forgot to teach them the words, &quot;I'm sorry.&quot; This is the one book in which you can learn why this should be so. Intelligence has changed rapidly in the years since the Cold War ended, and there are some satisfying books you could follow up on for post-graduate work, but SILENT WARFARE is a savvy place to begin.	2004-08-04

Why?  Why the darkness?  I suppose because many people contract the illness through needle use, the suggestion is that people who suffer from it have brough it on themselves, that they deserve to suffer.  Hogwash!  And Carol Turkington helps set the record straight on this issue right away.  Thank goodness for clear thinkers like Ms, Turkington.<br /><br />If everyone in America read this book, we'd be a far healthier nation, and based on recent speeches given at the Boston Democratic Convention, we'd be a nation dedicated to stopping disease instead of sweeping it under the carpet with everything else we don't care to think about.  Let's get some research done, and help save lives, before it's too late for all of us, and only our children left alive to reap the benefits of the education we spurned.	2004-08-04

I had read SILENT LANGUAGE by Twitchell Hall, and it definitely did not cover this faux pas.  My translator, a young Russian woman, informed me that it is not polite in Japan is leave food observable in plain view.  It would be like going to a business meeting in a US boardroom with your zipper undone and your genitals left visible as a result.  Whether or not this is actually the case, I don't know, but again this subject was not treated in Twitchell Hall's book.<br /><br />On the back of my edition of SILENT LANGUAGE it says that this is the book used in Kennedy's NEW FRONTIER to fight the image of the Ugly American then prevalent at the dawn of international mass tourism and the coming transnational age.  Well, time has moved on and I believe that Twitchy's masterpiece has seen better days.  They could do with far more ways to save embarrassment.  Otherwise it's red faces all around and that sinking feeling of having done something wrong, and you don't even know what it is you've done!  Also, I agree, there might be one for people coming to the USA for the first time, perhaps a book of photos showing different people's body language.	2004-08-04

One of the many interesting aspects of DEAF WOMAN OF CANADA is that you'll pick up many fascinating tidbits just by pursuing any one of the more than 300 stories told by the three authors of this book. The book is told with a sprightly touch, perhaps this is the contribution of Angela Stratiy, a well known comedian?<br /><br /> Some of the women portrayed have had pretty much minimal contact with Canada, and some have left the country to better their station and perhaps to get a glimpse of the &quot;deaf utopia&quot; which many deaf people believe lies ahead. Still, despite these reservations, you will enjoy reading this pageant of brave women and you may be tempted to reach out to the deaf ones in your life and try to give them copies of this groundbreaking book. Even if Amazon says it's out of print, you might try, I did and got a copy in the mail straightaway.	2004-08-04

Some of his other books, such as the classic tale of THE SPORTSWRITER, are also good for this exercise, but increasingly as the decades wear on, the stories in this classic collection do it for me, and apparently the people of America think so too, since he contonues to be one of the most successful writers in the USA, not only artistically, but also among the popularity contests too. As Ford has said of his own work, &quot;I feel most comfortable with reduced character loads because then I can concentrate in the way that I'm most inclined, on the interior lives versus the surface lives of people.&quot; Though, in ROCK SPRINGS, just like a deep hot spring, we get a little of both, not only the surface froth, but the deep down satisfying heat that warms the bones.<br /><br /> Some people say Ford is all cold and hard--like a rock. I always ask those nitpickers, Have you driven a Ford lately LOL!	2004-08-04

Let others tend to farflung Kathmandu and the INTO THIN ICE phantasmagoria of Everest and its legends. For the Spring boys, America was more than enough, and boasts some of the more beautiful ranges, peaks and vistas. The quality of the photos varies from page to page but in general, Globe Pequot does a remarkable job in treading the fine line between &quot;vintage&quot; and &quot;contemporary.&quot;<br /><br /> The Spring Brothers never pretended to be working in a fine art context, they are no Ansel Adams, but they were good photojournalists and in their own way, good naturalists too. One day a grateful nation will honor them with a two-sided medal. In the meantime, I advise all who read this message to grab your jar of peanut butter in one hand, this book in the other, and keep your rope in your teeth while you sail through the gleaming images of the North Cascades and other Western &quot;peaks of God.&quot;	2004-08-04

Even then he was so spring chicken, but he kept a hale and happy outlook on life based on his habit of immersing himself in the beautiful waters of America's hot springs (and wells). Now that Jayson has passed on to his happy reward--he died about ten years ago, at a great age--the torch has been passed on to a new generation of hot springs watchers and dippers, and Marjorie Gersh-Young has updated Loam's findings with some new material (lots of it) on her own. It's great and so are the photographs that illustrate every location.<br /><br /> My only dispute is, I don't see why Puerto Rico is in the book, it is a great state (or whatever it is) but it is not in the Northwest by any means! I forget what Jayson Loam had to say about including Puerto Rico among the Northwest region (if any). But in general, Gersh-Young does a splendid job of compiling and sharing the healthful habit of hot springs with a wildly enthusiastic crowd. Did you know that the Native Americans believed that hot springs provide &quot;Big Medicine&quot; direct from the Great Spirit? That's only one of a thousand charming facts you'll learn from this new edition of Loam's magnificent classic reference work. It's a bargain at any price!	2004-08-04

It's made of all scraps of muslin and cotton that were lying around the house. In its durable and roomy pockets, I can always locate the knives, cloths and sprays I need to do any particular job. Those of you who are accustomed to clean in the mude, however, will be disconcerted, that is strictly a no no with Jeff Campbell, who wants you to put on an apron, not just to cover your &quot;block and tackle&quot; but to hold different tools in for ease of use.	2004-08-04

Carlton Stowers, you are a treasure to American writing, and Scream at the Sky is one of the best books you've written.  I'm glad it's finally out in paperback, the wait was a long one for your fans.  This book, as you know, Carlton, describes a series of murders that took place almost a generation ago, and how they had to wait for vengeance and justice for many years, and how it took all the skills of a curious and righteous investigator to bring these murders to justice.<br /><br />Sometimes the legal system has a triumph or two.  And sometimes, as the Spanish say, revenge is a dish best served cold.  They say the dead don't care how long it takes to have their pain acknowledged.  In this harrowing case, filled with suspense and the anguish of the victims' families, we see a tale of American frontier pain and healing that encompassing a range of emotions as wide as the Midwestern sky.  The graves of five women who shouldn't have died, yet did, have a peaceful easy feeling about them today.  Thanks for writing this book, which will not allow their killer to get off scot free.	2004-08-04

Obviously inspired by Stephen Davis' HAMMER OF THE GODS and like journalism, Skipp and Spector whipped up a righteous concoction that just bubbles over with greenish lava froth.  If Satan really had a say in what metal sounds like, do you think He would have permitted those of little brain power to approach his altar?  I don't think so my friends!  The suspense gathers in the final chapters, as the members of the SCREAM (the band, not to be confused with England's PRIMAL SCREAM) approach the coming apocalypse with stiff upper lip and a variety of hallucinatory experience.<br /><br />They used to be the two authors you could really count on to really scare the living daylights out of you, but then something happened--something twisted snd sick--something that broke the bonds which it had been thought no man was born strong enough to put them asunder.  And ever since then, there really hasn't been a good thrill book and we've taken to watching old re-runs of Mister Rogers Neighborhood.

His book THE SILENT MIAOW is one of his very best books, ranking right up there with THE SNOW GOOSE and THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE.  Perhaps this won't make you a cat lover, but it can't hurt, and I guarantee this book will bring a twinkle and maybe a tear to the eye of everyone who has had a cat select them for living with.<br /><br />Whether or not your cat is still alive, or has joined its compadres on the farther shores of RAINBOW BRIDGE, Gallico's book wil make you laugh out loud with the cunning photos of the beautiful cats of the 1960s, cats not too far removed from the cats of today.  There's a little bit of sexism in the text, but that's to be expected, and as we all know, Gallico was actually a writer who thought the world of women, and wrote some amazing women characters from LUDMILA to MRS ARRIS.<br /><br />But the cats are the thing, and a good time is guaranteed by all.	2004-08-03

Yes, this book is a useful corrective for those who think of Baseball as something sweet like lemonade or mother's milk.  Like stand-up comedy, baseball seems to attract humans who are closer to monsters than most regular people, so mixed in with the good guys is a wide variety of cheaters, losers, misanthropes, crooks and brats.  Indeed, no matter what team you root for, you know in your heart they aren't all perfect gentlemen all the time.<br /><br />Ty Cobb alone deserves a whole volume to himself.  Of course for every bigot, etc., there's a Branch Rickey so the whole picture isn't as bleak as Scheinin paints it.  Still, he's a talented writer with a knack for decoupage, and his cut-up stories amuse and provoke.  Batter up!	2004-08-03

If you ask me (of course no one did LOL), this space trilogy of Lewis' would have been a natural, for some of its virtues could be reproduced on film, and perhaps the scope of film could have salvaged some of its weaknesses.<br /><br />As many have noticed, OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET, while giant in conception, is the tightest of the three, and each book becomes more of a baggy monster than the one before.  Dr. Ransom is introduced, and kidnapped to an alien planet where overtones of Miltonic good and evil tickle the fancy of the reader while provoking a great deal of suspense as to his fate, and the fate of the whole universe.<br /><br />Ransom is a fascinating character, scientist blended with he-man and activist--would have been perfect for Sean Connery, say, twenty years ago.<br /><br />In the meantime I urge all readers to give OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET a try, even if you're not into science fiction per se.  It has a great deal to tell us about the world we all still live in right now.	2004-08-03

Like Laura, Katy has a nascent kindness and innocence and a particular way of accepting life around her for what it is, neither good nor bad, just life.  Like Laura, Katy has a strong, direct and healthy relationship with her father, here a small town doctor instead of the homesteader that Pa Ingalls had to be to fit in with his time and place.  But if Ingalls had been a doctor, he might well have been like Dr. Thatcher.  Into their lives comes--the silent boy.<br /><br />The silent boy isn't silent because of shyness, though Katy is especially kind to him because of her innate goodness and feeling that he might respond to her overtures and break through his reserve.  He has some sort of autism which, as Dr. Thatcher observes, is like nature, neither good nor bad, just a fact to be reckoned with.  (Medical science wasn't as developed back then as it is today, as the now grown old Katy realizes from her present day perspective.)<br /><br />It's a touching tale of growing up, and of failure to grow.  And it's also sort of brutal and chilling.	2004-08-03

Stuart Wilde masterfully documents how we can take charge not only of our own lives, but of our etheric bodies; he even hints that we might be able to take charge of the etheric bodies of others, people in our lives, who share our homes and cities.<br /><br />In the future what miracles of understanding may the metaphysics of Stuart Wilde bring us?  The novelist DH Lawrence had some hints of it, and the poets like Yeats and Keats have always been connected to the etheric.  SILENT POWER is a short book, but well worth buying, like all other HAY HOUSE products.  Some of Wilde's Britishisms may grate on the US reader, but he is s skillful stylist and really can sell you on what he's saying.	2004-08-03

SILENT SPRING caused an enormous sensation forty years ago, as it married a highly evolved lyric writing style with a hardcore expose of DDT and other insecticides, a topic which was quite flammable and which provoked the wrath of a host of leading scientists and others invested in the big business of &quot;nature cleansing.&quot; To some, Carson was a renegade, and a retro one at that, a conservative who wished to take the world back to the days before &quot;scientific progress.&quot;<br /><br /> As many conservationists have been called before and since. But conservation does not automatically imply &quot;conservative,&quot; and I think Carson, in her own way, was quite radical in her thinking and in her prognosis for the future. This book is lovely, but to my mind not well served by the insipid introduction by Terry Tempest Williams who is an OK writer but nothing special, particularly when compared to Carson. My advice is, skip the intro, you don't need it, and get right to the heart of the book and the wonderful limpid prose, the most evocative since Thoreau's.	2004-08-03

In truth we have not been able to properly appreciate her until now for no good translations existed of her often interesting work.  Hooray for Serge Gavronsky and his willingness to climb into a Procrustean bed of nails into which few men would have willingly travelled; he is among the most accomplished translators of our day and teaches at Barnard where he is helping to organize the upcoming Zukofsky 100 centennial celebrations.<br /><br />Eh bien, Mansour is a different kettle of poisson entirely than Louis Zukofsky, being much more indebted to Surrealism for one thing, and to ideas of the erotic for another.  In brief, SCREAMS is a fantastic collection of poetry which will make you think at the same time as it will give you the erotic frissons previously only supplied via the rotting teeth of a rabbit.	2004-08-03

The True Story of the Rebirth of Famous Monsters of Filmland	Books	3	8	11	N	N	Great cover, upsetting text	The cover harkens back to the days when we were children and easily scared by the possibility of monsters, and with Forrest Axkerman's magazine FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND, which raised the association (at least to me) that all the monsters one was scared of actually lived in Hollywood, perhaps under the Hollywood sign or in a creepy &quot;modern&quot; house like the one Vincent Price lured his victims into in HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, or the one that Dr. Hodel lived in according to the book BLACK DAHLIA AVENGER. In any case, this magazine made a permanent association between noir LA and the monsters (Frankenstein, Dracula, the Mummy) that permanently roam little boys' nightmares all across the USA.<br /><br /> But, when you read the book, it's a little attenuated, and there's a lot of quarrelling going on between the author, Ray Ferry, and the kindly old Forrest Ackerman, whom we had always conceived of as sort of a kindly old CRYPT KEEPER, one who knew everybody and knew where all the bodies were buried, in an affable way. But now here he is revealed as a terrible megalomaniac and always preening and vain, a Clifton Webb type if you know what I mean.<br /><br /> Anyhow, Ferry's attack on Ackerman is so severe that one longs for a more objective account of their dispute, but in the meantime one reads LIFE IS BUT A SCREAM as one would HOLLYWOOD BABYLON, more in disgust than with joy.	2004-08-03

Well, the same clergyman shows up in this book, impeding Marti Lewis' investigation into the suicide of her great friend, Barry Logan.  Only one woman will listen to Marti's suspicions that Barry's death is really a murder.<br /><br />That woman is Karen Prescott, a policewoman with reasons of her own for listening to the young (high school senior) troubled woman, Marti, a girl who is beginning to think that maybe she's crazy, maybe Barry was secretly suicidal and she just didn't know it.  Together, Karen and Marti form a feminist bond that allows them to rescue the memory of Marti's slain friend.  Violent and kinky, SECRET, SILENT SCREAMS will scare you half to death before releasing you into a pool of ectoplasm on the floor.

Don't let that happen to you, and get yourself a copy of &quot;Scream Savers,&quot; which is a Bible-based guide to keeping your cool even when your kids get out of hand.<br /><br /> Whatever you do, spare your children from your own neuroses, especially if they are the fatal kind in which the chikdren are not seen as loving dependents, but as enemies of the stay-at-home mother. Karol Ladd, who has written over thirty books, and spoken often to many Texas and national women's groups, can show you the way.

Once you've read MANHUNTER you'll want to find out more about LeCLERCQ and his obsession with killers of the past and present.  PRIMAL SCREAM completes his voyage into the past, with the violent death of his own daughter a throbbing memory inside his brain compelling him to lead an investigation into a possible copy cat killer.  There's even a young girl called KATT, as if to hint at a COPY KATT!!<br /><br />Is Slade even a real person?  I wonder if it isn't the pseudonym behind which a variety or people can make their feelings known on the topic of serial killing.  One thing this putative syndicate could do to raise the standard of their books is to get some more imaginative titles.  For example, HEADHUNTER and PRIMAL SCREAM.  There must be dozens of books and movies already with those names.  PRIMAL SCREAM is a psychoanalutical movement, for goodness sakes.  The way Slade writes you'd think it was a heavy metal band.<br /><br />Canada must be proud that for a country with not very many people (compared to the US) Slade has populated it with mad maniacs and determined grim-jawed cops in pursuit.  And plenty of victims whose blood is rich with riboflavin.	2004-08-03

I never found any of Renee's quirks very amusing, the country songs she wrote weren't funny as they were supposed to be, indeed I kind of had the feeling Michael Kun isn't much of a country fan and has a disrespect for this kind of music.<br /><br />Also not funny was Renee's habit, which her husband Ham borrows from her via osmosis, of peppering her conversation with numbered lists.  So in short order A) not as good as the last book which B) wasn't nearly as good as Kun's novel A THOUSAND BENJAMINS, C) much too long, D) a few mile chuckles and E) needed an editor before it got to the reader.  But what do I know, 15 other Amazon readers think it's the best thing since Zuleika Dobson.  So judge for yourself, as ultimately you will.	2004-08-02

Who knows the truth about the enigmatic, &quot;silent woman&quot; of the book's title? No one, perhaps, not even that woman herself, who was mixed up about the kind of poetry she wanted to write and about her destiny, even her citizenship was fluid. Although Janet Malcolm wrote this book to prick holes in biographies of Plath that seek to canonize her, she really sinks her teeth into Anne Stevenson's repellent and semi-authorized biography &quot;Bitter Fame,&quot; which on its publication was widely seen as the Hughes' camo corrective to Plath hagiography. Malcolm finds out exactly what information Olwyn Hughes was willing to share with Anne Stevenson, and which slant was verboten, and the whole shameful affair, while not the superb intellectual condemnation of biography that Malcolm thinks it is, is stimulating on nearly every page. And in the process Malcolm tracks down and interviews some important people in the Hughes/Plath saga, and even makes room for Plath's most important critic, the UK theorist Jacqueline Rose. All in all, it's a mixed bag, and Malcolm is pretty repellent, but oddly enough it's exciting from start to finish.	2004-08-02

The pain medicine that should have been dulling the pain just didn't kick in this time.  Since 1990, she has been gathering her strength back, just taking it easy and resting, and also organizing and fighting back, showing that for some victims of traumatic stress, activism may be the answer to dealing with the insecurities of living through a frightful experience.  Now naturally what we all want to know is, Jeannette, this was terrible, but tell me, could it happen to me, too?<br /><br />What you find out will chill the marrow of your bones!  Warning, this is not a book for those who are nervous about doctors, nurses, hospitals, losing control, or pain.<br /><br />But for everyone else, it is an eye-opener, like something out of Edgar Allan Poe.

This is far from the truth.  There have always been outstanding pilots in the Navy, and now there is a cookie cutter system that claims that it can make aces out of any greenhorn who enlists.  I'd recommend SCREAM OF EAGLES for its multiple stories of bravery and courage in a difficult time for the USA, but it's a little over the top when it comes to how great the school is.<br /><br />There's a big IF attached to the story, and to sum it up in words even a NCO could understand, if the pilots of the US Navy were so awful during the VietNam conflict, why were they given the preponderance of medals issued for extraordinary service?  That's a mighty big if, if you ask this flight fan.<br /><br />You might well rent the film TOP GUN to go along with this, experience the hype from all angles.	2004-07-30

Bobby G was nearly 30 when the band really started to go places, and he had a maturity even then that saw them in good stead even in the days of SONIC FLOWER GROOVE.<br /><br />The graininess of some of the photos is appropriate for a band that didn't care about the dominant style but made their own style, even luring Kate Moss into the madness, as she played Nancy Sinatra in a remake of the old Hazelwood classic SOME VELVET MORNING (when I'm straight, ha).<br /><br />All in all, it's a book you may want to ownif you feel about Bobby Gillespie & Co. the way I do.

In this series Christ also has the power to rid the world of werewovles, piranha fish, or serial killers.<br /><br /> I wonder what happened to Pastor Randall, he was so reliable, he not only did the great &quot;Heebie Jeebies&quot; books, but he also had a great series called, &quot;The Misadventures of Willien Plunkett&quot; which wasn't so Stephen King and was more pleasant to read and preached the virtues of Christ even more wholeheartedlty.

Some of it is very clever, and the references to pop culture still work, but more might have been made of the human and emotional back stories of the main characters.  Neve Campbell's character, for example, doesn't have the emotional resonance years later that (to take up a similar example in a different film genre) Molly Ringwald displayed in her movies for John Hughes.<br /><br />I look forward to CURSED, the new collaboration between Kevin Williamson and Wes Crave, though the rumors of the re-shoots and re-takes, actors being fired, etc., and dissatisfied test audiences, make one wonder if it won't be more like KILLING MRS TINGLE than SCREAM.

The story has some outrageous twists and turns, but when you've got a plot that intertwines the lives of the gods with a race of vampires called &quot;The Dark Ones,&quot; you know from the beginning you're in for a long, out of this world, ride. Jason Fury has written some interesting books. In factv no two of his books are the same, and no matter what pseudonym he uses, I have found that he has an incomparable imagination and a true enthusiast's knowledge of American and world history. Just the right balance of research and intuition propels his stories from one wild romp to another.<br /><br /> Don't let the title fool you, &quot;Screams of Pan&quot; isn't an especially punk book. It's more like a modern version of the old 20s and 30s classic by Thorne Smith, with more explicit gay sex added. Go for it!	2004-07-29

She is very good at describing and clarifying how narrow our view of Munch has been; we treat him like some kind of haunted Poe or Klimt-like figure, even though the majority of his work has a golden glow like a fairy tale, and is not horror stricken as the early work we associate him with.  His painting is smooth and delicate, reminding me of the clear tempera colors we used to paint Easter Eggs with when we were small children, and there is something of the innocence of a child about his mature work; it is as though having undergone the darkness early on, his spirit was allowed to soar later on.  Or compare Shakespeare's late romances like The Winter's Tale or Cymbeline with the earlier and heavier problem plays (Measure for Measure) etc.  In any case, brava to Elizabeth Preliger for her much needed corrective.	2004-07-27

Here Clayton Eshleman, the great translator of Artaud, assisted by another less successful translator, brings us a number of the more arcane texts. This book doesn't have everything in it, but what it does have is choice. You have to hand it to Exact Change. They may not do everything they do for the first time (although there are many texts in WATCHFIENDS previously available only in French, if at all) but when they do something, baby, it stays &quot;done.&quot;<br /><br /> Ideally this book would come with a DVD in which we could watch the recorded performances of the living Artaud, for even though he was not, as an actor, the very best exemplum of his theories, some memorable glimpses of him linger on via film.	2004-07-27

Once again all the familoar characters in this long-running series return both to aid Savannah and to complicate her quest to trap a killer. I wonder if, when the identity of G. A. McKevett is revealed, we will all sigh in recognition or will it turn out to be someone we never heard of before, just someone who was good at copying the outwards signs of Sue Grafton and Marcia Muller's sprightly writing styles? My cousin has a theory and she's torn out big letters from the newspaper, like a ransom note, that spell out the letters of McKevett's name, and she keeps switching the letters back and forth on her old formica kitchen table, a cup of strong coffee close at hand, trying to find the anagram hat would reveal the &quot;real name&quot; of her favorite author. She says this is how she used to solve all the JUMBLE puzzles in the old Daily News.<br /><br /> We pass along the volumes of Savannah Reid's cases like old friends, me and her, savoring the intimate details of her life, almost as if she were a real person, and greater praise I can give to no author, pseudonymous or no.	2004-07-27

Now Gregory Dicum has compiled a wonderful book using my grandma's philosophy, and illustrated it with a wealth of satellite and other aerial photographs.<br /><br /> It's comforting to think that so much of the USA has been mapped out by surveyors for us to enjoy, and not a little worrisome that foreign terrorists probably know all areas as well as we do. Dicum explains that the urge to see things from above is a longstanding one in the brain of man, and while we can make out an ugly patch here or there (strip mining, etc) such photos have an eerie, depopulated beauty much like that of the Australia Nevil Shute wrote about in ON THE BEACH.<br /><br /> Dicum writes wonderfully and concisely.

The story is a little bleak, however, and kids don't seem to enjoy realizing that their world, at first so lovely, is bound to become a slum and an overcrowded prison of tormented souls.  Why so ugly, Miss Baker?  When you look through your window, do you just see the grimy side of life?  Cheer up, and if you can't cheer up, maybe you could write some books for adults, who have the forebearance to hear your wailings of doom.<br /><br />What's great about the book is the animation of the child, who grows up to be a man, and yet he plunges himself into ruin by siring a hostage to fortune.  The story has a sense of balance which approaches the Shakespearean but, as I say, may be too heavy for most kids.  Exposure to WINDOW will cause your children to grow up into neo-Goths, not that that is such a bad thing.	2004-07-27

You see it in the book, you'll see it on your keyboard (or on your screen, or in the worst case scenario, it's part of the hardware on your drive).<br /><br /> Ha ha, so now if you have that embarrassing porn &quot;someone else&quot; must have downloaded onto your computer, here's one way to wash that man right out of your hair, as it were.

She won the Edgar Award an incredible four times, but her greatest happiness came from the letters and reviews her readers gave her, for there are many readers whose favorite writer will always be Joan Lowery Nixon.<br /><br />DON'T SCREAM is a good one by her, although most of her books are good even if she did turn them out at a rate of up to 8 a year.  In DON'T SCREAM, the action turns on one ordianry gir;'s suspicions that one of two new boys in town is secretly evil, and Joan ratchets up the suspense so we never know which one it is.  Every time you think it's one, she weakens your suspicion by making the other one act in an ambiguous way.  It's a seesaw ride of brilliant suspense, and the heroine, Jessica, reacts to this unusual situation just as many another small town girl would do, she keeps her doubts to herself, failing to confide in authority until it's almost too late.<br /><br />It's set in Texas, so there are a lot of regionalisms, for this is an area that Joan knew well, and loved.<br /><br />It's been a year now, and oh, how bitter the loss!

Yes, he invests a lot in each story, and yes, this involves sometimes moving his mouth a little too far away from the mic, but not a word, not a syllable is lost and so much is gained. So much terror, so much suspense, so much authenticity. You'll feel like you're living in a series of demented worlds that could only have sprung from the demoniac mind of Harlan Ellison. I think it's a nice touch that the manufacturers were able to persuade the busiest man in the writing business to drop what he was doing and revisit his classics.

His friends were legion, and so many of them seemed to have kept his letters you sense that even then, they knew they were holding on to something special, even if mass fame wouldn't come to CB for another decade or more.<br /><br />During the time Bukowski was also writing numerous letters to the Beat poet Sheri Martinelli, who had also been the long distance muse to Ezra Pound when he was locked away safely in St Elizabeth's in Washington DC.

Arnold's dream of a scream loud enough to wake up an entire household clues us in immediately that he is a sensitive, caring man, with definite issues regarding boundaries.  No wonder he then focusses on the famous Munch painting in which space and time are caught up and expressed in a soundless scream, a visceral pain of being that transcends the visual and becomes auditory, or not quite.<br /><br />Many professors have written reams about Munch's SCREAM, but few have managed to bring it into the mainstream of Western intellectual culture.

The evidence for thinking so is flimsy at best, and Ms. Strong probably knows this, and still she decides oh, well, she's dead and won't be complaining if I brand her a cutter in my book, it will sell a few more copies (all the promo material features Diana's name prominently).

Kay was an ordinary English girl until she realized that, after a successful career as a dramatist for the early days of TV in England for the BBC, she was really the reincarnation, or avatar, of James IV, the doomed king of Scotland who died in battle in 1513 (at Flodden Field).  Suddenly Ada realized that this basically iis why she had an aversion to England, and also why she yearned for a black and white sweater (because she had worn one while she, I mean he, was James IV) and many other mysteries of her life became explainable.<br /><br />Also, why her marriage was so short-lived--her husband wanted to marry in August, and she didn't because seasonal depression always overtook her in August (because James IV had died then) and her husband insisted and the wedding was just horrid for everyone concerned.<br /><br />She began reading histories of Scotland of this turbulent period, and everytime she read something that rang a bell, she'd feel good, but the other histories that were wrong, the text became unreadable to Ada.  She began drawing obsessively--a dark tree trying desperately to suck up water from stony ground.<br /><br />This book proves that, if you thought of something weird, someone has been there before you.

At heart Joan Rivers is a down-to-earth woman with a writing skill that rivals that of the late Erma Bombeck.<br /><br />By the time you are done, you will have experienced extreme contractions--but of laughter, not pain!	2004-07-26

Even with old hands Richard Howard and Kay Ryan vetting the manuscript, the sparkle of Lindsay's previous book got dropped off along the way, like laundry, and never returned, like luggage lost at an airport. She is however always trying: &quot;Unlike tadpoles, big-eyed and wiggly,/ or bat babies with snub puppy faces/ and skins of kelpless velvet, the island was born/ red-faced and belching, hunchbacked, shifty,/ sharp, and hot all over.&quot;<br /><br /> These are the opening lines of NEOTENY, and many will enjoy the way Linsday is able to incorporate ideas and tropes from science and use them to give poetry some apparently needed depth, but others will object that this is not incorporation but an increasingly wanton scheme of interior decoration. We enjoyed these debates during the 1930s and 1940s as poets like Day Lewis and Auden attempted to bring the facts of science into the folds of the poem, and here the experiment has reached a sort of terminal absurdity.	2004-07-26

That book is The Primal Scream, by the misunderstood psychologist Arthur Janov.<br /><br />Many people thought that, because of his famous intervention with John Lennon and Yoko Ono in the late 1960s, that the good doctor was nothing more than a celebrity chaser, and that listening to Lennon's LP with MOTHER and WORKING CLASS HERO on it (among many other Primal-Therapy inspired tracks) would amount to a course in the same material without the bother of therapy.  To be fair, Lennon himself helped popularize this theory, and I think Janov's reputation suffered a little from it, as though he were nothing more than a fly-by-night rock star psychologist, like the man who said he cured Brian Wilson by helping him find his way back to his inner sandbox.<br /><br />But Janov is a good writer and a lot of his conclusions will help heal souls today, 25 years after Lennon's death and 35 years after its original publication.	2004-07-26

Nineteen when Woiwode encounters him in a drama about disabled folk, the blind, De Niro eventually becomes one of Woiwode's very closest friends. One dramatic episode details the renting of a U-Haul to meet De Niro Senior at the docks, where, after some time in France, he has arrived with a cabinful of oil paintings, some of them comically oversized.<br /><br />  Woiwode also spends some time detailing the genesis of his own writing career. He seems to have been the golden boy at Urbana, then in New York the urbane and married William Maxwell took him in under his wing and made sure his stories were published in THE NEW YORKER and that his first novel was picked up by FARRAR STRAUS & GIROUX. Every boy should have a good pal like De Niro and a good older gentleman friend like Maxwell--and the talent, of course, to back it up.<br /><br />  Woiwode must be overstating things when. among the list of the other famous writers Maxwell worked with, he includes Frank O'Hara. Could he be mixing him up with John O'Hara here? Many do who haven't read either.	2004-07-25

He is able to take the elements that made Dracula or The Invisible Man so memorable, and to isolate them, then shake them up in a box with the lore of the man from Baker Street, and the graphic novel was never the same again.<br /><br /> I prefer &quot;Scarlet in Gaslight&quot; to &quot;A Case of Blind Fear,&quot; but probably only because the setup of Dracula is so much more familiar to me than the Wells novel, and thus I don't have to search the far corners of my brain to compare Powell's innovations to the UR-text he's working from. But in truth, A CASE OF BLIND FEAR is actually more original and startling than SCARLET in many ways, foregrounding the wealth of invention Powell has at his fingertips.<br /><br /> The reproduction of the comic panels is another matter however, and it is here that the book falls down and Moonstone Books should rethink their policy. The book is simply too small and in some cases you can hardly read the dialogue without a magnnifying glass--just like Sherlock Holmes. But others will have sharper eyes than I, and I guarantee you'll find this book well worth the investment you make. &quot;The hunt is afoot!&quot;	2004-07-25

Longfellow's book Tales of a Wayside Inn is given a dramatic reading here, for McClatchy selects not only the best of the Tales but also tries to find room for the body and the heart in all its different avatars.  His excerpts from Michael Angelo are, as well, in tune with what we now know and feel about Michelangelo in the present time of the early 21st century, that he was as great a poet as he was a painter and sculptor, and probably a gay man to boot.  Poems like Longfellow's HIAWATHA and EVANGELINE are sensitively edited to bring forward their multicultural and ecological interests.  All in all, Longfellow may be the most forwardlooking of all the poets of 19th century USA, and that's a strong statement considering we are putting him ahead of (among others) Emerson, Poe, Dickinson, Whitman, Very, and Melville.	2004-07-25

Blakelock, an American Painter	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Art and history on a collision course with madness	Blakelock's paintings of moonlight have the weird, dissociated values of gesture that we associate with a much later generation of American painters (e.g. Pollock or De Kooning), at least according to controversialist Glyn Vincent, who notes that Blakelock, after a traditional and demure career as a minor artist of the Hudson River Valley school, made a great breakthrough as the 1870s turned into the 1880s. Unfortunately, insanity came along for the ride, and before long Blakelock was clapped into a mental home even as the prices of his completed paintings soared in a seller's market in the ateliers of the corrupt NY art world.<br /><br /> Enter the real villain of the story, a seductive and beautiful &quot;philanthropist&quot; who, under cover of helping Blakelock's worthy, long suffering and penurious family, worked to rescue him from the asylum but secretly to transfer the title of all his work to her name. You won't believe that one woman was capable of so much skullduggery, but such is the gift of Glyn Vincent's writing that you ALMOST do. Vincent is wonderfully accomplished and always looks to contextualize the individual incidents and privations of his characters inside a wider social sphere, which is much appreciated. Once you start reading THE UNKNOWN NIGHT, its story will never leave your soul.	2004-07-25

Hooray for Milligan for bringing us actual, literal change in panel after panel, page after page, and long live our &quot;man on the inside,&quot; Shade.	2004-07-25

What with the sorry state of our nation, and the multi-national corporations for which it acts as shill and alibi, we need Bill Hicks' so-called &quot;comedy&quot; more than ever before.<br /><br /> He saw so clearly how marketing and the transmedia have turned a once-proud country into a pack of Alpha-male dogs with no other idea in our heads but to make as much money as possible while dealing to the rest of the world the maximum amount of death without transfiguration. Cynthia True pursues some of Hicks' ideas, but often she falters before drawing them out to their obvious conclusion, preferring to pepper her prose with name-dropping and a continual barrage of travel and medical ills. In the process, something of Hicks' humanity is lost, but in other areas she is extremely competent and thus, I would recommend this book to anyone in search of a new hero. (Oh, how Hicks would have laughed to hear himself deescribed that way.)	2004-07-24

She is lovely and sometimes outrageous, but often so quiet you suspect she's covering up a crime so awful even she is frightened of her own &quot;reveal.&quot; It's a story of publicity and privacy, the firestorm of war and the extreme hush of the sex act, of two men who come close to respect as they grip themselves over the taut body of the woman who tempts them both . . .

That book was called, &quot;We Are The Stories We Tell&quot; and it was quite a popular book of its kind. Now, 14 years later, a sequel creeps in with a different cast of characters. It's funny whose writing is now &quot;out&quot; who was once &quot;in.&quot; Martin seems determined to give us a different kind of E-Ticket ride this time around, but some of her old favorites have made it back into this book as well. Thus for exanple, both books feature the ubiquitous Joyce Carol Oates, as well as the slightly tarnished Bobbie Ann Mason and Canada's Alice Munro, whose stature has been firmly cemented in the years since WATSWT #1 was launched.<br /><br /> In addition, Ann Beattie is here, even if we haven't heard that much from Ms. Beattie since the glory days of &quot;dirty realism.&quot; Her star has been supplanted by younger others, including ZZ Packer, the Bay Area wunderkind who went to Stanford as a Stegner Fellow, and Marisa Silver, whose stories of Hollywood lives are as poignant as anything written by Nathanael West or Dawn Powell. In addition, a fair number of more experimental writers have crept in, thus no more Flannery O'Connor, instead we have the wonderful Amy Hempel and the satisfactory Lynn Freed. The turnover is just beginning. But a woman reviewer might have other things to say, and different social significances to be noted.	2004-07-23

I have a feeling that readers heavily steeped in Civil War action will not be as charitable to this biography as others, because in places the narrative seems to come off the rails in a noticeable way.  Perhaps our expectations are too high, for we have been waiting for a masterful view of Grant's actions, policies and inner thoughts during the years of the War.  Oddly enough, in my opinion, Grant's inner life during the previous Mexican War is something that Smith has more of a handle on, and this section is written quite well.  If only all of the book had been like this!<br /><br />However, Smith recoups with a thorough account of Grant's presidency and writing career, if you can call it that, and yet what else is one to call a spate of writing that produced the magnificent PERSONAL MEMOIRS?  We revere Grant for his bravery not only on the field of battle but in the shadows of private life, in adversity he showed his truest colors.  Thanks to Jean Edward Smith, we now have a convincing overview of a roundly emulable man.	2004-07-23

Who was Ahab?  You might well ask, he was a fictional character in Herman Melville's American Renaissance masterpiece Moby-Dick or The Whale, and his name has become a watchword for monomania and for obsession, particularly when lived in an all-male world of men and their pursuits.  His quest to kill the white whale forms the backbone of Melville's Novel, and in Jeter Naslund's epic tale, it forms a significant subplot.<br /><br />You won't believe the adventures young UNA gets up to when, disguised as a teenaged boy, she sets sail on a whaler herself and becomes entangled, like Cukor's film of SYLVIA SCARLETT, with two very different men.  Okay, it's a little farfetched, but it's still very romantic, and Una has a poetic voice that will remind readers with long memories of the late Elinor Wylie.  Only you can tell if she was able to extend the captivating voice to cover the length of so many pages (nearly as long as Clinton's memoirs!) or if, somewhere along the way, Una becomes as shadowy as her elderly husband's plans for vengeance.  In the meantime, it's a good romance for people with lots of time, and perhaps the perfect summer book for folks vacationing in Nantucket or Martha's Vineyard.<br /><br />No matter which, you'll enjoy it, it's a real page turner, at least for some of it.	2004-07-23

Heretofore such records were only vaguely guessed at. Raskin uses the new information wisely, much as Diane Wood Middlebrook was able to use the testimony of Anne Sexton's analyst when writing her biography some years ago of Sexton.<br /><br /> There are a few places where I disagree with Raskin's implications. Regarding the now-notorious &quot;6 Gallery&quot; reading in San Francisco where AG premiered HOWL, Raskin states, &quot;Many of the notable local poets--Robert Duncan, Jack Spicer, and Robin Blaser--were not included in the program, and so the gala event at the Six Gallery was a cultural snub of sorts to the poets who thought they embodied the best of Bay Area poetry.&quot; This is disingenuous, as Raskin knows: neither Duncan, Spicer nor Blaser was living in the Bay Area at the time. Duncan was at Black Mountain College, Spicer living in NYC, and Blaser in Boston. How is this a &quot;cultural snub&quot;? It's also a shame that such a classy book should be spoiled by the numerous typos. On one page alone the names of two poets who spoke at Ginsberg's funeral are mis=spelled, so we have Andrew &quot;Shilling&quot; instead of Schelling, and Robert &quot;Haas&quot; instead of Hass. They show up in the index thus abused as well.	2004-07-23

The banter between his hero and his attractive co-workers is always funny, reminding me of early episodes of the US cult hit MOONLIGHTING, before it lost its cutting edge and went soft.<br /><br /> I suppose that's the danger Christopher Brookmyre faces, because along with his current adulation a little bit of softening is bound to creep in like termites in an old house. Never mind, soon he'll be satirizing himself . . . &quot;quite ugly one morning.&quot;	2004-07-23

But such goings on cannot be permitted.  There are a few good funny lines here and there, but nowhere near 20 dollars worth so itr's a case for the Better Business Bureau too as well as for the ASPCA.  I also liked the Chicago interlude, though the means we took to get there were as far-fetched as the flying carpet that transports Sabu through the skies in the old Thief of Bagdad.<br /><br />Give it up and go back to what you do best.

This book is much better than its reviews would suggest and is indeed essnetial reading for anyone concerned with nutrition and ways to eat more healthily in today's toxic world. We lve surrounded by poison. Or maybe a better way to put it is, there are a few wet green grapes in the barbed wire or today's fast-food paradise. And thia book teaches you how to go for the gusto.<br /><br /> Rodwell Williams is a very good writer and I wish someday she's write a book of recipes based on her background in nutrition, which is unusually extensive. Some people just like to cirticize because she uses findimgs from the 80s, but they forget the 80s were a great time for discoveries in this vital field, and that a lot of the information, although supplemented since, has not been bettered nor contradicted. So, the next time you're standing there next to your stove with a handful of radishes in one hand and a pound of arugula in the other, head for this book and turn it to the chapter on vitamins to discover what you're missing; then add it; then you'll be in fitness heaven. As for the so-called &quot;therapeutic&quot; benefits of this book, I wish there was a TV show like The Apprentice, but instead of Donald Trump there would be Sue Rodwell Williams giving us the benefit of her advice, and as an added bonus, there wouldn't be that constant refrain (so hurtful) of &quot;You're fired&quot; either.	2004-07-23

On any given day you will see the children streaming from music school or music camp, clutching this durable Dover book to their chests while the music in their heads strums through their fingers, and conjures up a jolly Christmas to come.  The sadder aspects of Christmas are not forgotten either, and the minor keys in which some holiday gems are written (e.g., O Little Town of Bethlehem which, even if not in a minor key borrows some mournful tones from Russian and Jewish music) will provide an adult counterpoint to the brainless holiday rock music that's a staple to US top 40 radio around this time of year.<br /><br />Give your kids (or nephews and nieces) this book of Christmas songs.

After all, polo is an abstruse sport, filled with arcane rules few understand. The rest of us can enjoy the novel for what it is, a fairly difficult novel about rootlessness and exile in 20th Century America. The hero, Fabian, takes his name from the socialist society of turn of the century England, and uses a trailer to transport himself and his animal across the nation. It's his &quot;little home on wheels,&quot; as he calls it. Fabian is a suitable symbol for our deracinated society, in which nobody really has a home because of the topsy-turvy state of the planet.<br /><br /> As for the (numerous) sex scenes, Kosinski does a great job at making us care for the emotions behind the sex acts, not just the bodies, but the hearts and minds of his players. The book is called &quot;Passion Play&quot; not just because of the polo scenes, but because in this book JK hoped to expose the open nerves of his hero with the precision of a master surgeon, each vein and ambition caught and held deftly by a scalpel of precise imagery and language. Who would have thought that he didn't know how to speak a word of English until age eight? Play on, &quot;PASSION PLAY.&quot;	2004-07-23

The author makes no strong claims to having written an important book. His introduction is so modest that you get the impression writing this book is a way to fill up the empty hours of his retirement. (He is 75, so no spring chicken.) That said, GEORGE GERSHWIN is scrupulously researched and makes claims for Gershwin's continuing stature within the field of music that pique the interest. Hyland's style isn't really a style per se, but it's serviceable and only gets in the way of his meaning occasionally.<br /><br /> I found Hyland's animus against the film star Paulette Goddard a bit puzzling. Is it because she was married (to Charlie Chaplin) when she conducted her affair with Gershwin? Hyland says that she is &quot;not a reliable witness&quot; as though this were a damning thing to say about someone's character (perhaps for a biographer it is, but for the general public? I don't know). She seems to have brought Gershwin some sexual pleasure and distraction from the illness that eventually killed him, but to hear Hyland tell it, it's almost as though her lying about dates done him in. Give a girl a break, William Hyland! Other than this lack of gallantry I enjoyed the book from beginning to end.	2004-07-20

Kiraly shares with Joe Eszterhas some of the same beliefs in the goodness of America, a land where you can make as much money and accure as much cultural capital as you possibly can.  And Kiraly has had it all.  In CHAMPIONSHIP VOLLEYBALL it is like having a coach over your shoulder at all times, a coach who is going to teach you to block, bump, pass and spike step by step, with careful diagrams and a consistent &quot;you can do it&quot; attitude.<br />Funny to think that a childhood cartwheel, in which he injured his hand badly by thrusting it into a gopher hole, led to a general lengthening of one arm and corresponding flexibility, which saw him in good stead when he became a teen.  Kiraly proves over and over that when life hands you (or your parents) a lemon, you can turn around and make the finest lemonade from it.<br />One handy chart included in both editions of KK's CV is the list of VOLLEYBALL MILESTONES at the end.	2004-07-19

The women she cites are drawn from her history-making book ALL THE WOMEN IN THE BIBLE, which pinned down approximately 310 women named and un-named in the Bible.  In the WISDOM book, Miss Deen picked about 50 of them, usually the wiser ones but not entirely.  Deborah, who is one of my favorites as well as being the inspiration for film star Deborah Kerr's first name, comes off the best.<br />Speaking of films, I wonder if Miss Deen had any acquaintance with the late Margaret Mitchell, because many of Deen's pithier recaps of Bible heroines might have come right from the pages of GONE WITH THE WIND.  The two authors have a lot in common, and I'm sure the people at HarperCollins are happy about that fact.  Prospective mothers also might find this book a source of some interesting and neglected names for their blessed events to be.<br />If you like a Texas twang served up with your theological speculations, this is the book for you.

She is the mistress of Gothic suspense, which comes entangled in her enjambments like Rapunzel the thorns in her hair.<br /><br />There are many fine poems in this volume, itself a convincing sequel to an earlier book \\"The Master Letters\\" which borrowed from Emily Dickinson in much the same way as the present book uses tropes of blackness, suffering and negritude.  One of the best is \\"Morgue Near Heaven,\\" a clever kind of literary form one could call a \\"pre-elegy.\\"  In \\"Morgue Near Heaven,\\" the elderly poet Stanley Kunitz is given his proper due while he is still with us--though very old of course, and infirm.  \\"I've never really seen/ A death mask of his face,/ /Because, techincally, he's never been/ That way, not yet.\\"  The small chill of those final words, \\"not yet\\" is worth waiting for, and there are promises to come.  \\"Maybe I'll inherit all the Teutonic sentences/ He knows by heart, or all the same,/ The grammar of the night, the factory/ Of slandering and fame.\\"  It's a nice tribute to a distinguished mentor.  (Kunitz, of course, wrote \\"Father and Son\\" and many other poems of note.)	2004-07-19

Maybe you've heard of Goulding, and certainly you've seen a number of his films, but never before has anyone been abel to put together all the facts, do all the right research, and conduct an amazing number of pertinent interviews to produce such a stunning result.<br />If Goulding had only directed &quot;Dark Victory&quot; and &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; his place in film history would be assured--and even higher.  It's his lesser efforts and indeed misses that have complicated his stature.<br />Goulding's work in music could be a book all of its own.  I had no idea he wrote the music for so many films, including such notable songs as &quot;Love Your Magic Spell is Everywhere&quot; (from The Trespasser), &quot;Mam'selle&quot; (from The Razor's Edge) and &quot;Dodie&quot; (from &quot;Teenage Rebel&quot;).  Given all that you'd think he'd be a natural filming a musical, but Kennedy's account of &quot;Friendly Island&quot; a/k/a &quot;Down Among the Sheltering Palms&quot; gives one pause.<br />Now I'm dying to see &quot;We are Not Alone&quot; and &quot;The Constant Nymph.&quot;  I've read both novels but are these films on DVD?  Sounds like not.  Oh well, something to look forward to.  Thanks, Matthew Kennedy.  You do San Francisco proud!	2004-07-17

I think frankly the collections CW published while he was alive have a bit more authenticity, even if the biography explains how different editors and publishers chose the arrangement of those books even more than did Woolrich himself.  And then again Nevins really wants to sell the \\"Noir\\" angle on Woolrich, and thus downplaying the gay pastoral fabulist of something like \\"Stranglers Serenade\\" or \\"The Black Path of Fear.\\"  Indeed no one but a gay man could have written the famous \\"Black Curtain,\\" nor the fragment of a novel that Lawrence Block later completed, \\"Into the Night.\\"  However that's just my two cents and reflects probably my own dark vision as much as anything of Woolrich's.<br />\\"Night and Fear\\" collects a whole bunch of pulp fiction that truly has some serious ups and downs, but when Woolrich is hot (as in \\"Cigarette\\" or the aforementioned \\"New York Blues\\", he is smoking!  Good work to all concerned.  I hope there are further collections, for the barrel has been bottomed out yet.	2004-07-17

That New York's Akashic Books has had the wisdom to publish these stories by Derek McCormack is a happy gift to US readers.  He has been a national treasure of Canada for some years, and now he can be ours as well.  The stories are sharply told, fables crafted to within an inch of their lives by a stylist so obsessive he reminds me of one of those crotchety perfectionists who builds the London Bridge out of toothpicks over sixty years.  At least it's a bridge.<br />At any rate, McCormack's writing is so precise it burns a hole right through you.  These little sentences, pared down to stilettos that pierce the heart.<br />When I compile a short list of the writers whose work means most to me, he's usually on the list someplace.  The stories in &quot;Wish Book&quot; are uniformly nasty but varied otherwise in tone, intention, mood.  The older stories, from &quot;Dark Rides,&quot; have I think a bit more melancholy and a different conception of formal experiment.  Which you will prefer depends on your mood.  As the French say, especially in Canada, &quot;c'est bonnet blanc et blanc bonnet&quot; (half a dozen of one, six of the other).  I wish Amazon gave out more stars than 5.  Let's see.	2004-07-16

The motorcade was proceeding slowly enough that I could see his face and I knew he was waving right at me.  It was extraordinary because up until then, I didn't believe the type about Clinton's \\"charisma.\\"  But after that, I was a believer.<br />I believe that charisma works both ways and it could turn people off, and certainly there are many Americans who despise Clinton and everything he stands for, to a degree unprecedented in history.  I think that even Hitler had fewer haters.  Reading \\"My Life\\" isn't the same dynamic experience as laying eyes on Clinton, but for some it will arouse the same vociferous passion, and they will find the lie on every page.  For me, I wish the book was a little livelier, and that the hand of the \\"editors\\" wasn't all over the place, puffing and fluffing down the prose style into mealy-mouthed Southern platitudes, but that is what makes political memoirs in our day.  Bill Clinton was run out of office by a mob and by his own unruly member, but those of us who were proud to have him as our President will enjoy this book and will yearn for the days when he ruled the world.	2004-07-16

Why is Ann Patchett being criticized for wanting to make money out of her friendship with the late Lucy Grealy?  It isn't hard to believe that Lucy had a lot of secrets, she hinted as much in her own autobiography, and if after her death Ann Patchett chooses to spill all of them, Lucy can no longer be hurt.  It isn't as if Ann had published this book while Lucy was still alive.  As for her decision to keep all the money herself, well, most writers get to keep whatever money they make.  They are not guilt tripped into having to donate large sums to cancer organizations.  Ann should not have to forfeit all respect or credibility just because she is keeping the money she earned with her book.  And who knows, maybe she is making a private donation, the way Frank Sinatra is said to have kept all his charitable donations a secret.  Let us assume that Ann's own conscience is clear about her moral position in writing and publishing (and profiting from) this memoir, and then we can start at ground zero to begin assessing if &quot;Truth &amp; Beauty: A Friednship&quot; is or is not a good book.	2004-07-16

He gives us priceless glimpses of the films that never got made, as well as a knowing eye at the ones that did.  For an Englishman, his takes on US pop culture are well-researched and never get in the way of his critical insights.<br />His comments on Marty Melcher, the bete noire of the Day story, are remarkably even-tempered, and his take on Day's practice of Christian Science ditto.  He's got an opinion on everything, but he's agreeable enough to make you wish the book was twice as long as it is.<br />The comical thing is that in every paragraph, Braun somehow makes a British connection whenever possible; sometimes it seems like he's pulling them out of his arse as he goes along.  Who would have guessed that Doris, the all-American girl, had less than six degrees of separation to so many UK institutions?  She starred with British born Cary Grant in THAT TOUCH OF MINK, Rex Harrison in MIDNIGHT LACE and with Richard Harris in CAPRICE.  (Harris, mysteriously, refused to speak to Braun without a signed release from Doris Day.)  The sequences of the Hitchcock film, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, that were filmed in London, get special attention here.  Erix Braun compares Doris Day to the British musical comedy stars Jessie Matthews, Gracie Fields and Gertrude Lawrence.  And a host of character actors from England made appearances in Doris' films, from Terry-Thomas to Reginald Gardiner.<br />Who was the co-star with whom Doris later fell in love and had an affair during her TV years?  In her own memoir Doris refused to identify him, for he was a married man then.  Braun preserves his anonymity, though a fancy bit of writing suggests, then denies, that he is thinking of Kirk Douglas for the part.  I wonder!	2004-07-15

Perhaps to see Rodgers through fresh eyes, Block narrows down his focus and his individual chapters pick up on very rarefied aspects of Rodgers' career.  If there is just about nothing on FLOWER DRUM SONG or THE SOUND OF MUSIC, you'll find a learned monograph on the three versions of the TV project CINDERELLA.  The learning's worn lightly and the writing is everywhere vivid and provocative.<br />As in his previous book THE RICHARD RODGERS READER, Block attempts a giant salvage operation, making a serious case for the worthwhileness, indeed the greatness, of Rodgers' final five musicals.  I don't know if anyone will be convinced that TWO BY TWO or REX are great works of musical theater, but it's entertaining, just as a dip into the Bacon-wrote-Shakespeare camp might be.  This is a book that will start a hundred arguments among lovers of Richard Rodgers, and there's nothing wrong with that.	2004-07-15

His daughter, Susan, has written an affectionate memoir of her old man which opens up the tarp in a pretty bizarre pup-tent.  Loesser's blue language is startling, and his temper and amour-propre make me dislike him intensely.  Other glimpses of his personality depend, I suppose, on how much the reader can swallow.  Here's that's always subjective.  His sketches and doodles are cute, but not worth reprinting here as though they were fine art.  The descriptions of her father's hand-made furniture have more mystery to them, one wonders what kind of person would make such strange contraptions.  However, he couldn't have been that bad if his daughter, apparently the salt of the earth, and his widow, the cabaret songstress Jo Sullivan, give vivid testimonial to his time on earth.  A remarkable fella indeed, even if a kind of creep.	2004-07-11

Newton Arvin's biography would also be great to see in a new edition.<br />Wagenknecht is a little bit defensive in the face of 1950s New critical dismissal of his hero, H W Longfellow, and it spoils the book a little bit, giving it a flavor of sour grapes, but some of his points are accurate, and in today's literary climate, Longfellow's longstanding interest in writing of many different cultures (he was an accomplished translator from many languages) give him the status of forerunner to the wave of interest in world writing today.  While he was one of the original members of the &quot;American Renaissance,&quot; and often thought of as a patriot, he  piquantly saw the USA as just one of many nations all of which had cultures of vitality and sweep.  Just think of his translation of Dante, for example, or his First Nations poem &quot;Hiawatha&quot; or the Acadian scents of &quot;Evangeline.&quot;<br />Wagenknecht knows a lot about HWL and even his note about the putative authorship of the poem &quot;There was a Little Girl&quot; (the one that ends up, &quot;And when she was bad, she was horrid&quot;) is worth seeking out this forgotten volume for.	2004-07-11

He found happiness with the woman he calls the sexiest on the planet (Naomi) and seems now to have retired from the business of screenwriting, a business which made him the highest paid screenwriter in the world--not once, but twice.  He has left a legacy of interesting films, some good, some bad, but his memoir of writing them (and of his cathartic childhood, the son of Hungarian emigres) is just plain stupendous.  It's one book that should have been two, or possibly three.<br />If you wrote, \\"Jagged Edge,\\" \\"Flashdance,\\" and or \\"Basic Instinct,\\" to name only the hits, wouldn't you try to be more discreet about it?  And the flops are a true laundry list of disaster.  Only in Hollywood could such an auteur not only survive, but thrive.  Very few screenwriters can boast of having sex with Sharon Stone, but Joe E. really rubs it in.  For all that, his picture of Marty Ransohoff trying to destroy the life and career of Glenn Close is truly a memorable one.  I guess Ransohoff won after all, because today one hears as little of Glenn Close as one does of Joe Eszterhas.  If you like Hungarian sentiment, add a star.  This is almost the Magyar version of Allen Ginsberg's \\"Kaddish.\\"	2004-07-11

That's the prospect of Christina Hardyment's wonderful if far-fetched book.  The family comes armed with an encyclopedic knowledge of children's literature from Hans Christian Andersen to Pinocchio, and a lot of research was done which, back in the days before the internet, must have been teduious to the extreme.<br />They all seem to have had a splendid time.  It makes me want to take the same trip and follow, a generation later, in the footsteps of this intrepid, charming family.  I wonder if the low key theme parks that Christina Hardyment describes have been upgraded (or downgraded, depending on your point of view) into more high-tech and impersonal thrill rides.  And yes, one does wonder how the little girls grew up and what kind of family life do they see themselves as having!  I suppose that's just human nature, wondering \\"what happened afterward,\\" just as in a fairy story.	2004-07-09

Apart from a pair of writing manuals we now learn he wrote to make money when the IRS descended on him to pay over $400,000 in back taxes, are any of his books in print?  Silesky ends his story at the moment of Gardner's death, so we don't hear any of the innumerable reasons for the critical decline in Gardner's reputation, and he doesn't do him any favors by printing that photo on the cover with the big white mullet caught poetically in mid flight.  It is a further shame that Silesky is so badly served by his proofreaders.  As another reviewer has pointed out, who doesn't know the first name of the US novelist Alison Lurie?  And on page 231, the eniment translator of Lorca, Ben Belitt, gets turned into &quot;Bellit&quot; -- why?  I guess because nobody bothered to check.  My favorite misspelling is Silesky's rendering of the classic opera &quot;AHMAL and the NIGHT VISITORS&quot; (pg 283).<br />It doesn't seem to me that enough really happened to Gardner to justify such a long book.  The tragic death of his brother apart, Gardner led a typical MFA type of life.  He catapulted himself into one writing job after another, replete with lots of booze, lots of admiring colleagues, lots of students all too willing to part him from whatever wife he was on at the time.  Silesky's story turns tragic only when Gardner reaches fame with the publication of &quot;The Sunlight Dialogues,&quot; and suddenly his character changes, and the friends who once called him &quot;sweet&quot; now realize he's a pompous windbag, a Father Mapple of the faculty lounge.  It's all very sad, but fails to convince you that a Gardner revival is in order, &quot;moral fiction&quot; or no.  When Charles Johnson uses the word &quot;legend&quot; to describe his late friend, he's being loyal, but it's a terrible debasement of the word &quot;legend.&quot;	2004-07-07

Any man who's been caught with his pants down will appreciate what Goya did for the Duchess of Alba, his great love and the subject of his famous NAKED MAJA.  In a way, this book has a lot of the same appeal of Irvine Stone's LUST FOR LIFE of fifty years ago, and readers with a taste for the picaresque, the ribald and the antiquated will be bellying up to the bar for more.  Katharine Hepburn once said that if she could only make herself believe in reincarnation, she would like to have been Francisco Goya, and now we know why.	2004-07-01

The background to the quest Davies outlines remains startling, even though it has later analogues (such as NASA).<br />Davies does a lot with his story but can't overcome its basic inertia.  I thought that Dwight Eisenhower would enliven this story, but he's just a minor player, and the major players are only shadowy figures in a tale of big business and government laissez-faire.  You do get a good feeling about small-town America in the years directly following World War I, when American optimism went hand in hand with a patronage system that has no real equivalence today.  It's a world in which &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot; are stood on their heads, and mean something very different than they do today.  One thing's for sure, you'll never look at a road map in the same way after reading this charming, unnecessary book.	2004-07-01

People who have read Rebecca Solnit's books, for example, might enjoy Diane Smith's somewhat lighter look at the same time period and subject.<br />They sell this book at Yellowstone National Park and I can see why!  It takes one right back to the days when the Indian had not been subjugated entirely by the white conquerors and empire-builders, and the vista against which this action is laid is fairly overpowering with its beauty.

The more I think about it, the more I realize that there were many other ways in which the killer could have shifted suspicion onto the person he was \\"framing\\" rather than go in for this method of leaving fingerprints which seems completely bogus.  Can people actually change their fingerprints at will?  Maybe some old textbook says so, but the mind doesn't take it in, not completely, and that's the problem with the book.  Otherwise the plotting is brilliant, although nowadays readers will wonder why Mrs Zia Bey, if she is in such an interesting condition, gets so drunk and makes such an obvious play for the reporter.

Basically a conservative book, this book leads us to believe that no one of today is fit to tie Duse's shoes.<br />Sometimes Duse was foolish about men and about writing, and according to the standards of the day she was a bad mother, but other than that, she was sublime in every way.  Sheehy claims that her appeal was a plastic one, that her rich warm smile illuminated her face, and took away the slightly doughy and overdone shadows her photos cast in composure.  She loved to walk, to relieve stress, and she made one half-hour motion picture, back in the days before exhibitors' demands froze the motion picture into being more or less ninety minutes long.  Sheehy says it's great, but by this time, the reader isn't sure whether or not to believe her, because everything is so superlative the tone is pitched too high.	2004-06-21

In a way it's a shame he wrote this book because it makes nearly every person in the Kentucky hills sound like a moron.

We can still view a little bit of the old Tree magic when we watch Fellini's film &quot;IL DOLCE VITA,&quot; in which she plays a poetry-spouting old bore.  Fellini's camera picks up every angle of Tree's aging, decrepit face, and cruelly turns her into a caricature of herself.<br />Daphne Fielding actually knew Iris Tree, and many of the anecdotes of THE RAINBOW PICNIC come from the two of them running into each other in various European countries.  The book is essentially a portrait of two women who lives extravagantly and without giving anything back to the world which treated them so well.  Excerpts from Tree's poetry are given here and there, and they support history's judgment of her as one who had no talent except for living.  She was close to Krishnamurti, Chaplin, Garbo and Gish, or so says Daphne Fielding.  Most biographies of the famous people she got on with will not list her name at all in the index, because she ws the definition of a minor player.  Vanessa Bell did an unrecognizable portrait of her and Cecil Beaton contributes two photos to this volume.  In one she looks very much like the US actress Mia Farrow, and in the other, like a washed-up Lotte Lenya.  A touching story, a memorable book, but a mis-spent life.  For Anglophiles only.	2004-06-13

These stories collect some of the many stories Woiwode wrote about a typicl Woidodean family called the Neumillers, replete with their piercing insight into the wellsprings of human behavior.  the heartbreaking story of &quot;Marie&quot; is a good example if the kind of thing Woiwode can write with his eyes closed: Marie, the goodhearted, clumsy girl who tries to do everything right but instead invariably failes and feels freakish, even within the bosom of her own family.  &quot;Marie wanted to rest her forehead against Jerome.  'I was just starting to find out where I belong in this family!'&quot;  Her cry of desperation is all the more poignant because it occurs over the Christmas holidays, when things should be peaceful at home.<br />Woiwode used a lot of this material for his best-selling novel, BEYOND THE BEDROOM WALL, so he is a canny recycler.  Many people will not care for this&quot;pay-for-it-twice&quot; tactic, thinking it unworthy of the man who brought us ARISTOCRAT OF THE WEST, Woiwode's magnificent biography of Gold Seal's Harold Shafer.	2004-06-12

He's uptight, prudish, in a difficult relationship with his mother, and he's embarked on an odd career.  He's actually a character only found in novels.  This book has an unusual title, the catchphrase of long-ago radio commentator and gossip columnist Walter Winchell, still alive in 1964, when this book is set, but his influence considerably diminished.  Bausch is one of those writers who has both written too many books and who still hasn't received all the acclaim he would have gotten had he written just one or two.  It's a devilish dilemma for any writer, but if he had a coach, he could have received some better advice when it came to writing his difficult, turgid, and flippant tale, stay away from the mob; don't borrow your heroine from Styron's &quot;Sophie's Choice,&quot; for doing so will only show your book up as even more inferior than it is, and 3) if you are going to tell the story of the American Civil Rights movement in your novel, make sure your use of it as a subplot doesn't overwhelm the main story of the book, making it seem like a misbegotten collection of character traits and Richard Yates-ish glum-isms.  other than that, this book has a lot of readability, though you won't believe it for a single instant.	2004-06-12

You'll learn a lot, without even trying, about the allure and the lore of herbs.  Landscaping with herbs is a whole field to itself, and not many people can explain it as well as Collins and Giles.

To say any more would risk the biggest of spoiler warnings, but I came away from the book with a chill down my neck.  For them, it's all fun and games.<br />The thriller plot of the book is pretty good.  The so-called &quot;terrorist cell&quot; is presented here with a skill that recalls Joseph Conrad and his anarchisr masterpiece, &quot;The Secret Agent,&quot; or Le Carre's thriller &quot;The Little Drummer Girl,&quot; which displayed a similar ambivalence about the need for world revolution and the proper vehicle for right-minded political action.  Well, see what you think.  Will I be back for Volume IV?  Probably, but I'll hate myself in the morning.<br />PS, if you've ever been to the real life &quot;Rincon Center&quot; here in San Francisco, you'll be relishing what becomes of it in this novel.	2004-06-06

Don't think I've ever read such a self-congratulatory work.  How do people stand her?  She says she doesn't like to write about people unless she likes them, but from her writing, one gets the impression she feels superior to everyone, always quoting the little non sequiturs people make by mistake, to make them look stupid.<br />The idol has feet of clay.	2004-06-06

The materials on which the authors based their book are very thorough, but no one is ever going to give Russ Columbo the Stephen hawking award for brains, so page after page of his intimate correspondence, and that of his brain-dead pals, palls after a little while.  The photos are great and seem to prove the long-vaunted notion that at some point in his career, perhaps to improve his chances with Indiana-born Carole Lombard, Columbo endured a primitive nose-job of the Gertrude Atheron style.  There are two kinds of people, and one of them is the kind that will love this biography to death, and the other kind will prefer to appreciate it, and its James-Ellroyisms, at a safe distance.  Kudos to its authors, who dared to sail into the mind of a shallow man for quite a long time.	2004-06-06

The author, Wayne Kinsey, a true fan, has devoted this book to the classic Hammer Years, at Bray Studio, a veritable Shangri-La, or mythical place, only this was real.  On this lot Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing and dozens more gave their finest performances in a variety of monster, slasher, terror, sci-fi and less easily classifiable films, for a parade of studio execs who sometimes resembled a kind of family--ever the more so in retrospect.  Kinsey presents a film by film breakdown, in chronological order, with many lurid and comical photos.  My, there were some beautiful starlets working for Hammer, and they seemed to take off their clothes at a moment's notice.  As for the men, maybe not so intriguing outside of Cushing and Lee, but those two alone account for a huge variety of eccentric tics and tragedies.<br />What I didn't like was the repetitiveness of the formula.  each film discussed in exactly the same way, and then the details of the film censors checking every script ahead of time and issuing stern warnings about &quot;do not do this or that.&quot;  OK, a bit of this  is worthy of perusal, but too much and the reader deducts a star.  And this was too much.  All in all, this book merits a &quot;4&quot; on the KINSEY SCALE.	2004-06-06

The play has great parts, including a dissolute, nearly middle-aged leading man, Julian, back from hell raising to reunite with his sisters, who are both drawn to him (and his new wife) and repelled by them and the lifestyle they represent.<br />The local color (New Orleans) is beautifully done and the music, written to Hellman's lyrics by the great Marc Blitzstein, is awesome, should be revived often.  OR, you could use the AEROSMITH album as your mental soundtrack as you read along in this play.  There's a film of this, too, with Dean Martin, that (surprise!) isn't half bad either.<br />If you like sagas of family life, this might be the very play for you.  Be warned, unless carefully cast, you might produce this play with actors whom your audience will not believe are siblings.  This has sunk some amateur productions of &quot;Toys in the Attic.&quot;	2004-06-06

Page after page of this book presents information that will be new even to those who thought they knew all about the mysterious \\"Vernon Lee,\\" the pen name-slash-alter ego of the British heiress Violet Paget, who preferred Italy to her own nation and writing to either.  The women who Lee loved are also an interesting gallery, and her brother, the aesthete Eugene, who travelled flat on his back with a male attendant to take care of him, is a whole different trip, deserving of a book of his own.<br /><br />All in all, a terrific biography.  I deduct one star only because, skilled as she is as a writer, she cannot manage to make Vernon Lee's individual writings even a fraction as interesting as she says they are.  This is a problem Michael Holroyd faced with his magisterial biography of Lytton Strachey, like Vernon Lee a decidedly minor talent, but Holroyd managed to surmount the inherent problems and delivered a convincing defense of Strachey's writing in various categories, but this Colby cannot do.  The reasons for this are both manifold and obvious, but a splendid try.	2004-06-06

It's hard to recconcile this overwhelming impression with the chronology of the storyline that places the action in a different era.  I wish Otto Preminger were still around, it would take a film-maker of his magnitude, unafraid of the corny and the obvious, to tackle this novel and whip it into a sprawling film.  Heighton is loaded with talent and the relationship between Sevigne Torrins and his father is magnificently drawn.  Like Michael Ondaatje, Heighton is a Canadian poet of repute but the parallels stop there.  I liked &quot;The Shadow Boxer&quot; a lot and I wonder why it wasn't more of a success in the USA.  Indeed I wonder how it did in Canada, where it might be considered a book sort of in the vein of Leonard Cohen's turbulent novel &quot;Beautiful Losers&quot; from the 1960s.	2004-06-03

I love Joe Layden's books, he is an expert at every kind of expository writing, and he's very good at translating the language of public figures into a sturdy prose tailored to each figure he's ghosting for.  He's the one who wrote the Rock's autobiography.  But now that he has worked with Peter Salgo he has actually done something of a public service.<br />Salgo's three-pronged prescription may be controversial--and indeed so simple that you could condense the message of this book into 10 words or less, like an old time telegram--but I feel confident that he is on the right track.  And so does my own cardiologist.  Maybe in the future we will all be learning a pattern of dependence on statins as a daily thing, the way we learn to brush our teeth.  And keeping chlamydia at bay is bound to be a good thing in the long run.  Good work, Salgo and Layden.	2004-06-01

In this late Dr. Fell novel, the entire backdrop of Hitler's mountain eyrie at Berchtesgaden is built up bit by bit, a marvelous exercise in brooding evil, only to be dismissed a few chapters later when the book lands with a thud in bourgeois Geneva (Switzerland), as the middle-aged painter Brian Innes tries to cope with his attraction to the youngish daughter of an old friend.  Innes nowhere seems like a painter, and never is his supposed knowledge of art or color used to indicate anything.  But the puzzle is ingenious.  What could cause a once-famous actress to tumble off a balcony in full view of two people--without being touched?  And the back story, where it does not involve Eve Eden's abortive 1939 pilgrimage to Hitler, is absorbing indeed.  Basically the problem is one that even Carr's greatest partisans have to acknowledge reluctantly, a constant flow of exposition badly delivered by people who already know everything, and a continual swarm of interruptions to the dialogue that serve no other purpose but to pad the plot and slow down the storyline.  The \\"Macbeth\\" inspired title, \\"In Spite of Thunder,\\" should say it all, but doesn't actually mean anything in context.	2004-06-01

The details of her poor adumbrated life ring true, and her involvement with the desperate, paranoid Edgar Allan Poe had the authentic tragic ring to it.  Finding out that she is only a fictional character made me feel diminished a bit, as though history had gotten suddenly a bit smaller.<br />Karen Pelletier's struggles in academia parallel Foster's journey towards artistic creation, and Karen's relationship with her daughter and her family are well observed and wry.  I didn't think the Lieutenant whose lips strike her more and more favorably over the course of the novel was all that exciting.  But, at least he was there in the clinch.  I'll look forward to Dobson's continuing treatment of this relationship, even if not very eagerly.  Good work all around, and plenty of fun and suspense.	2004-05-28

A troubled young girl, Jilly, ignored by her wheelchair bound father, Stephen, and her movie star mother, Oriana Devi.  A pair of amateur psychics, Julian and Vivian, deeply into reincarnation, attempt to aid little Jilly with their strange, eerie advice.  Meanwhile on a nearby horse farm a lovely chatelaine, Neryl, is married to the unapproachable and nasty Everett, but she's having an affair with a handyman a la Constance Chatterley.  Into this mix of personalities comes our heroine, Lynn MacLeod, once married to Stephen long ago, before Jilly's birth or even the arrival of the alluring dancer, Oriana.  Lynn has a lot of lessons to learn about growing up and also who she was in a past life.  Can she save Jilly before the curse of the singing stones sets in?<br />If you have a heart for romantic suspense, you've probably already read a dozen or more by America's answer to Daphne du Maurier, Phyllis A.

He read two stories from his new book HEADLESS, each of them completely different but complementing the other with what one had felt to be the missing piece out of American fiction. Reading his new collection HEADLESS is like breathing pure oxygen at the top of some snowcrested mountain of madness.  Every page is embedded with a jewel that will make you crazy.  Perhaps this is what happened, without him knowing anything about it, to the earliest Amazon reviewer of this book.  Weissman's best stories are as beautiful as the long poems of Rainer Maria Rilke, but it's a Rilke with a Chris Rock kind of postmodern irony and culture blasting.  Try reading the opening lines of HEADLESS, you will already have discovered the seedbed of a classic act of love.	2004-05-14

Maybe it's the face that two different men had a hand in this book, but it suffers from an absence of unity of vision, not only in its confusing back and forth time structure but, as other have noticed, the book has no overarching theme.  I attribute some of this muddiness to the authors' otherwise admirable attempt to show a degree of empathy for the two teen killers, by describing, at great length, every detail of their boring rural lives and how badly they wanted to be different than their peers, to distinguish themselves at something, even if it be murder of the most horrifying kind.  And yet at the other end of the scale, the victims are not all that interestingly portrayed.  We are continually told that they were wonderful folks, but the authors lack the skill to bring out the loss to the world at their deaths, their individuality as people.  Is it because of their immigrant status (upon which so much stress is laid), that somehow they are &quot;less than Americans&quot; and therefore can remain ciphers?  That would be an unfair assumption and yet it lingers in the reader's mind long after the book has been put down.  In brief, this is a frightening but un-illuminatiing book by two veteran writers.	2004-05-08

I don't know much about the Colonial revival in American culture, and this book is a splendid introduction to the ways in which our present-day culture have been modelled and molded by a series of cultural enterpreneurs like Nutting, for history is invidious and in the post-modern condition we can no longer distinguish between what is &quot;real&quot; and what is the simulacrum.  Nutting saw clearly how through mass production he could disseminate his own vision of what colonial New England history was like, in ways that would reinforce his own prejudices towards nationalism, etc., while gibing with his genuinely moving and democratic feelings towards beauty akin to the Arts and Crafts movement of the UK and the USA of a slightly earlier date.  Thomas Denenberg has all the facts and figures at his fingertips--he's a wonderful companion and never allows the readers to lose sight of the overall picture amid the myriad pleasues of Nutting minutiae.  I'll have to find out more about American historiography, especially if it's this deliciously presented.	2004-05-08

Therefore I didn't expect much fro this book on the West Memphis Three, particularly because it is such a well-publicized case, to tell the truth i expected a hack rehash of the scary story from Paradise Lost.  Was I ever surprised!  I'm glad I gave the book another chance.  Some have complained that the book is kind of &quot;dry,&quot; but I think that's the only way that Leveritt could have written it, for if she put all her emotion and passion into every paragraph, it would have been overkill.  Besides, all you have to do is read between the lines and, in a brave exemplum of investigative reporting at its best, she practically names the real killer and just stops short of handing down a new indictment.  Surely nobody who reads this book will doubt the identity of the real killer of those poor three little victims.  The only question remains, why?  How could one human being be so evil, or if you don't believe in &quot;evil,&quot; how could he be so depraved--&quot;psychopathic&quot;?  And how can we protect ourselves not only from the individual psychopath, but from the system of checks and balances that resulted in this massive miscarriage of justice?<br />DEVIL'S KNOT is an atmospheric book as well.

Cherry, a young British girl in the immediate postwar years, brings home an alcoholic and brilliant painter, Evan, as her new husband.  Her mother, a widow and the heroine of the play, is called Stella, and Stella falls deeply in love with her daughter's new husband, who reciprocates while painting her portrait.<br />There's a lot in the play about tides and how strong they are and how inescapable, even the ones in September, and most of the play is about how a woman like Stella is temperamentally more suited to a man like Evan, who is maybe ten or twelve years her junior, than the outwardly sophisticated but immature Cherry.  In this play hearts get broken.  Du Maurier wrote it as a tribute to her father's former mistress, the legendary Gertrude Lawrence, who played the part of Stella in the West End production.  (And the young Michael Gough--Alfred, the butler, in the Batman films--played Evan!)  What was strange is that Daphne, too, fell in love with Gertrude Lawrence exactly as her father had.  This is one story that wasn't in the Hollywood version of Gertrude Lawrence's life, Robert Wise's awful Julie Andrews biopic STAR.  But it should have been.  I loved it.	2004-05-03

I don't know who does his research for him, but McBain pulls it off again, another vivid and believable milieu, this time in the field of recording, producing and distribution of dance music.  He must be in his 70s but he has a remarkably young attitude, and his description of the pop single &quot;Bandersnatch&quot; by his fictional heroine, Tamar Valparaiso, is totally convincing to the point that you'll believe it could be in heavy rotation on MTV (if they still played videos).  Tamar would be a great part for Jennifer Lopez, even if she is a bit too old to play her properly, and she wouldn't like what happens to her in the course of the script.<br />I hope this is the first of a whole new &quot;Lewis Carroll&quot; series for the 87th Precinct.  It isn't McBain's best book by any accounting--for me, the best run was the long list of vintage novels from the late 70s through late 80s, from Calypso through Heat, Ice, etc, when he could do no wrong.  But this is the best of the recent crop of titles.  Hooray for a great grand master!	2004-04-26

One of the best anthologies of fiction I know, for it comes with a program and it shows how it all came together.  The &quot;Sycamore Hill&quot; workshop sounds like a more or less annual affair, in which the brightest new lights of science fiction are summoned to a central location (a la The Fellowship of the Ring) and each writes a story for the amusement of the others.  Everyone grades everyone else's tale and then the re-writes begin.  Here is a healthy sampler of some of the more interesting stories written in 1994, among them are tales by authors who have since grown big enough to hold their own conferences all by themselves if they thought to--Karen Joy Fowler, Jonathan Lethem, et cetera.<br />The comments by the other participants are included, so it's an anthology which comes closer to the &quot;raw&quot; side of the menu than the &quot;cooked.&quot;  Ouch!  Some of these &quot;comments&quot; must have stung, but everyone bears with it gracefully.<br />The funniest part is an appendix, &quot;The Turkey Hill Lexicon,&quot; a must for leaders of writing workshops in which these practiced writers give witty names to common writing solecisms.  I'll never forget &quot;As you know, Bob,&quot; which you hear on every soap opera, shorthand for exposition put into dialogue form among characters who already know the information for the supposed benefit of the reader.  Way to go, Sycamore Hill.	2004-04-26

Bizarre and improbable as her plots can get, she has the right stuff and can add a jolt of suspense to even the most outlandish situation.  Her heroes and heroines are likeable even when trapped in the one dimension she provides them.  But with this book, you just sigh and wonder, what on earth happened?  Many a time one finishes a book and then later realizes there were many loose ends and improbable coincidences.  But if you have this feeling while you're still reading the thing, the book has major problems.  With IF SHE SHOULD DIE, Thompson packs the book with far too many characters.  I didn't believe that either Tess nor Bethany was a good friend to Christine, or that they ever had been friendly with her.  And what about the retarded brother?  As others have pointed out, he is the most unlikely Watson ever to grace the pages of a book.  He is the one who finds Dara's missing diary in a hole in an old tree.  Probable?  I don't think so, but if he hadn't found the diary, there would have been no book, so all right already.<br />And the killer, when finally revealed, is someone whom nobody could have guessed because Thompson did not employ an iota of &quot;fair play&quot; with the reader.  Nowhere previously have we been given even a hint of the Killer's tragic childhood which supposedly made him a psychopath.  I never believed it for a second.  You won't believe the reason that the corpse was buried with the identifying ring!  Sorry, Carlene.  Please don't try to bring back Jeremy &quot;Gump&quot; for another go-around, your readers will not stand for it.	2004-04-22

My esteem for Lucille Ball fell while reading this book.  And I don't think it's her fault, I think it was Kanfer's.  He doesn't miss a chance to give you the overall impression that she was not in charge of her own life.  Anybody who ever saw Lucy knows that she was a woman who had her own demons, but it takes a biographer like Kanfer to show just how much the terrible past reached out its claws and choked her life free of pleasure and fun.  To the outside, she gave a vivid impression of a daffy screwball, but to those who attempted to get close to her, she couldn't help revealing the tightly wound, neurotic worrywart.  Her relationship with Ginger Rogers was just about the only one she found a jot of comfort in, and Kanfer makes it seem as if she reached out to Ginger as a way to complete her education.  All her life she was made to feel inferior to other people.  Even marrying an immigrant did nothing for her self-esteem, for he wound up cheating on her.  What did Lucille Ball do to deserve such a constricted, joyless life or such an inept and colorless biographer?  What a pity.	2004-04-21

But we in the USA have a way of depreciating our best writers, especially if they do not fit into one or another accepted movement, or if they do not conform to government-approved standards of patriotism and &quot;decency.&quot;  Harold Norse has the enormous range of his mentor, William Carlos Williams, and the verbal dexterity and flip amiability of his compadre, Allen Ginsberg.  But in spirit he is perhaps closer to the world poets rather than to any particulat American model--poets like Gabriela Mistral, Pablo Neruda, Reverdy, Ungaretti, Marina Tsvetayeva.  Only among these international figures, whose work argues with and deranges the ideological concerns that pre-occupy our best writers, can we finally rank Norse.  Many have spoken of his facility and technical mastery, but I think, after reading the whole of this volume, spanning an incredible seventy years, that the impression you come away with is not primarily admiration for a squeaky-clean &quot;line,&quot; but you're blown away by the vision--of language and society--displayed by this unique poet.  If we can't get him the Nobel Prize, at the very least we could try to secure him the Poet Laureateship of his adopted city--San Francisco.  He's already the Pope of Albion Street.	2004-04-15

Perhaps the character of Mercedes was just too hard to pin down, and this may not be Schanke's fault.  Acosta's work seems slight and dated, and no amount of cutting and pasting is going to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.  This leaves her as a curiosity, a woman who must have been something in her prime, when so many gorgeous women succumbed to her; and then as a victim of what we would now call &quot;erotomania,&quot; desperately clinging to the hope that someday Garbo would smile on her again, even though she must have known that &quot;outing&quot; Garbo in her insipid memoir &quot;Here Lies the Heart&quot; (which Le Gallienne heatedly called, &quot;The Heart Lies and Lies and Lies&quot;) wasn't the way to curry favor with such a private individual.  The last chapters of the book are pathetic in extremis, it's almost hard to believe Mercedes stayed alive from week to week she was so poor and abject, having no money of her own and totally dependent on charity from others.  She was like Job in every way except, of course, genitally.  But then again Job was probably pretty annoying too.  Schanke does a fine job putting together the pieces of a fabulist's life, jigsaw pieces from many different puzzles.	2004-04-15

As other reviewers have noted, the amazing event that happens at the Hotel Fairfax is so unbelievable and so badly prepared for you just sit there and take it, like a body blow, with a kind of dumb apprehension.  It's over the top and just what we deserve.<br />Somewhere in heaven, William Irish must be smiling.  Thirty years after his death, James Siegel has taken the plots of two of Irish's greatest books, &quot;I Married a Dead Man&quot; and &quot;Waltz into Darkness,&quot; and jammed them together until sparks flew in hell.

His first wife, the American heiress Mary, died too soon and had she lived a bit longer her influence might have prevented her three daughters from going on in the profligate way they did.  Or is that mere sentimentality?  Whatever it is, it's the crux of Anne de Courcy's listless group biography.<br />The author's research, while it makes for pleasant reading, hasn't uncovered anything really new about the three unpleasant Curzon sisters.  The reader ultimately feels sympathy for the UK novelist Elinor Glyn, who wrote &quot;It,&quot; with whom Curzon dallied after Mary died and whom he betrayed as cavalierly as he served the people of India.<br />I suppose there are readers who like Diana Mitford and who will be interested in the other women in her husband's brutish life.  They will lap this up like lackeys.	2004-04-14

His book details his ten year search of the perfect Warhol, and is fairly persuasive regarding the artisric merit of the late self-portraits he calls the &quot;Fright Wigs.&quot;  There's a particularly virulent one on the cover of his book.  The antics of the art dealers he encounters are fit for &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities,&quot; and you will want to slap a few of them silly should you run into them shortly after being introduced to them in the pages of Polsky.  Most people, he tells us, suffer from low self-esteem, but to a man (or woman), gallerists suffer from &quot;high self-esteem,&quot; i.e. they think they're better than they actually are.  Polsky paints himself as a man in over his head, and comparisons to Woody Allen have been made, but a better comparison might be Larry David . . . it's as if &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; was set in the high-priced world of contemporary visual art . . . just as vulgar, crass and profane.	2004-04-14

It's an interesting locale, situated at the juncture of violated native sovereignty and a new, tourism-based economy.<br />The author is dry to the extreme, and again and again nobly resists the opportunity to speculate (i.e., fictionalize) the details of his complex story.  He makes it clear whom he suspects, and it's a terrible story indeed.  And to think that for a hundred years Jane Stanford has been commonly thought of as dying by accident.  Accident--no~-far from it--this was cold blooded murder!<br />A classic case of who-done-it and who covered it up.	2004-04-14

Reading these verbatim transcripts, hundreds of pages long and recently unearthed, we are given the opportunity to do this almost virtually, for the Wildean voice comes through loud and clear, with perfect crispness and distinction.  This libel trial, the first of three of the Oscar Wilde trials, is almost a conversation between two persons, and the defence counsel, Carson, though incredibly scornful and insolent, is almost as intelligent and quite as good at debate as Wilde, so it's a splendid match of brains.  The outcome is disheartening, though, and throughout you can't help pounding the desk and murmuring out loud, oh, Oscar, how could you have been so stupid!  Or -- don't go there!  So he becomes real in a way he hasn't previously, not even in the best biographies available.  Queensberry and Alfred Douglas come off, in hindsight, as monsters of privilege in only quasi-human form.  And poor Edward Shelley, it is plain, deserves a book of his own.	2004-04-13

Haydon emerges as a provocative, vain, loveable and talented man with an incorrigbly high opinion of himself, a sort of rogue, but a heroic Englishman in the best sense.  As other reviewers have noted, William Wordsworth--not usually a sparkplug of fun or dynamism--comes off terrifically well, perhaps he was a man at his best with a tableful of male peers and far away from the women who perplexed him so.  I hope other cultural historians pick up on Hughes-Hallett's &quot;meal&quot; method and soon, perhaps, we will have an &quot;Immortal Lunch&quot; or &quot;Breakfast&quot; too.	2004-04-13

In a way, to use White House parlance, she has become &quot;embedded&quot; with her subject, to disappointing results.  She seems unable to utter a single negative thing about &quot;Yashji,&quot; perhaps due to this artificial, extended closeness, and her critical pronouncements suffer from a similar vagueness of effect.  I am left unpersuaded that Yash Chopra's genius lies in his ability to reinvent himself a la Picasso for succeeding generations, or is it that (again like Picasso) he just has stayed around for longer than anybody else?  Dwyer is far from helpful--just the reverse.  Her book seems designed to confuse and delude the reader.  There are several beautiful photographs among the pages, but you could practically visit Bollywood yourself for the price of this insanely overpriced volume.  Instead, rent a few of Yash Chopra's movies and you'll feel the difference between a tenuous analysis and a life-changing artistic experience.	2004-04-13

Indeed the whole system seems absurd in Lane's cosmos, a Navy without a purpose, a Navy emasculated by successive runs of job cuts and budget reductions and, although this isn't as clear, too much \\"peace.\\"  The way he pictures the Navy, it's almost as though only a nut would join.  The plot runs smoothly enough, though I didn't enjoy the \\"red herring\\" factor of the two brothers who happened to be staying, in their underwear, in the apartment of the Petty Officer accused of being gay.

Though he failed to speak to the surviving brother, Richard, Hodges still is able to paint a fairly full picture of Wong's private life.  The various misspellings are a shame (&quot;Delores&quot; Del Rio for example) but aren't egregious.  As other reviewers have noted, where Hodges shines is in his ability to &quot;crack the code,&quot; to convey to us what Anna May Wong was trying to sneak onto the screen when the pedestrian Hollywood scenarios she has stuck with failed her sense of her art--her gestures, her costumes, her allusions to realms of Chinese history and folklore she made her own, and which we might never have known about if we were not ourselves Chinese American--which I'm not.  So good for him!

Page after page will surprise even those readers familiar with the men he's put under the microscope, and there are, as well, a number of character studies which show that Shand-Tucci has at least the gifts of a novelist.  The torments of the closet make up the first half of the book, and the defiance of coming out gives piquancy and solidarity to the second half.  Shand-Tucci seems to have thought hard about the cultural significance of many characters dismissed as minor elsewhere, and this is probably the first book to think of the achievements of Rene Ricard and Steve Jonas as being on a par with those of Philip Johnson and Lincokn Kirstein; but then again he's imaginative and in history, sometimes, that's a plus.  I don't know he felt it necessary to add a dash of spite to his portrait of contemporary activist Charley Shively, this last touch kind of spoils the flavor of an otherwise terrific book for  me.	2004-04-06

I didn't know what to expect when I started Oliver Chin's book, but as I pursued the story of these wonderful kids, deeper and deeper, I wound up chastened, moved, and considerably enlightened.  People here in California who live far away from the World Trade Center should wake up and realize, it could happen here, but perhaps reading more books like Oliver Chin's will prevent it.

Ashby Bland Crowder has done a fantastic job recreating the life and times of an elusive novelist, who was at once proud and ashamed of being a Texan.  Since his death, William Humphrey's reputation has gone into a tailspin.  Crowder gives all the work a sympathetic reading, and makes a case for Humphrey as a novelist of great power and skill, on a par with William Faulkner.  The individual readings are extremely lengthy, however, and many readers will skip twenty or thirty pages to get right back to Humphrey's fascinatingly exasperated life.  An indifferent teacher (at Bard College) and an Anglophile on the order of Madonna, Humphrey was something of a heterosexual drama queen, often taking offense at minor slights or the converse, trampling over others' individual rights.  Perhaps as a consequence, his last days were a nightmare of Kafka proportions, and Crowder doesn't flinch from painting a bleak picture.  As a study in contradictions, &quot;Wakeful Anguish&quot; gets it right.<br />One caveat, I cannot understand those, like Crowder, who downplay the film Vincente Minnelli made of Humphrey's 1950s novel &quot;Home from the Hill.&quot;  Crowder pegs it as trash, but he should be more sympathetic; indeed, Minnelli's Home from the Hill is wonderful in ways Humphrey's novel never aspires to.  Both are worthwhile, and the film is a masterwork.<br />But don't let that stop you from acquiring a copy of this book, one of the most enthralling literary biographies of the year.	2004-02-08

But happily Calder is a superior writer, easily able to steer even the novice through these strange new waters.  The characterization is also outstanding, with Bill reluctantly, almost subconsciously, realizing that his longtime girlfriend, Jenny, is not the woman for him, even though he continues to find her sexually attractive.  Bill's an interesting phenomenon, a man of complicated wishes and regrets.  I'll look forward to getting to know him better in succeeding volumes.  A great plus was, I couldn't figure out how the victim died, and it remains a mystery until almost the very end.  You'll shed a tear for the victim and for \\"Squidge,\\" her lab animal with the tragic end.	2003-12-07

More often than not you'll hear them gossiping about money, sex, jobs, politics, just like anybody else.  It's refreshening indeed to have a whole book devoted to interviews in which the poets speak candidly about the thing only they have to share-how they wrote the poetry in the first place.  Daniel Kane, the distinguished historian who wrote All Poets Welcome: The Lower East Side Poetry Scene in the 1960s, has done an admirable job first of selecting a representative group of avant-garde poets, then drawing them out, making them feel comfortable enough to speak freely about the sources and techniques of their writing.  In addition, I can recommend this book to people who are curious about experimental poetry, but can't bring themselves to jump off into the deep end without a parachute.  It's very user friendly, and yet at the same time, you don't get the feeling you're being talked down to.  Some of the poets are quite well known (Creeley, Koch, Ashbery) while others are on the up and coming list.  Even the most interviewed among them wind up saying things you've never heard before.  That's the mark of a good interviewer.	2003-08-29

Outside of these coups, his career never amounted to much, and he gives little information on what makes an actor tick.  I was surprised about just how much of a drunk and drug-abuser he was, but Hagman happily makes it all seem like fun, and he doesn't employ the moralistic tone taken by so many other reformed drunks.  I enjoyed this book and yet I wound up wanting to read another book, the intertwined lives of Mary Martin, Richard Halliday and Janet Gaynor.  You get just enough allusion to their troubles from this book to leave you wanting more.  All in all, a fun read from a forgettable TV clown.	2002-01-17

You groan at some of the references, such as the &quot;second-best bed,&quot; but just as often you chuckle at Davis' dilemma and the kooky ways he comes up with to match his academia plot with the Elizabethan one.

She's an interesting cultural figure, I'll give her that, but the poetry has aged badly and after her marriage she never seems to do anything again but become addicted to morphine.<br />Perhaps the controversial interludes in which an aged Norma Millay chats vampishly with Milford might have been a book all their own on the order of David Plante's &quot;Difficult Women.&quot;  Why on earth did this book take 30 years to write?  There's a story underneath the story, I just don't know what it is.  People who've been to the Millay Colony lately have been filled with gossip about the recent decisions of the Board of Trustees, Milford might have included this information as an epilogue.  Again and again, and persuasively, Milford tells us that Millay was devastatingly attractive and magnetic.  Couldn't there have been one picture that shows her looking good?	2002-01-02

The way Cade was able to match Christie's work with her various traumas is wonderful, and it's hard to believe that seventy years later anyone can come up with something new about such a famous unsolved mystery, and yet Cade has done exactly that, with the help of Nan Watts' daughter.  I wonder what Rosalind Hicks, Agatha Christie's daughter, thinks of this book?  It's marvelous.  We'll never be able to read, for example, &quot;Verdict&quot; in the same way, knowing it reflects on Max Mallowan, Christie's second husband, and his liaison with his executive assistant Barbara Parker, who became the second Lady Mallowan after Christie's death.  How she was able to keep a sense of humor I'll never know.<br />Surprisingly the book makes one feel more, not less, admiration for Christie.  Good on you, Jared Cade!  Can't wait to see where you turn your hand to next.	2001-12-28
