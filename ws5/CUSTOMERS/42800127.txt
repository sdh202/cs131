It contains a lot of great information about Ancient Egypt.  I read another review by a reader who was offended by the thought that the Pyramids weren't built by slaves.  This was obviously a surprise to him but I had heard it elsewhere so it was no news to me.  There were slaves in Egypt and I'm sure they were badly used in other jobs.  They could have also been used to help build the pyramids, I doubt we will ever know exactly.  This is a good book and no reader should pass it up over one shocked review.

Carolyn Marsden should have known what was written in Thai better.  It's not too far off, but enough to indicate ignorance of the Thai language, which she tries to share.  It's obvious she asked people to write the words and wasn't able to check for accuracy.  Khun Mere is the girl's mother, better pronounced as Maa (like a in apple), and Sawadee is never used without Ka for girls or Krop for boys after it, it's very rude to use that word alone.  These inaccuracies hurt the book in my eyes and I think better attention to Thailand would have erased the mistakes.	2005-04-14

If you want the understanding of a young Star Wars fan to expand, here's one way you can do it.  Begin with an easy to read, interesting biography of George Lucas.  It covers his early years (not doing well in school) and a growing interest in film in college.  George Lucas also had to study film and find out about its history.  The book is an eye opener for many youngsters dazzled by the glitz and confused about the hard work in the movie making world.  This book provides an easy but necessary dip into the pool.	2005-02-23

While most factual books leave a reader with an unreal sense of detachment, this book personalizes and brings us closer to the experience a traveler would have if they visited Antarctica.  I loved the account of our author being visited by Emperor penguins and how she described the different kinds of ice to be found there.  I was able to get a clearer picture of the place and identify what travel must be like there.  I've heard of skidoos and some modes of travel before, now I have some sense of how it feels to use them.  The photgraphs enhance the author's account and I am glad to be able to share this book with my students.  I learned more about Antarctica from this book and am willing to believe they will too.	2005-02-19

I can identify with being the outside observer and could relate to the anger I felt when there was a clash of a cultural beliefs.  I was never more hopping mad in my life.  There is something totally disorienting about living with people from another culture in their country.  Most people who visit other countries do nothing more than hang out in tourist areas and have little contact with the people who live there.

He brought foods back from France that weren't popular here and made them famous.  Jefferson got people to finally try love apples or tomatos, thought to be poisonous here in the US, but eaten often in France.	2004-08-15

It is a very nice book and even nicer as I spent time reading it and absorbing the information contained in the book.  I plan to do a lesson on ships and lighthouses when I return to school in the Fall.  That way I combine my vacation with knowledge I picked up with traveling.

Maybe you're not old enough to read Gone With The Wind but love the movie.  This book is for you.  It has its own tale to tell but you do get that bite of Gone With The Wind in the story.  It is a book that is more modern and contains more acceptable views on slavery and Southern culture than GWTW did and has a good message for young women.  This is a girl who is concerned with the status of women in the South as well as the status of slaves.  It provides some infomation that young girls want to know about and brings up cultural issues that people are curious about.  I really liked this book and found it respectful of the characters and the life at that time, as well as the audience for the book.	2004-08-10

This book is unlike any novel I've ever read and I wondered, even after looking over some reviews on this site if I would like it.  I was worried it was too different.  Well, I tried it and ended up loving it.  The book is packed with stories that many people could identify with  in their personal struggles as well as including stories that so completely Chinese.  The cultural, ethnic and political struggles people go through in that country are heartbreaking.  The polictical system is so oppressive and fails to show a human face to its people.  It moved me  quite a bit and I'm very glad I attempted reading it.  It was enthralling and a pleasure to read, not difficult at all.	2004-08-08

I have been looking for a good Kwanzaa book but they are hard to find.  Most go through the days laboriously or have some cheesy made-up story that no one cares about as filler.  This book is great in the way it is written and how it states the purpose of Kwanzaa and the belief behind it.  It sends a much better message about Kwanzaa and how it came to be than other books do.  I definitely would recommend this book to many of my students especially my students from African countries.	2004-08-08

This woman as an American girl in Hitler's Germany provided me with insight into Hitler's Germany in a way that a German girl probably couldn't have because she would have been called into question.  As an outsider inside, she explains how Germans were secretly kept from knowing what was going on in the country and in the conquered lands.  It provided me with information on how life was for most Germans and how they could choose to remain ignorant in such a troubled time.  I never realized that Germans brought in slave workers from conquored lands and that Germans were punished for spending time with them.  I learned so much from this book.

This book was a disappointment to me.  I am an ESOL professional and so may have a different perspective than a mainstream teacher.  It also only deals with mainstream teachers in elementary school.  I think I was looking for a book that not only gave strategies for scaffolding, but a perspective on the right of ESOL students to be included in a classroom.  Many mainstream teachers teach their ESOL students in a sink or swim manner and start demanding that the students be taken out or retained if they don't succeed.  Bilingual education isn't an option for everybody, and sheltered English programs haven't shown their promise.  I 've seen very low expectations and students don't have the opportunies that native speaking peers have.  Teachers need a reason to differentiate for ESOL students.  They often don't understand, and that needs to be tackled first before strategies can be discussed.	2004-03-30

This book extends cooperative learning for second language learners.  Cooperative learning is very important for second language learners.  My complaint is that there is the belief that second language learning is all about teaching grammar skills and vocabulary explicitly.

I met Jean Fritz at an Educator's Conference a month ago.  She was pleased I picked up this book as Lafayette is one of her favorite historical figures.  I did it because I had a student who was intrigued by Layfayette in his social studies class.  I felt I could learn more about him and share the information and book.  I found out quite a bit.  Lafayette was a major figure in both the American and French Revolutions.  The American Revolution succeeded partly because of his determination.  He tried to set France on the right path several times, but it didn't happen in his lifetime.  He lived until his seventies and had a very full life.  He was a shining figure that celebrated life right up to his death.  I want to thank Jean Fritz for pointing this book out to me and prompting me to purchase it.	2003-11-28

I thought this book taught me more about ancient cultures than I knew before and that was interesting and valuable.  I feel uncomfortable about how the information is presented though.  Cultural sensitivity and understanding isn't high on ths book's list.  Everything is a joke and to be thought of as strange and be laughed at.  What's the point in that?  To reinforce stereotypes?  Guess so.	2003-11-06

I really enjoyed the book especially when it quoted laws on the right to an education for immigrant students.  I am aware of many districts who photocopy green cards and passports.  Many are callous and unaware that they can not do that.  Some districts have refused service to immigrants without immigration papers but who have met the residency requirement.  I even know of a district that wanted to charge tuition.<br />On another hand, I have yet to see Bilingual education pan out in most schools.  Second language educators deny this at their peril.  I noticed that the book refers to ESOL children placed into monolingual classrooms as &quot;sink or swim&quot;.  It is important to note that no child can be denied placement in a regular education classroom solely because they need differentiated instruction.  Sink or swim isn't allowed anymore, and ESOL students learn English well in monolingual classrooms with ESOL, Title I and differentiated instruction in their classrooms.	2003-03-25

I am a teacher who read this book and several others in an evening to preview them for students.  Most chapter books for kids these days are \\"much ado about nothing\\".  They don't make sense, are chatty, contrived and I could throw them in the garbage after finishing them.  This book on the other hand had a well developed character, with deep thoughts and emotions and was quite mature as circumstances compelled the character to be.  I would read this book with my middle school and older students and believe they would get a lot out of it.  Thank god for Ann Rinaldi!  If only other children's writers were able to write and develop characters like she could.<br />As for the 12 year old that found the book confusing, it was probably not a book to read on your own just yet.  It would have been more enjoyable to share with a teacher, classmates or your parents as they could help you with the background information needed to understand the story.	2003-03-17

It shows that we are all human and even George Washington had a clingy dependent mother.  Whatever flaws he had in his own personality and flaws in his relations, he still found himself being able to cope and acheive.  That's a great message to send to readers.  It also highlights the dependency women had on men.  George Washington's mother was not able to support herself and believed she could not cope.	2002-02-07

They found the story exciting and it stimulated a great discussion.

I used this book to tie up the values and ideas that Martin Luther King Jr. represented.  The students then painted pictures of peaceful situations.  This led to a discussion about peace.  A boy from Eritrea said that Ethiopians were bad and didn't want to be peaceful.  He was shocked when he learned that one of his best friends in the class was Ethiopian.  He learned that some Ethiopians are good and peaceful.  I as an American, apologized  to a Vietnamese student and pledged peace as he swore to be peaceful also.  Other students were surprized that the US and Vietnam had fought.  We learned a lot about peace from this book.	2002-01-18

I have read the book to students from Kindergarten to 5th grade.  They were completely entranced by the book.  I teach English language learners so they do not know American history.  My African students in particular were facinated by the history presented in the book and were very respectful while I read.  I have a presentation of Martin Luther King Jr. in my classroom and the students would walk with me to the presentation area and ask questions about the pictures and the history depicted in them.  They loved a drawing of Martin in the Birmingham jail and the Nobel Peace Prize he won.  This book helped me present an important person to my students in a way that was meaningful and memorable.	2002-01-04

This is a Kwanzaa book I may actually read to my students, but the ultimate Kwanzaa book is still out there somewhere.  If I read this book I would emphasize the Kiswahili words and intertwine the idea of learning an African language and how African-Americans try to connect to their African roots.  I wonder how my students from African countries will feel about this book?  I'll have to see.  They currently are intrigued by Martin Luther King Jr., civil rights and the idea of American slavery in the 19th century.	2002-01-03

I have not run into many children who have felt this way in my short career as an ESOL teacher but students similar to Mei Mei are out there.  This book is very helpful to teachers with ESOL students in their classroom who are not trained in TESOL practices.  Students often go through a silent period where they are listening to the language and just taking English in before they begin speaking it.  The story of Mei Mei gives an indication what may be going on in their minds at the time.<br />When I lived in Thailand, I often became frustrated and angry when I wanted to answer someone in Thai and tell them what I understood or knew about a subject, but was trapped by my lack of fluency in their language.  I used to think, &quot;Boy!

I did become intrigued when I lived in Thailand and learned to eat their way with a fork and spoon or watched Europeans with their forks and knives.  I am still not good at eating sticky rice and accompanying dishes with my hand.  My favorite situation was watching Thais describe the way Chinese eat with chopsticks.  The Thai think that the way Chinese eat is barbaric.  Little do they know that most Americans think they eat with chopsticks too!	2001-12-28

There was a lot of discussion about those who would have it banned from schools.  The book was originally written for adults, not for adolescents, but it is too good to ignore.  High school students should be exposed to good writing whenever possible.  The subject is sexual abuse and the more adolescents are allowed to discuss abuse the more we can prevent it from happening.	2001-12-28
