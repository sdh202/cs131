I live in the Andes, three hours from Cusco, among the Quechua.  This book is Julia's diary that she wrote after spending a year in the Andean town of Tambo (`corn planting', `my birthday', `barley planting').  The text has an abundance of words, but bringing the reader little anthropological insight into the life of the Quechua people.  It is one thing to say \\"the men continued to plant corn,\\" and another to explain how and why.<br /><br />The author states up front, \\"I am an artist, not an anthropologist,\\" and she details the lives of Andean men and women from this perspective.  What Julia accomplished, as an artist, is akin to an anthropologist trying to paint an accomplished landscape.  The results will probably be a lot of color, with little definition.<br /><br />Though the back cover touts the book as having \\"a wealth of ethnographic detail,\\" without an index, and written from an artist's vantage point,  what you get is a pleasant read.	2005-09-28

I was introduced to British Author John Burdett via his brilliant, `Bangkok 8' (2003).  I was heading to Bangkok and wanted a gripping Thailand-fiction read.  He delivered.  Burdett has an uncanny ability to shed cultural insights regarding the steamy and seamy streets of Bangkok better that any guide that I took with me.  When his follow-up, `Bangkok Tattoo' was released I was in the front of the line.<br /><br />All of the unforgettable characters remain: Sonchai Jitpleecheep, the main protagonist, a Buddhist police detective with a classical education and the son of an ex-prostitute, Mother Nong, who now owns a brothel in Bangkok, \\"The Old Man's Club,\\" in partnership with Sonchai's `oh-so-corrupt' Colonel Vikorn.<br /><br />The East and West, yin and yang, kindness and  kinkiness continues.  Burdett added a melange of Japanese tattooists, Muslim fundamentalists, American capitalists, street drugs, third world country corruption and of course, sex.  It all starts with the macabre murder of a CIA agent in a room in his mother's brothel.  What more could you want for the long flight to Bangkok?<br /><br />Is the book as good as `Bangkok 8'?  Almost.  Though there is powerful mixture of images and insights, his romanticizing of the Thai society  in direct contrast to his Yankeephobia is excessive.  The `Silence of the Lambs' spin-off is a given, and, unlike `Bangkok 8', the pace of the writing flags somewhat, half way into the book.  So?  So nothing.  This is still a highly enjoyable, hard to put down, read.  Not for the squeamish.  Strongly recommended.<br /><br />Sidenote: consider, as an additional book for your flight bag,  the salubrious: 'Sightseeing: Stories' by a new Thai-American writer, Lapcharoensap.  Lapcharoensap moves beyond the sex industry of Thailand, and though he doesn't sidestep the grit, the overcrowding, and the poverty within Thailand, he sees another side of Thailand that is nearer to Nirvana.	2005-09-28
45602:US	53002620	R3TVRN55MA384D	1843910233	658193917	Poor People (Hesperus Classics)	Books	5	13	14	N	N	The life of the poor is like Makar Devushkin's boots.	Dostoevsky's graphic portrayal of the struggles of the poor is set in St. Petersburg, Russia around 1840.  The two main characters are Makar Devushkin, a wretched, 40ish, impoverished scribe in the Tsar's civil service, and, Verenka Alexeyevna, an intelligent, sickly, orphaned teenager. In \\"Poor People\\" the desperate struggles of that the poor are psychological laid bare.  They have no safety net, no patron to keep them from tumbling over the edge of despair.<br /><br />Dostoevsky does not romanticize the poor.  He shows their dysfunctional idiosyncracies: \\"Poor people are capricious - that's the way nature arranges it.\\"  Makar is an unreliable, self-deprecating, yet vain man.  Throughout the story Dostoevsky makes Makar's boots an analogy of both Makar personality and his situation in life.<br /><br />The young, vulnerable Verenka holds on to life by a thin thread.  Her sacred memories of her beautiful childhood long gone sustain her.  She carries these memories as one would carry a mystical crystal, tightly clutched to her heart.  Her memories are her elixirs of life.  These two protagonists, though embedded in the same poverty, go different ways.  One is carried by the fickleness of fate, and the other makes a desperate choice for  change.<br /><br />I confess, to my chagrin, I have never read Dostoevsky.  I was chided by a well-read friend, who, during a discussion about the world's greatest novelist, stated \\"You must read Dostoevsky because of his grasp of the human psyche.  Dostoevsky's characters have profoundly influenced world literature.\\"  So,  I chose to start with \\"Poor People\\"; it was Dostoevsky's first novel, and one of his shortest (130 pages, verses `The Brothers Karamazov' at 900+ pages).<br /><br />If you're going to start reading Dostoevsky then `Poor People' is a great book to commence with.  You will get a glimpse of Dostoevsky's unique insight into the nature of humankind and about the extremes of life.  Highly Recommended.	2005-09-19

In 2004 almost six hundred books came out on Jesus Christ, and over seventy dealt with Christology (the theological study of the person and deeds of Jesus).  People want to know more.  There are questions to answer: Was Jesus God incarnate, or was he an eschatological prophet who proclaimed the imminent end of the world (A. Schweitzer), or was he a prophet of social change (G. Theissen), or was he peasant Jewish cynic philosopher  (J. D. Crossan)?  People want to know.<br /><br />Thomas Rausch, professor of Catholic Theology at Loyola Marymount University, draws on his background in theology and church history.  His writing, though learned, is engaging, interesting and informed.  Much of Christianity today presents Jesus as God incarnate, thus sacrificing his humanity in order to deify him.  Rausch writes against this... pressing the point,  that to understand Jesus is to start with his Jewish/Palestinian heritage and to follow it through Chalcedon (451 AD) and contemporary theology.<br /><br />For Thomas Rausch one needs not to start not with a Christology \\"from above\\", such as the orthodox statement of faith, the `Apostle's Creed'... i.e.:  \\"I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth. I  believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord...\\"  Rather one should start with a Christology \\"from below\\"; start with history, and  critically consider the words and works of the Jesus.  He believes that when one learns of the historical Jesus, that is sufficient to reveal Jesus's message, and that message is in itself conductive to faith.<br /><br />Rausch breaks no new ground, but rather, in a very logical manner puts together the pieces that will helps the reader to understand the Jesus of history and their faith..  Reason alone does not establish faith, but, the act of faith should in itself be reasonable. Highly recommended.	2005-09-19

With this 1st edition  \\"Let's Go Peru\\" is getting off the proverbial porch and running with the big dogs (Rough Guide & Lonely Planet -- see my reviews).  \\"Let's Go\\" is outstanding in two areas:  Budget Travel and Alternatives to Tourism<br /><br />Budget Travel.  \\"Let's Go\\" guides are known for their ability to find you the best bargains.  So, if you are counting every `centavo' then this guide will come through.  The authors will find you  a rock bottom, dirt cheep, bargain basement, lowest price possible accommodation and restaurant to match.  IE: Hostal Rocha (gotta love that name) in Huacachina goes for $2 a night and you might bargain them down.<br /><br /> \\"Alternatives to Tourism.\\"  This twelve-page section covers  \\"Volunteering,\\" \\"Working\\" and  \\"Studying\\" in Peru more throughly than any other guide.  Each  listing includes the names, address, phone numbers and electronic contact information that you will need.  So even if you are not a minimalist, but you are planning to stay in Peru for a while, you will want to have this information.<br /><br />I have lived in Peru for the past five years and I have frequented many restaurants listed in this guide.  With the exception of one or two, \\"Let's Go\\" is right-on-the-money.  I found the listing to be  up-to-date and their descriptions are the best of any of the guides out today.  For those who love \\"Nightlife\\" (bars & clubs), these sections are great.  All of their recommendations are easy to find on a fairly decent  map.<br /><br />The Andes can be brutal if you get altitude sickness.  I have seen the effects of \\"severe\\" altitude sickness, and it is not pretty.  Sadly, for some Dilbert reason, `Let's Go Peru' only gives you the altitude of about 60% of the cities.  They include the altitude of Tacna (562m or 1,842' ), but omit the altitude of such place as Puno/Lake Titicacawhich, which is at the nosebleed altitude of 3830m (or 12,565').  Go figure.  Altitude information is important, and yet only `Lonely Planet' list the altitude of all the cities.<br /><br />Some areas need additional work.  The \\"Essential\\" section (Documents, Climate, Money Etc.) in this guide is bare-bone-basic and not as good as other guides.  The four pages \\"Staying Healthy\\" section is anemic and barely covers important health information (in comparison, Lonely Plant's devotes ten pages about all important health information needed for your trip).  Though the maps are easy to read, the guide has fewer maps than found in the other mentioned guides.  These disparities will probably will be corrected in the 2nd edition.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is guide is especially valuable if you are trying to do Peru on your lunch money and/or may stay awhile to work, volunteer or study.

The insight and uncertainty, the affirmation and rejection , the yin and yang, that you experience while reading Berger is due to his intent to \\"affirm\\" Christianity, via the Apostle Creed  -- \\"I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of ....\\".  Christianity is religion of faith.  Faith in the miraculous and transcendental.  Faith is believing what is not provable or affirmable.  Thus, to seek an affirmation of that which only faith can appropriate is akin to seeking milk from a dry cow, then in frustration turning to the bull.  A frustrating experience for all involved.<br /><br />That is not to say that these twelve erudite essays are not provocative... they definitely are.  Berger address a variety of questions that beg answers: \\"Is God a person?\\", \\"How can a loving God permit the suffering in this world?\\", \\"Did Jesus have to die?\\".  His answers draw on many impressive sources.  This is a engaging work of both theology and philosophy.<br /><br />The are notable inconsistence in Berger's logic.  He affirms his belief in Christ and  in his resurrection, but not the Virgin Birth.  He presses the need for critical modernistic thinking, yet he rejects that death is a normal condition of life:  \\"Death is not to be accepted; it is an offence against the core `nature' of mankind.\\"  Excursus: mankind?  As a contemporary sociologist in the 21st century one would think that Berger would be using nonsexist language in his writing.  He doesn't.<br /><br />Berger delivers a pseudo-orthodox Christianity that is affirmable, along the lines of \\"I believe in God... but\\".  However, reading Peter Berger is not an easy task.  As an accomplished sociologist at Boston University he writes towards those who have an introduction into theology and philosophy.  This is a read best suited for upper-division or graduate level readers.  Recommended.	2005-09-08

Al Gini's book is not about the nature and characteristics of Play, but rather, it is a `working' diatribe against work; with only scant attention given to `Play, Leisure and Vacation'.  Paradoxically, Al Gini failed to grasp his own message.  He needs to lighten up his message and  play more, either that, or change the title (a much easier solution).<br /><br />His book starts with the chapter \\"The Problem,\\" and the problem is, of course, that we work too much; we work ourselves out of both health and holiday.  I believe the problem started with  Walt Disney and his seven dwarfs, those midget miners who plagued America with that addictive workaholic song - \\"Whistle while you  . . . \\"<br /><br />In other chapters Gini covers various social attitudes, such as \\"The Overspent America.\\"  This is an interesting chapter on how TV and shopping are the chief cultural activities in America.  In another chapter he discuses our national addiction to sports, \\"the spectacle of sports anesthetizes us to that which we are either unable or unwilling to deal with, in our own lives.\\"  Other chapters include: Retirement, The Sabbath, Weekends and Traveling.  All interesting and serious stuff, but . . .<br /><br />In \\"The Importance of Being Lazy,\\" we have a commendable sermon, with serious stats, against work; but, there is little new insight on \\"how\\" to play, neither does Gini bring any new ideas regarding leisure that challenge the reader to chill out and vacate their busy lives.<br /><br />So, fellow workaholics, if  you are going to be speaking at Toastmasters, the week before Labor Day, then this is the material you will want to quote: \\"The workaholic lacks boundaries,\\" \\"We made a fetish out of work,\\" \\"Work preoccupies our life\\" and  \\"Workaholics no longer show up for life,\\" etc., etc., etc.  On the lighter side consider Dale Anderson's playful book \\"Never Act Your Age.\\"  Conditionally Recommended.	2005-08-20

Fleet & Smith, describe how the Catholic Church, at various levels, continues to influence the political and social structure of both Peru and Chile.  They reveal  how the Catholic Church was, and still is involved in contemporary politic.  The Roman Catholic Church remains a force in Latin America and it would be improvident to discount the force that its voice has.<br /><br />Fleet and Smith also briefly addresses the history of  `Liberation Theology' (a theology that  reads Scripture through the suffering eyes of the poor, portrays Jesus Christ as liberator and calls for social action).  Their treatment is cursory and the text begs for a more thorough discussion on this topic.  The activists that were once inspired by liberation theology have been  quelled by the late Pope John Paul II.  The `radical' liberation priests have been moved to remote locations, and, as Fleet and Smith noted, `Liberal seminaries have been closed'.  Yet, this text shows that though the rhetoric has been toned down, and though `liberation theology' has faded from the screen, the Church continues to play a progressive, howbeit, a more spiritual role,  in most of Latin America.<br /><br />This is a  work of depth and insight. The general reader may find the text thick with social science jargon, and the academic arguments may be challenging at times, but, for anyone interested in the Catholic Church in Peru and/or Chile, and for those that are students of  Church-state relationships in Latin America this book is Strongly Recommended.	2005-07-15

I purchased this text to enrich my historical and ethnographical understanding of Peru.  Even though the `Rondas campesinas'  (rounds of the farmer/peasants) occurred in Northern Peru, the history and the ethnography within this text are relevant to all of Peru.<br /><br />`Nightwatch' is about the poor peasants of Northern Peru, who, in the long years from 1970 to 1990, when their nation was unraveling, banded together to survive and bring security to their communities.  The Rondas rose as a defense against surging violence, rampant crime and a morally bankrupt government.  In 1986 Professor Starn (Duke U.) was in Peru working on his doctoral dissertation in anthropology.  `Nightwatch' is the culmination of his study.<br /><br />Though the Rondas may never return, there will be new movements in Peru populated by the disenfranchised poor who continue their struggle for justice.  Today, justice for all  (except the rich) is an aberration in Peru.  Corruption and repression by the Government are growing.  Peru, today is a country without leadership and it is slipping back into the chasm of chaos that marked the years from late 70s to early 90s.<br /><br />As I write this review (June 2005) civil unrest is occurring in Peru.  Sadly, America and Europe have shifted their focus to the Middle East.  America and Europe have left Latin America adrift.  The despondency of the citizens as they watch their country and their lives sink into poverty is more pronounced monthly.  The unreliability and the massive corruption under previous Presidents, Belaunde (1980-85) and Garcia (1985-90), has returned under President Toledo.<br /><br />The book is well-written in a very readable style. The book is organized by broad themes, starting with the rise of the Rondas, and ending a little more than twenty years later as they faded into history.  Starn  charts the evolution of this peasant moment from a simple police force into tribunals that resolved dispute, disputes that the indifferent police and inept court system wouldn't.  He also writes about the patrols through the night and the drama of violence when these farms captured a thief.  The whippings and hangings demonstrates the resolve of the campesinas to regain control over their lives. Refreshingly, he does not romance the poor (projecting the image that such movements will remake the world).  His chapter on NGOs (non-governmental organizations) is balanced and informative.  If there is a downside it is that book tends to repeats itself, and could have been much shorter without sacrificing substance.  This book is about an unique expression of hope and for students of Latin America,  social science theorists and students of Andean studies this text will be essential reading.

This is not history for the faint of heart.  Michael Wood writes critically about both Cortez and Pizarro. He discredits the false bravado that is so often built around the Conquistadors.<br /><br />For Wood the Pizarro clan (Francisco and his three half-brothers) were nothing more than \\"ruthless opportunists\\" who blatantly butchered, tortured, raped, and destroyed the Inca civilization in the name of the King Charles V and militant Catholicism.  His commentary about Cortes was not much better.  Wood takes space to give the reader a glimpse into the pathology of both Cortes and Pizzaro.  It is a psychological nibble and one wishes for more.  For both men were psychopaths and considered the gold rich Aztecs and Incas as undeserving of any human rights, and no more than subhuman heathens.<br /><br />Wood captures the historical side of the Aztec and the Inca -  soul-rending .  The vanquished were filled with despair and dread, for they saw only an insatiable hunger for gold and women in the conquistadors' souls.  They watched the rape and murder of their people under the shadow of the crucifix.  In reality Cortes, Pizarro and their colleagues committed nothing short of genocide.  When you read Wood's historical account of the conquistador, these men make the war atrocities of the 20th century pale in comparison.<br /><br />But, there are two judgements that history has passed on these Conquistadors.  The first judgement is in regards to their inhuman treatment of the Inca's and Aztecs.  The second judgement is regarding them as warriors.  These Conquistadors were: bold, courageous, fanatical fighters.  They were, on all accounts, superior tacticians.  They had state-of-the-art steel swords and armor, horses (mobility) and fearful weapons (harquebus & mechanical crossbows) and knew how to use them.  In reality, the Spanish were the greatest soldiers of their age; for a century and a half no Spanish army was ever defeated in pitched battle.  And, in the history of war, never have so few conquered so much, so fast.  It stuns one to consider that  Spaniards were out numbered by perhaps a 1000 to 1 (in the case of Pizzaro).  How could Pizarro (or Cortez) conquer vast empires with a small band of Spanish soldiers?  The ethno-historian Nigel Davies stated best in his book, `The Inca', \\"These men thrived on adversity and always displayed an absolute resolve to retain the initiative.\\"<br /><br />Wood also writes about Orellana's two year voyage from Quito, down the Amazon, and Cabeza de Vaca's eight year journey to Mexico City.  Nearly every page has photos, maps and illustrations and the bibliography lists key books, including Indian narratives.

In reality, the Spanish were the greatest soldiers of their age; for a century and a half no Spanish army was ever defeated in pitched battle.     And, in the history of war, never have so few conquered so much, so fast.  It stuns one to consider that  Spaniards were out numbered by perhaps a 1000 to 1 (in the case of Pizzaro).

This year I have read various books on religious `pluralism', and I lament that I did not read Knitter before all the others in the field.  Knitter has written a brilliant and highly commendable introduction to a `theology of religions' ie. pluralism.<br /><br />Knitter, with sagacity, and a very balanced approach, outlines the key issues and denotes major voices in each of his four models.  These models explain how Christians can dialogue with other religions more seriously, and hopefully, even establish a partner-relationship.<br /><br />This world is full of various expressions of faith, and religious pluralism is not going away; if anything the various religious expressions are metastasizing and multiplying.  Knitters' intent is to inform those in Christianity that the orthodoxy of past two millenniums `maybe' no longer germane to our ever changing and ever shrinking world.  Throughout the book he stresses the point that there never has been, nor ever will be, one religious expression; there never will be `one truth' that will apply to everyone.  There are and always will be different faiths, and as he points out,  \\"Buddhist enlightenment and Christian salvation are different because they are really different.  They are two different realities.\\"<br /><br />Knitter  illuminates the strengths of  the `Exclusivistic/Replacement' model.  Approximately 40% of US Christianity, which includes Fundamentalist, Evangelical, Charismatic and Pentecostal communities, believe the theology of the `Exclusivistic' model.  This model stresses that without a personal relationship in Jesus Christ there is no salvation.  That Christ is found only within Christianity, and that God wants there to be only one religion - Christianity - the \\"one true religion.\\"<br /><br />The  model the majority of mainline Protestant Churches and the Roman Catholic Church is the `Inclusivistic' model.  This model stresses that God is to be found in other religions, but  Jesus Christ  has come to `complete' or `fulfill' these other religions.  This model wants Christians to dialogue with other faiths, not just preach to them;  the dialogue with other faiths should present Jesus as being the \\"full, final and fulfilling\\"of their religion.  This model holds (as does the `Exclusivistic' model) that the Christian faith collapses, if, ultimately, the definitive claim for Jesus Christ is denied.<br /><br />The `Pluralist' and `Acceptance' models state that Jesus Christ is truly `a' Savior, but, not the only Savior.  These two models press the point people and their cultures are more different than they are alike and there is no one truth that will apply to everyone.  There is no such thing as \\"one absolute truth.\\"<br /><br />Throughout the book Knitter reiterates that at the heart of Christianity is the question of whom Jesus is.  In every model Knitter returns to this foundational question. Ultimately, for the `Pluralistic' and `Acceptance' models  Jesus Christ is the stumbling block.<br /><br />But then if, in the case of the `Exclusivistic' model and `Inclusivistic' models Christian insist that Jesus Christ is the only Savior for all humankind, and that in Jesus God's expression is final . . .  then there will be really can be no dialogue, nor relationship with other faiths.  Jesus Christ, is in effect the crux of the book.<br /><br />Knitter is always fair and balanced, and writes in a down-to-earth manner in which layman and professionals alike will grasp more clearly the problems and nuances that are to be found in the current state theologies of religions.  Refreshingly, there is  no theological bashing of other models as you find in authors such as Herold Netland.  He states at the beginning of his book, \\"My task is to describe and analyze, not take sides,\\" this he does admirably. He has done a brilliant job in outlining the various approaches that Christian theology uses to engage other faiths.  His introduction to \\"Theologies of Religion\\" is a resplendent work.Highly recommended.Highly recommended.	2005-06-23

Life is filled with Suffering	Gotama (Buddha) was convinced that life was dukkha: filled with pain, grief and sorrow.<br /><br />Karen Armstong's writing is very comprehensible and discerning.  She correctly understands Buddhism as an \\"essentially psychological religion\\".  In this short, 187-page book, she discusses the life of Buddha and his quest to free himself from greed, ignorance (self-deception) and hatred.  This quest brought him to Nibbana, where self no longer exists and pain is vanquished (Narvana).<br /><br />Armstrong is very helpful in reminding the reader that Gotama existed in a historical context that was full of men and women seeking enlightenment.  His time was one of social change, spiritual upheaval and he was one of many seeking an inner-direction, a place of peace.<br /><br />Yet, this compelling and illuminating biography critically critiques Gotama's misogamist tendencies.  He was, says Armstrong, a man full of negative feeling about women and their abilities.  He initially refused to admit women to the Sangha, but after much pressure he gave his permission, but not without harsh restrictions.  Women had to accept eight strict rules and \\"the nuns were an inferior breed,\\" says Armstrong.  For example the first rule was that a nun must always stand when in the presence of a male bhikkhu, even one who was young or newly ordained.  The other seven rules are equally degrading.<br /><br />This is an excellent biography on Buddha that will open up his life and teaching to the general public.  Highly recommended	2005-06-01

Tom Levinson's quest is to talk to a kaleidoscope of Americans about their religions and their faiths.  `All That's Holy' highlights the religious plurality that can be found in America today, from the fundamentalist to the funky `Coffee Messiah'.  Tom's writing, while not gripping is engaging, informative and colorful.  His vignettes and insights offer lessons to learn, \\"We are all backpackers in this world.\\"<br /><br />Beware, that this book is like taking a cross-country GREYHOUND bus trip.  You climb aboard with anticipations, initially you are enchanted with the world that passes by, but after a time the scenery pans into a blur, and the images are no longer unique and the tedium returns.  Ultimately, after 300 plus pages, and with only a momentary interruption by the sensational, I found myself both relieved and happy to have reached the end. Recommended.	2005-05-17

I have used this guide for towns and places that other guides don't even list.  Each time the information was accurate and trustworthy.  If you are staying on the \\"tourist track\\" then Frommer's Peru description of sights to see is more informative and descriptive, and its restaurant recommendations are better selections.<br /><br />Rachowiecki and Beech have done a superb job on collecting, organizing and explaining both the essential information and the unique aspects about this alluring culture. Rachowiecki is an avid bird watcher and inveterate traveler who has covered this country top to bottom.  The city maps are good, and plentiful.<br /><br />Do read their \\"snapshot\\" section (pg. 23) which will give you an update on the social situation in Peru.  Rachowiecki and Beech's critique of the pathetic performance of this government is \\"spot on.\\"  President Toledo has achieved the infamous notoriety of having  lowest approval rating in Andean history - 9%!  Because of the impotent government, and the frustration among the people, there is a likelihood that you will encounter strikes and protest.  For the past two years strikes have been common.  That said, do  not be afraid to travel here, tourism is the sacred llama of Peru, and tourists are, by-and-large, safe, but, do check the State Department web site for travel warnings.  Note that the traveler's information section is buried at the back of the book.<br /><br />All most all accommodations have an email address, but strangely no webpage address.  None of the restaurants have a webpage listing, though, in 2005, many of the top restaurants have excellent web pages explaining their menu and prices, along with maps and enticing photos.  The cost for each accommodation and restaurant is listed in dollars, instead of the insipid icons that other guides use. Kudos!!!  Because of the fall of the dollar against the `Sol', you will need to add at least 10% to the quoted price for hotels.<br /><br />Also, consider these three travelogues that will enhance your time in Peru: \\"Aguirre\\" by Stephen Minta, \\"White Rock\\" by Hugh Thomson and \\"Chasing Che\\" by Patrick Symmes.

The only mystery in the book is what took Jake so long to get his libido focused.  Allie Parker; is the willing to take risks,  ultramodern, young beautiful heroine, who struggles against Jake until their lips meet.<br /><br />Of course there is an ultimate objective, but it is interrupted by frequent episodes of passionate sex.  Allie's  character keeps the adventure (and Jake) moving forward at a hot pace.  To say, as Kat Martin did, that \\"Allie shoved the bacon around the skillet\\" is an understatement.<br /><br />Though `Hot Rain' offers no new twists, and has few surprises, and though it uses the happy sunset ending, the story is none-the-less an enjoyable and engaging read. You will find this romance/suspense  novel a great `escape' read.	2005-04-27

His irreverent understanding of his military time, as seen though the eyes of an enlisted GI, have the satire and wit that made the TV series `Mash' a favorite of millions. \\"Inspections were, for those forced to participate in them, absurd, excruciating, a waste of time, and a pain in the ass.

The more intolerant the religious teachings, the more exclusive the cultic claims, the more imperialistic a religion becomes, the higher probability that it is heading in the wrong direction;  and soon, if unchecked, our world will feel the effects of its evil.<br /><br />Charles Kimball recalls the history of evil that deranged religion have brought to our world.<br /><br />His stories of suffering induced by religious fanatics bring home the importance of this book. Kimball shows how the Crusades of the Middle Ages, the  9-11 attack on the USA, the unabated killing in Israel and Palestine, the mass suicides and attacks on society by followers of cultic, charismatic leaders like, David Koresh, Jim Jones and Asahara Shoko are all integrals to religion(s) gone amuck.  The recounting of these world events alone makes the book an engaging read.<br /><br />Kimball favors the major world religions, and especially those that are oriented toward the \\"golden rule\\" and seeking the transcendent.  Christianity and Islam get the lion share of the writing, due to their size, world influence, monotheism and their history of conflicts and carnage.<br /><br />His writing  is clear, straight foreword, and unencumbered by religious jargon.  This is a helpful guide for study groups, for high school and college introductory classes, and for all of us trying to understand the dark side of the world in which we live.	2005-04-27

After evaluating the response, God then \\"calls\\" again, waiting for creation to respond, and thus the cycle continues, ad infinitum.  This is the `process' in `process theology'.  God's actions, Suchocki says,  \\"depend upon creaturely response.\\"<br /><br />Suchocki uses `process theology' to advance her argument that `diversity of religions' exist because various cultures have, through the eons, responded differently to God.  The diverse expressions of religions in the world exist in response to God.  Every culture, every language, every belief, and thus every religious creed was created from unique response to God.  Thus God is the author of every religious expression in the world today, and therefore every religion should be acknowledged as a God initiated religion.<br /><br />Regarding Christianity, Suchocki believes that the task of the Church is not to convert the world to Jesus Christ, but rather to invite the others to cooperate collectively to bring compassion and common good to our world.  She challenges all faiths (especially Christians) to reach out to each other in a spirit of dialogue and friendship.  For Schocki, when a world community of peace exists, then the \\"Reign of God\\" has come.  Out of these encounters a friendship will grow and works of mercy can begin.  She contends that in a world plagued by hatred, \\"to not engage religiously in global friendship is to cede the world to forces of evil.\\"  \\"We live in a world of diversity,\\" says Suchocki, \\"and are richer because of it.\\"<br /><br />A significant shortcoming is the book's lack of an index.  In \\"Divinity and Diversity\\" Suchocki has given the reader a solid apologetic that stresses that religious pluralism is part of the design that God has for this world.

I was in need of a fast refresher course on Buddhism as my college course, \\"Comparative Religions\\", taken in the early seventies, had seriously faded.<br /><br />The information in this book is rudimentary, and though the information stimulated dormant brain cells there was no new insights added.  The photos and maps (showing the world influence of each religion) are superb.  The writing is clear and easy to understand (most teenagers would easily grasp the concepts).  Each chapter lays out information about the basic dogma of each religion, and deals with such issues as the role of women, afterlife (exception being Judaism), holidays and important sacred text.  Yet, this guide would have had been more informative if it included charts and gave the readers contemporary illustrations of each faith (ie sidebars that give biographic sketches of today's `leaders and shakers' in each faith).

For Klauser writing something down brings the force of the universe towards you to help you receive your goals.  Write it down and it will happen.<br /><br />She recalls various life stories to illustrate how a needy soul took this principle and wrote down their wishes, hopes and dreams; then, almost supernaturally, these dreams became reality.  In one story she tells how a woman looking, longing for her soul-mate, wrote down, in detail, what her what her dream man would be.

He also shows how these very countries are determined not to let them in.<br /><br />The book is in three sections: The Immigrants, The Smugglers and the Authorities.<br /><br />In each section, McGill uses his journalistic skills, highlighting the human side of all concerned.  He writes intelligently about the plight of those who want a better life and freedom from oppression, about the greed of the highly organized criminals that run the trafficking engine, and notes the frustration of the authorities who are professionally trained, competent and often hamstrung by politics.<br /><br />The desperate stories of the illegal are gripping and graphic.  Few who read this book, if they were in the same situation would not try to find a better life.  You will read the stories of the lowlife, scumbags who make billions (not just millions) of dollars trafficking human flesh.  These syndicates (often connected with the Police and Military in Asia) actually laugh at the often-feeble attempt that nations put up to stop trafficking.<br /><br />More than about the sex trade or slaves, McGill writes about \\"illegal\\" entry into various nations and the journey that it takes such a brave and frantic soul.  In the USA alone (2002 statistics) there were 9 to 13 million illegal aliens (mostly Mexicans) living in the country.  Each day tens of thousands attempt to cross the porous border.<br /><br />Now, post 9/11, the book points out a few of the efforts that more vigilant countries have taken to curb the movement of millions of people per year who want in.  Most of the 9/11 terrorists were in the USA because of a seriously flawed department of immigration management system.  Nothing is mentioned in the book about this.<br /><br />Now there is a good chance that millions of the `illegals' in the US will be granted legal status by President Bush.  This blatant political action would make a sham out of the existing legal immigration programs that honest applicants go through legally, often waiting years, to get in the USA legally.  Bush's legalization of illegal aliens sends the message to all seeking to enter the USA \\"Why try to be honest and legal when it is easier to arrive illegally and get a politically motivated pardon later.\\"<br /><br />McGill's book is not about just immigration into the USA.  He also shows how England, Germany and Australia have greater immigration problems that the USA does.  He points out that a few, like Norway and Australia, have seriously tightened up their program and clamped down on illegal entry into their countries.<br /><br />This is a quick, short airplane read and it would be a great introduction for High School and College students.  The general populace will find his writing clear and engaging. The book has a discernable bias for the illegal needing to get in.  More so than the right of nations to defend and protect their own populace and boarders.

He reread the copy of telex he was about to send to Adelman in New York, detailing printing and shipping cost.\\"  After more than 100 pages of nothing happening (zero, zilch), then I realized that the title of the book was true to form.  The `make-believe' is what you must do.  It is the readers responsibility to create the action, develop the characters into more than the two-dimensional cardboard standups that Barrett makes them,  and it is also up to the reader to make the book `come alive' because Dean Barrett is not going to do so.<br /><br />The author does not give you any discernment into Thailand's  Buddhistic way of life,  nor will you have a better understanding of Thailand' rich history.  Why Barrett used the word `Kingdom' in the book's title is the only mystery in the book.  Thailand is no more a `kingdom' than England is.  Thailand is a democracy, not a Kingdom.  If you read this book you will end up knowing nothing more about this unique country than when you started; sad but true.<br /><br />You can, quite easily put this book down.  So save yourself the disappointment and get a fantastic thriller/detective novel about Thailand today; a book that will give you insight on both the culture and the Buddhist philosophy of life:  read  \\"Bangkok 8\\" by John Burdett (highly recommended - see my review).  I do not recommend this book.	2005-02-27

It has an excellent section titled, \\"Facts about Thailand\\", that introduces you to this exotic country and its section \\"Facts for Visitors\\" (Visas, money, health etc.) maybe the best out in a Thailand guide.  The accommodations recommendations are reliable and normally good.  Both accommodation and restaurant prices are given in Bahts (much better than Rough Guides 1-9 numbers), but because the guide is slightly dated (2003) the information is about three years old by now and you will have to adjust the prices by at least 20%.<br /><br />Bangkok is a huge sprawling city, much like Los Angeles, and this guide logically separates the six regions within the city that you are most likely to visit.  You will find the map, hotel and restaurant recommendations and sites closer together than Rough Guide, but neither guide makes it easy to navigate this concrete jungle.<br /><br />The maps in Lonely Planet are plentiful but more difficult to decipher than in the Rough Guide's maps.  Good, easy to use maps are critical, especially when you are trying to find a recommended restaurant while the 95 degree heat saps your patience, the traffic and noise assaults your senses and your frustration grows with this guide.  Becuase of the tiny, small print, the small 1/3 page map that is designed to covers 5 square miles of Bangkok you turn the book 360 degrees and scream (don't work your voice will not be heard amongst the din).  This is a important area that needs tweaking.<br /><br />Rough Guide (see my review) does a much better job with restaurant recommendations than Lonely Planet.  This guide will list a restaurant and write something banal about the place, like \\"has Thai food\\" and leave it at that - \\"duh\\".  Occasionally, the guide sticks out its neck and says something risqu&eacute; like; \\"has good food\\".  Seldom, does the guide commend a dish to try.  \\"Rough Guide\\" both tells you why they recommended the restaurant, i.e. \\"relaxed riverfront eatery under bamboo shelters... marinated pork or chicken\\", and often tells you what dish you should try, \\"the chef's signature green peppercorn sauce served with steak, chicken or duck.\\"  This is what good \\"guides\\" are supposed to do, guide you.  Another area that needs tweaking.<br /><br />If you are going to go to Bangkok, Chang Mai or Chang Rai then this guide would be my first choice.  If you are going throughout Thailand and will not spend time in Bangkok then consider Rough Guide first.  Finally, if you are going to do the sun and surf  (Southern Thailand) and not go north of Bangkok then `Lonely Planet Thailand's Islands and Beaches' is the book to have (see my review).ce, like \\"has Thai food\\" and leave it at that - \\"duh\\".

I just returned from Thailand and I took four guides: Thomas Cook's,  Lonely Planet, Let's Go, and this guide (see my reviews on the others guides, and do seriously consider Lonely Planet Islands & Beaches IF you are only going to spend time as a sun lizard).<br /><br />`Thomas Cook Thailand' is a special niche guide, best suited for those with tour groups and `Let's Go Thailand' is the guide for those backpackers that are `on the cheap'. This leaves Rough Guide to face off with Lonely Planet and in some areas it is superior to L.P and in one big area it is not.<br /><br />Rough Guide's restaurant recommendations are by far the best of any guide I reviewed; they are both reliable and informative, giving great descriptions and dish recommendations, \\"the grilled river prawns with chili, the matsaman curry and the delicious durian cheese-cake.\\"  The restaurant prices are listed as: Expensive, Moderate and Inexpensive.<br /><br />The hotel accommodations recommendations are also descriptive, very reliable and most have either webpage addresses or email.  Sadly, Rough Guide still uses the user 'unfriendly' price codes, instead of just saying in dollars (or Bahts) what the cost for the hotel is.  Thus you need to memorize the table where the number 4=400-600B and 5=600-900B etc., then you can convert to either dollars or euros to get the price.  Also, since the Guide is published in 2004 (thus the information is from 2003) you add 10-20% for inflation.  Both Lonely Planet and Let's Go just tell you what the price is.  \\"Duh\\".<br /><br />The Guide has excellent information that tells you the nitty-gritty that prepairs you for your trip.  It also has great history, religion (Buddhism of course), environmental and cultural sections.  Not to be missed is the additional reading recommendations (six pages).<br /><br />Where it bombs is BANGKOK.  The Guide says that Bangkok is \\"sprawling, chaotic and exhausting\\" and that is exactly how I experienced the 115 pages that covered this mega-city.  The layout is dysfunctional.  It has no logical consistency between any two points.  Bangkok is the home of 11 million people; it is huge and spreads out like greater Los Angeles.  It needs to be broken down into regions and then sections and those need to be logically kept together.  But, this guide will give you information on one area, like Thanon Sukhumvit, then 60 pages later the accommodations for that area, then 20 pages back will be the Thanon Sukhumvit map; but wait, the restaurants for that area... you guessed it, will be located some where else.  Hello!  Who laid this out?  What herb, pray tell, were they using?  So, if you plan to spend any significant time in Bangkok, then Lonely Planet is a better guide.<br /><br />Maybe the 6th edition Rough Guide will improve the Bangkok section and hopefully increased the guides paltry index (8 pages for all of Thailand - Bangkok alone could be 8 pages) and make this an outstanding guide.

But, the title is more engaging than the detective story it leads.  The story itself reads more like the script from the movie, \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\".  After reading it I thought `Barrett could make a good screenwriter for a Loony Tunes sequel...  \\"It all started with that phone call.  I wish now I had never answered it.  But I did.  And right away I could tell something was wrong from the tremor in the voice on the phone.  `You're tremoring', I said.\\"<br /><br />I bought  `Murder at the Horny Toad Bar' to take with me on a business trip (really!) to Thailand.  I bought it as a good diversion from the in-flight movies that United Airlines carefully selects from last year's movies that bombed at the box office.  Look, I am not ragging on airline movies; I can squint with the other 443 economy class sardines, and with them try to make out the images on the 9\\" color-challenged monitor.  From my seat, 20 feet away, when I squinted with intent, I swear the image was `Nemo' swimming home (my 5th time with this movie).  However, saving my eyesight, I started to read `Murder at the Horny Toad Bar'.<br /><br />His `Horny Toad Bar' story is one of several escapades (erotic/exotic and oversexed) that you will be privy to.  So, if you are looking an escape, with a Thai flavor, or if you are want to know more about Bangkok life (it can be outrageous) seen from below the belt; then Barrett provides a lot of vistas from that vantage point.  But, if you are in the market for a great (excellent) Bangkok detective story, then by all means get `Bangkok 8' by John Burdett - (see my review).  And, if \\"Horny Toad Bar\\" may be too risqu&eacute; for you, then consider getting the highly recommended, \\"Travelers' Tales: Thailand\\" (see my review).	2005-02-23

Let's Go is the budget back-packers handbook.  Of the three guidebooks I have just reviewed on Thailand (Lonely Planet, Rough Guide), I found that Let's Go excels at helping you find the best of the \\"cheap\\" restaurants, and bargain basement hostels and hovels (occasionally hotels).  Also, if you are considering camping in Thailand then this guide excels in this category.<br /><br />Extremely impressive is the section titled \\"Alternatives to Tourism\\" where scores of NGO (non government organizations) are listed.  Of the three guidebooks Let's Go has the best source for volunteering in Thailand.  Conservation organizations, medical organizations, urban and rural development organizations are all listed.  If you want to study in Thailand this guide has many school listings.  Also, its history section is succinct and stellar.<br /><br />Where the guide runs third is in the quality and quantity of maps, it has fewer accommodations and restaurants recommended, and its description of sights that you will be seeing is cursory..  For example the famous, must see, Bangkok Wat Phra Kaew (Temple of the Emerald Buddha) and the Grand Palace received only 3 paragraphs in this guide, Rough Guide gives you five pages of description.  Extremely tacky are the ads found in the guide that promote everything from clothing to guesthouses.  Bad.<br /><br />If you are strapped for cash and going to travel Thailand on the `cheep' then this guide along with \\"Travels' Tales Thailand' (see my review) should be in your knapsack.

If you are going to Bangkok there are two things that you should have for your flight: a seat cushion for the 23-hour flight and `Bangkok 8'.  This is one of most gripping detective thrillers I have read in years.  Not only is it a startling exoticum, but Burdett sheds cultural insight regarding the seamy streets of Bangkok better that any guide I took with me.  When I arrived in the city of 10 million, Bangkok was more than a grid locked, sprawling Asian city, as much as it was the setting for this story.  Strange but true.<br /><br />John Burdett delivers characters like that of Detective Sonchai Jitpleecheep, son of a prostitute, and one of the few honest cops in Bangkok, that are fantastically unique.  So much that you may want to look him up while you're there.  Good luck.  His writing mixes Buddhism and brothels, incarnations and transvestites, all of these, and a very attractive FBI agent (Kimberly Jones), stay with you to the end.<br /><br />Within a few pages you will be thick into the mire and mystery.  Burdett throws you a murder so macabre, so bazaar, that you wonder how did he ever think this up.  The last chapter is anti-climatic, but the novel's integrity is solid.  He is a master tale-spinner and I am looking forward to his next intriguing novel.  Highly recommended	2005-02-23

Travel is not about the destination but about experiencing new worlds.  Few of us travel to see more museums, churches, temples (wats) or sights; but rather we travel to experience the zing & zang that life has to offer.  Few countries are as exotic as Thailand and to make sense of this intriguing travel destination every suitcase heading for this country should have a copy of this book.<br /><br />Thailand can beguile even the most seasoned traveler.  The stories that O'Reilly has selected here capture the ethos of Thailand, and help you to understand the inner essence of the Thai culture: whether the story is about one of the estimated ½ million prostitutes (Love in a Duty-Free Zone), or the mind behind the neon orange garb of a Theravada Buddhist monk (A Mediator's Initiation), or the Thai food, that vacillates from the sweetness of coconut milk to the incendiary heat of the chilies (A Cooking School in Bangkok), all of this and more is covered in this text.<br /><br />Regardless, where or why you visit Thailand you should have this book to read on the interminable flight to Bangkok.  Add a great guide (Lonely Planet or Rough Guide) and the electrifying, mystery/thriller \\"Bangkok 8\\" by John Burdett (see my reviews) and you will be set.  Highly recommended	2005-02-23

A special `niche' guide to Thailand<br /><br />Thailand will satisfy even the most jaded traveler's hunger for the exotic, erotic, beautiful and unusual.  Ben Davis knows this and has provided a `niche' travel guide for Thomas Cook.  `Niche' because this is not a travel guide in the normal sense.<br /><br />I have reviewed five guides this year on Thailand, and truth be known, I struggled with how to write a review on this guide; it just doesn't fit the normal `travel guide' fare.<br /><br />Traditionally, travel guides answer the basic questions: where, when, what, how and how much.  They are indispensable for those who are independent minded, and normally not a member of a packaged tour group.  Traditional travel guides are written for those who want practical information that will help them navigate and richly experience the country.<br /><br />Traditional guides have scores of restaurant and hotel recommendations with the estimated price breakdowns.  This guide does not.  Traditional guides have good maps of  the country regions and cities; along with travel information that makes exploring Thailand enjoyable.  This guide does not.  Traditional guides will add cultural and experiential insights to their standard fare.  Right: this guide does not.<br /><br />What this guide does is give you  hundreds of excellent color photo that explode Thailand before your eyes.  Ben Davis tight and terse writing complements the photos and he does recommend what to see before you leave Thailand.  His walking maps (and recommendations) for Bangkok and Chiang Mai are very good.  At the end of the book is a good, but basic general information section.<br /><br />So where is the `niche'.  This guide is  recommended for those who are with a packaged tour group, and want  a quick, vivid, photo sketch of this fantastic country.  So if you do not need to know where to stay or eat, and don't want to read pages of history but want only a brief summary of what's what, this is your guide; all others should consider Lonely Planet or Rough Guide, both highly recommended  (see my reviews).s is your guide; all others should consider Lonely Planet or Rough Guide, both highly recommended  (see my reviews).	2005-02-23

Faith, according to Stella \\"has more to do with God incarnate in life and relationship that it does with affirming the existence of a Supreme Being\\".<br /><br />His writing style comes across as if you told `Father Stella' that you had serious doubts about the creeds of the Catholic Church, at which point he would smile, sit you down, and say, \\"Doubt is a part of faith, and there is no reason to think of yourself as deficient if you have doubts.\\"  Then one by one he goes through key theologies telling you about how he has doubts too, and how he now believes.<br /><br />However, about half way through the book you realize that Stella is still very much `Father' Stella and is still a priest of the Church (unlike Karen Armstrong, ex-nun, who questions and rejects the Catholic Church, Stella chooses to stay in and with the church).  Though, in this book he questions the  creeds of the church by the end of the text you know he is still very much a man of the cloth.  This attempt to mix water and oil can be a bit confusing, and sometimes noticeably contradicting.  On one hand he states that \\"God is not definable, confinable, not a person\\", but rather.... \\"who I am\\".  Thus, you and God are one.  However, in his chapter on `Prayer' he changes nothing from the church's teachings.  Thus, you pray to a God `out there', \\"we must be willing to express to God who and how we are.\\"  You will find these discrepancies throughout the book..<br /><br />The book is a fast, easy read that will help those that are struggling with their faith (regardless if they are Catholic or Protestant).  In the New Testament the disciple Matthew wrote that, after the resurrection, the disciples went to meet Jesus, they fell on their face and worshiped him \\"but some doubted\\" 28:17.  If there is a single core message it is: Don't hide your doubts, rather `doubt' boldly.he disciples went to meet Jesus, they fell on their face and worshiped him \\"but some doubted\\" 28:17.

Her love, then hate, then finally acceptance of the Catholic Church and Christianity, is omnipresent throughout the book.<br /><br />\\"I wanted to find God\\" Armstrong states.  And so with unflinching honesty, she wrote this memoir about her search through the labyrinths of religions.  Her title (from T.S. Eliot poem `Ash Wednesday) describes her climb out of despair, regrets, setbacks, medical misdiagnoses, academic failures and religion, and how she slowly, painfully, emerges from her darkness to find  international success as a writer about religions.<br /><br />For Karen, \\"Religion is not about accepting 20 impossible propositions before breakfast, but about doing things that change you\\"  and by the end of the book, she concludes, that ultimately, God maybe `Nothing':  \\"Perhaps in our broken world we can only envisions an absent God.  Maybe the only revelation we can hope for now is an experience of absence and emptiness.  The best theologians and teachers have never been afraid to admit that in the last resort, there may be `Nothing' out there.\\"<br /><br />Throughout the book she doesn't let you forget that she was a nun, damaged by the system, yet because of friends, mentors and a commitment to her spiritual quest, she prevails.  Karen Armstrong has a soul-mate with Elaine Pagels [Beyond Belief] and the legions of others who struggle with the dogmas of Christianity and other religions.

There are definitely better	Of the three guides that I took with me to South American (Footprint, Rough Guide and this guide) all have their strengths and weak points: Fodor's has more of the latter.<br /><br />Fodor's South America guide excels as a business person's  guide.  Its usefulness is limited to a few principal cities in each country and the main tourist attractions.  Fodor's  recommendations of hotels and restaurants are normally well worth heeding, and this was often the primary reason  I used this guide; however, I need to caveat this point.<br /><br />I am a firm believer that any guide book worth its salt has many `easy to read' maps - Fodor's does not.  Location maps, help you to locate the recommended restaurant (or hotel) listed in the guide and are essential to all guides.  Fodor has location maps ONLY for 7 cities out of the10  countries that are profiled in the book (FYI - there are thirteen countries in South America).  This guide has NO OTHER location maps.  A serious failure.<br /><br />This is a 2004 publication (thus the information was gathered in 2002 & 2003, normal for guides) and Fodor's does list the webpage of `most' of the hotel in profiles, but none of the recommended restaurants have their web listing included, and in today's Internet world, most all of the upscale restaurants have a web page with photos, menus and prices.<br /><br />Finally, the layout was more cumbersome to use than either Footprint or Rough Guide.  The guide does not separate their recommended accommodations and restaurants. The guide uses a quirky, icon dollar sign rating to delineate the cost of accommodations and restaurants, so you flip back to the legend to remember how much $$$ was, BUT, that reference changes in every country.  So three $$$ dollar signs equal one amount in Peru but a different amount in Paraguay.  A hassle indeed, it would be much more sensible just to tell the reader what the cost of rooms or food will be in dollars.  Keep it simple Fodor's.<br /><br />For those that will actually explore South America Rough Guide is my first choose,  [see my review] followed closely by Footprint.  Fodor's is an `also-ran' guide.

Foster Perry is a self-professed modern shaman.  He is the son of a pragmatic scientist (physician), yet he chose a radically different path from that of his father.<br /><br />Since the sub-title of the book is `Shamanic Journeys in the Amazon' I took this book with me into the Amazon with the hope that Perry would shed insight into the Amazonian Shamans (remarkably different from the Shamans of the Andes) -- NOT.  The Amazon is just one of many places he goes to search for shamanistic enlightenment.  Foster Perry's \\"other world\\" experiences makes episodes of the Twilight Zone seem like Reality T.V., and his various psychotropic drug experiences would warm the heart of Timothy Leary.<br /><br />Perry's egocentric writing is often as distracting as it is distasteful;  i.e. \\"When I finished speaking the audience leaped out of their chairs and gave ME a thundering ovation.  They stormed the stage to shake MY hand.  I felt the presence of Sophia and Archangel Michael in MY aura.... the swarming mass of bodies pressed against me.\\"  When you think there is no hope for him he goes on to tell you how he learned to be humble.  He is so humble that he will tell you so.  The coup de grâce is where he compares himself to Christ and tells how he sacrificed himself for \\"the sake of my tour group\\".<br /><br />Besides his vainglory writing style, his \\"other world\\" babble is both tiring and confusing,  i.e. \\"I entered the mysteries in the agora... I was detached on my pilgrimage and then suddenly I experienced the taste of the pineal opening and my ears began to whistle\\" ad infinitum.  There is nothing in this book that is recommendable.  In one word - Avoid.	2005-01-09

As a travelogue the book is both insightful and engaging. As a history excellent; as it retraces the tragic and doomed journey of  Pedro de Ursua and Lope de Aguirre through across the South American continent (1560).  This book chronicles one of the most bizarre mutinies to rock 16th Century South America.  He narrates the grandiose ambition and blinding pride that gripped Spanish Peru in the 16th century; not forgetting to lauds as well the \\"clever, ruthless and courageous\\" men and women that invaded and then settled South America.<br /><br />Stephen Minta, British, and a Senior Lecturer in Comparative Literature at the University of York, writes brilliantly about Peru in the late 1980's and early 1990's (Peru hasn't changed that much since).  His writing is full if insights into human nature, and has the occasional biting satire, tongue-in-cheek humor and a candid and critical evaluation of an applaudable  travelogue.<br /><br />This book is in the company of the best modern South America travelogues/history (IE White Rock by Hugh Thomson and Chasing Che by Patrick Symmes - see my reviews).  For afficionados and students of South America (especially Peru) this book is a must read.  Highly recommended.	2005-01-09

I took this guide with me to Peru 9-09.  For the last nine years I have lived in, and traveled throughout Peru.  Frommer's keep surprising me with new relevant information about Peru.  Kudos.  Especially informative is Frommer's first section: \\"What's New in Peru\\".  In Frommer's the Cusco, the Machu Pichu and the Inca Trail section alone take up 100 pages and the information is excellent.  If you are going only to these locations then this portion of the guide is reason enough to buy Frommer's.  Also, for ornithologists (bird watchers too) Peru is one of the greatest countries on earth and Frommer's has good coverage on how, where and with whom.<br /><br />In the world of Peru guides (this year I have reviewed five) there are two types of guides; those guides that are written for the wandering/explorer/backpacker who wants travel to the normal visitors' sites, but will also go `off the beaten track'  (Footprint, Let's Go and Lonely Planet [the best is LP, see my reviews]), and then there are the guides for the traveler who like comfort, have money and will visit only the main tourist attractions: Cusco [Machu Pichu], Puno [Lake Titicaca], Arequipa [Colca Canyon], Lima, Iquitos and the lines at Nazca ... this is where Fodor's and Frommer's fit.<br /><br />Frommer's is much better than Fodor's in many aspects, and in comparison to all the guides, Frommer's excels in  providing you with the important and essential information needed to plan your trip (entry requirements, health, travel resources, when to go, suggested itineraries, recommended reading, etc.).  Thus, if you are staying on the tourist route then you will do well to have this guide in your knapsack.<br /><br />Frommer's recommendations of restaurants in Cusco is much better than the 2005 guide but still not what it should be.  'Cicciolina' restaurant is a must, but on the other hand the 'Inca Grill' is expensive, so-so food and targets the tourist trade.  Check out tripadvisor online for current eateries or ask a local professional where they eat.  Take care when asking the local guides for restaurant recommendations, as they will normally direct you to a tourist restaurant and thereby get a free meal and commission from the restaurant.<br /><br />If you are NOT exploring Peru or going off the beaten-path this is a very good guide.  For those that desire to go down the road-less-traveled get Lonely Planet.  Frommer's Peru is Strongly Recommended 4.5 Starseck out tripadvisor online for current eateries or ask a local professional where they eat.

She succeeds at presenting a perspective (how-be-it liberal and feminististic) from which to understand the lives, and characteristics, of the \\"sex workers.\\"  She argues that these women's lives are highly conditioned by pre existing gender meanings produced by a traditional patriarchal system \\"that aims to marginalize and control the prostitute\\".  Commendable is how she lives with the women during the work hours (in a reasonable manner) and thus was able to become `close' with various \\"women who prostitute\\" and journal their life stories.<br /><br />The weakness of her investigation is that she does not adequately show the interrelationship between the prostitutes and the Peruvian society, i.e. family, neighbors, friends, and other groups (for example, social, political, religious).  All of the rich social life that exist within this traditional Latin American society is glossed over.  This is the very  the disposition of ethnography.<br /><br />I have lived in Peru for seven years and my yearning to know more about the ethnography of this<br /><br />country was the primary reason for buying this book.  I was disappointed.  However, if I was working the streets of any major city as a social worker or religious worker (Salvation Army, etc.) this book would be a valuable find.  In short, Nencel's sociological understanding of prostitution is the strength of this dissertation (4 stars), but the ethnography (anthropology) regarding Peru is disappointing (2 stars).

Shootings, stabbings, robberies, stake-outs, walking the beat, cruising in patrol cars, it's all here in this vivid black and blue memoir.  Conlon deftly blends prose with cons in a way that most writers would envy.  Though  the book weighs in at a whopping 2 pounds (560 pages), the rapid-fire stories will enthrall you with the manic world of Conlon's life as a New York city cop.<br /><br />Like a good cop TV series (NYPD) or the best cop movies (Serpico, French Connection, Narc, Training Day) `Blue Blood' takes you into to a world that for most is both foreign and frightening.  Conlon's writing is crackling sharp and rich with the dialogue of all kinds: from  criminals, junkies, crack heads and cops.  You will feel the frustration that NYPD cops go through; not just from the decrepit criminals they deal with, but, because of the dysfunctional bureaucracy and small minded `brass' that plagues mega-city police departments that harass them.  You will realize, as Conlon did,  \\"The job is not your friend.\\"  What is amazing is how Conlon and his 37,000 police comrades continue to do their job, a job that this book brilliantly captures.<br /><br />Those who are enthralled with police stories, those who are fans of TV police shows, and especially those that are considering police work as a profession will feel lucky that Conlon gave them a window into his world.  This is the best written big city cop biography in print today.  `Blue Blood' is a  great book that I  highly recommended.  4.5 stars.	2005-01-09

There are those guides that are written for the wandering/explorer/backpacker, the vagabond who will travel to the normal visitors' sites, but will also go 'off the beaten track'.  The guides that target this type of traveler are: Footprint, Let's Go, and Lonely Planet [see my reviews].<br /><br />Then there are the guides that target the traveler who doesn't own a backpack, has money (or least a credit card without a limit) and plans to visit only the main tourist attractions, i.e. Cusco [Machu Pichu], Puno [Lake Titicaca], Arequipa [Colca Canyon], and the lines at Nazca.  Often these travelers are part of a tour group.  The two Peruvian guides that target these travelers are Fodor's and Frommer's [see my Frommer's review].<br /><br />Fodor's, though dated as a 2004 guide, is more out-of-date and incomplete than the other guides.  For example, the guide's listing of 'North American Airlines' omits both United and Delta.  Both have been in Peru for the past four years.  The guide states that gasoline cost $2 a gallon (wrong). It was $2 a gallon in 2001, now it is well over $3 a gallon.  More important are the quotes of restaurant's prices, in actuality the meals cost me twice what the guide quotes (hotels were about 20% more than the range quoted).<br /><br />Though Fodor's does list the webpage of most hotels, none of the restaurants had a web listing (now all most every good restaurant has a web page with menu, prices and photos).<br /><br />However, the most serious failure by Fodor's is its omission of location maps.  These maps are very important when you are in a new city, and want to locate the nearest restaurant (or hotel) that the guide has recommended.  Fodor's only has location maps for Lima (the last place that should be on your 'must see' list). Even Cusco, visited by 95% of all foreign tourists, has no restaurant/hotel location map, so you are on your own and this guide is very much \\"out to lunch\\" (pun noted).  This is a serious omission.<br /><br />This surprises me for normally Fodor's guides are great (I have reviewed over a dozen Fodor's guides).  The guide does have very good itineraries and walking guides, and its recommendations for restaurants are worth following, but the other shortcomings make this guide only 'conditionally recommended. So, if you are not the backpacker type and want  a very good upscale guide, Frommer's guide is your guide.our 'must see' list).

To journey is to see other worlds, to experience other cultures and to acknowledge your own connectedness in this transitory  world.<br /><br />In 1995 Patrick Symmes left on a motorcycle journey across South America to chase the ghost of Ernesto Guevara -- 'Che'.  In this absorbing travel journal Symmes retraces 'Che's' 1952 South America motorcycle adventure.  He knocks on the doors of strangers, turns over rocks and does detective diligence.  Yet, as Symmes found out, chasing ghosts can be extremely arduous, especially if the haunted house has been torn down and replaced by condos.  In the last fifty years South America has morphized, and all that is left of 'Che' is his legion and what has been  printed on T-shirts.<br /><br />Symmes' writing is provocative, informative and enjoyable: \\"Chasing curves over a swelling landscape, a motorcycle enters the pure expression of physics and is bound to the road in a way no car will ever know.  The raw force of the engine is not hidden beneath a hood, but alternately purrs and grows a few inches from the knees, demanding the consciousness of power.  A rider on two wheels can taste moments of oneness with the road.\\"  I have spent the past 9 years traveling in South America and Symmes' writing captures the distinct spirit of the people of Argentina, Chile, Peru, and to a lesser degree Bolivia.  The search for 'Che' is the  golden thread (or for you bikers, the tire tread) that keeps this travel journal on track.  Especially enjoyable is Symmes' history of each of the countries that he travels through.  Highly recommended for those that are going to visit South American and students of Ernesto Guevara.	2004-10-30

Brad Thor's first novel has all the characters needed: a squirrelly V.P., scoundrel Senators, Swiss mercenaries, conniving rich, befuddled FBI and a very beautiful Swiss agent named Claudia .<br /><br />You cannot help feeling that Brad Thor wrote this prose with a screenplay in mind (Brad Thor is host of the PBS TV series 'Traveling Lite'), you almost can hear a director yell \\"cut\\" at certain places in the story. And though<br /><br />Scot Harvath is the superhero, he fails both the plausibility and reality check. But read on, the action keeps you engaged until the too predictable ending.<br /><br />A solid airplane read for those that need lots of action and escape. Recommended .	2004-10-30

I was American proud. Yes, I had the first septic system in the entire valley (that's right boys and girls, the first septic.

I was proud.<br /><br />For all my construction I hired a 30ish \\"degreed\\", civil engineer. For my \\"septic\\" he dug a deep, twelve foot hole and poured 16\\" thick cement for its walls, closed it with a metal lid and told me I had a septic. Months latter, this cement hole, filled up and overflowed. What he built was not a septic system, but a 12', cement lined, hole. When I had some local farmers help me dig a new septic/cesspool one of them said, \\"No mister, your engineer didn't know 'pooo' about septics\\" (a more exact word was used). He was right, but then, until this book, neither did I.<br /><br />If I had bought this book (or actually got an engineer who knew something) I would have saved myself a lot of anguish and smell. This is an excellent, basic primer on just about everything you<br /><br />will ever need to know about moving black water from your home to a world that the worms and bacteria love. Plus, the book has great sections on 'graywater' and composting toilet systems.<br /><br />Well written and very easy to understand. Plus, a unique chapter on the \\"History of Wastewater Disposal\\". I bet you can't wait for this late night reading.	2004-10-30

Most of the time, especially when traveling, paranoia is good!<br /><br />I have traveled extensively internationally for the last 15 years and consider myself travel savvy.  Recently, in Peru, I have been robbed of my passport, camera, credit card and ultimately, my peace of mind.  This robbery happened in broad daylight, 100 yards from a policeman (in Peru the police are known for their collaboration with criminals and their corruption).

After 9/11 the focus of the police has clearly changed.  Very, very low on the police \\"to do\\" list is catching a purse-snatcher.  Caveat:  You are the only defense that you have.<br /><br />Though the book is very good, it could be helpfully improved.  There are no statistics.  There are no lists, maps or charts that delineate the most dangerous tourist destinations.  There is no appendix to help you with additional reading and/or web resources.

Because of my work, I have known the joys and sorrows that Follett's pen elucidates, as he sets his novel in the world of international humanitarian medical care. I marveled how well he captures the essence of this work.<br /><br /> 'Lie Down with Lions' is one of Follett's best crafted reads. A solid love story, with larger-than-life characters, wrapped in suspense and tension. KUDOS. Highly recommended 4.5stars	2004-07-26
576791:US	53002620	R230D9EHS6ZXU	1858289076	862765901	The Rough Guide to South America (Rough Guide Travel Guides)	Books	4	87	87	N	N	A Very Good Guide - with a few idiosyncrasies...	I have just finished driving 8,500 mile, through six countries (Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina & Chile), and I had with me this guide and 'Footprint - South America'.<br /><br /> Rough Guide, though not as exhaustive as Footprint, is one of the best South American guides out today.<br /><br /> The guide starts with a basic, but very good, sixty-page information section on South America. Then each country has it own basic information, history and a few recommended books. When Rough Guides has city maps, they are very usable, each having numbers and letters that show you where hotels and eateries are located in the city.<br /><br /> Its primary strength is its excellent descriptions and recommendations of a select few of the better restaurants and accommodations in each location.<br /><br /> It is far better than 'Footprint' in its description of select accommodations and restaurants. These reviews are the primary reason to purchase this guide. Each review clearly describes the hotel or restaurant, allowing you to have a good, solid comprehension of what you will be getting, both in lodging and in food. For example: &quot;Red Mangrove Inn&quot; - this secluded bohemian hotel was designed and built by its artist owner and has many idiosyncratic flourishes. Rooms are built with bay views and have hot water. There is a whirlpool on the veranda&quot; and the Restaurant, &quot;La Bonga del Sinu&quot; specializes in local Caribbean cuisine, especially beef dishes at low prices&quot;.<br /><br /> Because good reviews take space, this guide, though 1100 pages, has far fewer recommendations than 'Footprint'. Thus the guide provides you with a small (occasionally paltry) selection of what the writers considered to be the best accommodations and restaurants available. For example in Puerto Iguazu (AR) 'Rough Guide' has 4 recommended accommodations, whereby 'Footprint' has 13. In Cusco, Peru this guide lists 8 recommendations, whereas 'Footprint' has 32. This also holds true with restaurants.<br /><br /> 'Rough Guide' is best for those who stay on the main roads, as it is not as extensive, or complete as 'Footprint' when you leave the pavement. 'Rough Guide' lacks coverage of smaller cities and towns that 'Footprint' covers. This will not be a problem for the majority of travelers, but for those that have wanderlust, or those that seek to drive South America and take the road-less-traveled, they occasionally will be without help.<br /><br /> I found 'Rough Guide's' recommendations for accommodations to be better than their recommendations for restaurants. Another flaw is there is no price range for the restaurants (expensive, moderate, cheap, etc). Thus you can go to a restaurant and you meal can cost $3.50, and your next restaurant meal may cost $35. Also, there is an incongruity with website listings for recommended hotels. One country listing may give you the website address for each hotel, but most countries are hit and miss with the website address. As you know, seldom today does a hotel NOT have a website and a hotel's website is extremely helpful in giving you a vivid picture of what you get for the buck.<br /><br /> Caveat: Any guide's research was conducted one to two years before its published date and accommodations, and especially restaurants, come and go, so call to confirm before you pay for the taxi.<br /><br /> Ultimately, the biggest flaw that the guide has is its serious deficiency of maps. Maps are imperative to a good guide. When you arrive in a city or town the first thing you want to do is orient yourself. Many, far too many times, this book fails to publish a map for its locations. If 'Rough Guides' could do one single thing to improve this guide it would be provide a map for each location in the book.<br /><br /> If you are going to spend time in South America and be in various countries then I recommend that you take both guides: 'Rough Guide' and 'Footprint'. If you want only one guide then it is a decision between excellent descriptions (Rough Guide) or numerous recommendations and sundry maps (Footprint). Even with its idiosyncrasies and shortcomings this is a great guide. Strongly recommended.ou want only one guide then it is a decision between excellent descriptions (Rough Guide) or numerous recommendations and sundry maps (Footprint).

I have not read a more disjointed, dysfunctional guide than this one.<br /><br />Jason Wilson uses the word 'Babylonic' to describe Buenos Aires, and in a Freudian way, that very word describes how this book reads.  Wilson uses the words of other writers to express (evidently he cannot) the soul of this city.  All the multitude of quotes muddles your mind and the book ends up sounding like babble.<br /><br />Quote after quote assails you from writers you will be sorely pressed to recognize.  This book could, maybe, work best in an Argentinian Literature course where the readers would have a pejorative understanding of the writers quoted.  BUT, it is not, in any way, suitable for the average, or even above average, traveler in Buenos Aires.  If you want an understanding of Argentina's Culture, then you should consider 'Culture Shock! Argentina' (however it too could be seriously improved, see my review).  Not Recommended	2004-07-13

It sure seems that the other reviewers (posted below) read a different Gimlette book than I, but I found this book both extraordinary and a \\"bloody good read\\".  I read the book  while I was traveling through South America by car.  I had a week to ten days for Paraguay and brought along  Gimlette's travelogue/history.<br />John Gimlette's writing is engaging.  His grasp of the history of Paraguay is superlative. His dry English humor often gives the absurd and macabre balance.  Face it, Paraguay has an egregious history and there is no other way to tell it but explicitly.  Gimlette does just that well.<br />John Gimlette is a lawyer practicing law in England who has an infatuation with Paraguay.  His writing approach is much like that of a defense lawyer who is stuck with the implacable task of defending a depraved guilty hoodlum.  The lawyer, John Gimlette, does his case study and digs up the often dark past of his client - Paraguay (i.e.  incompetent, corrupt leaders who started a war that would go down in history as the bloodiest conflicts ever,  80% of all Paraguayans would perished, then there is the genocide, a haven for fugitive Nazis, and a corruption standard that would make Bangladesh look honest).  In this book, reading between the lines, you can detect the lawyer in Gimlette.  Read carefully and you can hear him pleading his case before the bench, stating \\"Yes, your honor,  Paraguay is guilty, BUT there are mitigating circumstances and I want to set the record straight\\".  The reader must decide whether he succeeds or not.<br />The book has short comings.  It is missing an index and maps (map for a travel book really help John).  Both of these would have been a welcome addition to a book filled with people, places and facts.  That said,  no Paraguay guide in print today will inform you as much about this isolated country as \\"the Inflatable Pig\\" does.  Nor, will any travel guide in print today entertain you as much as Gimlette's does.<br />This book made my travel in Paraguay come alive and I believe that every traveler to Paraguay should have a copy, as well as any serious student of  South America, Mennonites, Jesuits and post war Nazis.  I am looking forward to his next book: Newfoundland.

I took this guide, along with Footprint and Rough Guide, on a two month tour of Argentina, Uruguay &amp; Chile. Though this guide's title doesn't say it, the guide also covers two important locations in Uruguay (Montevideo and Puente del Este), a very nice plus.<br />IF you like the best in life, and can afford it, and if you are not going off the beaten path but plan to stay in the major cities, then Frommer's can be a definite plus. However, if you are driving, backpacking, exploring smaller cities and towns, then get another guide (consider Footprint or Rough Guide).<br />Travel Guides target various audiences. Frommer's is for those with jingle in their pocket. There are guides for those that backpack and have a tight budget (Rough Guide, Let's Go), then there are guides that are for people that have a budget in mind, but can splurge when needed (Footprint, Lonely Planet, or Moon's), and then there are guides for those with money, 'darling'. These are willing to pay for the best and when traveling money is a secondary or tertiary concern, if a concern at all. Frommer's and Fodor's target the upper income class. To put this in perspective &quot;inexpensive lodging&quot; in this Frommer's guide averages around $40-$50 per night (double), while in the Rough Guide &quot;inexpensive lodging&quot; is $2-$10 per night (double). The restaurants that Frommer's lists as 'inexpensive' cost me on average $20 per meal (tip, tax and house wine included), 'inexpensive' to Rough Guide cost me about $2-$4.<br />Frommer's excels in pointing you to the best restaurants. The descriptions of each restaurant are superb (&quot;This historic cafe has served as the artistic and intellectual capital of Buenos Aires since 1858&quot;, &quot;with its high gilded ceiling and grand pillars, bas-relief art work and original Spanish paintings, this restaurant boast the most magnificent dining room in the city&quot;, and it sells &quot;thick rump steaks, tenderloins, BBQ ribs or tender filet minion with delicious mushroom sauce&quot;). That said, keep in mind that life changes and chiefs come and go.<br />Occasionally, one out of five times, the recommended restaurant bombed-out. I was in one recommended restaurant and ordered the dish that guide recommended, &quot;Spanish Paella&quot;. I ended up with 5 cups of over cooked, mushy yellow rice, 3 small shrimp, 7 black mussel shells (half without the mussel) and squid pieces, lots of squid pieces. Also, prices quoted were about 20-30% higher that the book stated. But, overall, this guide is a guide to excellent restaurants in Argentina and Chile.<br />The guide's maps are too few to be a contender with other guides (it is hard to believe that this travel guide has only city maps for Santiago and Buenos Aires, but totally omits maps for Chile's and Argentina's major cities like Mendoza &amp; Cordoba!).  That, and in comparison to other guides, the few maps that there are not as easy to use or navigate with.<br />Your selection of places to stay are paltry compared to other guides (Cordoba, second largest city in Argentina has three listings), however what listings they do provide describe the properties very well and have website addresses. I especially liked the &quot;Seeing the sights&quot;.<br />This guide is superb for knowing where to find the best restaurants and usally the best lodging in Chile, Uruguay and Argentina. So if you want the best, will only be in major cities, and money is not an issue, this is a very good guide.

The first five chapters (Pre-Columbian through the Creation of a Nation State 1841) enriched my visits to Sucre, Potosi, Oruro, and La Paz.  Though the text is not intended for the average tourist, it is valuable to any traveler who has more than a passing curosity about this unusual, provocative country.<br /><br />Herbert Klein is Profossor of Lain American History at Columbia and his writting style reflects this.  \\"A Concise Short History of Bolivia\\" reads like a college text book, jammed with dates, famous and obsure names, events and the obicucious commentary.  It is evident that Klien has a sharp grasp of Bolivian politics and ecomnomics, and his comments bring light to the the plight and oppression that the people of Bolivia have endure.  No where in South America have the poor been as exploited as they have in Bolivia.<br /><br />The leaders of Bolivia have consistantly placed the hopes for an economic renewal in Bolivia on one major export (first silver, then tin, now gas).  They have not learned from history.  They exploit one non-renewable resource, and spend the money (that doesn't first go into the pockets of corrupt politians and their cornies) on bigger government building, a larger militiary (Bolivia, a land locked nation still supports a Navy) and squander the people's future.  Herbert Klein clearly show how history documented this.  Saddly, it is happening again today with the newly found reserves of LPG.<br /><br />After visiting Potosi and its infamious mines of  'Cerro Rico', a huge cone shaped mountain where over 300 mines exist to extract silver, I was perplexed to find that Klein does not mention that over 8 million, million! men have suffered and died mining this mountain since 1545 when the silver was discovered.  Klein glosses over this fact, choosing not to elucidate how the  Spanish Crown was responsible for the genenocide, yes genenocide, of the indigious poplulation.  Strikingly, Klien is silent.  I sensed in reading this history text he did not want to rock any boats, and instead choose a text that would be \\"acceptable\\" for any college class (including those in Spain)... Viva the status quo!<br /><br />That said, the text is strongly recommended for any student of South American history, Bolivia and for those that are planning more than a few days in this wonderfully obscure country.sensed in reading this history text he did not want to rock any boats, and instead choose a text that would be \\"acceptable\\" for any college class (including those in Spain)...

Argentina (Cultureshock Argentina: A Survival Guide to Customs & Etiquette)	Books	3	17	17	N	N	Though the guide is dated, it is still has significant value	Culture Shock! Argentina by Fiona Adams 2000<br />To say that Fiona Adams is enthusiastic about Argentina would be a gross understatement.  Her book, often reads like she is a publicist for the country.  Her unbridled accolades about Argentina clashed radically with the pessimistic, often despairing citizen that I often talked with.<br />Yes, as Fiona Adams writes,  Argentina has: the tango, beautiful people, cosmopolitan centers, chic boutiques, great steaks and cheap (good) wines, but these alone do not capture the ethos (or culture) of  Argentina, any more than cloths make the person.<br />Though Fiona Adams mentions the dark recent history called the &quot;dirty war&quot; (1976-1983) where  30,000 &quot;disappeared&quot; and the military government  oppressed its own populous she does not elucidate how this culture could foster such a government, or how this has affected the culture of today.  She fails to say how the culture allowed years of  massive ineptitude  among corrupt government officials.  Though the book is tagged &quot;New, Expanded Edition&quot; it is really a pre-2000 work, thus it doesn't consider how the economy sunk in the economic morass it is in today, nor does it talk about the effect on the society when the majority of all the people lost life savings in the financial collapse of 2001 (FYI: in 2002 the GDP was minus11%, Inflation was 41% and more than 37% of the population lived below the poverty line).<br />Though the guide is now dated, it is still has significant value and is a worthwhile primer on the culture.  Fiona Adams does give you insight into the social customs, business etiquette, foods, football, and unique characteristics that you will find in Argentina.  So should you buy it?  Well, a  good travel guide will also give you cultural insights (though not nearly as completely) and because of the date and what has happened in Argentina I would wait until Adams both revisits, and rewrites &quot;Culture Shock!&quot;.

Thus, predictably, this story, like the roller coaster, slides backwards the last part of the novel. The last half is predictable and a bit unsatisfying. If you are a Ken Follett fan then you may find \\"Code to Zero\\" lacking the violence, intrigue and exotic passion (zero zing) that most of Follet's spy thrillers have had (Key to Rebecca - Eye of the Needle - Lie down with Lions). That said, though this was not a one night, \\"burn the midnight oil\\" read, it was a story that I wanted to finish in two nights. \\"Code to Zero\\" is worth the purchase. Recommended.	2004-07-12

Recently (5/04) I traveled for three weeks through Bolivia and found this guide to be very reliable, user friendly and exact.<br />The guide has excellent maps, brilliant descriptions of what to see and do, a very good 'Brief History' section, a good 'recommended books' section and the layout is excellent.<br />Everywhere possible James Read has included the internet addresses and web pages for additional information.<br />Most important James Read's recommendations for accommodations were always &quot;spot on&quot;.<br />If there is a downside to the guide it is the restaurant recommendations. You need to take his recommendations 'with a grain of salt'. His praise of establishments (4 out of 11) did not live up to the hearty accolades he gives out, though most did. That and the accommodation price code (why not just state the US dollar amount?) are the only distracting aspects of the guide.<br />So, if you are going to explore this isolated, landlocked, astonishing country, you will not find a better guide out today. This guide along with Herbert Klein's &quot;Concise History of Bolivia&quot; (see my review) would be a great package. Highly recommended  4.5 stars	2004-07-12

This Oxfam Profile doesn't live up to the engaging style, nor the insight, of other Oxfam Country Profiles that I have read; such as John Crabtree's - Peru  (see my review).<br />Like the CIA webpage (recommended that you visit) this book is full of statistics, but statistics alone do not give one the insight needed to understand the social fabric and ethos of Bolivia.  After reading the text I came away knowing that Bolivia is the poorest, most oppressed, socially unequal country in South America, but hungered to understand the reason that is so.<br />Marcela Lopez Levy writes in a somber, yet informative, encyclopedia style.  Her text, although filled with facts, fails to engage the reader. For example, in her chapter 'People and Power', her opening sentence reads: &quot;For many observers of Bolivia in the Latin American context, it is the strength and vigor of its popular organizations, campaigning for the justice in the political, economic, and social areas, that is the salient characteristic of Bolivian society&quot;.  Yawn.<br />That said there are some insights to glean from this book.  One interesting insight was Marcela Lopez Levy's reflections on the Aymara language (spoken by 25% of the Bolivia population). The Aymara language has logic that is very different from the dualistic (true/false, good/evil etc.) logic of most European languages.  Marcela Lopez Levy states that in the Aymara language: &quot;A statement may be true, it may be false or may contain its own proportions of truth and falsity.  These partly true, partly false statements can be specifically named and communicated in a way that Spanish and English cannot convey (actually politicians have perfected this aspect of language).  Also, in the Aymara language the future is behind the speaker and past in front.  Given the importance of language for structuring thoughts, it is not surprising that the past seems so 'present' in everyday conversations.&quot;  Interesting insight.<br />Throughout the book, the photographer, Marj Clayton, B&amp;W photos add life to what is otherwise an uninspiring book.

He is a man of the Word.<br />His prayers challenge, confront and comfort.  They challenge us to listen for God's word to us - today, in our world.  His prayers confront our hardness of heart and our complacency.  Ultimately, Brueggemann's words comfort us by illuminating the steadfast faithfulness of God love for struggling people.<br />\\"Our lives are occupied territory... occupied by a cacophony of voices, and the din undoes us.  In the daytime we have no time to listen, beset as we are by anxiety and goals and assignments and work, and in the night the voices are so confusing  we can hardly sort out what could possibly be your voice from the voice of our mothers and fathers and our best friends and our pet projects, because they all sound so much like You.

A Survival Guide to Customs & Etiquette)	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Wait for the next update - cries out for an update	Some have said that Bolivia is timeless; a land that refuses to change.  Maybe, BUT a guide that exists to expound on the Bolivian culture should not be timeless -- it needs to be current.  This guide is not current.<br />Mark Cramer initially wrote this book  pre-1996, and though the title page states the text was \\"revisited in 2001\\" I found nothing in the book that included the last five years of Bolivia's revolts and reformations.  Bolivia is a country with serious upheavals (economic and political) and it has an engaging and often revolutionary political system. My visit this year to Bolivia showed me that the country and people do change, and they have.  This book should have illustrated this fact.<br />My criticism does not mean that the book is without `some' significance.  Cramer's  first 100 pages are somewhat engaging and informative.  His writing is at its best in the chapter that deals with \\"Social and Business Customs\\".  Sadly, half of that chapter is used to list the various festivals in Bolivia, without adequately telling you the \\"why\\" each festival exists, i.e. \\"San Rafael\\" (24 Oct.) \\"A four day festival in Santa Fe with folk dancing and more drinking.\\"  The last 150 pages are superfluous.  Instead of guiding you deeper into the customs, culture and etiquette (the normal focus of `Culture Shock!' guides) Cramer takes a hike... literally.  He attempts to turn the book into a travel guide, and not a good one at that.<br />The strength of other `Culture Shock! Guides' is that they give you a depth of understanding of the people and their ethos, how the history of the country has created customs and culture.  Regarding this `Culture Shock! Guide' you should save your money and wait until the guide is not just `revisited', but rewritten.  Conditionally recommended 2.5 stars.	2004-05-23

Is `Jesus' God or simply &quot;one of us&quot; pointing us to God?  This question is the crux of Pagels' book: the Gospel of John (Jesus is divine) or the Gospel of Thomas (Jesus comes forth from the divine light, but so do we all).  The Nicene council cemented the Christian statement of faith, but according to Pagels' history, could have, or should have, pushed another gospel.<br />`Beyond Belief' is more than a discussion about why John got in the Bible; `Beyond Belief' is also a book about the skeptic, for skeptics.  This is a book that affirms the questioning Christian and historically supports the doubting `Thomas'.  With Pagels you will have a friend and advocate; one who states that it is not only dutiful, but historically correct for Christians to question the divinity of Jesus.<br />This book is, in actuality, about accepting your place, in the Christian world, as a heretic.  Heresy originally meant - the act of choice.  And if you `choose' which elements of Christianity to accept and practice, and which to reject, then you fit Pagels' definition of heretic.  For Pagels the choice not to unquestioningly accept religious authority is good, right and what those seeking both truth and God, must ultimately do.  Elaine Pagels so states: &quot;Most of us, sooner or later, find that, at critical points in our lives, we must strike out on our own to make a path where none exists.&quot;  Highly recommended for those who think outside the big box.	2004-04-12

My maps always look pristine on the first day, by the time I have arrived at my final destination the maps are beyond redemption, often consisting of segments and various pieces.  This map holds up!  The Rough Guide Maps are \\"Rip-Proof\\" & Waterproof because they are printed on a high grade sheet of plastic (kudos).  Because of the plastic fabric it is easier to fold than paper maps.<br /><br />The roads (expressway, highway, secondary and other) are cleanly printed and in sharp detail making reading this map a breeze.  The coloring and shading used allows for a  good decimation of physical features, such as mountain ranges, valleys and peaks (Altitude noted).  What is lacking is that the map is without any inset maps of major cities.  This is a short coming but all-in-all this is an excellent road map of Argentina.

An engaging primer on six emerging diseases that have tormented the world recently: (1) Mad Cow Disease, (2) HIV/AIDS, (3) Salmonella DT104, (4) Lyme Disease, (5) Nile Virus, and (6) SARS.  Walters' premise is that we have radically changed the environment and thus we are reaping the results of our own actions via plagues.  Trained as a veterinarian, Walters sees all of the above plagues as the interactions between animals and our disruption of the environment.  He states, &quot;Intensive modern agriculture, clear-cutting of forests, global climate changes, decimation of many predators that once kept disease-carrying smaller animals in check, and other environmental changes have all contributed to the increase [of epidemics].&quot;  He also mentions how the increase of global travel has contributed to the spread diseases (i.e. SARS and HIV/AIDS).<br />The book is a short, (156 pages) quick read, and best suited for those outside of the medical community who want to know more about any, or all, of these plagues.  If you have a good grasp of epidemiology, and are well-read, you will probably find the subject matter remedial.  Also, Walters' treatment of the six plagues is uneven.  His last chapter on SARS is a quick gloss over and disappointing in comparison to his more captivating treatment of the preceding five plagues.  Recommended 3.5 stars.	2004-03-25

This book, though it has many excellent sections and qualities, has one short-coming: its accommodations and restaurants are dated (published 2001 but most establishments were reviewed in 2000 or 1999).  There are many new establishments that have opened and a bunch that have closed. I knocked on the door of the &quot;Trends Guest House&quot; in Belize City only to be told by the neighbor, &quot;Its closed.  Been closed for two years&quot;, &quot;Oh&quot;, I replied.  &quot;Yea man, there was a murder&quot; the neighbor said.  &quot;Oh?&quot; I replied. &quot;Yea, the owner was murdered by a guest.&quot; Oh! I replied.  So the recommendations are hit and miss,  but for those that which were open, the comments are reliable (most have raised their prices) and worth pursuing.<br />If you are going to snorkel or dive, you should know that much of the reefs in the Northern Cayes (Ambergris &amp; Caulker) are 65-85% dead. This is because of the three hurricanes in the last 5 years.  According to one marine expert, it will take 20 years or more of them to return.  Nothing is said about the destruction to the coral reefs in this guide.<br /><br />On the plus side this guide has excellent Internet references.  Almost every hotel has email addresses and many of them have webpage addresses.  Maps are clear, concise and easy to use.  Tons of references that point you to a plethora of information on Belize. (most with web address).  Belize is completely covered, no area of interest is omitted, and Peter Eltringham has include a very good section on TIKAL, Flores (across the boarder in Guatemala) and the Bay Islands (Roatan).<br />His bibliography on recommended books to read is valuable and solid for anyone that wants to know more on Belize.<br />All Rough Guides have a difficult to use number system to quote the price range of a hotel, i.e. one hotel is a number '6' which means between BZ$110-150 that scale is back on page 28 of the guide, then you convert the BZ$ to $US.  This system is a pain when it is so much easier just to say $75 dollars.<br />Bottomline: WHEN the new edition comes out, Rough Guide to Belize will be at the very top of the Belize guides but, until then, you will be best served by another guide.ystem is a pain when it is so much easier just to say $75 dollars.<br />Bottomline: WHEN the new edition comes out, Rough Guide to Belize will be at the very top of the Belize guides but, until then, you will be best served by another guide.	2004-03-02

I have just returned from Guatemala (my sixth journey) and was there for 10 days.  I took this guide with me and, honestly, wish I hadn't.<br />Though Bernhardson covers all the standard guide topics in his Introduction Section (Land, Flora &amp; Fauna, History, Government, Economy and People) but his writing is uninspired and you will find yourself skimming past much of it.  ie. \\"Independence from Spain was achieved indirectly, as Mexican General Iturbide declared Mexico's independence in 1821 and demanded that Guatemala join it.\\"  At the end of the book the `recommended reading' section does contain adequate recommendations in Literature, History, other Guidebooks and Archaeology and is worth considering.  His writing of the archeological sites, his strong suit, is good, howbeit, dry and languid.<br />Each hotel and restaurant that I checked out did conform to his evaluations (though some were definitely pre-2000 evaluations) and you can trust those that he does recommend.  The indexes for accommodations and restaurants are excellent time-saving additions and should be in all guides.  Kudos.<br />A CRITICAL FLAW.  Missing from this guide is any significant reference to the Internet.  There is no connectivity in this book.  This is a huge short-coming, especially considering the publication date (2001).  You will get zero Internet references for additional information, zero webpages for hotel or tour operators... nada.<br />Guatemala excels in having excellent Spanish language schools (and cheap too!).  In Antigua alone there are over 50 schools, yet Bernhardson lists only 10 and does not give you significant information that would help you make an intelligent decision.  Again, the fact that there are NO website addresses (and every school worth its `buenos d&iacute;as' has a website), and the fact that he gives you very little information on selecting a school, makes this guide virtually worthless.  Try [...] for more information on Spanish language schools.<br />Maps are an essential and critically important aspect of any guide.  And the maps themselves are good as maps go, however, the city maps in this guide don't have the usual \\"user-friendly\\" reference numbers for locating the recommended restaurants and accommodations.  Thus, you have to scan the map for the name of the establishment, and when you're in a bouncing vehicle, on Guatemala's roads, this task is more difficult then it should be.<br />Bottom line: Save your money.  This guide is not up to the quality of other `Moon Handbooks' and you will be better off purchasing `Lonely Planet' or `Rough Guide'.

This is an enthralling thriller of detective, dementia, that is laced with enough sexual deviancy that it pulls you in like a whirlpool and the spinning doesn't stop until the very end.<br /><br />But, there  is one thing that is getting worn and frayed, both in this novel and in contemporary story writing (and Hollywood), and that is the over used story line where the brilliant, beautiful white female (doctor) is swooped up by an accomplished black male stud, who in this case is the detective.  Would it be refreshing just once for a Demi Moore type to swoope up Denzel Washingto?  Maybe the brilliant beautiful white female wins the heart of an accomplished, athletic black male. I have never seen it written.<br /><br />Ok, I am getting down off of my soap box. This spellbinding thriller is strongly recommended.  Highly recommended	2004-03-02

John Shelby Spong believes that change is coming and he has been a strong advocate for the gay community.  He believe that the church too is going to change, it's going to happen within our generation.<br /><br />This is a book about change.  About changing how to perceive God.  It is a book that clearly states God is not a supernatural being, Jesus is not the earthly incarnation of God, the Bible is not the \\"Word of God,\\" the supernatural miracles of Jesus did not happen and Jesus was not resurrected, nor did he return to God. God, incarnation, atonement, Trinity, miracles, 'Christian' morals, and the Church as it exists today are all replaced. What the title of this book should be, is, \\"A New Religion for a New World,\\" for that is what Bishop Spong is giving us.<br />John Shelby Spong does not believe in a Theistic God and he states so forcefully; \\"Theism is dead, I joyfully proclaim.\\" THEISM as Bishop Spong defines it, is \\"a being, supernatural in power, dwelling outside this world and invading the world periodically to accomplish the divine will.\\"<br />Yet, Spong admits, \\"Christianity postulates a theistic God who does supernatural things.\\" Christianity is about God invading the world through Jesus Christ. Christianity is, and has been for 2000 years (give or take), \\"Emmanuel\\" - God with us, visibly and dramatically. \\"Christianity is a THEISTIC religion\\" said Dr. Sally McFague (Professor of Theology -Vanderbilt Divinity School - author of the pensive and provocative book, 'Life Abundant' -- envisioning Christianity for the new century -- see my review).<br />Therein lies the rub. Allow me to digress. A man had a Honda Civic that needed the engine overhauled. He decided to 'radically' change the car and make it a quarter-mile race car. He pulled out the engine and transmission, threw out the brakes, replaced the tires and the suspension. He gutted the interior completely (graciously keeping the windshield and wipers). He then cut away parts of the body to accommodate the new parts and welded the doors shut. He put in a high performance, 400 horsepower engine and modified what was left of the car so that it could reach speeds in excess of 110 mph in 9 seconds. Now, with a great stretch of the imagination you could say this man still had a Honda Civic, but, in reality, he had created a new vehicle.<br />This book is not a \\"radically, reformed\\" car, so to speak, it is a completely different car. Bishop Spong has taken a blow torch and sliced out the parts of Christianity that he no longer believes in or adheres to.<br />He has not \\"radically reformed Christianity\\" he has created a new belief system.<br />This is not to say that he does not have something to say. He does and he says it well.<br />Bishops Spong radically questions the basic assumptions of conventional Christian theology and attacks the paradigms that ecclesiastical hierarchy find convenient. He rejects: Theism's tribal theology, bibliolatry, Jesusolatry, and Christianity as an exclusive pathway to God. His \\"beyond theism\\" theology demands that we stand and embrace our own humanity, not with shame or the stigma of sin, but recognizing that we are unique and full of potential. That we can, without an \\"eternal and omnipotent protector\\" and live fully, love fully and be all that we can be.<br />The God that Spong embraces is \\"not a being but BEING itself. This God is the source of life, the source of love, the Ground of Being.\\" For Spong God is beyond any limits of our religious systems. God is no longer a being 'external' to life, but the very BEING of life itself. He says, \\"I have walked beyond theism, but not beyond God.\\" He forewarns that to separate yourself from the belief of a theistic God is painful. Those that do will have to stand without magic or miracles. He writes, \\"We make no attempt to suggest that life is fair or to defend the theistic deity when life is harsh. We do not cultivate afalse security.\\"te a false security.\\"	2004-03-01

This is what can happen when the seeds of hope, in desperate souls, are watered.<br />I have seen, after living in Peru for five years, that the majority of Peruvian women (and most any developing Latin American country) have to face 4 tyrannical forces that oppressing them -- the autocratic church, government that is lethargic & indifferent, condescending, machismo men and ultimately, poverty - debilitating poverty; poverty that can strip a soul of both hope and humanity and ultimately lead to a philosophy/theology of fatalism.  This is the story of how the women of El Agustino faced the four totalitarian forces and prevailed.  How they rekindled hope among the hopeless and gave directions for a better life to the lost.  The women of El Agustino have not slain Goliath but they have kicked the dickens out of his shins.<br />The writer, Tom Powers, S.J (Director of the Center for Ignatian Spirituality), explores, in intelligent manner, howbeit academic, the struggle of women who have come to a neoCatholic theology which highlights both a transformed faith and their social action.  Tom Powers'  writing is more a 'white paper' on the struggle and modest triumph of these women; the women of El Agustino, Lima, Peru.<br />To Tom Powers credit (as an established Catholic), he 'pulls-no-punches' when critiquing the Peruvian Catholic church and its stilted and oppressive dogma which keeps both women and the poor in servitude to existing political, social and economic systems.  He writes \\"The conservative (Catholic) church in Peru exhibits little concern for the social realities and presents itself in the model of the authoritarian and dogmatic institution that thrived before the Second Vatican Council\\".<br />His book is a quick contextual sketch of many aspects of the Peruvian system.  Tom Powers discusses the history of Peru, the struggle of democracy and the rise of the 'Sendero Luminoso' terrorists, the Catholic Church, liberation theology and globalization.  He exposes the theology of the women of El Agustino, showing how theology, like God, never stays the same.  For Powers all theology emanates from the critique of, and struggle against, the sources of oppression.  God is defined and redefined in the midst of this struggle. The struggle of these women is fearful, but the fear has not paralyzed them<br />This is a must reading for any student of Liberation Theology, for those that have an interest in women and their struggle in the world and especially for anyone that is going to live in Peru.

It is full of side trips that can last an hour or a day.  What Hunter has done is make miles of tedious asphalt fun and entertaining.  Do you know where to stop and buy `Chocolate-covered potato chips'?  Or, do you know where the `Gone with the Wind' museum exit is?  Hunter does!<br />The book is well laid out and very easy to use.  I applaud the way that Hunter uses two sets of maps in the book.  The I-75 section in the front of the book runs North to South, or Detroit to the border of Florida.  The map pages in the back of the book run South to North.  In the center of the book is the travel information, insider tips, special reports, etc. that make the trip enjoyable.<br />An area of improvement would be a symbol on the maps delineating where significant interstate highway construction is happening  Rand McNally Road Atlas 2004 has a great symbol system showing where construction is going on.<br />Also, someone needs to tell me why this guide and the I-75 guide written by Christine Marks (see my review) both stop at the Florida border!  A mystery to me as  I-75 does go all-the-way to Miami!<br />This is the best of the I-75 guides out to-date.  You will find tons of useful information you will not find in other guides.  If I-75 is your route South (or North) you will appreciate this gem.  Get it!  4.5 stars	2004-01-03

With a decent guide State guide you won't need this book.  Frommer's has two very good Florida Guides that for a few dollars more gives you so much more.<br />What this guide will give you is 25 Driving tours.  You will find the guide useful if you are going to Florida (or live in Florida) have a car, you love to drive, and have free days to follow out the itineraries.<br />For example the `Dayton Beach' Tour is 3 days and 191 miles.  The small map starts out each tour and gives a numbered, stop by stop, clue of what you will see along the route.  Each place of interest has a very short description, very short, that provides a very basic insight.  Most of the tours found in this guides go in loops, you finish where you started.  This is probably not what you wanted to do.<br />After 4 weeks in Florida, I found myself using the State guides &quot;Frommers&quot; &amp; &quot;Fodors&quot; over and over (see my reviews) and seldom used this guide.  In short, the guide is well thought out, colorful, and the very short informational pieces are well written, BUT the usefulness of the guide is not there for me and I doubt if it will be for you.

This is a stimulating and provocative book written by a Vietnamese Buddhist monk who attempts, in good will and world peace, to bring Buddhism and Christianity into a harmonious relation.<br />Thich Nhat Hanh hopes that, if people would look at what these faiths have in common, there could be tolerance and acceptance of each other.<br />To bring harmony to these two religious belief systems is no small task, and only someone with a large amount of both faith and love would attempt this. Christianity and Buddhism are diametrically opposed: Faith in God. Faith in Self. So acknowledges Hanh when he says, &quot;In Christianity faith means trust in God, in Buddhism faith means confidence in our ability to wake up our deepest capacity.&quot;<br />But then, Hanh has a large amount of both faith and love, and he is no ordinary Vietnamese Buddhist monk. He has been engaged in peace works for almost 40 years. In 1966 he came to the United States and met with Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to protest the war in Vietnam. Pushing forward in his belief in peace, he went on to develop The Fellowship of Reconciliation, an interfaith peace organization, with members like Martin Luther King, Jr., Thomas Merton and Father Daniel Berrigan. Through his life, and with the contact of many strong Christians, he converted to dualism of beliefs.<br />&quot;On the altar in my hermitage in France are images of Buddha and Jesus and I touch them both,&quot; Hanh says. He believes that ignorance brings bondage and disparity, but understanding of another brings liberation and &quot;unlocks the door to the prison of suffering.&quot;<br />He acknowledges as a Buddhist monk that Buddhism does not hold to the belief of God and he recognizes that Christianity is not a religion of believers in God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. And in his own, very unique way, he believes too. Especially important to him is Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. Hanh describes his understanding of Jesus Christ as &quot;one through whom the divine was manifested&quot; but not the only expression of the divine, &quot;it is said that there are 84,000 Dharma doors, doors of teaching . . . it would not be very Buddhist to say that yours is the only door.&quot;<br />In addition to highlighting concepts of Buddhism, Hanh offers Christians a new prism, a new angle from which to look at Jesus, the Holy Spirit, their Christian faith and those of other faiths. He says, &quot;If you satisfy yourself only with praising the name of Jesus, it is not practicing the life of Jesus. We must practice living deeply, lovingly and acting with charity if we wish to truly honor Jesus.&quot;<br />Living Buddha. Living Christ is not a primer on either Buddhism or Christianity but rather a compilation of the two by a Buddhist monk who understands where these two great religions can touch and sometimes even dance. Though Hanh never gets the oil-and-water to mix, he does get them to complement each other. This in itself is a great achievement. An index would have greatly assisted in making this a good reference book as well.

With over 400 beaches, Florida is Mecca for those with a need for sun and sand.  This 681 page guide is a godsend to those that live for the bronzed body, fun, and zany people that these beaches offer.<br />This guide is the most accurate, comprehensive guide on Florida beaches to date. The authors have spent over 17 years in compiling this great guide.  The comments and selections are theirs alone. The guide is full of facts (Florida is a 447 mile peninsula), stats (Florida grew in habitats by 23% in one decade) and hard information (the main reason to buy the guide). Puterbaugh and Bisbort, as the writing will evidence, are conservationists, strongly lauding eco-tourism.  Kudos.<br />Though the nightlife sections in this guide are far the best available, the accommodations and costal cuisine sections are paltry and poor; nowhere near the strength of better state guides.  Puterbaugh and Bisbort selected the 25 \\"Top\\" beaches among the 400 beaches in Florida, but sadly omitted a map showing where these 25 beaches are located.  Thus you do the work via the index.<br />I used this guide while traveling for a month through Florida.  `Florida Beaches' could be a stand alone guide, but I recommend that you use it in concert with an excellent state guide, such as  Frommer's Florida (see my review).  Together, these guides will direct you to the best Florida has to offer.  4.5 Stars.  Strongly Recommended.	2004-01-03

You will find the average per night fare costing $200 - $400 per night.  It should be stated that Zagat started as a patrician's guide to restaurants.  But not here, for you will be disappointed to find that this guide had no reviews of the restaurants that are found in the hotel and resorts<br />However, I have used the guide various times to search out the \\"Top\\" places to stay in the U.S. and I am always pleased with the recommendations.

Fodor's was the most used, referred to and dog-eared of the lot, and here is why.<br />Every time Fodor's recommended a restaurant or a lodging it was accurate and excellent.  The descriptions of the properties were superb. After you were done reading about the place you had the feeling you had been there.  For example, the comments on the Austing Huas in Taos Ski Valley states, \\"The breakfast room has large picture windows, stained-glass paneling and an impressive fireplace.  Aromas of fresh-baked goods, such as owner Paul Austing's apple strudel, come from the kitchen.\\"<br />Fodor's strength is it's coverage of  major cities, prominent towns and \\"must see\\" attractions. It is more contemporary and weak on the history, in fact it completely omits an introduction to New Mexico section that usually covers the land, flora and fauna, history, economy and the people (Moon is excellent here and Roadside History for regional history).  You will find that Fodor's occasionally skips Interstate places that could be lodging stops (IE: Lordsburg, etc. [Moon does better at this]).  Most irritating is the quirky, icon dollar sign rating that is supposed to delineate the cost of accommodations and eateries.  Four dollar signs equal this much, Three this much, etc. but not in Santa Fe.  It would be much better to tell the reader what the cost of rooms or food will be.  Keep it simple Fodor's.  And, the maps could be much better as well<br />That said, this is still the most trustworthy guide for you to use when you are selecting accommodations, dining establishments and sights to see.

Now, when my friends come to Peru, to see Machu Pichu and/or the ruins of Choquequirao, I give everyone a copy of \\"The White Rock\\".<br />Hugh Thomson has done a great service to all those visiting these ruins.  He has not only written an engaging, and often funny travel log, but he has given us a history of the Incas.  He shines a new light on Inca life and customs.  Their principle cities: Machu Pichu, Choquequirao, Vilcabamba and Chuquipalta [the White Rock] are discussed in the book..<br /><br />But, this book isn't just about Cusco, Machu Pichu or Choquequirao - but it really is.  It isn't about the Inca's culture and their vast empire (c.1438-1572) - but it really is.  It's not about various unique, brash, daring, larger-than-life individuals who Thomson encountered, but it is.  Nor is it about Hugh Thomson and his extraordinary journeys through the Inca heartland - but, then again, it really is.  This Book is an incredibly accomplished blending of all of these, as well as a lively, dauntless travel log of an exception explorer.<br />Thomson's pendulating writing has the unique ability to freely swing back and forth between various perspectives.  He writes as an anthropologist,  a historian, an archeologist, an explorer, and a  traveling bum.  He weaves these perspectives together while never losing the story line - The White Rock.<br />Thomson's ultimate destination (Chuquipalta [the White Rock]) takes him on the famed Inca Roads, transversing the Inca empire, yet all the while gathering  information and simultaneously reflecting on the beauty and uniqueness of their culture.  He reveals how the Incas were brilliant administrators, masters at constructing roads and stone cities while never discovering the wheel, the arch, or developing a written language.  Thomson clearly  chronicles the conquest of the Incas from the time of Francisco Pizzaro (and his murder of the Inca Atahulpa) through Pedor de Cieza de Leon and the execution of the last Inca, Tupac Amaru, in the main square of Cusco.<br />Bottom line, If you want to journey though the lost world of the Incas, then this book, matched with a solid guide like `Let's Go: Peru, Bolivia &amp; Equador' (see my review), will enrich you as you explore the Inca heartland.  Highly Recommended.covering the wheel, the arch, or developing a written language.

Besides being a phenomenal ROADSIDE history book (best used with an automobile traveling the highways and byways), it is worth the purchase for the 100s of black &amp; white photos that are found throughout the book.  In my recent two week of travel through New Mexico there was not a ghost town, pueblo, town or city that was not expounded upon.<br />Folks, this is a wonderful book, and works best as a supplement to a good traveling guide (my recommendation is Fodor's New Mexico [see my review]).  Now, I will admit that traveling guides usually have a brief sketch of the history of locations, but Roadside History expands that and the photos are priceless.  Strongly recommended	2003-12-16

The guide took you through a city in an intuitive manner.  For example, in the `Exploring Las Vegas' section, instead of scattering the recommendations before you (as Frommer's did), Fodor's approached it from the point of you progressing down `the Strip'.  Also, the guide only  listed those sights (casinos) with \\"the most imaginative themes or attractive particulars.\\"<br />The recommendations for accommodations were all `top drawer' and unique, but normally pricey.  The restaurant and nightlife selections were great, always distinguishing and creative and worth the search to find.  The maps in the guide did help, a bit, but this is a weak area that Fodor's USA needs to work on ( Frommer's USA has the best).<br />If you are a bit short on money, and cutting costs maters then check out `Let's Go USA'.  If you are not financially challenged, and want to experience the best while you are on the road, then this is a great one volume guide. Strongly recommend 4.5 stars.	2003-12-16

Howells' guide gave me a `leg up' on  the destinations that were `definite maybes'.  The guide was extremely valuable in leading me to destinations I would not have considered without the guide.  (Las Cruces and Ruidoso in New Mexico and Bisbee and Ajo in Arizona).<br />I found Howell's writing to be friendly and informative.  He succinctly describes the best side of each of his selection, but, and I consider this a detraction, seldom does he point out negative aspects or flaws a community, town or city might have.<br />Sadly, there is no web-page references, appendixes or references that could give you additional information on his locations.  He omits information as basic as Chamber of Commerce contact information, or the names of the main newspapers.<br /><br />Finding a new place to live is a lot like dating - most places leave you wishing for more, a few are provocative enough to warrant placing them on your \\"maybe list\\" , and one, or at best two, will tantalize you enough to want to come back for more.<br />So, if you are at the beginning of your search for a new place to live, then this guide is a great first step.  \\"Where to Retire\\" will speed up your search and give you a general feel for various places.  This guide needs to work in tandem with other guides such as a State, Region or Country guide.  Recommended 3.5 stars.	2003-12-16

The guide covers most of the 48 States, as well as Canada.  Alaska and Hawaii and a few continental States are not listed.<br />Each time I used the guide, and each time I took their recommendations I was rewarded with a very good to great experience.  The accommodations were memorable and food, was the type were silence falls over the time while eating, as each diner is as tantalized as there are focus on their vitals.<br />Mobil's selection of  hotels are not budget minded; they are by most accounts expensive.  Only a few selections will be near $100 (single), whereas most accommodations are much more than that.<br />Restaurants are a bit better but not by much.  They are also pricy.  Seldom will you and your guest leave the table for less than $100.  It would have been nice to have a list of \\"values\\" where Mobil would list the ten \\"best\\" hotels for under $100, or the ten \\"best\\" restaurants for under $50 per person.<br />A small irritation was that the guide lists hotels and restaurants together, without separation them.  Thus you read through most all of the list seeking for either a restaurant or lodging.<br />So, if you want the best and you can pay for the best then get the best.  And this book will be the best book to help you do just that ... it is a great small, purse size guide making it an excellent travel companion. Highly recommended.  4.5 stars.	2003-12-16

Let's Go is, hands down, the best USA guide for a backpacker, a student, or a Gen X or Gen Y person on a tight budget..

Rather, you will find accommodations that include where to pitch your tent, park your van (IE  Circusland RV Park - Nevada) USA Hostels, National Recreation Areas, or accommodations like: `Thunderbird Inn' in Santa Fe, NM or  `Whiskey Pete's' in NV (billed as the \\"cheapest casino right in the middle of  Nevada\\").  Restaurants that are listed are good'n cheap.  Such as the  `Plaza Dinner' in Las Vegas ($1 beers) or `Carnival World Buffet at the Rio' (\\"Hands down the greatest buffet in Vegas\\").<br />All buyers of USA guides need to realize that you will get only the top, most popular, picks of a given State.  If you are going to wander the back roads you will be on your own.<br />Get this guide if you are economically challenged, but beware, this guide, compared to the more upscale Fodor's or Frommer's USA guides,  is a bare bone, thin-pickens book.

YES).  The guide's 'What to See & Do' is worth adhering to.  The maps are excellent and locate accommodations and dining rapidly for you.  The comments for restaurants were normally 'spot on the money', but, restaurants can turn over ownership and management quickly and quality can drop.  I experienced this in the case of the Frommer's recommended restaurant 'Maria Teresa' in Albuquerque.  This is a property needs to be revisited and possibly dropped from the guide.<br />Very disappointing (and the PRIMARY reason for the 3 star rating) is the absences of any prices for accommodations or restaurants!  This is the first major guide I have ever reviewed that omitted prices!  This is a major flaw for this guide.<br />There are better guides for your money.  Consider Fodor's (see my review) or if you are economically challenged consider 'Let's Go USA' (see my review).  Conditionally recommend	2003-12-16

Sanctuaries, Retreats, and Sacred Places).  Though Fodor's was the best guide for selecting accommodations and eateries, Moon's guide excelled in historical and tidbit descriptions.<br />What set this guide apart is the history, superior maps (especially compared to Fodor's) and  Stephen Metzger's straightforward, clear, writing style.  Metzger's introduction to New Mexico section is outstanding (The Land, Flora and Fauna, History, Economy and the People).  This is an important contribution to understanding the State completely skipped by Fodor's.  Also, Metzger's history of regions, cities, towns and pueblos is exemplary.<br />Where the guide falters is the weak descriptions of accommodations and restaurants, IE \\"The hotel is distinctly decorated\\" or \\"a discreet little inn with 12 rooms on an alleyway\\".  After reading Fodor's vivid descriptions this was a serious step back.  Also few, if any, website addresses for lodgings are found, and in a 2003 publication that is a serious omission. (Fodor's has website addresses).<br />If you are primarily interested in finding the best dining experiences and great accommodations Fodor's is my pick.  But, for a State guide that is strong on overview and excellent in the history are you can't beat Metzger (however, also check out Roadside History of New Mexico).  Strongly Recommended	2003-12-16

The Amazon is a world unto itself and this guide will help you explore this world.  This guide introduces you to the various cities and towns, vast jungles and the myriad of rivers that flow through this world.  Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia, the Guianas and Venezuela all lay claim to this world and all are covered in this guide.<br />The practical A-Z section is basic but good.  Statements like \\"Avoid eating endangered species\\" are a bit moronic, especially when no list of endangered species is offered.  The 50 pages devoted to `Amazon Wildlife' are helpful, but your chances of seeing most of the wildlife documented in the book are slim.  After five days on the rivers and camping on land in the Manu Biosphere Reserve, my medical group had yet to see a single form of wildlife, other than the occasional spider monkey.  The brochures that you are handed at the travel agency have beautiful photos of the animal life that you probably won't see.  However, what the Amazon lacked in visible wildlife, it made up for with its insect population.  And, to the guides credit, it does start off the \\"Fauna\\" section with a the insect section.  The Amazon Spirituality (Rainforest Shamanism) and the Music and the Amazon sections were delightful.<br />I relished the forthright and candid critiques of the agencies (\\"the elevated price of this agency hardly justifies the modest increase in comfort\\"), hotels (it is the best cheap hotel in town) and restaurants (one of La Paz's best Italian restaurants).  That said, you will only get a handful of recommendations for major cities and if you plan to stay longer it is best to get a country guide.<br />There are no prices, or costs, for anything!  This is a substantial omission.  No prices for agencies service, no prices for the restaurants nor for the accommodation.  Nor does the author take to task the serious damage that is being done by multinational mining, logging or petroleum companies.  Scant is said about the escalating ecological damage that each country is allowing in the Amazon.  And then there is the bare bone \\"further reading\\" section and an absence of any any films or documentaries set in, or about, the Amazon.  All of these are significant short-comings.<br />Be aware that this guide will not help you decide where to go, it gives no recommendations, it only helps you whittle down your choices; by laying out all the possibilities before you.

Eight hungry souls and myself were heading out for an 8-day trek through the Andes (Peru), and I was put in charge of menu selection.  I searched Amazon.com books that would give me a hand in developing the menu for the group.  I found \\"More Backcountry Cooking,\\" and, overall, I impressed.<br />Though the book was not perfect, see my `problem' paragraph below, it did provide me with some good ideas to make the meals more ambrosian.  I found Dorcas S. Miller's advice, especially her 17  &quot;Hot Topics&quot; (40 pages), to be informative and practical (choosing the right stove, carrying your kitchen in a pack, etc.)<br />She has great tips and many charts (charts-cooking time, salads, more) as well as great appendices.  Most of her recipes are easy, appealing and clearly explained.<br />However some sections are better than others,  and her breakfast selections, well, was as appealing as `tofu pancakes'.<br /><br />My greatest problem with the book is that is designed for those in the US and I am backpacking in Peru, a developing (third world) country.  Millers' recipes use `mucho' instant and dried ingredients.  Here in the USA it is not such a problem to purchase them, but where I am going the markets do not carry instant or dried ingredients.  That means I had to buy everything here and lug it to Peru.  My bags were already full, and at their weight limit.  Thus, many of the recipes were not practical.  I point this out for those of you that will be heading to remote and faraway worlds.<br />That said, the book was still informative, helpful and I recommend it for any backpacker or camper who wants good food under the stars.	2003-11-26

This is a book about wealth and poverty.  Gary Fields statistically shows the inequality of poverty, income mobility and economic well being (or the lack thereof) through `distributional analysis'.  He takes various aspects of macro economics and analyzes and draws a conclusion for each aspect.<br />The index and reference sections are excellent.  Disappointing is the lack of an appendix.  An appendix with information that would collaborate the footnotes alluded to in the text would  have been helpful to have at hand (i.e. a footnote like \\"for profiles of whose these poor countries are see World Bank 1997\\").<br />Also, aggravating is Field's comparisons, using statistics of various countries throughout the book, but then moving on without concluding or inferring anything (I.e. Korea spends 10% of its educational budget on higher education while Venezuela spends 43% --- ok, so?).<br />If you are not a student or teacher with a concentration in international economics, or a graduate student in international development, or a practitioner with a international agency, then this book will probably  not be valuable to you.  However, if you have affinity for statistics, and a strong bent towards international issues like poverty, inequality and distribution of wealth, you will find this book a statistical storehouse.

To say you are an America is to say that you are, de facto, a consumer.<br />This word is a defining aspect of our American world...  Consumerism covers daily life, whether it be drug discounts, tourism, marketers, insurance, cars, homes, technology or just plain old product reviews.  We Americans are defined by our consumption.<br /><br />Lizabeth Cohen has given us a thoroughly researched, readable history on consumerism, and how it came to be such a force and part of our lives in America.  She argues that after WWII the \\"Consumer Republic\\" was launched, full force, affecting life styles, government and even belief systems.  Though the beginning of a consumers movement had occurred before 1940, the \\"Consumer Republic\\" took form and force after the second world war.<br />Cohen's writing style is informative, to the point of being academic.  \\"A Consumers' Republic\\" is a history book.  Thus, it may be a bit more pedantic than most general readers would like.<br />I found a few omissions that distracted from the overall excellence of the book. One being that Cohen does not investigate how consumerism has been incorporated into, and seriously affected, American Christianity.  She does not address how Christianity, especially considering the `Protestant work ethic', helped to shaped and drive consumerism into being.  She does not explore `why' Americans live to consume, \\"shop til they drop.\\"  Neither does she reflect on the effects that unbridled consumption have on both the social fabric of our nation  or the ecological impact on our land.<br />That said, this book is a \\"need to read\\" for students of American history, marketing, those involved as consumer activists, and business.

The editor of this book, Rodney Clamp, selected 10 essays that would look at`consumption' and `capitalism' in America, from a Christian theological perspective.<br />While his intent is laudable, his selection of essays is disappointing.  Out of the ten essays I found only three to be engaging: John Tropman's \\"Catholic & Protestant Ethic\\", Craig Gay's \\"Sensualist Without Heart\\" and Bill McKibben's \\"Returning God to the Center\\".  The remaining essays were pedantic and academic, for example, one writer states, \\"The Christian patristic vision offers a coherent metaphysic in which to interpret and to address issues of ecology and global consumption.\\"  Really?  I do say.<br />Clamp wants to sound the alarm and establish a new Christian theology, which he titles: the \\"theology of consumption\\" .  These ten essays are his attempt to bring forth this new theology.  In these essays he juxtaposes consumerism and capitalism, finding both to be in dire need of Christian redemption.  As he understands it, \\"consumer capitalism's\\" problem is not with the \\"legitimacy of making money\\" (that's OK), but what gets Clamp is what we, the American consumer, actually enjoy spending the money we earn!  Go figure.  Rodney Clamp fails to realize that `consumption' and `consumer' are pejorative terms that can not be separated from the American ethos. Neither can consumerism nor consumption in America be tamed by a Christian theology.<br />So, if you are a student of the \\"American consumer\\", and  you are used to reading engaging writers  like Eric Schlosser's<br />\\"Fast Food Nation\\" or Lizabeth Cohen's A Consumer Republic you will most likely find this book dense, difficult and disappointing.  However, if you have hours to burn, and you want to plod through seven uninspiring essays, then, yes, you could glean insight and something of value.  This book is really targeting ministers, professors of theology or students of American consumerism.  Conditionally recommended.	2003-07-03

So states the author, Stephen Bevans.<br />Everything, every thought, every belief and creed must be set in context.  You, your faith and your expression of faith is as much North American faith as it is Christian faith.<br />If you are familiar with H. Richard Niebuhr's \\"Christ and Culture\\", you will see how Bevans presents six new models  that are more relevant to the time in which we live.  Though the book was originally printed in 1992, with five models (Translation, Anthropological, Praxis, Synthetic and Transcendental), this second editions has added a new \\"Counter-cultural\\" model.<br />Models are like a GPS, they orient you.  They help to define where you are in relation to the world that you live in.  Thus, when you can get your bearings you can then plot the course where you need to go.<br />For Bevans, faith, and everything it embraces, must be seen through context.  You, me and all human beings are products of our culture and context.  Our understanding of God is a product of Western, European context.  Scripture is written in a context, for a context, and from a historical context (See Lucien Legrand's \\"The Bible on Culture\\".).<br />The role of the theologian, minister and everyday Christian is to articulate God to a society that is on the other side of the God experience.  The models that Bevans offers can help.  His six models allow you to select a vantage point, or rather a platform from which to speak to the world today.<br />Bevans has done a great service for those seeking to understand their Christian faith in a postmodern world.

The `deep feelings' that I have are more akin to indigestion than a spiritual incarnation.  As a cross between Tim the Toolman and Chef Boyardee I love to `power cook'.  That said, I was given this unique book by  a distinctive woman that I am dating a `goddess'.<br />She gave me the book with her binding instructions, \\"my little toad, please cook from this book and review it\\".  My murmured response was, \\"Yes, my living royalas, you know that I live to serve\\".  With book in hand I started down the `need to know' road.  First, since I have a `goddess', or rather, she has me, I need to know what is a goddess?<br />You need to be aware that there are `goddesses' and there are those in the `Goddess' movement' or `Wicca'.  The latter, the Wicca, are in what appears to be the fasest-growing religion in America, says the Atlantic Monthly ( 1/2001).  There is a lot to this movement and it fluxes from women who are considered unique and remarkable to those in the movement that consider themselves Witches.  Some in the Wicca or `Goddess'  movement perceive the movement as a religion based on the broad themes of ancient pre-Christian paganism, although it is not drawn directly from paganism.  Goddess, on the other hand, is an expression used for women who affirm both their uniqueness and feminineness, while seeking to expand their sense of self-realization.  They seek to emulate the virtues that are found in those that have realized their Divine consciousness.<br />The editor, Pamela Daniele, defines the word best by saying \\"a true goddess is any woman who has the courage to search for ways to make the sacred the everyday events of her life.\\"  Her intent was to bring together those that were reclaiming their own spiritual power, their sense of sacred self, and allow them to tell their story.  The recipes are secondary to the desire to unlock the goddess energy that all possess.<br />The recipes are solid dinner recipes (no homemade brews, elixirs or potions  - sorry).  Some recipes are predictably airy but their range is wide, and many are winners, so do not discount the recipes, there are some real `keepers' in this book (especially the rum cake on pg. 157).<br />I found the book to be unique, engaging and useful.  Though I doubt if the book would be a \\"must read\\" for the guy at the fire station, it would be a great read for all those women who want to know they are not alone in realizing their divine gifts in everyday life.

I have a homestead in Peru (near Cusco / Machu Picchu).  I wanted to raise my own meat; thus I bought a dozen chicks.  As life dictates they grew and the day came for eating.  I gave the first chicken to my housekeeper to kill and clean.  She smothered the poor  bird by holding its beak closed and plugging the nostrils.  The suffocation process took about two struggling minutes.  Not a good way to kill a bird, I thought.  The second chicken was given to my hired hand, and he killed the bird by stretching its neck three times.  Yes, a better method,  but really, what do the professionals recommend?  Thus, I initially bought \\"Storey's Guide to Raising Poultry\\", to find the most humane way to kill poultry.<br />The book is a no-nonsense, fact-filled resource.  Written for those who are serious about raising poultry (chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, game birds and other poultry).  Written by a professional poultryman, the book covers nutrition, disease, immunity, housing, breeding and management in a comprehensive manner.<br />The writing is clear, terse and complete.  The diagrams and drawings are good.  The book has a superb index, along with a good glossary, a list of associations, an appendix that gives you sources of supplies and equipment, and much more.<br />The descriptions of the breeds of poultry could be better.  The one paragraph given to various breeds is inadequate for those who are unfamiliar with breeds (Wyandottes, Australorps, Araucans etc.).  The feed section is bias towards commercially packaged feeds, and gives little to no information on homemade mashes.  In Peru, we must make our own mash, or go without.<br />All-in-all, Storey's Guide it is a lot more book than I initially needed.  But, after reading through the book, I was both impressed and intrigued enough to consider raising other types of poultry.  Hum, maybe turkeys are next.  I did use Mercia's recommended method for killing chickens  (sever the jugular and insert knife for debraining) and must confess that killing a chicken, regardless of the methodology, is not my preferred hobby.

I now live in Peru four to six months a year and I have reviewed Peruvian travel guides for the past six years.  I must say that the 'Footprint Peru' 4th edition is a quantum improvement over the last edition, and is one of best single guides on Peru on the market now (considering also Rough Guide and Lonely Planet).  Another review may appear under my name below but it is for the 3rd edition.  Buy the 4th edition.<br />When it comes to profiling tour operators this guide is superb.  If you are hiking the Inca Trail or want to visit the Manu Reserve (Manu only has 7 licenced operators) this guide is a must.  The guide has also highlighted some of the NGOs working with abandoned children and environmental issues - applaudable, indeed.<br />The maps in this edition are much better than the last edition and more user friendly.  Many hotels (some hostels) have email addresses and the descriptions and the recommendations are accurate.  The sidebars and highlighted information sections are excellent.  The restaurant (eating) sections are reliable, however, I found various comments on the decor or music, but `nada' on the food or service.<br /><br />Ben Box also has a Footprint Guide on Cusco, but I strongly recommend that even if you are going to just Cusco, you skip that guide and purchase this one.  This guide is more up to date and reliable.  Cusco is in a constant state of change.  Many new hotels, hostels and restaurants open yearly and the best place in Cusco, for up to date information, is the 'South American Explorers Club' in Cusco (Lima, also has a club).  This guide lists the club and its new address on page 156.<br />Impressive is the write up on Choquequiaro, 'lost city of the Incas'.  Larger than Machu Picchu, and only 30% excavated, it is truly a world class destination and the other guides only give it a slight mention.<br />The index is basic and could be much better.  The guide also lacks an accommodations or restaurant index. Thus, if you have a recommended restaurant you want to look up in a large city (Lima, Arequipa, Cusco etc.) you have to go through all the restaurant pages 'til you stumble across the restaurant you seek or miss seeing it completely.<br /><br />Offensive is the use of paid advertisements for hotels, tour companies and travel services (there are over 70 ads in this guide - many are full page).  Not only are the paid advertisements intrusive,  but the advertisements causes one to question the integrity of the guide, especially when a travel company or hotel, with a full page ad,  is also strongly recommended by the authors.<br /><br />The history, politics and culture sections are basic, but do not give you any more information than you could get out of a good encyclopedia.  In Peru there is severe environmental damage going on that gets no mention.  Also, several ecological alarms are being sounded by various NGOs over the depletion or destruction of various habitats, and, finally, the ineptitude of the government, under the new President, Toledo, is retarding any change.  It is alarming that in less than two years the President's approval rating has dropped from 82% to the lowest approval rating in Peruvian history - 14%.  The other two contending guides do a much better job of giving a contemporary picture of the state of Peru.  For those who want a solid social understanding of this nation, I highly recommend the short, 95 page book, Peru: A Guide to the People, Politics and Culture - Interlink Books.<br />Overall, Footprint Peru 4th edition is a top rated guide.  The accommodations, eateries, sights to see and other information is the best guide out to date.  You will do well with the purchase of this guide.

The photos express a evolving understanding of \\"Christ\\" (and a few other connected topics) in our contemporary Western culture.<br />In this book,  Nissan Perez (the curator of Photography at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem) has collected photos reflecting the Western world's meaning of Christ.  Occasionally, in the book, the sacred has been caricatured, even profaned, but, to the curators credit, the book doesn't seek to be \\"religiously correct\\" by editing out the profane, nor the secular; rather he reveals in a balanced way how  today's society understands Christ and Christianity.<br />The book's jacket cover (The Last Supper using `The Sopranos') is one of the many examples of how artists through the ages have utilized religious imagery to express Christ.  The contemporary photos are powerful symbols of the postmodern understanding of both faith and Christ.<br />Paul Tillich (German-American philosopher and theologian) once wrote \\"Man's ultimate concern must be expressed symbolically, because symbolic language alone is able to express the ultimate.\\"  The symbol is the ultimate language of faith.<br />These photos capture the symbol of Christ, the image of Christ and more.  They eloquently express the complexity found in the language of faith.  The symbolic images of  Christ that are captured in these photos: Last Supper, Crucifixion, Descent from the Cross.  The photos are provocative,  and press the interpretation of an orthodox Christ.  Photos can, as this book deftly shows, point beyond themselves to something else, something transcending the mundanity of life.<br />This book, like its many images, transcends words and captures the matrix of faith.  This language of faith deserves to be seen.  Highly recommended.	2003-06-29

A must read for those who desire to understand the political forces that control Peru.  His insight into the critical control that the IMF, WTO and IDB have over developing countries like Peru are eye opening. His sections on the economy and society are informative and succinct.  The poor (54% of the society) struggle daily, living hand-to-mouth while the wealthy and powerful remain safe behind their walled fortress homes.<br />John Crabtree didn't excessively laud ex-president Fujimori terms in office, but neither was he excessively critical of Fujimori's dirty subterfuge, which recently has been disclosed.  Nor was he critical of Fujimori's hatchet man Vladimiro Montesios.  He states, \\"Categorizing Fujimori is not easy.  By no means a traditional dictator, he was certainly no democrat.  Rather, his regime was a hybrid of both elements.\\"<br />As I write this review there are demonstrations in every city in Peru.  In the streets of Cusco, the police, in their attempt to crush a demonstration, killed a teacher (28 May 2003).  President Toledo, is suffering a massive crash in his approval ratings (from 84% after the election to 14% May 2003).  The lowest approval rating ever given to a president.<br />This is a must read profile of Peru.

This (along with a good travel guide, (ie. Footprint Peru 4th ed. - see my review) should be in your suitcase before departure.<br />Jane Holligan's writing is clear, concise and without a political tilt.  She clearly notes \\"there has been no shift of wealth to the poor... and power in Peru remains highly concentrated.\\"  The book is politically dated (pre-2000) and leaves one wanting Holligan to write an update; especially now since ex-president Fujimori's dirty subterfuge has been disclosed and the recently elected President Toledo is suffering a massive crash in his approval ratings (from 84% after the election to 14% May 2003)<br />Her sections on the economy and society are informative and succinct.  The poor (54% of the society) struggle and live hand-to-mouth while the \\"wealth and power remains highly concentrated in Peru.\\"  Twelve families, the so-called `Twelve Apostles, were so powerful that they formed an advisory committee to previous presidents.  This is still a country of masters and servants.<br />Areas of improvement are in the mediocre maps and sparse and dated \\"Further Reading section\\".

I was not disappointed. The book delivered essays that I would not have otherwise read. Many essays gave me pensive perspectives and prompted me to consider worlds that hithertofore did not exist.<br />Some of the selections are provocative; they shun being \\"politically correct\\" (Read Gilbert Meilaender's essay: After Sept. 11th.). John Wilson's, the editor, selections are broad and cover subjects that probably would have escaped your attention (Paul Elie's 'The Last Catholic Writer in America' for example).<br />The title of this book pressed me to ask two provocative questions: \\"What constitutes 'BEST' , and what constitutes 'CHRISTIAN'?.<br />Editors strive, one would think, for clarity among multiplicity. However, John Wilson says nothing about his criteria for selecting the 'Best' 'Christian' essays. He chooses, and the reader is to accept, in a \\"fundamentalist\\" way (without questioning) his discernment.<br />I wanted to know how Wilson determines what is 'best'? The very word, 'best', by itself, implies a critical comparative judgement. Did Wilson, in his selections, hold these writers to the stellar scale of such 'Christian' writers as: Origin, Augustine, Luther, Bunyan, Kierkegarrd, Schweitzer, Bart, C.S. Lewis, Tolkien or Brueggemann (to name just a few)? Nothing is said.<br />Then there is the significance of the heavy laden word 'Christian'. I consider myself one (though others would contest this assertion). The word 'Christian' has substantial implications. To most in North America, 'Christian' implies, at the very least, a moral and spiritual value system. However, every 'Christian' tradition has a different take on this. Which tradition does Wilson tap for his guiding standards? Maybe Greek Orthodox? Catholic? Primitive Baptist? Pentecostal? Presbyterian? Lutheran? Episcopalian? Congregational? Unitarian Universalist? Or the Metropolitan Church? Nothing is said.<br />Also you read the various essays with no specific destination in focus. Normally, \\"Christian\\" writing exists to cause one to reflect, or consider, moral or spiritual issues. Most \\"Christian\\" writing has an agenda and often presses the question, \\"How shall we live\\" as 'Christian'? In this book, with its diverse subjects, you finish the book as you would a good bowl of vegetable soup, satisfied but without a sense of any distinct flavor.<br />Maybe a more accurate title for this book, maybe: 'Outstanding Writings by Various Christians 2002' I strongly recommend the twenty two essays in this for those who want a devotional that will take them outside of their norm. 4.5 starse Metropolitan Church?

Niebuhr's views, historical, cultural and religious, were solidly based in the  context and culture of the late 40's and early 50's.  He wrote as an ethicist who, in 1950, fully comprehended the cataclysmic failure of the German National Church. Now, over fifty years later, with the republishing of Niebuhr's book, his inquiry into the relationship of the Church and the contemporary culture remain valid, though the world and the church have dramatically changed.<br />In &quot;Christ &amp; Culture&quot;  Niebuhr describes five models of  how the sacred &amp; secular can interact.  Ultimately he seeks to give insight into the question of &quot;how shall we, as Christians, live?&quot;  I will not go into the five types, but of the five types, Niebuhr favors most the &quot;Christ transforming Culture&quot;.<br />Faith, in Christ, Niebuhr believed, needs to go beyond separation, accommodation, adoration or polarization and engage dynamically the culture with the values of life that Christ espoused.  Faith in Christ, through presence and social action, will transform the world.  Thus, for Niebuhr, if Christ identified with the poor, we should too.  If Christ took in the orphans and widows, we should too.  If Christ healed the sick, we should too.  Jesus is God-with-us, not to rescue us out of &quot;all of this,&quot; but to redeem, transform, restore us and all of this.  God's work of redemption is not at odds with God's work of creation.  We live in the world, we create the world and we, through faith, are involved in bringing God's &quot;kingdom come, here on earth as it is in heaven.&quot;<br />This is a must read for any student of Christianity.  This is a serious read and it can be a bit dense and daunting at times, but it is non-the-less a Christian Classic that every pastor and thinking Christian should have in their library.  Strongly recommended.	2003-06-17

Last year there was a rash of taxi robberies and rapes. The police in Cusco are a joke. Anyone with a car and who sticks has \\"TAXI\\" written on the front window is not questioned by the authorities.

(see my review)<br />The guide could improve it's weak, mediocre maps.  Also frustrating, in all Footprint guides, is the use a price guide for accommodations.  Instead of just stating the price per room, Footprint gives you a cumbersome group of letters that correspond to the cost of the room.  The problem is that you may forget that LL=$... and up.  Or that the letter \\"A\\" next to a hotel means it costs around $... So you have to find the legion again and figure it out.  You would think that as many years as FootPrint has been around, they would have realized that just quoting the cost of the room in dollars is the best way.<br />Also, there was no mention by Hutchison regarding the rising problems with crime and gangs in Managua (Capital of Nicaragua).  In fact he recommends seeing the old Cathedral \\"at night\\" and, for the past few years, this is and has been, a dangerous area for violent crime.  In fact, when I asked to go to this area in the daytime, even then the taxi driver told me be careful using the words: \\"peligroso, peligroso\\".

Frommers is my first choice for England, and here is why.<br />Fodors publications tend to be for the more affluent travelers.  Dont be mislead by the subtitle, which states: Guide for All Budgets- NOT.  Though I am no longer a young, backpacking, hostel staying traveler, I am not rich, nor am I affluent, nor even close to the 'very comfortable' category.  Rather, probably like most who will buy this guide, I am a mid-income, working stiff.  So, for me, the mass majority of the selections in this book are steep.  In London, most of Fodors accommodations are more than $100, many $200-$400.  Hotels in smaller cities or towns were at $80-$340.  I would not hesitate using any of Fodorï&iquest;½s recommendations.  Lodging reviews are descriptive and accurate.  However, when Fodors states, as it did with the 'Posthouse Kensington' that the hotels standard rooms are on the small side they mean closet small.  Very small, Lilliputian small, infinitesimally small, get the idea?  We could not pass each other in the room without one of us getting on the bed while the other passed.<br />The dining recommendations that Fodors lists are VERY GOOD, and this guide recommends the best restaurants that Great Britain has to offer.  But, though London has many bargain restaurants, and some of these are very good, few are listed.  I found nothing less than $20 per person listed.  Most lunch meals cost (for 2) more than $45 and dinner more than $60.<br />A guide book worth its salt has to guide you with quality maps. The few maps that Fodors uses are good at helping you locate dining or lodging. However, this guide is deficient in the quantity of maps provided.  A very weak area in this guide.<br />Also, instead of giving the general price of lodging (and restaurants) Fodors gives you a cumbersome code to use,  IE ££££=over £230, £££=£160-230, etc.  You need to remember what the symbols stand for as you read through the guide, then, unless you are British, you will need to convert pounds to dollars.  Frommers is much more straight forward and is converted already to dollars.  A significant plus!<br />Fodors is excellent regarding website and email addresses for accommodations, however, even though many of the top restaurant now have their own websites with vivid photos and menus, I found no addresses listed.<br />Their travel information essentials (A-Z information) is very good and there is a top rate Portraits of Great Britain and Books and Movies section.

After spending three weeks in Nicaragua I heard much hype (mainly from those selling real estate there) about the \\"coming boom\\".  It was when the saleman was telling me to \\"get in now, or regret it\\" I recalled the words in the Bhagavadgita, \\"Delusion is the child of ignorance.\\"<br />This book can help, BUT, most of the time, it reads more like a Nicaraguan chamber of commerce advertisement; using lines like: \\"land of opportunity\\", \\"ripe for investment\\", etc.<br />Reality check: Nicaragua is not a San Miguel del Allende (Rated by \\"Money Magazine\\" as one of the top ten retirement locations) nor will it be the next Costa Rica.  I don't want to bash the country, but those considering Nicaragua need to know that it has very poor superstructure, and it is one of the poorest nations in Latin America, and this year it was eliminated from receiving US aid because of massive corruption.  Finally, if that isn't enough, Nicaragua is constantly ravaged by earthquakes and hurricanes.<br />Yes, Nicaragua is a cheap destination. And yes, there are opportunities to be found.  But, before you pack your bags, take time to investigate and do your homework.<br />Christopher Howard does not seriously address the downside of this country and he also uses statements, from unknown sources, failing to qualify their competence as authorities.  Thus, comments from sources which state: \\"Nicaragua has a thriving economy\\" are not only ludicrous, but this type of statements compromises the integrity of the author.<br />Howard makes statements like \\"The country is ripe for foreign investments because it is so underdeveloped.\\"  Wow, Howard!  What a great reason for investing in Nicaragua.  It, and  60% of the world, are \\"ripe for foreign investments\\", eh?.<br />Finally, in the book you will find pages of advertisements for real estate companies, relocation consultants,  and even a plug for tours that are lead by??? you guessed it, the author himself.<br />On the upside,  there is a section called \\"minor obstacles to doing business\\".  Actually, these obstacles can be major.  This section is informative and needs to be heeded.  Also, Howard's  \\"Red Tape\\" section is a must read for those who have made up their mind to come, live and invest in Nicaragua.  And, his 'Health Care' Section, his `Cost of Living' Section, and his `Hired Help' Sections are all provide you with valuable, useful information.<br />His most informative, and provocative section is titled \\"Love and Permanent Companionship\\".  This is a must read for all American men that think that they will find a sweet, young Nica.  Howard points out that  \\"young, attractive, unscrupulous Nicas target Americans/Canadians\\".  Howard states candidly, \\"marriage means you support her and her whole family\\" and that \\"quality Latin women are difficult to meet.\\"  Howard's realistic picture here is applaudable.<br />Is the book self-serving and lacking the critical comparision to other Central America countries? YES.  Can this book help you if you are thinking of living in Nicaragua? YES. Overall, there is useful information packed in these 200 pages that warrants a purchase.

Joshua Berman & Randy Wood have not left a pueblo unexplored nor a  beach missed.  IF you are going visit only Nicaragua, this is the guide to take with you.  If, perchance, you will visit other countries as well, then my first choice is \\"Footprint's Cental America Handbook\\"<br />Every city, town and beach I visited in Nicaragua was covered.  I found their recommendations for accommodations, food and other service in the guide to be \\"right on\\".  In our technology connected world the authors have the web addresses and/or email addresses for most hotels (not the hostels).  Great.<br />Very important for those planning to study Spanish in Nicaragua, this guide has a great rundown of most of the schools in various cities.  This section is a must read before selecting a school (I speak from experience).<br />I do need to point out the poetic license that is taken by the authors.  The authors describing place with magniloquent words, that when the guide is held up to the reality of the place it is not half as wonderful as they say.  Their writing on Leon is a great example.  They write that being in Leon can give you an \\"exotic feeling\\" like the \\"one gets by walking down the cobble stone streets by colonial buildings\\".  If and when you visit Leon you will be there a long, long time looking for that feeling and that street of cobbled stones.  Maybe they meant \\"asphalt streets with pot holes\\".<br />Although the guide is copyrighted 2003 I found that information regarding new hotels, restaurants and bars stopped at or around 2000.  However, the authors introduction section (economy, government etc.) is through 2001. Do note, the upper priced hotels (over $100) only get the mention of their name<br />And how do you make a very good guide - GREAT!?  Well, more maps and better maps, especially of Managua, would be a great place to start.  The guide has information about many sites of interest with corresponding maps to help you navigate.  Also, there is NO section that recommends books or videos. There is no list of foreign embassies to help a traveler locate their embassy in Managua.  Finally, the crime is rising in Managua, but only in Managua, and the guide does not address this.<br />These things said, I still strongly recommend this book.

Besides \\"Let's Go Central America\\", I took two other guides with me for a three week stay in Nicaragua (\\"Moon Handbook-Nicaragua\\" &amp; \\"FootPrint Central America\\" [see my reviews]).  Though this is a good guide, the others were better.<br />'Let's Go' targets a budget minded, backpacker audience.  In this Central America guide the  descriptions of the regions, areas, cities and town are more abbreviated; and they lack the depth, explanations and information needed to allow you to appreciate where you are going and what you will see and experience.  For example, the entire description for a fantastic archipelago in Nicaragua called `Archipelago de Solentiname' is only eight words, &quot;Renowned for its natural beauty and minimalist paintings.&quot;<br />The guides 'Accommodations', 'Food' and 'Sights' are accurate and contemporary, but mainly scoped for the budget minded.  Because the guide covers all of Central America you will find the  history, economy, culture and environment sections  abbreviated.  Thus, if you are going to just one country you would be better off with just that country's guide.<br />Let's Go Central America 2002 would be most useful for those on a tight budget and for those going to various Central American Countries.  But, if I was to choose just one guide for all Central America, it would be: &quot;FootPrint's Central America&quot;.<br />That said, this is still a usable and reliable guide.

If you like short, tense engaging writing, you will enjoy the first half of Viking Funeral.<br />Stephen Cannells bang, bomb, pow writing style is made even more action packed by his use of short, six to ten page, chapters.<br />Cannell is at his best when he takes you into the dark, dangerous other world of the L.A. police.<br />'Viking Funeral' starts with a bang, boom, zing and stays that way as long as the  story stays in Los Angeles.  But the writing loses momentum, and feels disjointed, in the second half of the book.  In the second half the cop hunting cops goes down bumpy, dirt roads in Venezuela and Colombia.  Somewhere down in South America the story  gets lost and bogged down.  In an attempt to keep the story moving forward  Cannell introduces the character of ex-Colonel Santander Cortez, an Aryan, Argentinean sadist.  But the gruesome torture scenes (the ex-colonel peals strips of human flesh from his live, agonizing captives) takes you nowhere.  Finally, a rescue and escape back to L.A.  Yea.<br />Without giving anything away, the ending is both predictable and sappy; reading  like an old Hollywood script where the good guy rides off into the sunset with his true love.<br />That said, this still is a worthwhile airport, pool or beach read.  It  keeps you engaged  enough to be a decent diversion, but not enough where you would miss your flight or the not see the kids in the pool.	2003-03-30

In this work, Leo Perdue has breathed life back into the task of theological interpretation of the Old Testament by clearly listing, defining and highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the various categories of Old Testament interpretation<br />Dr. Leo Perdue points out a variety of new and imaginative directions for Old Testament theology. The Collapse of History gives the reader both an awareness and fresh appreciation of alternative models to Old Testament Theology. Models, whether in science or theology, allows one to construct a new hypothesis with which one can probe, develop and postulate the unapprehended.<br />What Dr. Perdue gives us is a box full of keys with which we may attempt to unlock Old and New Testament's revelation about God and ourselves. Especially provocative are the new and engaging approach of liberation theology and imagination theology. Each of these new schools of thought have encouraged me to go beyond my old paradigms and probe new salient theological truths that are implicit and explicit in scriptural text.<br />Both liberation and imagination perspectives approach biblical theology with vigor and relevancy for our needy world today. I remained concerned how much of academic biblical thinking has been done apart from contemporary theology leaving the learner to juxtapose the two, whereby they can bring a message of relevancy to his/her listeners.<br />Context is critical and so notes liberation theology. Its motif is found in its solidarity with the oppressed and the downtrodden of our world; as well as its rejection of authoritarianism and hierarchy. The underlying focus of liberation theology is freedom from sin, selfishness, indifference and arrogance to others suffering and plight, that come from Jesus Christ. Liberation theology sees Jesus Christ as the embodied extension of Yahweh's identification with the suffering, the poor and the enslaved of the Old Testament: the suffering servant, the redeeming God.<br />Imagination theology has given us a solution for moving from the historic text to a contemporary context. Often biblical theology becomes bogged down in the nuances of scripture, not realizing that for the majority of Christendom critical analysis, historical critique and source hermeneutics are meaningless if the text, and thus the revelation of God, can not be applied contemporaneously.<br />Imagination theology allows for a transcendence of the orthodox and thus produces both the opportunity and ability for God's people to embrace a new vision of order; a kingdom that is responsive to suffering, exploitation and oppression of all of creation.<br />Theological imagination leads to faith; and faith leads to a vital, living community of God; a community committed to ushering in &quot;Thy kingdom come, here on earth as it is in heaven&quot;. The work of Leo Perdue is an important reference for any serious scholar or student of hermeneutics and Old Testament theology.n theology has given us a solution for moving from the historic text to a contemporary context.

When you finish the 94 pages you will have a solid perspective of this country.

In London words like  \\"inexpensive lodging\\" are a oxymoron.  The authors do offer more help for those hoping to find accommodations less than $100 a night but in London it is a quest.  For example, in the South Kensington section titled \\"inexpensive\\" you will find the `Swiss House Hotel' (really a B&B) at $165 double.  Their South Kensington titled \\"Very Expensive\\" quotes prices at or around $400-$500 per night, sometimes more.<br />That said, all of their recommendations are reliable.  The descriptions of accommodation, restaurant, pubs, sights, etc. are all very good.  Frommer's makes life a bit easier for their readers by giving the cost of accommodations and restaurant in both British pounds and dollars. YEA.<br />Almost all of the hotels have website listing.  Seeing your accommodations in color via the web is a major help. However, for the restaurants there are no web page listings; even though many of the top restaurants now have their own websites with vivid photos and descriptive menus.

Two issues `twisted her lemon', one was the paltry lack of information on important locations (Salisbury and its magnificent cathedral gets 58 words, Stonehenge a short paragraph) and the other was the difficult and demanding way the guide connects the hotel descriptions to the maps.<br />Regarding the first point, the title of the guide is very clear about what it covers: Hotel's and Itineraries. It is not a country guide.<br />Karen Brown's selections of hotels are excellent and her comments and appraisals are `spot-on.  She writes as one who has actually stayed at each establishment, who has met the owners or managers, and one who paints a picture of what you will find and the experiences that you should have when using one of these select properties.  Great.  That said you should know before purchasing this guide that these hotel selections are some of the most unique and best in the UK.  Therefore, they are not for those on a shoestring or moderate budget; but rather, as the financially well-endowed would say, these guides are for those with \\"discriminating tastes.\\"  Her website, karenbrown.com, is worth a visit and you can check out the various accommodations listing in greater detail.<br />Besides top notch unique accommodations, the guide gives you nine extraordinary driving itineraries that wind you through the very best regions of England, Wales &amp; Scotland.  This is what the book is all about.  Nada mas.  I kindly pointed this out to my girlfriend.<br />Regarding the second point, the guide is cumbersome.  Karen Brown needs to make finding the hotels, which correspond to dot on her maps, much easier.  Her driving itineraries are in the front of the book, and the recommended hotels in the last part of the book and there is no simple reference between the two.  There are much better ways to set this up.  Karen Brown needs to learn from the major guide publishers. They could help her a lot here.

Fueled by idealism and burning spiritual passion, this medical missionary led one of the most intense lives of the 20th century.\\"<br />Be apprized that \\"Out of my Life and Thoughts\\" is not an easy read.

He took these principles and undauntedly applied them to his religion and his culture. Albert Schweitzer was a critic of Christianity and modern civilization and this book captures Albert Schweitzer, \\"the critic\\".<br />In the world and church around him he saw conformity and the lack of individual reflection. This is a book about a nonconformism, a brilliant theologian/philosopher and a humanitarian genius.<br />Unlike other biographies of Schweitzer I have read, these authors write with a fluid, engaging style, pulling you closer to the man that they knew and profiled. Albert Schweitzer lived 90 years and the length of his life is a challenge that biographers must face. They must capture the individualistic spirit of Albert Schweitzer youth, the brilliance of his middle years and the tenacity of his old age.<br />Albert Schweitzer's Nobel Peace Prize in 1953 spoke of his sacrificial work in Africa, his vital practical philosophy of life, his call to clear comprehension of the historic Jesus that Christianity needs to embrace, his musical brilliance, his compassion for the animal kingdom and his love of healing. Yet, to brush stroke with ink a portrait of this unbelievable figure is a demanding undertaking and Marshall and Poling have done it right, and they did right to one of the greatest personalities of the twentieth century. Strongly recommended. 4.5 Stars.	2003-02-04

A man who lived a contradictory life, had an \\"almost clinical, even arrogant intelligence\\". James Bentley profiles Albert Schweitzer using the same standard as if he were a normal \\"Joe\\". This is a critical error.<br />Albert Schweitzer was a genius, a German genius and in the genre of German geniuses (Bach, Wagner, Bonhoffer, Kant, Harnack, Strauss, Einstein, Sarte, Bultmann, Nietzsche and Goethe, to name a few) Albert Schweitzer is no more idiosyncratic than any other German genius.<br />Consider, at thirty years old Albert Schweitzer had earned two doctorates in philosophy and theology, and was about to earn two more in music and medicine. He transformed Christianity's understanding of Jesus Christ by his landmark book \\"Quest for the Historical Jesus.\\" He was the head of a theological seminary, a minister in the Lutheran church and, in his spare time, was a virtuoso on the piano and organ as well as an expert on the life and works of Johann Sebastian Bach. Then, at 30, he left everything Europe had to offer to become a medical doctor to the poor in French Equatorial Africa.<br />Yes, he had eccentricities, he was quirky and obstinately focused, but not, as the title portrays, an \\"enigma\\".<br />A great man attracts critics, large and small. Often the book takes on the hue of a vendetta vindicated by this former Anglican priest. Bentley seeks to prove that Schweitzer had a \\"tormented\\" and \\"deeply miserable\\" childhood. I find it odd that Albert Schweitzer, in his two books on his childhood, never mentions this and only states how normal and enjoyable his childhood was. Bentley points out that Albert Schweitzer had a hospital that was run exclusively by whites, though Albert Schweitzer was publicly and personally opposed to racism.<br />On the positive side Bentley does look behind the curtain to see what brought Schweitzer to his place of fame. He seeks to understand what made this brilliant, determined and headstrong man, a man who was above all a \\"searcher of truth,\\" a man who never lost his ideals. His expose on Schweitzer's time studying Bach and organ building (his second musical passion) is a must read for any music lover. He places great emphasis on the mentors who helped direct and shape this great man. Bentley also brings his expertise to bear on Schweitzer's views on the historical Jesus.<br />Bentley's writing is not breezy nor brisk. It is more like a sermon that is erudite and interesting, but in need of a zap by the Holy Ghost. This book is better suited for students and afficionados of Schweitzer rather than general readers. As George Marshall once said, \\"In Schweitzer's life one finds contrast, disappointments, frustrations anger, defeat and fame.\\" In the end Albert Schweitzer never abandoned his quest for the truth, even when this quest branded him as a heretic. Today, for all of us, Schweitzer remains a permanent inspiration to all who believe in the sanctity of life and becoming all they can become.

Germs\\" convincingly underscores the fact that our government cannot protect us from the impending disaster that will, according to top authorities, come to America in cataclysmic proportion. The best our government can do is respond to the attack and attempt to save as many lives as possible.<br />What is so amazing about this book is, by the time you are a third through it you are amazed that we are not all dead. As the book clearly points out, IT IS NOT because of the competence of our FBI, CIA, CDC or other government agencies. The authors clearly point out how time after time our government intelligence and health agencies rise to each occasion and fly the flag of ineptitude; and now we sadly realize this (sic. September 11th ).<br />The authors begin and end the book illustrating that biological weapons are, in contrast to other weapons of mass destruction, comparatively easy to produce. Nuclear weapons are expensive, extremely difficult to build and relatively easy to detect. Biological weapons are none of the above. Germs should convince you that the next war will be fought in the heartland of America and will be carried out by either rogue states, terrorist groups or lone actors.<br /> \\"Individuals can make war with these new weapons\\", Joshua Lederberg, biologist and Nobel Laureate, warned President Clinton in 1998. After which Clinton told the New York Times that neither nuclear nor chemical weapons are as frightening as what he has learned about germ warfare.<br />Miller, Engelberg and Broad have done a great service by giving all Americans a wake-up call. An alarm that goes beyond the cold war nuclear scare of the 60's because there are no germ shelters that can be built and used effectively. When the biological attack begins you will not know it, it will only be days after the attack that symptoms occur, then donning of a bio-suit is too late.<br />To say this is a disturbing book is an understatement. The report that Russia has developed lethal, futuristic germs, including a super-anthrax; \\"germs meant to seize control of the human metabolism, causing a body to self-destruct,\\" is more than unnerving. Today, in our world, biotechnology is coupling with virology and in the words of the authors new kinds of \\"designer pathogens that can defeat drugs, antidotes and vaccines\\" are being produced.<br />The final sentence in the book is worth repeating. \\"We remain woefully unprepared for a calamity that would be unlike any this country has ever experienced.\\" Apocalyptic.

Mobil Travel Guide is one of the three guides that I reviewed during my two week driving vacation through Florida and it came in last (Frommer's #1, Fodor's #2 [see my reviews]).<br />For 44 years Mobil has been rating lodgings and restaurants using a demanding and defining star system.  According to the book's preface, every establishment listed in this guide was supposedly evaluated and \\"inspected by  EXPERIENCED field representatives\\".  I have doubts about that.<br />The standards used by Mobil to inspect and evaluate restaurants are stringent.  In Florida there are NO five star restaurants.  There are 23 four star restaurants (four star \\"reflects superb dining choices, where remarkable food is served\\").  In tandem, there are only three  lodgings that get five stars and seventeen that get a  four star rating.  Considering there are 22,000 restaurants and lodgings listed in this tourist guide, a five star Mobil rating should be near true perfection.  Initially, until I used the guide, that was impressive.<br />I am very impressed with the restaurant ratings, BUT I am disturbed by the hotel ratings.  The restaurants that I used the guide to find were what the guide promised.  The lodgings were not.<br />In Ocala, Florida the guide gave a three star rating (\\"professionally staffed, beautifully appointed and the lodging experience is truly excellent\\") to a major chain.  I stayed at this recommended property and, it was a good hotel/motel, but not as the guide states:  an \\"excellent lodging experience\\".  The guide gave the same rating to a much better national/international chain hotel.  Go figure.<br />Worse was to come.  In Ft. Lauderdale another three star rating was given to a major name  Resort and Spa Hotel in Fort Lauderdale.  I stayed there and it was such a run down \\"has been\\" of a hotel (bad Service, dirty building, rotted wood railings, refrigerator door broken, hole in blanket, housekeeping did not clean counters or empty trash), that I wrote the company and to their credit, I got a full refund.  The guide states that \\"three stars\\" means: professionally staffed, beautifully appointed and the lodging experience is truly excellent.  NOT!<br />Another swampy side of the guide is the abysmal layout.  There is no index to speak of; only an attraction, lodging and restaurant list.  You find name after name of lodgings or restaurants with no index to a page: None.  Go figure.<br />To complicate and make this guide \\"user inhospitable\\", there is no separation of lodgings or restaurants by price or even rating.  The publisher listed them alphabetically.  So a five star is followed by a two star, then a three star, one star and a four star.  Unlike the other guides which give you structures (very expensive, expensive, moderate) with this guide you just surf through the listings and select.<br />The listings have NO commentaries to speak of, just the star rating and factual information (credit cards, time, cost, facilities etc.).  Only restaurants with four or five stars get a small, ittty-bitty commentary.<br />The Maps, provided by \\"Mapquest\\", are few and far between, and appear to be an after-thought.  They lack the usefulness found in the city maps of other guides (Foder' & Frommer's).  Good city maps, that legend and mark clearly the recommended restaurant and hotels, are a prerequisite for good guides, and the `Mobil Travel Guide' fails totally here.<br />Though the guide does have Internet addresses and web sites, and though its star rating system (only for the restaurants) is commendable, it cannot compete with either Zagat or Frommer's as a  primary guide.

Am. countries	I have only been in five of the fourteen countries covered in this handbook, but of those I have travel through, I found this all-in-one guide to be succinct, reliable and valuable. That said, it does not replace the comprehensiveness of a specific country guide. Basically, this handbook is a digested compilation of the specific country handbooks that Footprint produces. Thus, if you are only visiting one or two countries, buy those handbooks. If you are going to explore South America and want only one guide, this guide will be valuable.<br />Each country section is condensed, comprehensive and reliable. Though smaller towns will be omitted, the most important cities, towns and sites will be covered. Each country has been segmented into regions, as noted by the country's map, and within each region Footprint covers the top two, three or four cities or towns in a region. Basic travel information is given at the beginning of each country.<br />As with all Footprint Handbooks this guide has excellent color maps. In the back of the guide you will find ... exceptional color maps of South America. Also, throughout the book, I found the b&w maps of regions and cities to be very good.<br />Another impressive aspect of this guide is found at the beginning, in the 'Essentials' section, where there is a very good discussion of bringing and using a car/SUV throughout South America. This section also includes information on motorcycling and a section on cycling throughout South America.<br />Though each country section does have a 'futher reading & useful websites' section, this is very basic. The section on health/vaccination is bare bone basic.<br />On the \\"downside\\" I often found that the brevity of the restaurant and lodging remarks were so terse (or no remarks at all) that they were not helpful, i.e.,. Hotel Barros Arana (Chile):modern, or a restaurant remark: good not cheap, or a hostel: helpful. Also I find the intrusive paid advertisements for hotels, tour companies, hostels, calling cards and travel<br />services throughout the book (a half-page, a full-page, a quarter page) offensive. The purchase ... should be more than enough to make a profit, but Footprint chooses to afflict its readers with uninvited advertising to increase its profits.<br />For those using glasses, the small type that the publishers uses will cause you to strain to read in low or poorly lighted areas. Also, the pricing for accommodations is a cumbersome rating system that could be simplified. It is not user friendly. There is no pricing guide for restaurants.<br />That said, this is an adequate, to very good, guide for those who are going to visit a multitude of countries while in South America. The information is current and reliable. Especially recommended for those that plan to motor through South America.

The restaurant suggestions are solid.  Also, for those traveling to South Florida, this guide would be good and is recommended.  3.5 stars	2003-01-05

Florida Restaurants (Zagatsurvey : Miami, South Florida Restaurants, 2002)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A Great Dining guide for those living in Miami!	On my two week journey to Miami I used this guide as a supplemental fill-in guide to Frommer's South Florida.  Broken into four regions: Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Palm Beach and the Keys, this Zagat Survey will save you time (and disappointment) by helping you select the best place to feast.<br /><br />I have used other Zagat Surveys for years and have found them to be up-to-date and reliable in their critical evaluation of a restaurant's food, ambiance and service.  Scoring 1-30 in each category (food, decor, service), a restaurant's top score in each category can be 30.  The \\"Chef Allen's\\" Restaurant (Miami) scored 27, 23, 25 . . .  the highest  score in Miami.  The remaining restaurants in Miami have a flagship to follow. One of the most useful features is the guide's &quot;Top Rating&quot; sections: Top Food by Cuisine, Best Buys, Most Popular, Top Outdoor, Top Romantic, Top Views, etc.<br /><br /> This is a very good pocket guide and, if there is a downside, it is the lack of maps.  Of the four profiled areas, only Miami and Ft. Lauderdale get two small maps each, showing on the map the 40 most popular restaurants in each area.  Another area that may disappoint some is the terse 50 word description for each restaurant, a brief narrative that fails to mention any outstanding restaurant dishes.  If you are looking for a fuller restaurant description, for a few select South Florida restaurants, I commend to you \\"Frommer's South Florida\\" travel guide.  This guide is best for those that live in Miami.  That said, Zagat has been, and is, a great dining guide for these areas. Recommended!	2002-11-10

This is a dense and demanding read and, unless you have a basic comprehension of the deeper issues of both science and Christianity, you will be zooming around in Twilight Zone.<br />In Barbour's book quantum physics meets process theology, thrashes around and out comes... hum, well, I'm not actually sure.  I got a bit lost in post-Darwinian evolution, genetics, neuroscience, astronomy, thermodynamics and relativity.  I almost had it when Barbour threw in a dose of genetic engineering and global environmental issues.  I felt like I was back at Cal State in a 400 level class as a freshman.  Get the drift? &quot;Genetic Drift&quot;?<br />It is best to give you an example of his writing from a portion of his opening statement, Chapter 4;<br />&quot;I hope to show that it is consistent with neuroscience, computer science and a theological view of human nature to understand a person as a multilevel, psychosomatic unity.... In the first three sections (of this chapter) I look at neuroscience, theology and research on artificial intelligence.  I then examine some philosophical interpretations of consciousness.  Finally I suggest that process philosophy (Albert Whitehead) can provide a conceptual framework for integrating these varied prospective on human nature.&quot;<br />When you consider his astute, erudite writing, and that he is tackling some of the thorniest issues confronting contemporary science and theology today, you have a slow and demanding read.<br />Dr. Barbour seldom uses stories or examples,  but, when he does, they are like rain on parched earth.  Relished.<br />Conditionally Recommended for any science or theology student or professional.	2002-10-20

That night, I listened to our guests amenable chatter, while they passed the large platter of meat, each one piling their plate full of meat, red, juicy beef. I said nothing. Yet, throughout the dinner I hearing my inner voice say over and over... 'E coli, E coli, E coli'.<br />This is a disturbing book, especially regarding effects that both the meat industry and fast food industry have on our health. This is a damning book for the under-regulated meat industry and equally damning for the Republican Party, which, according to Schlosser's research, is comfortably in bed with the meat industry and actively blocks efforts to heighten the health standards of the meat industry. Schlosser names prominent Republican Party politicians who have received generous contributions from the meat and fast food industry and thereafter acted to restrain and reduced the effectiveness of the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service to detect and remove contaminated meat.<br />Also daunting is the size of both mammoth international corporations that control much of what America eats. Power and greed meet Big Mac's and fries in this engaging and exemplary book. There are many striking chapters in this book. Chapter One: 'Founding Fathers' offers fascinating sketches of the men that shaped the fast food industry. Chapter Four: \\"Success\\" tells about the development of the franchise method of business ownership. Chapter Five: \\"Why the Fries Taste So Good\\" gives a glimpse into the world of chemically engineered flavorings, both natural and artificial.<br />In reflection; Americans spent 110 billion dollars on fast food in 2000 and fast foods great taste was but one of the many reasons. Though Eric Schlosser lays out the convicting reasons we should change our diet, I am afraid that telling Americans to stop eating fast food, that they are getting obese, and it is bad for their health, will have the same effect as telling Dean Martin to stop drinking, that alcohol was going to kill him.

As raw, ragging and heart wrenching novel as I have ever read. By fluke, I grabbed 'White Oleander' off a \\"trade-a-book\\" shelf, in a hostel in Peru. By noon I was entangled and engrossed in the struggling, teenage world of Astrid. Abandoned both physically and psychologically by Ingrid, her mother, first by intention, then murder, Astrid, via multiple foster care homes, seeks survival, self-awareness and love. Her journey brings her to face her to her own underworld, her mother's netherworld and finally to construct her own world.<br />Janet Fitch tells a masterful story, full of twists and turns, but the story is never convoluted. Motherhood, a complicated and difficult subject at best, is dissected and the properties of it are examined via the characters of the various foster care mothers that Ingrid is forced to live with. But, always, as a constant contrast, motherhood is laid out against the dark and<br />deficient character of Astrid's own murderous and diabolical mother. This extraordinary novel deserves all the raves, awards and acclaims that it received and it deserves to be read. Highly Recommended.	2002-10-19

John Shelby Spong does not believe in a Theistic God and he states so forcefully; &quot;Theism is dead, I joyfully proclaim.&quot; THEISM as Bishop Spong defines it, is &quot;a being, supernatural in power, dwelling outside this world and invading the world periodically to accomplish the divine will&quot;.<br />Yet, Spong admits, &quot;Christianity postulates a theistic God who does supernatural things&quot;. Christianity is about God invading the world through Jesus Christ. Christianity is, and has been for 2000 years (give or take), &quot;Emmanuel&quot; - God with us, visibly and dramatically. &quot;Christianity is a THEISTIC religion&quot; said Dr. Sally McFague (Professor of Theology -Vanderbilt Divinity School - author of the pensive and provocative book, 'Life Abundant' - envisioning Christianity for the new century - see my review). <br />Therein lies the rub. Allow me to digress. A man had a Honda Civic that needed the engine overhauled. He decided to 'radically' change the car and make it a quarter-mile race car. He pulled out the engine and transmission, threw out the brakes, replaced the tires and the suspension. He gutted the interior completely (graciously keeping the windshield and wipers). He then cut away parts of the body to accommodate the new parts and welded the doors shut. He put in a high performance, 400 horsepower engine and modified what was left of the car so that it could reach speeds in excess of 110 mph in 9 seconds. Now, with a great stretch of the imagination you could say this man still had a Honda Civic, but, in reality, he had created a new vehicle. <br />This book is not a &quot;radically, reformed&quot; car, so to speak, it is a completely different car. Bishop Spong has taken a blow torch and sliced out the parts of Christianity that he no longer believes in or adheres to. <br />He has not &quot;radically reformed Christianity&quot; he has created a new belief system.<br />For Spong; God is not a supernatural being, Jesus is notthe earthly incarnation of God, the Bible is not the &quot;Word of God&quot;, the supernatural miracles of Jesus did not happen and Jesus was not resurrected, nor did he return to God. God, incarnation, atonement, Trinity, miracles, 'Christian' morals, and the Church as it exists today are all replaced. What the title of this book should be, is, &quot;A New Religion for a New World&quot;, for that is what Bishop Spong is giving us. T\<br />This is not to say that he does not have something to say. He does and he says it well. <br />Bishops Spong radically questions the basic assumptions of conventional Christian theology and attacks the paradigms that ecclesiastical hierarchy find convenient. He rejects: Theism's tribal theology, bibliolatry, Jesusolatry, and Christianity as an exclusive pathway to God. His &quot;beyond theism&quot; theology demands that we stand and embrace our own humanity, not with shame or the stigma of sin, but recognizing that we are unique and full of potential. That we can, without an &quot;eternal and omnipotent protector&quot; and live fully, love fully and be all that we can be. <br />The God that Spong embraces is &quot;not a being but BEING itself. This God is the source of life, the source of love, the Ground of Being.&quot; For Spong God is beyond any limits of our religious systems. God is no longer a being 'external' to life, but the very BEING of life itself. He says, &quot;I have walked beyond theism, but not beyond God&quot;. He forewarns that to separate yourself from the belief of a theistic God is painful. Those that do will have to stand without magic or miracles. He writes, &quot;we make no attempt to suggest that life is fair or to defend the theistic deity when life is harsh. We do not cultivate a false security.&quot; <br />Bishop Spong deserves the accolade given to those who push out the boundaries of any rigid system. Especially in religion, those that hold controversial opinions and especially dissenters like Spong, who publicly depart from the officially accepted dogma, are marginalized and labeled. Spong has paid the price of apostasy in his search for truth, life, love and God. This book is required reading for all those searching for the same. Highly recommended	2002-10-19

I have no children, yet I seek to pray for the children of the world. Marian Wright Edelman has helped me to do this, more, and better.<br />Her preface to \\"Guide My Feet\\" is worth the purchase price alone. The mini-biography of how her family, faith and community supported her struggles through the black/white segregation in America and how she broke through to become a woman who has brought social reform to our country is a notable portrait indeed. Her collection of prayers are poetic, pensive and will penetrate through our hectic, occupied lives:<br />\\"Lord , let me not be so busy working to buy the things that my children want that I cannot give them the time and attention and love they need.\\"<br />Just before I picked up Edelman's book, I finished reading Eric Schlosser's \\"Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal\\" (Highly Recommended - see my review). As Marian Edelman worries in every fiber of her being, \\"about our many children who, lacking a sense of the sacred or internal moral mooring are, trying to grow up in a society without boundaries\\" and the \\"relentless cultural messages glamorizing violence, sex, possessions, alcohol, and tobacco\\", Schlosser will, if you read the books in tandem, show in \\"Fast Food Nation\\" that we all need to increase our concern and prayers towards the omnipresence marketing efforts directed daily at our children.  Yes, prayer works, but so does responsible parenting. These two books should be read concurrently. As Schlosser notes \\"the typical American child now spends about twenty-one (21) hours a week watching television - roughly one and a half months of TV every year. About 25% of American Children between the ages of two and five have a TV in their room\\". Marian Edelman's prayer, \\"God help us to shut off television and radio and computer and phone so that we can communicate with each other.\\" is timely indeed.<br /><br />Every month 90% of American children between three and nine visit a McDonald's. Each year fast food chains annually spend more than $3 billion on television advertising directed at children. A taste for fat developed in childhood is difficult to lose as an adult, and obesity is extremely difficult to cure. That said, and noting the above statistic, please remember that over one-quarter of all American children are obese or very overweight (African American children leading this group). Perhaps, besides prayer, we should also use modified Biblical quotes to protect our children; \\"McDonald's get hence behind me\\".<br />The prayers of this book plead with, and petition God (as most prayers do) in a raw, honest way that comes from the heart of a parent who desperately loves her children. The wisdom and prayers found in this book will affect you and hopefully infect you with the same raw honesty needed to raise a child today.

Lead me not into Religion.<br />Because the title of the book promises so much, \\"The BEST Christian Writing\\" I assumed this book would be just that... Christian Writing at its Best. But it is neither \\"Christian\\" in its theme, nor \\"Best\\" in the writing.<br />Let's start with the word \\"Christian\\". To use this word would predispose the editor to select writing that is by its focus Christian\\"; you know writing that focuses on Christianity. It could include Christian fundamentalism, Christian orthodoxy, Christian Catholicism, Christian pentecostalism, the Christian radical right or liberal fringe, or even, something about Jesus Christ. You get the point.<br />But, John Wilson has done none of the above to any significant degree. Rather, he has given us a smattering of various outlooks on life that hang hinged, sometimes, loosely, on the word \\"Christian\\". There is no prevailing Christian theme. The writing flails around, whacking at various issues. Everything from the Pope to Public Schools. You can read about quantum mechanics, Erik Erikson, or the Azure-Hooded Jay. You get the point.<br />Regarding the word \\"Best\\", well, of the twenty-two writings, from various publications or direct submissions ONLY SIX of them are stellar or significant. The remaining are fair to mediocre. Thus, the quality of writing spans a gamut that includes THE EXCELLENT AND ENGAGING WRITINGS of J. Bottum and Richard John Neuhaus ('Pius XII and the Nazis' and 'Born Towards Dying') Just skip the droning of E. Ericson (A Father to the End). Save your money and if you must go to the library for this book. Conditionally Recommended.	2002-09-09

I have only been in five of the fourteen countries covered in this handbook, but of those I have travel through, I found this all-in-one guide to be succinct, reliable and valuable. That said, it does not replace the comprehensiveness of a specific country guide. Basically, this handbook is a digested compilation of the specific country handbooks that Footprint produces. Thus, if you are only visiting one or two countries, buy those handbooks. If you are going to explore South America and want only one guide, this guide will be valuable.<br />Each country section is condensed, comprehensive and reliable. Though smaller towns will be omitted, the most important cities, towns and sites will be covered. Each country has been segmented into regions, as noted by the country's map, and within each region Footprint covers the top two, three or four cities or towns in a region. Basic travel information is given at the beginning of each country.<br />As with all Footprint Handbooks this guide has excellent color maps. In the back of the guide you will find ... exceptional color maps of South America. Also, throughout the book, I found the b&w maps of regions and cities to be very good.<br />Another impressive aspect of this guide is found at the beginning, in the 'Essentials' section, where there is a very good discussion of bringing and using a car/SUV throughout South America. This section also includes information on motorcycling and a section on cycling throughout South America.<br />Though each country section does have a 'futher reading & useful websites' section, this is very basic. The section on health/vaccination is bare bone basic.<br />On the \\"downside\\" I often found that the brevity of the restaurant and lodging remarks were so terse (or no remarks at all) that they were not helpful, i.e.,. Hotel Barros Arana (Chile):modern, or a restaurant remark: good not cheap, or a hostel: helpful. Also I find the intrusive paid advertisements for hotels, tour companies, hostels, calling cards and travel<br />services throughout the book (a half-page, a full-page, a quarter page) offensive. The purchase ... should be more than enough to make a profit, but Footprint chooses to afflict its readers with uninvited advertising to increase its profits.<br />For those using glasses, the small type that the publishers uses will cause you to strain to read in low or poorly lighted areas. Also, the pricing for accommodations is a cumbersome rating system that could be simplified. It is not user friendly.

Schlosser names prominent Republican Party politicians who have received generous contributions from the meat and fast food industry and thereafter acted to restrain and reduced the effectiveness of the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service to detect and remove contaminated meat.<br />Also daunting is the size of both mammoth international corporations that control much of what America eats. Power and greed meet Big Mac's and fries in this engaging and exemplary book. There are many striking chapters in this book. Chapter One: 'Founding Fathers' offers fascinating sketches of the men that shaped the fast food industry. Chapter Four: \\"Success\\" tells about the development of the franchise method of business ownership. Chapter Five: \\"Why the Fries Taste So Good\\" gives a glimpse into the world of chemically engineeredflavorings, both natural and artificial. <br />In reflection; Americans spent 110 billion dollars on fast food in 2000 and fast foods great taste was but one of the many reasons. Though Eric Schlosser lays out the convicting reasons we should change our diet, I am afraid that telling Americans to stop eating fast food, that they are getting obese, and it is bad for their health, will have the same effect as telling Dean Martin to stop drinking, that alcohol was going to kill him. And it did.<br />This is a highly recommended, unsettling socialcultural report that is a required read by anyone who seeks to understand American culture and all that are packing the pounds.	2002-09-09

By fluke, I grabbed 'White Oleander' off a \\"trade-a-book\\" shelf, in a hostel in Peru. By noon I was entangled and engrossed in the struggling, teenage world of Astrid. Abandoned both physically and psychologically by Ingrid, her mother, first by intention, then murder, Astrid, via multiple foster care homes, seeks survival, self-awareness and love. Her journey brings her to face her to her own underworld, her mother's netherworld and finally to construct her own world.<br />Janet Fitch tells a masterful story, full of twists and turns, but the story is never convoluted. Motherhood, a complicated and difficult subject at best, is dissected and the properties of it are examined via the characters of the various foster care mothers that Ingrid is forced to live with. But, always, as a constant contrast, motherhood is laid out against the dark and<BR>deficient character of Astrid´s own murderous and diabolical mother. This extraordinary novel deserves all the raves, awards and acclaims that it received and it deserves to be read. Highly Recommended.	2002-09-09

Shelley (1792-1822)<br />This memoir was given to me by my girlfriend, with the concise notice, \\"you must read this\\". Smiling, I graciously accepted the book and stuck it at the bottom of my towering stack of \\"must read before I die\\" books. Susan is a sweet, sensitive Southern girl, who also possesses the tenacity of Scarlett O'Hara. Thus, within days, she pulled this book from the bottom of the stack and coyly placed it back on top, with a yellow 'stick'em' note attached: \\"read it!\\".<br />She knew that I had recently experienced the undulating joys and sorrows that go with building, reconstructing or refurbishing a house. The fact that my house is in a remote valley, near Cusco, Peru, makes Frances Mayes' book an imperfect fit, but at still very pertinent. Although the people in my Peruvian valley are stuck a half century behind Italy, I have mirrored many of Frances Mayes' building and learning experiences. That said, this book is a required and enjoyable read for anyone before, during or after building, reconstructing or refurbishing a home in any country.<br />Besides being an engaging read on life in Italy and its sumptuous food, Frances Mayes has pollinated her experiences with various interesting vignettes: beekeeping, the life of a fig, pine nuts, food, more food and still more sumptuous Italian food.<br />Different people read any given book in different ways. Many of the reviewers of this read touted and raved about Mayes' travel memoirs, others raved about the sensual epicurean nature of the book. But, as a male, a divorced male, a divorced male that has labored on the restoration of a past girlfriend's house, I cannot but wonder about Ed. Frances Mayes was recently divorced when she found her \\"new identity\\" in the house in Bramsole. She also started a new relationship with a contemporary professor named Ed. Ed's name no longer is mentioned when she wrote her preface, dated five years after the story begins. So, \\"What happened to Ed?\\" Throughout the book you will read about Ed's endless efforts in helping Frances Mayes rebuild her Italian farm house. The writing of these memoirs took a few years and without a doubt, as the book attests throughout, Ed worked his derriere off. So my male nature perks up and wonders what the heck happened to Ed? Maybe Ed will write his version of \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\" and title it \\"Sunburned in Tuscany\\". I know, it's a male thing.<br />That said, and after I put the book down, with a sigh of enjoyment, I remember the words that I read halfway through the book. Frances Mayes wrote words that echoed my sentiment about building a home and living in another country. She says, \\"I know the appeal (of having a home and living in Italy) to me is partly the balance it restores to my life in America.\\" She, like me, knows America is home, but she recognizes that a hiatus in another country not only refreshes the soul, it enhances the spirit of life itself. That is what \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\" is about, life itself.

Christianity is about God invading the world  through Jesus Christ.  Christianity is, and has been for 2000 years (give or take), \\"Emmanuel\\" - God with us, visibly and dramatically.  \\"Christianity is a THEISTIC religion\\" said Dr. Sally McFague (Professor of Theology -Vanderbilt Divinity School - author of the pensive and provocative book, `Life Abundant' - envisioning Christianity for the new century  - see my review).<br />Therein lies the rub.  Allow me to digress.  A man had a Honda Civic that needed the engine overhauled.  He decided to `radically' change the car and make it a quarter-mile race car.  He pulled out the engine and transmission, threw out the brakes, replaced the tires and the suspension.  He gutted the interior completely (graciously keeping the windshield and wipers). He then cut away parts of the body to accommodate the new parts and welded the doors shut.  He put in a high performance, 400 horsepower engine and modified what was left of the car so that it could reach speeds in excess of 110 mph in 9 seconds.<br />Now, with a great stretch of the imagination you could say this man still had a Honda Civic, but, in reality, he had created a new vehicle. This is not a \\"radically, reformed\\" car,  it is a completely different car. Bishop Spong has taken a blow torch and sliced out the parts of  Christianity that he no longer believes in or adheres to.  He has not \\"radically reformed Christianity\\" he has created a new belief system.<br />For Spong; God is not a supernatural being, Jesus is not the earthly incarnation of God, the Bible is not the &quot;Word of God&quot;, the supernatural miracles of Jesus did not happen and Jesus was not resurrected, nor did he return to God.  God, incarnation, atonement, Trinity, miracles, `Christian' morals, and the Church as it exists today are all replaced. What the title of this book should be, is, \\"A New Religion for a New World\\", for that is what Bishop Spong is giving us.<br />This is not to say that he does not have something to say.  He does and he says it well.  Bishops Spong radically questions the basic assumptions of conventional Christian theology and attacks the paradigms that ecclesiastical hierarchy find convenient.  He rejects: Theism's tribal theology,  bibliolatry, Jesusolatry, and Christianity as an exclusive pathway to God.<br />His \\"beyond theism\\" theology demands that we stand and embrace our own humanity, not with shame or the stigma of sin, but recognizing that we are unique and full of potential.  That we can, without an \\"eternal and omnipotent protector\\" and live fully, love fully and be all that we can be.<br />The God that Spong embraces is \\"not a being but BEING itself.  This God is the source of life, the source of love, the Ground of Being.\\"  For Spong God is beyond any limits of our religious systems.  God is no longer a being `external' to life, but the very BEING of life itself.  He says, \\"I have walked beyond theism, but not beyond God\\".<br />He forewarns that to separate yourself from the belief of a theistic God is painful.  Those that do will have to stand without magic or miracles.  He writes,  \\"we make no attempt to suggest that life is fair or to defend the theistic deity when life is harsh.  We do not cultivate a false security.\\"<br />Bishop Spong deserves the accolade given to those who push out the boundaries of any rigid system.  Especially in religion, those that hold controversial opinions and especially dissenters like Spong, who publicly depart from the officially accepted dogma, are marginalized and labeled.  Spong has paid the price of apostasy in his search for truth, life, love and God. This book is required reading for all those searching for the same.  Highly recommended.e of apostasy in his search for truth, life, love and God. This book is required reading for all those searching for the same.  Highly recommended.	2002-08-08

In `The Human Being', Wink redefines divinity, not as godlike, but as fully human, and calls us to become like God - actualized humans.  \\"We are called not to become what we are not - divine - but to become what we are: human.\\"<br />This book is an authoritative commentary on the words, \\"son of man\\" and \\"the son of the man\\" an expression found throughout the Bible and an expression that Jesus used almost exclusively to describe himself.  The Hebrew phrase simply means \\"a human being.\\"  For Wink, Jesus came to teach us, to call us, to be truly human.  A task that Wink feels we have failed at miserably.<br />\\"We are only fragmentarily human, fleetingly human, brokenly human.  We see glimpses of our humanness  . .  but we have not yet arrived at true humanness.\\"  He goes on to say, \\"we are incapable of becoming human by ourselves.  We scarcely know what humanness is, but we know well what inhumanity is.\\"<br />I found the most interesting and engaging chapter 'Feuerbach's Challenge', where Wink agrees with Ludwig Feuerbach, the 19th Century German Philosopher, that God is the merely the projection of human values and human nature.  He turns this around to support his thesis that the projection of our best<br />qualities and powers into Godhead, the emptying of ourselves into<br />transcendence is what God wants.  \\"We are projections of God, functions of God, and that God is a function, a projection of us.  Consequently, our perceptions of God are projections, as Feuerbach thought.\\"<br />I was disappointed that Wink's focus is on us becoming `truly human', yet he only gives one and a half pages to discussing the definition of the `truly human'.  Scant space when you consider this is the core of his thesis.  Throughout the book he alludes to what being `truly human' means, but you must collect the fragments and paste together your own understanding.  He states, \\"The new human being has not yet emerged.  Evil is as powerful today as it was the day Jesus hung on the cross.\\"  Right, Professor, but what does the \\"new human being\\" look like, Jesus?  And if Jesus, then the human side, right?  Carl Jung's concept of `individuation' is referenced multiple times,<br />as is Maslow's concept of self actualization.  But you come away with nothing definitive.<br />This book is a demanding academic read that will escape most of the general populace.  It is recommended for ministers seeking a commentary on the words \\"son of man\\" and various passages throughout the Bible, as well as theologians and students of theology.  In  `The Human Being' Walter Wink has given us an exhaustive study on the words \\"son of man\\"; going beyond just the<br />Biblical and expanding the study into the use of the words in Pseudepigrapha, Apocrypha, Gnostic and Jewish mysticism and Apocrypha mystic writings.

Avant-garde theologian, reformative and unorthodox Christian, Sallie McFague, in 'Life Abundant', sets forth a radical, earthbound, theology that is as provocative as it is over sanguine.<br /><br />Her 'hope against hope' prophetic cry to all North Americans is to 'love and protect the world' and thus love God. Forsake your 'hell bent' consuming way and share the world's resources equally. Be liberated from your role as oppressors. While this message is needed and laudable, it will, sadly, go unheard and thus unheeded. For, as Seneca, the Roman philosopher said at the time of Christ, \\"It is the superfluous things for which men concern themselves\\".<br />Dr. McFague is an accomplished professor of Theology (Vanderbilt Divinity School) and, as such, she challenges you to reconsider your life philosophy, your spiritual theology and your consumer mentality. Dr. McFague wants you not to read her book as much as to engage, challenge and argue with her via the book. In the end, she hopes you will rethink and develop a 'working theology' that embraces and loves the world we live in.<br />While the title of the book is affable, and even quaint, this book is not. This is a dense and demanding read; however, a postulation worthy of every thinking person's effort. I am going to attempt the absurd. I am going to attempt to distill the erudite writings of Dr. McFague in three phrases. In \\"Life Abundant\\" Sallie McFague has an admonitory outcry for \\"middle class North American Christians\\". She calls them to 1) Change their manic consumer lives, and choose to live in harmony with, and care for, all creation. 2) Realize that Christians (as all people) live to give God glory by loving the world and everything in it. 3) Deconstruct their traditional theologies and then reconstruct them in concert with her \\"Panentheistic\\" theology.<br />Be forewarned, any attempt to fully grasp Sally McFague's in a coherent way will be akin to attempting to wrap your arms around a full grown Redwood tree. Her theology is \\"relatively absolute\\". She believes that all theologians speak of God metaphorically, and there is no such thing as a complete theology, rather there are only piecemeal theologies, and no creditable theologian makes empirical statements about who God is. Thus, the reading of her explanation of her belief system is akin to listening to Dennis Hopper disjointedly saying in 'Apocalypse Now' that he found \\"the one\\" (referring to Marlin Brando). Heavy man, heavy.<br />Her theology is Christian Panentheism - Pan'en'theism. God is immanent, incarnated in the world through nature. Thus she sees the world as 'in' ('en') God and that God is 'with' the world. God is with us here and now in all living beings. \\"The world\\", for Sallie \\"is where God dwells, it is God's 'house'\\". And, for her, the \\"divine incarnation\\" is not limited to Jesus, but God is incarnate in the world and each creature is \\"a microcosm of divine incarnation\\".<br />For McFague God is Reality. She states; \\"when we say that God is reality we mean that reality is both with us and beyond us, both eminent and transcendent, both physical and spiritual\\". God is \\"the source, the sustainer, and the goal of everything that is.\\"<br />Her theology is a 'working theology' and she believe that we must act - now and decisively. She condemns the consumptive, consumer life style of North Americans. Her evolved theology is no longer the self-centered tribal, traditional anthropocentric Christian theology of the masses (salvation for the individual), but is a cosmological theology that affirms that being with nature is being with God and salvation is when you are in God's presence (God is found in relationship with others and nature). For Sallie the deterioration of nature and the injustice to the poor people is caused by the religion of our time - consumerism.<br />I found that some of her provocative statements raise significant questions. For example, if God so loves the world and is continually engaged, or \\"radical present\\", with the world, then where is the evidence of His/Her/Its involvement? Nowhere does Dr. McFague explain where or how God is \\"radically present\\". Please, give me examples, Dr. McFague, of where and how God is involved with this world He/She/It loves.<br />She does not embrace the Christian belief in the popular image of God as a supernatural being and redeemer of human individuals. But rather for Dr. McFague God is - radically transcendent and radically immanent. Her Christology is unconventional and unorthodox. She discards the personally redemptive, sacrificial death of Christ - \\"Personally, I have never been able to believe it\\", and replaces it with an 'ecological economic Christology.'<br />Her chapters on economic models are great reads, but her statement that we, in North America, have \\"allowed our economic theories (i.e. market capitalism) to tell us who we are\\"- is disputable. Market capitalism did not make us consuming, self-gratifying individuals, but rather we adopted market capitalism because it is what best benefits who we are.<br />Also, she beats the drum of 'frugality', asking her readers to restrict significantly their materialistic intake (she admittedly acknowledges that this is not a beat that North Americans are likely to dance to). Thus, her Jeremiah prophetic call to a radical life change, thought desperately needed, will accomplish what it did with Israel - Nada.<br />Her end notes (30 pages) are a gold mine for all those interested in cross-references, excellent bibliographies, insights and side-bar comments.<br />In short, though complex, this is a stimulating and thought provoking read. Anyone who believes, as McFague does, that God loves and wants to save the earth, should read this book, agree with her theology, \\"we are to give God glory by loving the earth\\" and chorus \\"Amen, and Amen\\".

The artisans hammered out remarkable jewelry and artifacts for the various royal dynasties (Chavin, Nazca, Wari, Moche, Inca) as far back as the late second millennium B.C.<br />Silver to the Inka (supreme ruler) symbolized the moon, the female deity and source of life.  Gold symbolized the sun (male deity).  Silver and gold were equally valued by the Inca civilization and were only to be possessed by the Inka and his royal household.<br />Quantities of gold objects survived (with no help from the pillaging of the Spaniards from 1532 on), but lesser amounts of silver. The silver which has survived often suffered physicochemical changes. It also appears that silver was less frequently used by the artisans because it was more difficult to locate and process than the more readily available nuggets and flakes of gold.<br />That said, this book catalogues the New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art's November 2000-April 2001 exhibition of pre-Columbian Peruvian Silver.  The &quot;Rain of the Moon&quot; exhibition was made possible by generous loans of major pubic institutions and private collections.<br />The map and three essays that accompany the 64  photos (color/b&amp;w) are very informative.

My humanitarian medical trip this year to Rwanda mandated that I attempt to understand the insanity of the genocide that killed, in 100 days, over one million children, women and men only eight years ago.<br />My first read was the excellent, and highly recommended book: `We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families' by Philip Gourvitch (1998).  My second read was this book, also stellar.<br />This book is not just about Rwanda, it is about extremes; it is about Africa.  This is about unbelievable agony, suffering and human catastrophe.  `This is not a pretty' book.  Scott Peterson has done a outstanding job in duct-taping a handle on a tragedy that is uncircumscribible.  The degree of evil to be encountered in this book is extraordinary.  This is a book  about degenerate crimes against humanity and how people come to commit such atrocities.<br />Peterson divides the book into three parts: Somalia, Sudan and Rwanda; with Somalia get the lion's share.  Sudan comes next and finally, Rwanda (about 70 pages of the 320 paged book).<br />Peterson seeks \\"to illuminate human tragedy in a way that show how such tragedies may be easier to avoided in Africa, and beyond, in the future.\\"  Whether he accomplisha this is your judgement call.  As a cynic, I believe that what has been, will be again, and `history will repeat itself' sooner that we think or want.<br />He breaks down Rwanda's genocide into three primary axioms: 1) Hutu's hatred and fear of the Tutsi's, 2) Catholic Church's' silent support and active disengagement, and finally, 3) the French government's active support before and during the genocide.<br />However clean and persuasive these arguments are they fail to explain the social insanity and the demonic deprivation that took possession of the Hutu  population and drove them into a such an unholy orgy of defilement and slaughter.  I cannot fault Peterson for failing short of a succinct, logical, sane explanation of such insanity.  No one has, nor do I believe ever will, sufficiently explain the \\"Why\\" something this insane happens.<br />Notwithstanding, this is a solid, informative work worthy of any library concerned with such matters.

To travel to Africa without a guide, paper or flesh, is a bit looney.  But, this month, I found myself in Rwanda in said (and sad) condition. For the first few days I managed to blunder along, until I found and bought this great guide at a hotel side store (of course at a significant mark up).<br />For the next two weeks Briggs and Booth did a superb job of guiding me along the dirt roads and winding byways (This is the \\"Land of a thousand hills\\").  They always explained clearly the world where I wandered.  They consistently helped me uncover destination gems that I would have surely overlooked.<br />Most impressive were their cultural, economic and ecological commentaries. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to traveling with the Office of Tourism across this country while I was working on a medical project for the President's office.  I can say that the insights and comments of Briggs and Booth regarding Rwanda are extremely competent and on the mark.  Their insight alone makes this book a needed purchase for those that will visit or work in Rwanda.<br />The 1994 genocide is, of course, briefly covered and the history, heath, culture, people, planning and preparing sections are all informative and full of needed information.  Also, for an outstanding book on the 1994 genocide do read; 'We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families' by Philip Gourvitch.<br />I found Janice Booth's  caring and engaging story of her friendship over the years with Peter - a Rwandan Tutsi a wonderful and caring addition.  This story is found in the preface and concluded in the epilogue.<br />The only notable shortcomings are the maps.  In today's competitive world of travel guides, good maps are essential.  The maps are very basic on only fair.  That said this guide is a 'must have' for all who journey to this beautiful and bewildering destination. Highly Recommended. 4.5 stars.	2002-05-27

Very bizarre, for my Western mind to grasp, considering that just eight years ago 99.9% of those on the dance floor witnessed violence, 79.6% experienced death in their family and 57.7% watched the gore of killing or maiming with machetes.  Not to mention how many were victims themselves or how many were perpetrators.<br />In this outstanding book, Philip Gourvitch lays it all out, and it is brutal and gruesome.  His writing  is forceful and forthright.  He directly indites the U.S. and Europe, citing their deliberate indifference to the genocide.  He writes, \\"Rwanda had presented the world with the most unambiguous case of genocide since Hitler's war against the Jews, and the world sent blankets, beans and bandages ... hoping that everyone would behave nicely in the future.  Especially damning is France's complicity with the Hutus.<br />There are a few areas of shortcomings.  The lack of an index and noticeable is Philip Gourvitch remiss to lay any blame at the door step of any of the African nations for their disengagement.<br />Also, if  you selected  this book, hoping to have a rational and sane answer for how and why this insanity happened, how 1,000,000 people could be hacked to death by friends, family, teachers, physicians and coworkers in 100 days; you will come away empty handed.<br />But, this is not a shortcoming of  Philip Gourvitch book.  For there can never be adequate explanation for such demonic decimation.  The genocide of Rwanda, the base brutality, the inhumanity, the cries and pleading prayers of the victims and the vacuum of morality and compassion have made these actions uncircumscribible.<br />Finally, this book should be read in several sittings.  The despairing denseness of the inhumane acts are too heavy to be comprehended without breaks, ie \\"Hutus young and old rose to the task.  Neighbors hacked neighbors to death in their home and colleague hacked colleague to death in their work place.  Doctors killed their patients, and school teachers killed their pupils..

Hope - this book is about needed justice and the hope and healing it can bring.<br />My journey to Rwanda this year prompted me to delve into the  tyrannical torture and terror that swept this small, poor nation in 1994.<br />In 1994, over a period 100 days, over one million people were butchered. It is such a staggering number that it is hard to comprehend.  Just to write the first names of the murdered down would take you 2 ½ years, writing six names a minute for eight hours a day.<br />Although Elizabeth Neuffer's book is about the pursuit of justice and  the delivery of justice, it is also about the grim and gruesome reality of killers, rapists and victims.  Her clear, straight forward journalistic writing style is engaging.  Of the books I have read on Rwanda's genocide (I highly recommend both Scott Peterson's 'Me Against My Brother' and Philip Gourvitch's 'We wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families') Neuffer is the only one that covers rape.  She has dedicated chapters to the rape, and it need to be judged as a war crime. She exposes the effect that has on the victims.  Her sensitivity and willing to disclose this little discussed topic is needed, refreshing and laudable.  Kudos.<br />Rwanda now has 130,000 incarcerated, waiting for their genocide trials to begin.  But, justice is extremely slow in coming.  One case alone took 1.5 years.  In three years Rwanda's courts have handed down 2,500 vertics.  At that rate it will take the Rwandan courts 150 years to clear the dockets.  \\"Perhaps what you end up with in a post-genocide society is not justice at all\\"  Gerald Gahima, Rwanda's previous deputy minister of justice, stated.  \\"Maybe we should think of another word for it.\\"<br />In her book Bosnia get the lion share of her writing (400 plus pages) but her short sections dealing with Rwanda is alone worth the price of the purchase.  This is an outstanding book, worth of any library and to be read by anyone interested in these topics.  Highly Recommended.topics.    Highly Recommended.	2002-05-23

During the four months I was in Colombia I sought daily to understand the malaise and mayhem that have gripped this once promising South American nation. I would read of the killings, the kidnapping and the destruction caused by the FARC, the ELN, Death Squads, Police and Military and sadly shake my head in<br />dismay.<br />I personally saw how the rich and powerful remained unscathed. I watched the television news portray President Pastrana as impotent against the forces that the people of Colombia feared. I read in local papers how the military and death squad's killing sprees of unarmed civilians continued. And I walked among the masses of the poor and oppressed, talked with widows and orphans, and knew that they were, as always, the greatest losers in this unwinnable war.<br />It was during my last few weeks in Colombia that I picked up Bert Ruiz's \\"The Colombian Civil War.\\" This book has allowed me to better understand how such maledictions could befall a once promising nation.<br />Bert Ruiz has written a needed primer for those desiring to understand Colombia's raging war. His extensive research has untangled, as best as humanly possible, Colombia's convoluted problems.<br />Several of his chapters stand out as stellar. Especially noteworthy are his chapters, \\"The War on Drugs\\" and the<br />following chapter \\"Death Squads.\\" His writing is forthwith, very informative, well researched (with prolific end notes).<br />Ruiz lays down the historical foundation that is needed to understand how this democratic nation got into such a<br />mess. There is finger pointing galore and no one goes without criticism.<br />On the short shifted side, only a few pages talk about America's (or Europe's) massive need for illicit, illegal drugs which fosters the Colombian cartels, the cocaine labs, the death squads, etc. I was yearning to read more regarding the effect that the USA's drug addiction (America's 4.1 million heroin & cocaine addicts) has on sustaining Colombia's malaise.<br />I was distracted when Ruiz flipped back in Colombia's history after taking me through to the year 2000. When I finished Chapter eight, I was engrossed in Colombia's current conflict, ready to grapple with the immediate, when, \\"wack,\\" Ruiz starts his next chapter, \\"Northern Brothers,\\" in 1739. Go figure.<br />The same discontinuity happened with the needed story of Pablo Escobar. Ruiz did captured my attention about this powerful Medellin Narco boss, but left me hanging. Escobar escaped jail and does not show up until the next chapter, 25 pages later, where he meets his death. Choppy.<br />That said, this is a very good book, dealing with a very convoluted situation. Echoing the words of John Crabtree, a visiting fellow of Latin American Studies at London university, \\"Colombia's crisis is amazingly complicated and entrenched . . . and (Colombia) HAS NO OBVIOUS SOLUTION.\\" Ruiz is an engaging writer. In \\"The Colombian Civil War,\\" he has given us a primer to help us understand Colombia today. This book should be a required read for students of Colombia/South America, and/or for those interested in the drug trade/problem gripping the world today.

He has information on shipping motorcycles and automobiles to Columbia.  He has an excellent section on health, and his 'Background' section is succinct and informative (History, Culture Etc.).  He covers the normal tourist destinations and encourages exploration of places that 99% of visitors to Colombia would miss (Tayrona National Park, Ciudad Perdia, etc.).<br />His accommodations and dining recommendations are adequate, generally accurate, reliable but are becoming outdated.  Luckily, although this guide has been out for three years, the prices for lodging in Colombia have stayed relatively stable and accurate and eight out of the ten hotels I selected to visit in Bogota were still open.<br />AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT: A serious omission for this 2000 guide is the absence of hotel web pages and hotel email addresses.  Electronic addresses have become a &quot;must have&quot; for any competitive guide book.  A good hotel web page allows you to view the property, get current rates (and specials), view the<br />property and rooms and make an on-line reservations.  This is a must for the next edition.<br />Good maps are essential in a guide.  Bogota, Cartagena, Barranquilla, Cali and Medellin are sprawling cities that desperately need good maps. Bogota has four  maps, but they are upside down!  Normally maps are oriented with North at the top of the page, not so here, North is at the bottom and South at the top. I had a hell-of-a-time orienting myself, until I got my compass out and discovered this wacko lay out.<br />Also confusing are  references to map numbers that don't exist. Pollard mentions a number, IE in the Bogota section, 'Hacienda Santa Barbra #3 on the map', but the publisher did not print the numbers on the map.  His recommended sleeping locations are noted on the maps, but not restaurants. Needless to say, this is an important area that needs significant improvement.<br />The above shortcomings notwithstanding, you will not want to go to Colombia without this guide.  I strongly Recommend it.ing locations are noted on the maps, but not restaurants.

Yea, for God the Giver! Sign me up! I want more and more and more. Give me, give me, give me.<br /><br />I've got the key now! Bruce Wilkinson preaches that God's existence, God's very reason for being, is to bless you - \\"a lot\\".<br /><br />In this book, Wilkinson asks the reader the rhetorical question, \\"Is it possible that God wants you to be 'selfish', bold face me-centered selfish', in your prayers?\\" (YES!), \\"To Ask for more - and more again?\\" (YES! YES!).<br /><br />So what is stopping God from giving, giving, giving? Well, it must be me! I am not asking, begging, pleading, cajoling the right way. Wilkinson sets me straight when he writes, \\"God's bounty is limited only by us, not by His resources, power or willingness to give.\\" Oh, Bruce tell me, tell me what I must do.<br /><br />In \\"The Prayer of Jabez\\", I get the mantra, the right words to unlock God's blessings for ME! All I have to do is \\"Pray Jabez's prayer word for word\\", everyday. That is what Bruce did for thirty years, and look at him now, author of a run away best seller!<br /><br />I have been redeemed! Bruce has set me straight. All this time I had God figured wrong. My theology was [messed]-up. Even my worship was wrong. Now, thanks to Bruce, I know that \\"seeking God's blessing is what I must be about.  God exist to give me things and that is the ultimate act of worship.  How I hold my head in despair realizing how many wasted year I lost by praying for other people, when I could have been rich!  Bruce told me I should have been praying for God to \\"increase the value of my investment portfolios.\\" Drat!<br /><br />But Christians, here's both the deal and ideal. When we skip forward in the Bible and find the prayers of Jesus, then we are getting somewhere, we are finding the harsh reality that was often found in Jesus's prayed.  He was not imaging up new Mercedes Benz 350, no, before his decisive moments, before the transforming experiences of his baptism, his trial, betrayal, his  death; he look into the depth of his own human weakness and fear of death, and he cry out for God not to bless him, but to be with him.  Tip:  He did not pray \\"The Prayer of Jabez\\"  BIG important  theological point.<br /><br />Come on Christians, get your heads out of your pocket books. Move out of the prayer of Jabez and into the prayers of the one you call Lord and Savior. Hey, here's another idea, try saying one of Jesus' prayers each day for 30 years.

Highly recommended	This is a brilliant book with hundreds of color photos (full page and double page).  The reproductions are excellent.  The text that accompanies the prints is straight-forward, simple, easy to read and succinct.<br />To cover the scope of the history of Colombia's art (over 400 years) is a formidable and a very applaudable accomplishment. But, Benjamin Villegas, did not stop here.  He pushed the scope of art history beyond the colonial and post-colonial period and included the tribal periods prior to the Spaniards! Bravo.<br />This 400 page coffee-table book comprehends the substance of Colombian Art.  \\"Colombian Art\\" is organized into four sections: Pre-Colonial, Colonial, 19th Century and 20th Century Art.  The gold and ceramic art of eleven pre-conquistador human groups; the religious art of colonial Colombia, painters of independence, travel painting, landscape painting (19th Century), expressionist art, political art, surrealist art and the emergences of abstract art, are all well documented.<br />There is an introduction to the works of Masters such as: Franciso Cano, Debora Perez, Serio Trujillo M., Gonzolo Ariza, Jose Rodriqiz A., Luis Caballero, Alejandro Oberegon, Enrique Grau  and, of course, Fernando Botero (an entire chapter).  I was awed at the scope and quality of art that Colombia has, and continues to produce.<br />I read and reviewed \\"Colombian Art\\" while spending a few months in Colombia.  While I was there I had the opportunity to visit many museums and art galleries, and \\"Colombian Art\\" helped me appreciate even more, the richness of the art and profundity of the artist.  This is a stellar book, worthy of purchase by any art connoisseur, Colombian aficionado or student of the indigenous tribes of pre-Colombia.  Highly recommended	2002-03-25

In 2002 I spent a month exploring Colombia (although the terrorists-FARC problem seriously restricted my movement).  \\"Panoramic Colombia\\" helped me to remember, vividly, what I had seen and get a  glimpse the many parts of Colombia I needed to return to see.<br />Using a roundshot, 360 degree camera, Villegas  has done a great job of showcasing the cities and natural wonders of Colombia.  Each color photograph captures mountains, jungles, coastal areas, rainforests, moorlands, towns and vibrant cities.  Each geographical region is delineated by a map (a nice touch).  The reproduction of color is a notch below excellent.  Most of the two page panoramic photos are 30 inches long, however, there are twenty photos that fold out into three pages, over 45 inches long!<br />\\"Panoramic Colombia\\" is an excellent introduction to Colombia.

Fernando Botero (1932) is Colombia's greatest, internationally acclaimed artist. He was born in Medellin in 1932, lost his Father in 1934 and was raised by a devoted, loving Mother.  Parenthetically, he said of his Mother, &quot;Her never failing words of encouragement helped me become an artist.  Every one of my drawings was to her a thing of beauty.&quot;<br />As the title states, this book presents only Botero's contemporary canvas works (1987 to present) and omits his sculptures. Botero has matched and grouped his work in eight sections.  The full page color plates are good in quality, though not excellent.  Botero's love of color and voluminous forms bring a surrealistic energy to his people, endowing them with a sensual persona.  Noteworthy is that almost all of Botero's works shun shadows. He feels that &quot;shadow is the enemy of color&quot;.<br />The first fifty seven pages is the transcript of an informative and insightful  interview of Botero by Ann Maria Escallon (director of the Art Museum of Americas, Washington, D.C.).  This section is a 'must read' for any student or afficionado of Botero.<br />This is a worthwhile addition to any art library.  Though the reproductions could have been more vivid and sharper, this book is a wonderful expose of Botero's recent canvas works. Recommended	2002-03-25

Owen West's story of the hellacious problems that US military men encounter doesn't quite reach the bar that Mark Bowden set.<br />West builds the central charter of Lieutenant Galvin Kelly by flipping back and forth from Somalia to Lt. Kelly's childhood in the USA.  One chapter you are with the LT. in Somalia looking into the faces of the suffering and famished.  Then next chapter you are reliving Galvin Kelly's childhood, adolescence or college years; back and forth.  This ocellation causes the focus and momentum of the story line to crippled.  Thus, the first hundred pages of \\"Sharkman Six\\" F.T.E. (fail to engage) me.<br />However, about 100 pages into the book the pace picks up, the story stays in Mogadishu and the action engages both the enemy and my attention.  Leadership demands decisions; decisions that will cause the Lieutenant and the reader to struggle with dilemmas and moral issues.  Complex compromises will be made and great warriors will sacrifice their military career and lives.  The climax and battle scene is absorbing and intense. Strongly recommended.	2002-01-31

With these you can visit the hotel site and see the accommodations and rate prior to making reservations. Fodor's has a very good section at the back of the guide that lists recommended books to read and music to listen to \\"before you go.\\"  And, unlike Frommer's, Fodor's has a great list of videos (films set in N.O.) to watch.<br />However there are two significant areas in this guide that could use improvement:  maps and hotels/restaurants.<br />Regarding the maps: the guide needs more, better maps; maps that use color.<br />The biggest criticism is regarding the hotel/restaurants recommendations. For some reason the Fodor's does not differentiate quality via symbols for either restaurants or hotels.  The only rating system that they use is the \\"Fodor's Choice\\"; a single star next to the listing.  Thus, the elegant Ritz Carlton and utilitarian Quality Inn, which are both listed in the guide, have no symbolic differentiation - except their $$$$$ cost.  The same is true regarding the restaurants.<br />The recommended accommodations and dining recommendations are, for the most part, generally accurate and up to date.  However, my experience at listed and recommended, Sheraton Hotel was woefully inadequate.  This hotel does not warrant the listing that Fodor's gave it.  It especially does not merit their comment, \\"expect top quality service.\\"  NOT.<br />At the Sheraton New Orleans Hotel, I had prepaid reservations for a nonsmoking room that WAS NOT honored.  I was given a handicap with a shower where the water fluctuated between scalding hot and cold.  The bath towels were both dingy and cheap and the front desk employees were indifferent and callous.  Then, upon check out, I found a surprising $13 \\"per day\\" charge for the fitness club that I used once.  The Fodor's guide highlights the hotel fitness club, but has no mention of the surcharge.

Frommer New Orleans 2002 will guide to and through New Orleans.  It will open up the city for you like a jazz player opening his trumpet case.<br />New Orleans is Mardi Gras (fittingly the entomology of `Mardi Gras' goes back to a  Roman orgy).  This annual event  defines New Orleans for the million plus tourist that come to be part of this \\"party to end all parties\\".  There is music, lots of jazz music, parades, salacious acts, alcohol, food and sex that incarnate this granddaddy of public parties.  But, as hundreds of thousands of other visitors to New Orleans can tell you, all of these traits can be easily be found throughout the year in this emancipated city.  Be assured that Frommer's guide will open this city up for you, anytime of the year.<br />The guide's accommodations and dining recommendations are up to date, plentiful, generally accurate and reliable.  However, my experience at the Pelham Hotel did not warrant the \\"highly rated\\" star that Frommer's gave it.  The carpets in the room were stained and needed cleaning, there was an noticeable odor in the hall and room, the front desk staff was apathetic and some of the normal amenities that hotels in this price range offer (in room coffee, etc) were not provided. Frommer's  needs to rethink its rating on this property.<br />Frommer's star rating system is difficult to locate.  It is buried away from the recommendations in the first portion of the book. When I did find the ratings they were somewhat difficult to understand and confusing.  There are zero to three stars but moderate or inexpensive restaurants and hotels can only get zero, one or two, but NOT three.  The very expensive to expensive restaurants and hotels can be awarded  one, two or three stars, but NOT zero.  So an expensive property CAN'T get a zero (but in my last experience, the Sheraton New Orleans needs a -0) and a moderate restaurant CAN'T get a three star rating (\\"exceptional\\").  Frommer's must feel that if a property has a lot of  money invested they could not totally disappoint and if a proprietor did not invest big bucks, well they could ever reach exceptional.  Wrong. This is the weakest area of this book and definitely needs improvement.<br />Maps are essential in a guide, and for this Mississippi twisting city good maps are a must. Frommer's has excelled in this area and has included a free color fold out map in the back of the book. Kudos!<br />A wonderfully strong aspect of this guide, that can be very beneficial to your trip planning,  are the Internet web site addresses provided with almost every hotel.  You now can visit the hotel site and see the in room accommodation, check out the specials and rates prior to making your reservations.<br />The guide also has a very good shopping section, and many of the listed stores also have web site addresses.  Also there is a very solid section on recommend books and recordings (though it sorely lacks any mention of videos - films set in N.O.). Finally, for those with more than three days Frommer's's provides a good selections of trips outside of New Orleans.<br />As Frommer's says \\"the best way to get inside New Orleans is to plunge right in.  Don't just go for the obvious This city has so much more to offer.\\"  And so does this guide.

A wonderful, inspiring read. Highly Recommended.<br />Edwina Gateley has the unique ability to hear, in her silence, the resonance of God.  She hears the same way that Stradivarius, knew perfection when he heard it.  In this book of poetry, she sings her ballad  \\"Growing into God\\" in such a melodic way that you will nod, affirmatively, with her canter.  By the end of the book she brings the presence of God almost within touch.<br />What makes her poetry both timeless and infinite is her lonely, brave, sojourn - a lifetime of seeking. Her spiritual pilgrimage took her to places and spaces that few have known.  She says, \\"My journey with God was full of ups and downs, a roller coaster, touching heights of love and joy, and depths of despair and anger.\\"  She goes on to say, \\"Betrayal, insecurity and loss are all part of the deepening process of faith by which we come.\\"<br />I needed, and used, \\"Growing into God\\" while  I was on a self-imposed exile from first world modernity and if possible, myself.  For six weeks I retreated to the high Peruvian Andes.  Often the experiences she told of in \\"Growing in God\\" mirrored my own.  I found warmth and reassurance in Edwina Gateley's insights and her tapestry of words.  Poems such as: Silence, Faith, Fall, Listen, Vision, Stirring, Sitting, Spaces, Farewell, Journey, Reunion and Deeply Grateful affirmed that I am not alone.  My favorite, if it is possible to have just one, is her classic poem, \\"Loss.\\"  I will quote a part of it.<br />Loss<br /> \\"I do not know you, God.<br />  I thought I did -<br />  your attitudes were listed long<br />  in my Divine inventory....<br />  One day<br />  a grayness fell upon my world,<br />  like a shroud,<br />  choking my hymns and prayers.<br />  Thought I called on you,<br />  there was no answer,<br />  no cloud by day nor fire by night,<br />  only a terrible silence<br />  screaming your absence -<br />  leaving me,<br />  not knowing,<br />  my deep, deep faith<br />  disintegrating<br />  floating away like ashes<br />  on a night breeze,<br />  dissipating in the darkness,<br />  leaving me all hollowed out.\\"<br />\\"Growing in God\\" is for all of those believers who no longer feel close to the God they once danced with.  \\"Growing in God\\" is for those, who in younger years, were confident in their faith; who would, without hesitation, sonorously tell other, invited or not, how they too could believe. Now, years later, their faith is only whispered and their  words couched in relativity.<br />\\"Growing in God\\" is for all those who, like Edwina Gateley, dare to believe that God is still there, seeking to reconnect and renew.<br />\\"My dance was lost<br />to pilgrimage.<br />But your dance<br />never ceased, God.<br />Still you circled waiting -<br />to play and whisper<br />once again.\\"<br />Highly Recommendedith <BR>  disintegrating <BR>  floating away like ashes <BR>  on a night breeze, <BR>  dissipating in the darkness, <BR>  leaving me all hollowed out.\\" <br />\\"Growing in God\\" is for all of those believers who no longer feel close to the God they once danced with.  \\"Growing in God\\" is for those, who in younger years, were confident in their faith; who would, without hesitation, sonorously tell other, invited or not, how they too could believe.

This is a difficult book to read.<br />It is a difficult read, not because of the historical writing of Peter Ruhe, who has done a commendable job, nor because of the photo editing by Sophie Spencer-Wood, a top rate job indeed; but because the publisher, Phaidon Press, choose to print the text using a very small type with a recessive color using glossy paper.  Sad, especially when you open to the text section and see there are 2 ½&quot; top, 2 ½\\" left and  1 ½\\"  bottom  margins.  Go figure.  To make the matter worse under each photo caption, the publisher uses an even smaller type and in a tan color.<br />Phaidon Press failed to consider that the audience most likely to buy to this book, will be, by majority, mid-aged or older.  Thus, they, like me, probably will need reading glasses.  However, even with good reading glasses, the smallness of type, the faded black ink (on the verge of gray) and the glaring glossy paper made reading this book very strenuous and difficult.<br />That said, I found Peter Ruhe's writing balanced and refreshing.  He chronologically lays out Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's life in an engaging, investigative manner.  Ruhe is an admirer of Mahatma but not enamored enough to be a blind devote.  He points out the times that Gandhi's belief in satyagraha (truth-force) blinded him.  One such time, related to the evil of Nazi Germany, \\"Gandhi insisted that Hitler was merely misguided.  In his mind the German leader could be dissuaded from further conquest by the power of reason or, if necessary, satyagraha\\".  Though Gandhi had achieved mystical status, to Ruhe he was still a man, although, one of the world's greatest.<br />The 400 Black and White photos curated by Sophie Spencer-Wood are excellent They illustrate the time line of this great man's life.  The reproduction of the photos is top rate, and this alone makes the book a worthy addition to any Mahatma Gandhi collection.  Gandhi's body was cremated, January 31. 1948.  The words of Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister, eulogize Gandhi even today, \\"the light has gone out of our lives, and there is darkness everywhere, our beloved leader... the father of the Nation is no more.\\"  Recommendedhe words of Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister, eulogize Gandhi even today, \\"the light has gone out of our lives, and there is darkness everywhere, our beloved leader... the father of the Nation is no more.\\"  Recommended	2001-12-18

I read this book while spending a month in a small Peruvian village in the Andes.  A village that is far from the tourist path of Machu Pichu.  A village that would mirror the mountain community of Killac, the setting for this engaging classic.  Killac, is a village that depicts the neglect, backwardness and feudalism that existed in Peru at the turn of the twentieth century, and to some extent still exists today.<br />\\"Torn from the Nest\\" is a brilliant story of love, power, courage, oppression, virtue, incest and deceit written in 1889, and was selected as one of the first volumes in the Library of Latin America, Oxford.<br />The \\"Library of Latin America\\" series makes available, in English, major nineteenth century authors whose work has been neglected in the English speaking world.  To be selected as one of the first works by this editorial committee was no small feat, especially when you consider the plethora of writing against which this title competed.<br />Clorinda Matto de Turner dared to change the demented orthodoxy of the Roman Catholic Church and the oppression of the indigenous Indians by the immoral wealthy gentry, including the village priest.  Her anti-clerical tone was unmistakable; so much so, that the Catholic Church in Peru immediately condemned the book and considered it heretical and blatantly irreverent (that was enough to get me to read this book).  This condemnation set in motion the persecution of Clorinda Matto de Turner.  In the months and years to follow, because of her social, political and religious writings, she was suppressed, oppressed and finally driven from her county.<br /> Though a century has passed, the Indians of Peru are still a oppressed people, held back by lack of education, oppression of culture and language and economic exploitation.  This year, for the first time in Peruvian democratic history, a candiate from Inca descent has been elected president of Peru.  For those interested in the .

The ancient city of Machu Picchu is to Peru what the pyramids are to Egypt. Each year hundreds of thousands of tourists visit this archaeological site.<br />Though juvenile literature, this short book holds interest even for adults. After Philip Steele discusses the archaeological discovery of Machu Picchu by Hiram Bingham in 1911, he goes on to talk about the life the Incas must have led, using Machu Picchu as the example to illustrate what the Inca civilization was like. He starts off with the strict social classes that the Inca society had: the rulers, government, priests, religion, warriors and the farmer, the commoner and everyday life.<br />The Inca civilization (1200 - 1532 ) had phenomenal architects, builders and engineers. Even today, their stone work is unsurpassed in history. Steele, also covers, ever so briefly, the unique and advanced skills that the Incas had as craftsman, especially in pottery and jewelry. However, he elevates the society more than is justified. He makes statements like &quot;the Incas were skilled doctors and surgeons&quot; when actually they were homoeopathists that used natural plants as remedies. Regarding surgery, they sought to relieve pain in the head by tapping holes in the skull. Even though he points out that the Incas did not use money, only a barter system; he fails to point out that the Incas also did not write, read or use the wheel. And though he mentions their religious beliefs (pantheistic), he did not point out that while worshiping their Sun God, they did regularly sacrifice humans as part of the ceremony.<br />In &quot;The Incas and Machu Picchu&quot; Philip Steele has given children and adolescents an excellent primer to both the Inca civilization and this remarkable site. His writing is both entertaining and educational. The many color and b&amp;w photographs are excellent, and with each picture, an informative caption makes this book and excellent tool.	2001-12-18

What do you get when you mix a Brit with a Texas Oilman, a London Society female missionary and an Oxfordian highbrow who specializes in whining and negative thinking. Place them in the 1930s, shake well in a stolen aircraft, fly them to an unknown part of the world somewhere in the Himalayan/Tibetian and run them out of fuel.<br />What you get is a bloody good adventure that is written a bit like a Kipling tale.  The story begins in India and takes you to Shangri-La, located in the valley of the `Blue Moon', a place of moderate perfection.  For in Shangri-La the cardinal rule is &quot;moderation&quot;- the key to extended life.  In this microcosm of moderate perfection you will find a world where aging is retarded significantly and life exists to appreciate the aesthetic.<br />Though the book was published in 1931, the &quot;First Paperback Ever Published,&quot; it has an ageless `Celestine Prophecy' style.  Of course it was not the first `Spiritual Adventure' story written but it was the first to incorporate first world technology (aviation) with spiritual wisdom.  Not a romping, gut tingling, adventure tale, it does drag at times, but the ending has a nice twist and there are some adages that bring the read to a pensive pause.  &quot;People make mistakes in life by<br />believing too much, but they have a damned dull time if they believe too little.&quot; Recommended	2001-12-09

Any one of these cities are key targets for a bio-terrorist attack. \\"Germs\\" is a solid SHOULD READ for those that are concerned and skeptical about the U.S. Government's ability to protect it's citizens. This should be even more evident after the anthrax attacks on America. And a \\"YOU'VE GOTTA READ THIS\\" for everyone else. <br />What is so amazing about this book is, by the time you are a third through it you are amazed that we are not all dead. As the book clearly points out, IT IS NOT because of the competence of our FBI, CIA, CDC or other government agencies. The authors clearly point out how time after time our government intelligence and health agencies rise to each occasion and fly the flag of ineptitude; and now we sadly realize this (sic. September 11th ). <br />\\"Germs\\" convincingly underscores the fact that our government cannot protect us from the impending disaster that will, according to top authorities, come to America in cataclysmic proportion. The best our government can do is respond to the attack and attempt to save as many lives as possible. <br />The authors begin and end the book illustrating that biological weapons are, in contrast to other weapons of mass destruction, comparatively easy to produce. Nuclear weapons are expensive, extremely difficult to build and relatively easy to detect. Biological weapons are none of the above. Germs should convince you that the next war will be fought in the heartland of America and will be carried out by either rogue states, terrorist groups or lone actors. \\"Individuals can make war with these new weapons\\", Joshua Lederberg, biologist and Nobel Laureate, warned President Clinton in 1998. After which Clinton told the New York Times that neither nuclear nor chemical weapons are as frightening as what he has learned about germ warfare. <br />Miller, Engelberg and Broad have done a great service by giving all Americans a wake-up call. An alarm that goes beyond the cold war nuclear scare of the 60's because there are no germ shelters that can be built and used effectively. When the biological attack begins you will not know it, it will only be days after the attack that symptoms occur, then donning of a bio-suit is too late. <br />To say this is a disturbing book is an understatement. The report that Russia has developed lethal, futuristic germs, including a super-anthrax; \\"germs meant to seize control of the human metabolism, causing a body to self-destruct,\\" is more than unnerving. Today, in our world, biotechnology is coupling with virology and in the words of the authors new kinds of \\"designer pathogens that can defeat drugs, antidotes and vaccines\\" are being produced. The final sentence in the book is worth repeating. \\"We remain woefully unprepared for a calamity that would be unlike any this country has ever experienced.\\" Apocalyptic.

About 24 pages into the book, as Jay showers accolades on his father's and mother's ministry (PTL and Heritage Village), I came to the conclusion, &quot;He just doesn't get it, even now&quot;.<br />Jay was born into religion.  Knowing what we do now, most people would really have a difficult time associating the work and message of Jay's parents as true Christianity. Thus, Jaye was born in to a theology that glorified and promoted the antithesis of what Jesus Christ taught.  The Bakkers were one of  the, most powerful forces in the world of tele-evangelism.  They promoted a gospel of wealth and prosperity.  They took &quot;mammon&quot; one step beyond its definition as `worldly wealth', when they added glitz, glitter, glamor, and the gaudiness of show business to the definition.  Under the guise of Christianity they called their supporters to a &quot;name it and claim it&quot; theology and taught that God wants you to have more, and more and more.<br />Sadly, years later, Jay Bakker still doesn't get it.  He writes that his father's teaching and theology influenced his followers to send money to help build the multi, multi-million dollar Heritage USA and the water park.  And Jay goes on to say that others ministers, like the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart, hated him for that water park.  &quot;I'm not sure why&quot;, says Jay.  Duh.<br />He describes his father's sexual liaison with Jessica Hahn, for which PTL payed $265,000 in hush money, &quot;a fifteen-minute affair&quot;.  What Jay fails to understand was that his father's affair was  the result of unfaithfulness that Jim Bakker had been committing for years; an unfaithfulness over the years to the real teachings of Christ. Jessica Hahn was just what finally came to forefront.<br />Read on and it gets worse. &quot;My dad constantly went out of his way to reach out to the poor, the hurting and the needy.&quot;  Jay writes.  &quot;He had built his whole life on that&quot;.  Woe, Jay, we are not talking Mother Teresa here.  Boy, you gotta wake up.  Wait, maybe the indictment and conviction of your father on 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy hold some weight with you, right Jay?  Nope.  According to Jay, &quot;the charges boiled down to a case of overbooking...at Heritage USA.&quot;  Man, this child is thick headed.  FYI - His father was sentenced to forty-five years.<br />The remainder of the book deals with Jay's dive into alcoholism and drug abuse and his surfacing, after a lot of  bobbing up and down, into ministry.  The upside of this book is that Jay Bakker is now working as minister.  A steet minister, covered with tatoos, that cares for people where they are and accepts them for who they are.  The downside is that even though Jay now preaches a message of love and redemption, he never comes to grip with what went wrong with his father's and mother's ministry and why.  Sad, because Jim and Tammy's story has a redeeming message for those that want to take a hard look at it.

It is difficult to be critical of an author whose intent is to say something good and uplifting to the reader, ie. &quot;Flowers are the plant kingdom smiling at us&quot;.  So I will  say that this book was, at best,  'somewhat interesting', but grossly lacked inspiration. I tend to cringe, but Sermons from Compost Pile did have a few salient points, but as a whole was pedantic and as dry as a catus garden.  OK, now I feel like a slug, but this is said in fairness to those of  you who are considering a purchase.<br />Edward Sylvia's &quot;Seven Steps&quot; were trite adages that failed to engage me.  For example , the first three were: as a garden needs light, so we need UNDERSTANDING; as a garden needs water, so we need TRUTH; as a garden needs soil, so we need CHARACTER.

A great guide will have city maps that note the location of restaurants and accommodations.<br />If it were not for Wayne Curtis' &quot;spot on&quot; recommendations I would give this guide a &quot;not Recommenced&quot;.  But if you choose to purchase it, you will need to supplement it with another quality guide like , Moon's \\"Atlantic Canada Handbook&quot;, then Curtis' recommendations can help.

After the September 11th attacks on America, humor and laughter is both most needed and welcome, especially when traveling.  To complain about your bum travel experiences is both expected and natural.  To laugh at the your daunting faux pas is even chic; and, to get others to laugh at your inconveniences,  discomfort and even down right dangerous experiences are cathartic.  This book will not disappoint those who need a good laugh.<br />This is a collection of humorous stories for those who have been there, done that and deserve a `hell of a` of a lot more than a T-shirt.  If you ever have been on a third world bus then Doug Lansky's piece is a must read. For you that have eaten everything that walks or crawls, Richard Sterling goes one further.  And for you `Dave Berry' afficionados his &quot;Failing to Learn Japanese&quot; is a delight.  Oh, yea, Bill Bryson's &quot;Stroll Through Paris&quot; is truely hilarious.<br />Like a third world road these twenty eight stories are not all level reading, there is the occasional rough and uneven story, but the majority are engaging and giddy.  You will find this book a great read on the road.  Recommended	2001-10-22

This Moon Travel Handbook has a solid introduction section that covers the region's land, ecology, history, government, economy, climate etc.<br />Each Province is covered succinctly and Mark Morris' information and recommendations are helpful, but his restaurant comments could be more critically informative, ie. &quot;the food is well prepared&quot; (what the heck does that tell me?) or &quot;the seating is smoothingly refined&quot; (huh?). Also, because the publication date is 1999 (thus the information is pre '99) I found some restaurants and inns closed or sold. As a whole, accommodations prices have increased an average of 15% to 20%.<br />Maps are an essential and critically important aspect of any guide.  The maps in this guide are easy to read but lack the user friendly aspect of locating the recommended restaurants and accommodations on the maps.<br />A area that has become as essential as address and phone numbers is email/web site addresses. A time and significant cost saver especially for up-to-date information and accommodation quotes and reservations.  I am sure this will be addressed when the next edition comes out.<br />Though slightly flawed due to the date, lack of user friendly maps and absence of Internet information, this guide is still my first choice for Maritime Canada, Newfoundland and Labrador.

Is this the best guide for Norway? Almost (see my Lonely Planet: Norway review).  The information that Lee gives you regarding the &quot;Basics&quot; (flights, travel companies, visas, etc.) is the best out in a guide.  The maps (a critical element in any guide) are adequate, but not great.  Also, the maps only show the locations of the noted hotels, but omit locating restaurants. Go figure.<br />An ongoing peeve that I have about Rough Guides is their use of a number system to quote the price range of a hotel, ie. a Hotel costs a '2', then you have to flip back to the numeric legion to find out that 2 = 500-700kr, which you then divide by the current rate of exchange.  As other guides demonstrate,  there are betters ways to help your reader gage approximate cost.<br />I am disappointed that the 'boxed' vignettes that usually embellish other Rough Guides are few and far between in this guide. Finally, this  guide omits an accommodations or a  restaurants index. Thus, if you have a recommended restaurant you want to look up you have to go through all the restaurant pages 'til you stumble across the name you seek or miss seeing it completely.<br />The profile of Oslo is the best out, and if you are only going to Oslo, then \\"Norway: The Rough Guide\\" is the preferable guide.  Phil Lee has included an excellent section on recommended books to read and a good piece on Norwegian Literature.  Though not complete there is a scattering of website and email addresses for travel companies and some hotels, Although all hotels have their phone and fax numbers listed, nothing beats email.<br />If you are going to explore this wonderful country then &quot;Norway: The Rough Guide' will be a welcome companion.

Cathedrals are monoliths of faith gone by; sacred geometries that tower above cities and towns throughout Europe.  Cathedrals are now major attractions for tourist groups, projects for endless restorations and museums of meditation.<br />In \\"Heaven In Stone and Glass\\", Father Robert Barron (a Catholic priest and professor of theology) has brought together a readable devotional, that combines a heavy dose of fundamental  theology with a brief pragmatic explanation of how and why the Great Cathedrals were built as they were.<br />But be apprized that this text is really a devotional that uses cathedrals as the illustration for Father Barron's homilies. Robert Barron spent years in France and uses the Cathedrals of Notre-Dame and Chartres as his architectural examples, but these cathedrals are applicable to the propensity of cathedrals throughout the world  Some readers may quail at the conservative theology that Robert Barron promotes.  He states that we must come to grips with the fact that we are sinners &quot;disoriented, lost, desperately in need of a guide&quot;.  And that the church is the ark of our salivation &quot;as long as we sinners stay in the confines of the church, we will make our way to the light.&quot;  However, if this is not your spiritual belief, don't take flight, for Robert Barron's writing is as engaging as it is opinionated.<br />I read this while visiting the great Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim, Norway, and I highly recommend that you read it while visiting a Cathedral. This book can add meaning to your next cathedral experience while providing a strong devotional base. It is evident that cathedrals hold stories of salvation to those who can read them as a metaphor.  They are &quot;symbolic manifestations of a spiritual universe that cannot be seen&quot; and much more than stone and glass.  Robert Barron has written an engaging devotional and useful guide.

Now, made available in English for the first time, this is a gripping story of Russian navigator Valerian Albanov. A man among men who establishes, or at least reinforces, the definition for the words: courageous, tenacious and dedicated.<br />Albanov's story does not read like the personal diary that it is; rather `Land of White Death' is the gripping compelling writing of a journey through a world that so foreign and hostile that it vaporizes hope of the most valiant men replacing hope with the despairing darkness of the frigid arctic nights.<br />He and a group of ill prepared and poorly equipped men left the warmth and perceived safety of their stranded ship to journey without a map into the frozen arctic.

The superb information and recommendations are reliable and though the publication date is 1999 (thus the information is pre '99). Norway is a stable nation with very low inflation and the prices are close to the quotes.<br />&quot;Lonely Planet Norway&quot; has a solid introduction section that covers Norway's history, government, economy, ecology, climate etc. This guide has an informative, practical, travel section and, most important, a reliable and up to date listing of recommendations that Swaney has checked out (lodging, restaurants, entertainment, places to see and things to do). At the start of each section is a regional map, more maps, and a list of highlights or &quot;must see&quot; for that region. Great!<br />Deanna must not be a motorcycle afficionado for there is no mention in her book of motorcycle rental in Norway. I rented a Harley in Trondheim for a week of travel through the Western Fjords, Central Norway and the Trondelag region. Brilliant way to see this glorious country, but, beware the weather is more temperamental than a manic Chihuahua. It can and will go from warm to cold to wet back to sun in the space and distance of one hours travel. My motorcycle rental did include the all-purpose riding gear, I brought my own helmet.<br />A weak area is the intermittent use of email/web site addresses. These are very helpful, especially for hotel quotes and reservations. I am sure this will be addressed when the next edition comes out.<br />This is the best guide out on Norway, my second choice is Norway: The Rough Guide (see my review).

How she went from being a &quot;helpless, isolated woman in a completely foreign land&quot; to a place of semi-belonging.  She dutifully followed her husband to Norway.  He was a specialist on the Heidrun oil project.  This book is the story of Mrs. Morgan's --&quot;survival&quot;.<br />Up-front, I read this book while in Norway and found myself an outsider looking in on a struggle I couldn't comprehend.  For the life of me, hard as I tried, I could not grasp the horrific dark foreboding that Mrs. Morgan said she had to faced in Norway.  God knows I've tried to understand how she struggled to &quot;survive&quot; another year, but I was definitely an outsider looking in.  Hell, I was more than an outsider, I was  more like an alien visiting another planet.<br />I have traveled the world, and spent time in some mighty dark and depressing places.  That being said I  have great difficulty seeing Norway as a &quot;completely foreign land&quot;.  Communist Vietnam - sure.  War torn Congo - yes.  Oppressive Afghanistan - Right. But Norway, where English is their second language; where the infrastructures and national income are the best in the world; where the only hardship was the excessive taxes and that  they only served real beer, not 'lite beer', and I gained a few pound while staying there.  No, I just can't see Norway as a &quot;completely foreign country&quot;, any more than I could identify with her helpless, \\"isolated\\" whine.<br />I'll admit, I must be an insensitive male (ask my girlfriend, she'll tell you), and by popular definition, I am definitely from Mars.

Though it is baffling why such a gifted photographer has chosen stars, scoundrels, sensationalism and sex as his portfolio's  focus, he is nonetheless a brilliant craftsman.  Vadukul is now a New York fixture in the world of high fashion and glamor.  His name was made capturing the `Avant-garde' along with the `unexpected' in a provocative way.<br />\\"MAX\\",  is a  massively oversized publication (18&quot; x 14&quot;) and when opened, engulfs most coffee tables with iconic faces that have defined our cultural world.

This books 200 black-and-white photographs pulsate between the surreal worlds of Hollywood, New York, Paris and New Orleans at Mardi Gras.<br />Regardless of my desire to see Vadukul use his accomplished skill to photograph Africa and show our cloistered society the daily life struggle of the other impoverished 3 billion people that share this planet with us; one can only recognize the gift that is evidenced through these photos .  His photos are often energetic, raw, and abstractly captivating. Besides the crisp headshots, many of his photos capture this neon world with an impressionistic style that Van Gogh might have rendered had he a camera instead of a brush: or Dalai and his surrealism had he a SLR.  Very engaging nonetheless.  Recommended 4.5 Stars	2001-09-20

Besides being a skill aviator, his life was sprinkled with luck.  As a child he had the good fortune to be semi-adopted by the great inventor Alexander Graham Bell.  Though the paperwork for adoption never was completed (due to some family members protest),  the relationship between Alexander Graham Bell and Douglas McCurdy grew throughout his life and created the foundation for McCurdy's future in aviation.  McCurdy was the first to fly in Canada, the first to fly out of sight of land,  and the first person to fly from the United States  to Havana, Cuba (1911).<br /><br />This book pedantically lays out McCurdy's rise and recognition as one of the world's aviation pioneers.  The writing style is less than engaging, and except for those most enthusiastic about flying, most primary school children may lose interest.  Sadly,  the book lacks diagrams.  When Les Harding attempts to describe how McCurdy and his team developed  the `aileron' for their airplane, (this was McCurdy's most important contribution to aviation) there is no diagram.  The verbiage he uses to describe the \\"little wings\\" is inadequate for a child to understand.  The dozen or so black and white photos at the beginning of the book were wonderful but they stop midway through the book and needed to go on to help children understand the world at the turn of the 20th century and McCurdy's place in it.<br />Overall, if your child is an aviation buff then this would be \\"a good book\\" to explain the little known Canadian aviation history.  This book, along with the Robert Redford video \\"The Great Waldo Pepper,\\"  would be a perfect evening with the kids.  Recommended. 3 stars	2001-09-20

The Grilled Ginger Chicken is a must try and the  Fresh Lime Pie was quick and great tasting.  Ten Speed Press has done an great job in printing the color photos.

Scores of photos illustrate in vivid color what the finished dish looks like and there are great sailing shots too.  The side bars have helpful hints.

Fischer is a street philosopher, a theological anarchist and a disturbing writer, AND, I needed to hear his prophetic voice deriding the techno-conforming world in which we live. Throughout this book he challenges the reader to rethink core belief systems - question authority and normalcy.<br />If you need \\"the system\\" to get you through life, then this is not the book for you.  To say that \\"Shattering the Crystal Face of God\\" is radical  is an understatement; i.e. \\"God didn't throw Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden.  Greed, petty and selfish people fought over it until they destroyed it.  We created the gods we needed to punish ourselves for our sins against ourselves and the planet.  We are the instruments of our own damnation, and no savior is going to come along to absolve us.  If we are to be saved, we've got to do it ourselves.\\".  Get his message?  Fischer is not subtle.<br />The only thing that is sacred to M.L. Fisher is truth.  His search for truth reminds me of Mahatma Gandhi's epigram \\"The search for truth is a search for God. Truth is God.\\".  Provocatively, Mahatma gave his life to the search for truth, and was also an anarchist, but popular anarchists are rewritten by history to come out as revolutionaries, spiritual leaders, and sometimes Gods: Jesus Christ.<br />Fischer's sixteen chapters capture sixteen perspectives that are best read not straight through but in spurts.  Each chapter was a joy to read.  Not all of his writing is philosophical.  Often, Fischer, alias \\"The Tripper\\",  takes the reader on his wanderings, mostly in the California central coastal  area near Big Sur.  \\"Descending the panorama trail\\", he writes, \\"I waded through the chest deep flowers of the coastal early spring. Looking out, I lost track of the temporal\\".  Time is a subject that M. L. Fischer often talks about and losses track of.  For M.L., time is a figure of speech and is best dealt with by living in the moment.<br />  It is interesting that Spencer Johnson's bestseller \\"Who Moved My Cheese?\\" (published in September 1998 and on best-seller lists for nearly two years) is about rethinking the concepts which define your life, your reality (especially economic) and then moving on with life.  M. L. Fischer does the same thing in \\"Shattering the Crystal Face of God\\" but, as the title infers, more intensely, and he has totally skipped  the 5th Ave. packaging and marketing. \\"Trade in your tired conceptions for some fresh perceptions.

This is a good introduction to martial arts and a primer on Karate; a hand-and-foot fighting method developed in Okinawa from Chinese Kung Fu.  The beginning of martial arts, as we know it today, is generally acknowledged to have come to China from India and Tibet 2000 years before Christ was born.  Initially, these forms were exercises used by monks to keep their body fit and as protection against bandits.  This early form of martial arts practiced and perfected by the monks at the Shaolin monastery is known as Kung Fu.<br />Kung fu soon expanded into a method of self-defense that would protect the monks from bandits when they traveled.  Stories soon got out how various monks would soundly defeat multiple opponents and when the Emperor heard the stories, he asked the Shaolin monks to come protect him in his court and help him fight his enemies.<br />Karate is ONE form of marital arts but, in this book the authors fail to clearly express this.  No evaluation or comparisons between the different martial art forms are made.  This would have been very helpful.  Since Karate was derived out of Kung Fu the authors do a reasonable job covering its history.  Other martial art forms: Akido, Jijitsu, Tae Kwon Do, also get a page or two.<br />This is a simple introduction that helps you understand how Karate evolved and how it has found its place in our modern world.  It has very good photos and a wonderful section on Bruce Lee and  Chuck Norris.  If you are a young person wanting to get a better understanding of this martial art form then this would be a good book to begin with.  Recommended.	2001-08-15

First off, it is nigh impossible to find a decent cookbook for less than $..., but to find a great cookbook for under $... (Amazons price), is a true discovery.<br />But we need to beg the question: even if it is a bargain, do you need another book just for picnics?  I mean, picnics are simple, right?  Chicken, potato salad, wine, salt, pepper and some napkins.  Well, if you have picnic atrophy and go only once a year, then youre fine with the Colonel.  However, if you, by chance, plan to cultivate the cultured outdoor dining side of you, Stovel is your mentor.<br />Stovel breaks up the book into the four seasons, and within each season she gives multiple menus (Spring 6, Summer 12, Fall 7 and Winter 4 menus).  Each menu normally has five items.  For example: Stovels, Spring Day-Hike Picnic menu has: grilled chicken fillets in a spinach wrap, artichoke salad, carrot sticks, gingerbread and fruit, with herbal iced tea.  Her menus are thoughtful, flavorful, and balanced by having only one or two unique items out of the five.  Her recipes are easy to follow and very tasty.  This is a text only, there are no photos of the plates.<br />I thought Picnics were fun, kinda fast, intimate (like for two) and cheap.  But the recipes here are for eight people!  I have never had a picnic with eight people.  I have had a church gathering and a Super Bowl sporting event, but not a picnic with eight people.  Perhaps Stovel comes from a large family and see her readers bringing mom, dad, grandma and the five kids along; but in todays world of virtual families, recipes for eight are an overkill.  Thus, because my picnics are for two, every recipe has to be cut in half and then I still have a picnic basket of left overs.<br />Also, sometimes, the ingredients for these recipes doubled my weekly grocery budget.  For example, the ingredients for the Artichoke Salad (pg.16) set me back $16 by the time I bought  three jars of marinated artichoke hearts $9, six sun-dried tomatoes [you gotta buy the whole jar] $4, mushrooms, scallions, etc.  Or consider the Fresh Fruit Bowl Kaleidoscope costing more than $17 not counting the Grand Marnier Liqueur which is a heart-stopping $4, just for 50ml.<br />These points aired, this is a wonderful book that has recipes that can be used year round, picnic or not (Try Tantes Coffee Cake and Currant Oat Scones - Excellent).

The top award goes to the prolific author Christopher Baker, who wrote \\"Havana Handbook\\" and \\"Cuba\\" (both are published by Avalon Travel).<br />In Havana Handbook Christopher Baker gives you a solid introduction to Havana and Cuba, a good, but basic, general travel information section.  His two books have the best accommodations, restaurants and sights-to-see reviews and recommendations available today.  He also provides excellent tables &amp; lists of pertinent subjects, good black &amp; white photos, scores of side bar topics that are full of informative caveats, and the beginning of web site and Internet addresses.<br />The only improvement I can recommend to Avalon Travel and Christopher Baker (are you listening?) would be more, much more, email addresses (especially for the hotels) additional online sources and additional maps (i.e., Baker recommends three great walking tours through Havana and these need maps). However, I have reviewed other Moon Handbooks and the Havana Handbook's maps and scattered inclusions of online resources are a real improvement over other Moon Handbooks.<br />So, if you are going to visit  JUST Havana, and you don't want to cart around Christopher Baker's definitive, 827 page &quot;Cuba&quot; (Highly Recommended - see review), then this 368-page guidebook is very good and reliable choice. BUT,  for three dollars more I would buy  Christopher Baker's &quot;Cuba&quot;.  Regardless Christopher Baker has written a tour guide unmatched by any other Cuba guide book.  Recommended	2001-07-31

The five star rating for these gudes goes to this prolific author Christopher Baker and his superb guide.<br />Christopher Baker is an accomplished &quot;tell it like it is&quot; writer. He has a flowing writing style that keeps you engaged even during the dryer parts of a guide book.<br />His condensed (38 pages) history of Cuba is one of the best I have yet read in any travel guide. Regarding his sections on Government, Economy, Society and the People, Christopher Baker's writing overshadows the other guides.<br />After using his guide to investigate, and select,accommodations, food and sights to see in Cuba, I found only one case where the information was not current and that was with a restaurant that had closed. His reviews of accommodations and restaurants were informative, selectively bias and up to date; these are the most important characteristics of a good guide book. He has included superb imbedded blocks of pertinent subjects (i.e., Earnest Hemingway, Chi Guevara, Fidel Castro, the Cuban missile crisis, the special period, sex &amp; tourism etc.), good black &amp; white photos, scores of side bar topics that are full of informative caveats, a good selection of maps and the beginning of web site and Internet addresses.<br />You owe it to yourself to get the best guide available before you visit Cuba: Get Cuba by Christopher Baker.

Muller is a wonderful travel writer with the ability to make even the mundane come alive. Her way with words (&quot;The main square was full of Saturday-night drunks all walking like wobbly bowling pins&quot;) keeps you reading on to find out where she will land next, and among whom.  From helicopter crashes to street festivals, Karin Muller follows this ancient road, and allows serendipity to play its hand. She encounters not only the absurd and strange (having your  head beaten with a guinea pig to find out your disease or ailment), but the beautiful and sublime (&quot;people who reached out to help a stranger through a day of violence and despair&quot;).<br /> Her travels follow the famed Inca Road.  This ancient highway reached from Equador down to Chile, and played a critical role in homogenizing the Inca Civilization. I have been to South America over a dozen times in the past six years and her highly entertaining stories ring true.<br />There is a significant weakness to this book - the lack of maps.  I find it a bit baffling, that National Geographic, curator of some of the world best maps, failed to include any quality maps of a journey that snakes down and around South America. Rather, National Geographic gives you one decrepit and confusing black and white map of South America.  BUT! They do include 26 excellent color photographs. Go figure.<br />In `Along the Inca Road',  Karin Muller gives you more than just a great read, she furnishes you with provocative and informative insights into both  the history of the Inca and their culture.  This is a wonderful book and will be enjoyed by all who appreciate the Inca culture, South America and great travel writing.  You should read this book.  4 1/2 Stars Recommended	2001-07-19

But, after reading what Major Damon Gause went through, I paled in comparison.  This man dwarfs any other combat man (or woman) I have ever known.  I doubt that even Rambo could have endured what this man experienced.<br />Damon Gause had the characteristics of Rambo: raw physical strength, mental toughness, the ability to withstand tremendous amounts of pain, discomfort, deprivation of food &amp; water, toleration of the sight of gore and scores of gruesome deaths, plus one more - both he and the war he fought were real.<br />Beyond being a true warrior Damon Gause is also a very good writer.  Most &quot;journal&quot; books have the prose of flour paste.  This war journal is an exception. Gause brings you into the horrible moment of the fall of the Philippines to the Japanese. You feel the desperation, despair and dementia when the Japs took Corregidor. Continually through the book Gause praises the courage and loyalty of the Filipinos who fought with him and often helped him.<br />It would be easy to read this book as just an account of a courageous and extraordinary American solider whose feats of &quot;heroism in action&quot; awarded him the Distinguished Service Cross, but this book offers more.  It offers a wealth of lessons that anyone could learn from, and apply to daily life.<br />Two truths that can sustain you in the `valley of the shadow of death': believe in your cause and hold to your ideologies.  In the words of Winston Churchill \\"Never, Never, Never Give Up\\".  And, despise the thought of surrender. Retreat yes, surrender no.  Fight on, even when it looks impossible to prevail. Remember, that of  those that surrendered, they were starved and mistreated, often kicked or beaten, and many who fell were bayoneted. 7,000--10,000 died on the way in the Bataan Death March.<br />Other axioms that are applicable for living and prevailing even today are found throughout the book: develop partnerships, remember your destination and stay focused, camouflage your intentions when the adversary is around, risk trusting others to help you - they will.  For those that can, have faith in God's ability to provide and protect you.  And finally, when a passing enemy ship's canons are trained on you and your rickety little boat, display their flag, zealously wave and smile, shouting, &quot;long live Japan&quot;, and perhaps you too will live.  Remembering that their day will come; a day when they will stand on your battleship, with their heads bowed, in defeat.

A unique tea cup fell to the floor and shattered and all of my miracle glue could not restore it.  A child of 12, sold for $500 to a brothel in Manila services 10 men a day and she is kept in perpetual slavery. She has been infected with HIV.  &quot;Veronica's life has ended&quot; and all the miracle prayers we send up will not redeem her.<br />This book is about the shattered lives of children. It is about the reality of such painful deprivation for the estimated one million new child slaves each year.  It is not just about the pain, Kilbourn also considers what prevention and holistic intervention needs to take place to salvage these abused children.<br />In `Sexually Exploited Children' Phillis Kilbourn  presses the boundaries of our dignified comfort zones as she takes us into the world of 'Sexually Exploited Children'.  She does not stop with just child prostitution, child pornography, or pedophile rings, but she also peals back the ugly scab of incest.  Kilbourn does not leave us as voyeurs into the heinous world of sexual perversion, rather her sections dealing with prevention and intervention postulates some hope.<br />Reality says that the immoral world of child sexual exploitation is only a symptom of deeper economic, social and spiritual problems.  Normalcy says parents don't sell their children into sexual slavery on a whim; rather it is because of a major breakdown within the society.  A breakdown not just in Asia, Brazil or in &quot;those backward poor countries&quot;, but this world exists here in our homeland - big time.<br />Kilbourn's bottom line is that if we, as an educated, advanced society, fail to acknowledge and then engage these profane activities, then we 'de facto' accept the dehumanization of these perverted people and their pervasive powers.  We  'de facto', by our disengagement, inadvertently accept Dante's world as our world.<br />Kilbourn and MARC publishing have done us a significant service by revealing this dark world to us.  This is a must read if you are willing to have your conscience pricked.  But, be aware that during your reading you may hear the voice of a child crying and find yourself  involved.

A black and white photography on China that lacks photos of people.<br />Up-front, I want to acknowledge that China is immense and probably impossible to capture in one book.  I applaud Conners courage to travel by foot, bicycle, bus and train across the provincial provinces of China.  Some of her photos lift off the page and wrap the stunning landscape of China around you.  Callaway, the Publisher, is known for their superb quality in illustrated books and the reproductions here are excellent.<br />I acquired this book before I left for China and wanted to review it when I returned.  I have been back about a month.  What impressed me about China was the masses of people, all 1.3 billion of them. China seemed to be a compendium of human molecules always in motion.  Take that, and then blend the contrast between the new modernity of the metropolitan areas and the stark inequality of the poverty of the peasants (over 80% of the population are still farmers), and you have quite a photographic opportunity.<br />None of this is captured in Lois Conner's book. Of the Tritone photographs over 80% lack people.  Conner's photography was shot over a period of 15 years (1984 -1999).  In those years over 215,000,000 people were added to the country's population. China, among other things, is about people. The soul of China is found in its people.  Smiling faces, running children, friendly shopkeepers, generous strangers and polite professionals were the mental photos I remember of China.<br />Her photographs capture the space, shapes, shadows and unique landscapes found in this complex country and they do so, well.  Perhaps Vicki Goldberg, of the New York Times, said it best, \\"The results are lovely and can be challenging, though some are just pretty pictures.\\"  I want more China. Recommended for the quality and reproduction of the photographs, but not for the subject focus.	2001-06-16

Now there are a few knots that you probably will not use (Hangman's Noose, Shamrock, etc.) but others that can be used daily.  Regardless, if you want a fancy knot or just a real simple knot, Derrick Lewis will show you how to tie it right.<br />The book has excellent color photos of every knot, and most of the photos show the knot being used . . .  the hangman's noose a notable exception. The examples are good and generally easy to follow, though not as easy as the step-by-step color illustrations found in  Budworth's `The Complete Book of Sailing Knots (see my review).

The eligibility requirements are given for each benefit.  How to file claims and a very good section on making appeals if you are turned down is included.<br />This book is worth the purchase price if just for information on the burial benefits.  Almost any veteran (except dishonorable discharge) qualifies to get buried at a national cemetery.  Contact information is given and details, like the headstone, are spelled out.  Also, the healthcare benefits are a must read for any veteran.<br />This book is a no frills compendium of government benefits for vets.  If you can read federal government's S.O.P. without a problem, then you will be comfortable reading this.  Factual, clear (as much as any government writing can be) and comprehensive.  Missing is a question and answer section that could help a person deal with the impersonal bureaucracy.  Missing is a &quot;how to\\" section, whereby tips on getting the insensitive, intransigence of governmental bureaucracy is made easier.<br />I believe that the government should give each veteran a copy of this book upon discharge and make this book free upon request.  But that probably will not happen, so make the decision now to have a copy of this book with you and do as I do, take it to read and reread while waiting at the next Veterans Center.

This is the best knot book out for sailors and a great knot book for everyday users.<br />So, how many knots does one need to know to sail safely?  Some say as few as three, but Budworth shows you how to tie over 60 nautical knots, each with step-by-step color instructions.  He has an excellent introduction that covers history, tools, terms, material and construction of cord.  Each of the diagrams has the knots history, application and a written instruction that 99% of the time is not needed.  Budworth breaks down sailing knots into five sections: Stoppers, Loops, Bends, Hitches and Others.  Finally, he gives you a glossary, a bibliography of numerous knotting manuals, and tells you how you can join `The International Guild of Knot Tyers\\".  The only thing missing is a section on knot jokes.<br />Knot books don't get any better or simpler than this.  If you are going to buy one book to learn to tie knots this is the one.

The Capitols and the key cities in these three states get the lion&#8217;s share of ink (GA: Atlanta, Savannah, NC: Charlotte, The Triad Area, The Triangle Area, SC: Charleston, Myrtle Beach, Columbia).  IF you are going to be in JUST these cities, this would be a VERY GOOD guide to have.  The rest of the areas in each state get a quick &#8216;once over&#8217;.<br />Fodor&#8217;s dining and lodging recommendations are very good and are the best each city has to offer.  You won&#8217;t be disappointed by any of these listings.  However, they tend to be for affluent travelers and, though the South excels in great bed and breakfasts, none are listed.  The nightlife and the arts recommendations are very good.  Sports and shopping sections are also reliable and comprehensive.  Also, very helpful, Fodor has various &#8220;Great Itineraries&#8221; for each state broken down into 3 days, 7 days and 10 days.<br />What is obviously lacking are a lodging index and a restaurant index.  Thus, if you have a recommended restaurant you want to look up, you have to go through all the restaurant pages 'til you stumble across the name you seek or miss seeing it completely.  Another significant short coming, especially considering the 2001 title of this guide, is the lack of website addresses or email addresses for any of the listed hotels.  This penalizes you if you want to check out the hotel rooms, interior and/or exterior photos and then ask questions about special rates via email.<br />I am a firm believer that any guide book worth its salt has to guide you with both words and support those words with quality maps. This guide has excellent dining and lodging maps but just for Atlanta and Charleston!  What a shame to short change the other cities.  Also the guide encourages &#8216;walking tours&#8217; but gives no &#8216;walking maps&#8217;, you have to use the city map to figure it out.  The pull-out color three state map is a great addition. And, the few regional or city maps that are included are very helpful, and the maps clearly show you sites to visit, but with maps, more is better, and this guide begs for MORE specific area maps.<br />Finally, and this is true of all Fodor&#8217;s guides, is the insertion of irritating and unwanted hard page advertisement for banks and calling cards. The purchase price ... is more than enough for Fodor's to make a profit, but it chooses to afflict its readers with protruding advertising to increase its profits.

And, the knots are very basic (25 Knots were selected out of the  4000 that exist), but the diagrams are NOT as easy to follow or as comprehend as other books (see my reviews on Great Knots & How to Tie Them [Lewis] and The Complete Book of Sailing Knots [Budworth]).

Also superb is his &quot;Great Wall&quot; write up.  Brown's `Summer Palace' write up, while good, criticized the British and French for their terrible act of destroying the original palace, but said nothing of the destruction caused by Mao's henchman.<br />His recommendations for accommodations often have web site address and email (an important additions that many other guides omit), and Brown's restaurant and hotel recommendations are reliable and commendable.<br />On the weak side this 'travel log' lacks the interesting information that is found in other guide, i.e., understanding of Mao's Communist China, Tiananmen Square commentary, modern China, etc.  The accommodations and dining recommendations are very light and maps are few and far between.<br />What Brown has done is give us a valuable supplement to use in conjunction with your China travel guide (see my reviews on Rough Guide China  and Lonely Planet China for highly recommended guides).

Each restaurant and accommodation that is listed in the guide is marked on the maps (ya gotta love it).<br />The terse 3000-year history is as well written as objective as history can be, and thorough enough for most visitors. There is an outstanding appendix section, titled: &quot;Context,\\" covering, besides history, architecture, art, film, music and an excellent book list.  The recommendations for accommodations and restaurants are reliable and up to date.<br />However, this is not a perfect guide (5 stars). One of the weak areas of the guide is the omission of an accommodation or a  restaurant index. Thus, if you have a recommended restaurant you want to look up, you have to go through all the restaurant pages 'til you stumble across the name you seek or miss seeing it completely.<br />Another significant shortcoming is the lack of website and email addresses for hotels.  Phone and fax numbers are provided but, considering the cost, nothing beats email.  This is a significant omission, especially considering that the guide has a 2000 publishing date and most major Chinese hotels are now Internet connected,<br />Though the 'Basic Section' is up to guide books' standards, and has a few interesting sections (i.e., recommended tours, China Online Etc.)

There is no mention of Falun Gong and only a scant mention of the Three River Gorge Dam.  Usually Rough Guides are much better in this area.<br />Finally, an ongoing peeve that I have about Rough Guides, is the use of a number system to quote the price range of a hotel, i.e., the `Friendship Hotel' is listed to cost a '6'.  For a `6'  you have to flip back to the numeric legion where you find out that `6' = 600 to 800 yuans, which you then divide by the current rate of exchange.  As other guides simply demonstrate, there are better ways to help your reader gage approximate cost.<br />If you are going to just be in and around Beijing or Shanghai then this guide at 1100 pages may be an over kill.

The nightlife section is the best and there are some very interesting dives to explore in Beijing.  The color maps are great and easy to use.  Want to find a restaurant that Simon Lewis recommends?  Go to map 7, cross reference C,8.  Besides these color maps at the back of the guide, the b&w map of  the Hidden City is very good, showing the palaces, buildings and special locations at the site.  The restaurants and accommodations that I used on my visit to Beijing were 'spot on'.<br />Simon Lewis' unique and 'off the beaten tracks' vignettes are a joy to read. Topics include, Feng Shui, Beijing online and the Trans-Siberian Train and Dissent in Tian'anmen Square, just a few of the vignettes.  On the other hand, very little information is given to help the reader understand the culture and history of Beijing.<br />Though Simon Lewis includes a very informative directory of important offices, i.e., airlines, banks, embassies, hospitals etc., he only gives names, addresses and directions in English, not Chinese characters, so they are basically useless for taxi drivers and just about everybody else.  But he does have Chinese characters for all accomodations and resturants.<br />Simon Lewis focuses on the budget minded when it comes to recommending accommodation and restaurants, \\"Luxury hotels in Beijing are legion (and very pricy), but, you can still avail yourself of their lavish facilities, such as the lobby toilets and pick up free copies of the 'China Daily'.<br />A peeve that I have about Rough Guides is their use of a number system to quote the price range of a hotel, i.e., the Friendship Hotel costs a '6', then you have to flip back to the numeric legion to find out that 6 = 600 to 800 yuans, which you then divide by the current rate of exchange.  As other guides demonstrate, there are betters ways to help your reader gage approximate cost.<br />A weakness of many guides, including this one, is the absence of a hotel/ restaurant index.  Thus, if you have a recommended restaurant you want to look up, you have to go through all the restaurant pages 'til you stumble across the name you seek or miss seeing it completely.  Another significant short coming when you wish to make a reservation, especially considering the 2000 published date of this guide, is the lack of website and email from any of the listed hotels.  Most all Beijing hotels are connected to the web.<br />If you want a very good true 'pocket size' compact guide, \\"The MINI Rough Guide to Beijing\\" is a must buy and one of the best guides out today...Highly recommended. 4 1/4 stars....dship Hotel costs a '6', then you have to flip back to the numeric legion to find out that 6 = 600 to 800 yuans, which you then divide by the current rate of exchange.

Though an adequate guide for the general tourist, Fodor's excels as a business person's guide.  The 'Doing Business in China' section in this guide, though brief, is excellent.  Also the Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong sections are very good.  Also helpful, Fodor has various proposed itineraries for several  cities and regions found throughout the book.<br />I am a firm believer that any guide book worth its salt has to guide you with both words and quality maps. This guide has excellent dining and lodging maps for Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong but sadly stops there.  Fodor's other regional  maps are very helpful and the city maps clearly show you sites to visit.<br />Twenty writers have collectively compiled what amounts to a travel compendium on China. Thus the information can vary in helpfulness and accuracy.  The chapter on Southwestern China, which includes a scant section on the Three Gorge Dam, states, \\"that when completed the dam is intended to supply one third of the nation's electrical power\\".  One third!?  If this were true (not) that would be more than would be equivalent to 35 nuclear reactors or nearly 70,000 megawatts of electricity.  Closer reliable estimates place the projected output to 10% of China&#8217;s electrical power.<br />Insensitive and politically incorrect, Fodor includes the  Republic of Mongolia in its guide for China!  That would be like a guide on Florida including Cuba; offensive to any nation&#8217;s pride.  Also irritating are the unwanted insertions of hard page advertisement for banks, calling cards and travel services. The purchase price of $... is more than enough for Fodor's to make a profit but it chooses to afflict its readers with protruding advertising to increase its profits. NOT!<br />Even though this guide has a 2000 publishing date there is no Internet information.  No list of cyber cafes and no website or email address for accommodations, even though most major hotels  are Internet connected.  And finally, there is no Chinese characters in the book, thus when you need to use a taxi there is nothing to point to as 99.9% of the taxi drivers speak zero English.<br />Basically, this guide would be adequate for a person with a large tour group or a business person visiting Beijing, Shanghai or Hong Kong, but there are better guides out for the general traveler (see my reviews of Lonely Planet China or Rough Guide China).

Fodor's excels as a business person's guide. The Capitols and the key cities in these three States get the lion&#8217;s share of ink (GA: Atlanta, Savannah, NC: Charlotte, The Triad Area, The Triangle Area, SC: Charleston, Myrtle Beach, Columbia).  IF you are going to be in JUST these cities, this would be a VERY GOOD guide to have.  The rest of the areas in each state get a quick &#8216;once over&#8217;.   <br />Fodor&#8217;s dining and lodging recommendations are very good and are the best each city has to offer.  You won&#8217;t be disappointed by any of these listings.  However, they tend to be for affluent travelers and, though the South excels in great bed and breakfasts, none are listed.   The nightlife and the arts recommendations are very good.  Sports and shopping sections are also reliable and comprehensive.  Also, very helpful, Fodor has various &#8220;Great Itineraries&#8221; for each state broken down into 3 days, 7 days and 10 days.  <br />What is obviously lacking are a lodging index and a restaurant index.  Thus, if you have a recommended restaurant you want to look up, you have to go through all the restaurant pages 'til you stumble across the name you seek or miss seeing it completely.  Another significant short coming, especially considering the 2001 title of this guide, is the lack of website addresses or email addresses for any of the listed hotels.  This penalizes you if you want to check out the hotel rooms, interior and/or exterior photos and then ask questions about special rates via email.<br />I am a firm believer that any guide book worth its salt has to guide you with both words and support those words with quality maps. This guide has excellent dining and lodging maps but just for Atlanta and Charleston!  What a shame to short change the other cities.   Also the guide encourages &#8216;walking tours&#8217; but gives no &#8216;walking maps&#8217;, you have to use the city map to figure it out.  The pull-out color three state map is a great addition. And, the few regional or city maps that are included are very helpful, and the maps clearly show you sites to visit, but with maps, more is better, and this guide begs for MORE specific area maps.<br />Finally, and this is true of all Fodor&#8217;s guides, is the insertion of irritating and unwanted hard page advertisement for banks and calling cards. The purchase price of ... is more than enough for Fodor's to make a profit, but it chooses to afflict its readers with protruding advertising to increase its profits.

If you are considering on going into the Peace Corps (or are an ex- Peace Corps volunteer) get this book.<br />If you are planning on learning Chinese get this book.<br />If you are going to visit China and/or journey up the Yangtze River take this book with you.<br />I just spent three languid days steaming up the Yangtze and read 'River Town' while reminiscing on the unique insights that Peter Hessler has on contemporary China.  His candor and compassion for the common Chinese come out of his two years (1997 - 1998) as a Peace Corps English teacher in the Yangtze river town, Fuling.<br />River Town is more than a travelogue or anecdotal book that memoirs a Peace Corps workers 'two years in China'.  It is an anthropological comprehension of a nation that is often an enigma to many who encounter it.  Hessler comprehends, as best as anyone can in a scant few years, a culture that is as complex as its language.  A world where the people have learned to live and balance the contradictions (Communist capitalism) and irony (tai chi to the beat of rock music) that pervades their world.<br />Provocative and very informative is his chapter 'The Dam'.  What Jan Wong does for revealing a comprehensive and balanced account of Tiananmen Square massacre in her book &quot;Red China Blues&quot; (see my review) Peter Hessler does for understanding the Three Gorge Damn project now underway on the Yangtze.  A must read for those interested in this controversial and provocative project.<br />An extraordinary experience in an extraordinary book. Highly recommended.  4 1/2 stars	2001-06-02

Peter Neville-Hadley is an impressive and informative travel writer.  His candid \\"call 'em like they are\\" inspires a reader&#8217;s confidence in his evaluations.  He is the anthesis of the insipid  writer that panders to commercial tourism.<br />He is blunt about short comings both in the society and Chinese travel industry. Regarding the government dominated tourist industry he warns you about Chinese museums and historic sites.  He writes, \\"Misrepresentation of the true history of a site is commonplace, whether for political reasons intended to exalt the communist party or put the blame for destruction wholly on foreigners.\\"  Regarding hotels, he is in the government's face, \\"China's star rating system in not to be trusted.\\" And the police fair no better, \\"Police in China are generally to be avoided... they are assumed to be corrupt until proven honest\\".  My experiences during my recent trip to China provided him correct.  You can trust his recommendations and reflections on both Beijing and China.<br />I enjoyed his view points on both history and current affairs.  His small section on 'Christianity in China' is excellent and he is blunt about how Christian influence was stunted significantly in China because of its own short comings, he writes \\"It was the Christians own squabbling that lost them their influence in China.\\" He is skeptical about the hype over China&#8217;s emergences as the dominating superpower, he states, \\"Stories of China becoming the biggest economic superpower in the near future are greatly exaggerate\\".  He goes on to give his reasoning.<br />He has an 'A to Z' section (climate and crime, media, money and museums, police and post offices, etc.)  that is very useful and interesting.  Neville-Hadley has the wonderful ability to condense 1000 years of history into ten pages that you can digest and understand; a talent that so many other travel writers can&#8217;t do in twice the space.<br />His accommodations & restaurant guides are accurate and good.

Jan Wong, a teenager during the Vietnam era, was dissatisfied with capitalistic Canada and  radically sought change.  For Wong the truth was to be found in Mao's 'little Red Book' and her reading room was to be China.<br />Looking back twenty-five years and with 20/20 hindsight, Jan Wong takes us into the dragon's lair revealing both her youth's ideology and Mao's China gone by.  For many who remember the 60's and early 70's you will understand how she could turn her back on the comfort and freedoms of her home in Canada, renouncing all, and go to live in Mao's China.  For fourteen years, with a religious, fanatical devotion, Jan Wong dedicated her life to become a missionary of Mao.<br />Her red world crashed around her in 1976, the year when the cultural Revolution and Chairman Mao died..  All of her sacrifice, all of the suffering she went through as a worker-peasant were for naught, as China drastically discarded Mao's ideology and moved towards a hybrid capitalistic communism.  She felt betrayed, suckered and stupid, &quot;I vowed I would never again suspend my disbelief. I promised myself I would question everything.  I became a skeptic.&quot;<br />Her opportunity to question everything came when the New York Times hired her as a Journalist in its Beijing office.<br />Jan Wong's on site coverage of the Tiananmen Square massacre of 2600 Chinese citizen's in 1989 stands out as one of the best on site reports I have read on the subject.  Even Mao, in his 40 years of rule, did not turn tanks on his own people, but Deng Xiaping slaughtered his own people to keep his grip on Communist power.  She writes, &quot;The guns at Tiananmen Square killed my last illusions about China.&quot;<br />This book is a must read for anyone traveling to China today.  It does more to help you understand the current history than a dozen guide books will.	2001-06-02

William Bennett is the former Secretary of Education and the editor of the recent bestseller Book of Virtues.  Bennett has become a voice of morality for America.  In Death of Outrage, Bennett laments the reality found in hard statistics; numbers that show that America is not as virtuous as Bennett would like.  In disgust he writes, \\"In a self-governing and law-abiding nation, we must never allow ourselves to be lulled into passive disgust or indifference.  We should never lose our sense of outrage.\\"  For Bennett, America has lost its moral compass.  America  no longer has  the correct notion of right and wrong.  If Americans did, they would be outraged at the moral lapse of their president.<br />Bennett's  \\"outrage\\" is induced because his reality is flawed.  The first step to happiness, and sanity, is to grasp the reality about you and the situation that you are in.  Bennett writes from the belief that we are a nation of highly principled, morally correct people who, when they see the truth about William Clinton, would rise up and express righteous indignation, seeking to throw the President out.  Wrong.  Bennett, get a grip.  The reality is more than 70  percent of America liked Bill Clinton and wanted the case dropped.<br />But these numbers stop William Bennett?  No.  He  is not one to give up just because the America populace is morally dull.  He proves that with the Death of Outrage.  Bennett is going to help us grasp Clinton's criminal offense and guilt; explaining it again as if we just don't get it.  But Dr. Bennett we do get it.  We know our President is a scoundrel and he cheated on his wife, lied to the people of the country and used his office to cover it up.<br />Ultimately, Death of Outrage is about morality, and the lack there of in the America people.  Bennett appropriately quotes the Bible various times in Death of Outrage underscoring the need for standards and morals in our nation. However, other socially concerned voices need to be heard along with Bennett, such as the voice of the social activist, theologian and contemporary author Jesuit Priest Daniel Berrigan.  Berrigan reads the same Bible but comes up with a different reality . . .  \\"The Bible has news for you; moral incapacity rules the world.  The system does not know light from darkness.\\"<br />Don't get me wrong, we need moral prophets, and this book does an admirable job at outlining the President's offenses and his defense, going on to dismantle them line by line.

I read this book while in Beijing, China and was amazed at the cult status that Mao still has in China.  My travel companion found a `Mao' alarm clock with the autocrat's smiling face beaming at you and  his arm waving the seconds by.  After vacillating on whether to buy it or not, she said, \\"I am intrigued by the novelty, but put off by the thought of waking up to a demagog's face each morning.\\"<br />Mao was ultimately responsible for the death of an estimated 60 million people.  To put this in perspective, that is more than the entire population of Italy today.  It is interesting that Penguin choose to publish a biography on this megalomaniac, but not Hitler or Stalin.<br />My first read in the Penguin Lives Series was the biography of Leonardo de Vinci&quot; (recommended -  see my review).

Wrong.<br />Jonathan Spense is a prolific writer on China, with over twelve titles in print to date  His coverage of the life of Mao is academic and reads more like an college essay than a gripping biography.  At no time during the reading did I get a sense of the personal struggles of Mao Zedong nor was I able to connect with him as a revolutionary.<br />Spense glosses over two disastrous periods of Mao's chairmanship: The disastrous `Great Leap Forward' period (1959-1962) and the terrible terror and repression of the `Cultural Revolution' period (1966-1976).  He left out WWI entirely and gave very scant space to China and WWII. Also, grossly abbreviated are the years of Mao's revolutionary war that ended in Chaing Kai-shek being driven off mainland China to Taiwan.<br />It is interesting to note that when Mao met Stalin (December 1949), Stalin asked about publishing Mao's literary works.  Mao was not happy with them and requested more time, \\"You need your works edited?\\" Stalin asked.  \\"Yes,\\" Mao replied.  I am sure that Mao would want a rewrite of this biography too.

The maps: excellent.  Internet addresses and web sites listed, YES.  Great introduction, check.  The history and general information are very good.  Even the box vignettes are filled with wonderful superfluous information (IE. Cheap thrills, great Jewish families, etc.).  His entertainment section is one of the best I have seen.  And, the accommodations, restaurants and 'what to see' are reliable, up to date and discriminating.  `Lonely Planet: Shanghai' is done right.<br />This also would be a great guide for long term business persons, foreign students and expats living in Shanghai.  Mayhew's has unearthed information that would take you a massive amount of time and energy to retrieve on your own.  His list of clubs, organizations and charities are great.  .<br />For those who will be in Shanghai more than a few days, his section 'Excursions' takes you outside of Shanghai and these areas are well worth the effort to see.  He is a co-writer for 'Lonely Planet China' (see my review) and, even though some of the information is found there too, it is only cursory compared to this guide.<br />Bottom line: Shanghai is a marvel, a modern urban Lazarus.  A study of a city's resurrection.  Never has any city come back so new, so fast.  There is not a better guide out today to introduce you to this resurgence than Bradley Mayhew's,  Lonely Planet Shanghai. Highly recommended	2001-05-31

Sherwin Nuland writes about the world's greatest genius in the same way a surgeon would methodically approach an operation.  Sherwin Nuland is Dr. Nuland, Clinical Professor of Surgery at Yale University, where he also teaches medical history.  His writing is direct, scientific and unembellished and, when done, he has laid out the life and works of Leonardo before you.<br />Nuland addresses the personal life of this grand master in the first thirty pages.  Nuland discusses the strong indications that Leonardo was homosexual and dialogues with many of Leonardo's previous biographers, including Sigman Freud.  Leonardo was an illegitimate child, whose education was only until the age of 15, never married or had even one tryst with the opposite sex. Throughout his  life he was subservient to the wishes of  the patrons upon whom he relied upon for income.  Interesting is the blemished reputation Leonardo had as an artist who started scores of works only to leave behind him a myriad of unfinished paintings, sculptures and drawings.<br />For Dr. Nuland Leonardo de Vinci's anatomical drawings were his crowing work.  For thirteen hundred years before Leonardo the medical world had relied upon the medicine and anatomy of the second century Greek physician, Galen.  The magnitude of the forward leap that Leonardo gave  science was remarkable, and \\"remarkable\\" is an understatement.  Leonardo de Vinci dared to think beyond the accepted medical orthodoxy of Galen.

Printed on the inside of the cover there are praises for \\"Garden Seed Inventory,\\" and rightly so, for it is a valuable,  \\"one of a kind\\" catalogue of all the vegetable seeds offered by garden seed companies in North America.<br />Dr. Harlan, retired professor of plant genetics (there's a clue for you) states that the book is for \\"enthusiastic gardeners, plant breeders and those interested in the preservation of seed stocks.\\"  Now I think of myself as an enthusiastic amateur gardener, but it will take a whole lot more than my enthusiasm to really make this tome useful.  This is a book that a professor of plant genetics should have. This is the book that the owners of one of the 255 seed companies listed in the book should have, and this is the book that a seed zealot would have, but not your normal `enthusiastic gardener'.<br />Don't get me wrong, this book is extremely valuable to the right person.  As Wendell Berry said,  \\"The saving of seeds has become a matter of the greatest importance, for we are on the verge of losing the genetic diversity of our food crops.\\".  Over the last 20 years, because of mega-transnational corporations buying out the small seed companies, there has been a significant loss of local or regional varieties.  Here's why; when a large corporation gets into the seed business they have to cover a large market, so they breed for a variety of vegetables plants that can grow anywhere across North America (hybrid) and dump the regional plants.  In 1981, the first edition of \\"Garden Seed Inventory\\" there were 493 tomatoes (red) varieties available; by 1998 there were 108 still available (78% drop).  Then again, in the same period, there were 546 new varieties brought to market.<br />What this book is really about is saving our vegetable heritage and assuring genetic preservation.  It is the seed squealer of horticulture books.  It will tell you which varieties are about to be dropped and it also helps you find regional varieties that you can plant, thus preserve the lineage.  It is a great tool for those that are ready to move from enthusiastic gardener to zealous, non-hybrid vegetable seed gardener. However, for the rest of us Americans, we will probably plant our gardens with  the seeds that were on the rack at the local stores and when they come up, if they come up, enthusiastically smile.  Highly Recommended for the zealot, conditionally recommended for the rest of us.can plant, thus preserve the lineage.

Ortho kills bugs, pests and diseases.  This book is indispensable for any serious or semi-serious gardener.  Where there is growth there will be \\"anti-growth\\" force.  The wilted vine, the brown grass, yellow spots on leaves, discolored needles, clusters of pink soft-bodied insects and, yes, garden fans, gray grubs with brown heads are all part of the \\"anti-growth\\" force.<br />This problem solving book has excellent color photos illustrating every problem you could possibly encounter.  The layout below the photo is simple, yet very effective: Problem, Analysis, Solution.  No book in my gardening library is used more.<br />\\"The Ortho Home Gardener's Problem Solver\\"  even has a section for household pests (sorry, no section for your neighbor's barking dog).  If it has a downside, it is that it is  published by a chemical company which means that there are NO organic solutions.  By-in-large Ortho's motto is \\"if it is alive, we can kill it chemically.\\"  This is the definitive reference tool for the home gardener.  Highly recommended.	2001-04-16

Venice is comprised of one hundred islands, stapled together by 400 bridges, water taxis and gondola hawkers, making this one of the most captivating cities of the world, and one that especially needs and deserves its own guide.<br />Damions Simonis has produced the definitive guide on Venice.  In his &quot;Lonely Planet Venice&quot; you have brilliant maps, a solid introduction section that covers Venice's history, government, economy, ecology, climate etc.  An informative practical travel section and most important, a reliable and up to date listing of recommendations for lodging, restaurants, entertainment, places to see and things to do.  These, along with the beginning of Internet references (though he fails to include hotel web sites and email addresses), make this a great guide on Venice.<br />If you are planning to spend your time in Italy, and mainly in this city of romantic waterways and sumptuous architecture, you deserve the best guide out today - Lonely Planet Venice.

Rather, it is a compendium of historical topics that, when brought together, illustrate the mosaic history of Venice.<br />Mary McCarthy writes with the confidence of a discerning Brussels diamond buyer.  In her book McCarthy holds up Venice and asks the reader to observe the beauty, uniqueness, and flaws that time has formed over the past ages.  She turns this city/state before you and by the end of her 150 page book, you will have examined a gem.<br />Her writing, while learned, can be convoluted, and the text should be read with a dictionary by one's side,  i.e., \\"The other way lay universal odium&quot; - odium?.  A significant distraction is the lack of an index, biography and glossary.  These aspects make the work difficult to engage. Yet, I pushed  through the book because of the insights that Mary McCarthy gave to Venetian culture and history.<br />For those that are schooled in Italian history and have an interest in Venice then this book would be worth reading, for McCarthy's insights can be provocative as well as  intriguing.<br />For the general traveler there is better and more &quot;user friendly&quot; books on this gem of a city.

With the deficiencies listed below, this guide would normally warrant a star less than the four I gave it, BUT, Rick Steves' recommendations are exemplary, unique and most of them keep you  away from the hordes of tourist that often plague Italy in the Summer.  This  guide truly has unique vignettes that separate it from the glut of guides on Italy.<br />When I was in Venice, I used  Rick Steves' guide and it  lead me to an interesting Gregorian Mass at San Giorgio Maggiore Church.  Rick also dutifully told me what to do if one of Venice's pigeons take a dump on my head (you grin, but think this not strange for Venice has tens of thousands of these strategic bombers).  In this guide you will find selected venues that most other guidebooks completely omit, but alas, going off the beaten path you will often miss out on the tour buses, fat ladies with sun hats, trailed by the downcast husband with a camera as a dog-tag around his neck.  Drats!<br />The index is grossly anemic and the maps are hand drawn, giving you only a basic idea of where you are in Italy. Also, this is not a complete guide to Italy.  Rick Steve is selective and omits a significant portion of Italy, areas which I found fascinating, such as Bergamo.  &quot;Rick Steves' Italy 2001&quot; includes: Rome, Florence, Naples, Venice, Lake Como, The Dolomites, Cinque Terre and five hill towns.  If you are going to any of these areas specifically then Rick Steves' guide would be a welcome addition, along with a more comprehensive guide such as Frommer's Italy.  Recommended	2001-04-11

The Red Guides are the &quot;Consumer's Report&quot; for dining and lodging in various geographical locations throughout Europe.  Red Guides stress the independence and impartiality of their  &quot;professional inspectors.&quot;  Accommodations and restaurants are  &quot;visited anonymously&quot;  and each inspector &quot;always settles their own bill.&quot;  Each selection is revised annually.  The &quot;Michelin Red Guide Italia 2001&quot; lists more than 4000 hotel addresses, ranging from hostels to exceptional luxury hotels.  There are more than  3000 restaurants including 209 with stars (fine quality cooking).  Each listing details the facilities, prices and sometimes includes a very terse comment.  Impressive was the listing of email addresses for the majority of the hotels.  And their web site provides you with all of the Michelin products that are available ....  Their maps are superb.<br />Using this guide reminds me of my first computer, an antediluvian machine that ran on &quot;dos&quot;.  That computer could accomplish a task, and occasionally did,  but not without much frustration, irritation and the occasional &quot;who in the #%^*! designed this thing?&quot;.  First off, this guide is NOT in English (only the legion is).  It is written in Italian, and my Italian is nonexistent (remember dos?).  The guide gives you a price listing for hotels and restaurants that is quoted in liras.  Thus, if you wish to convert it to dollars, and most North American travelers will, all you have to do is divide the posted amount by 2164.5 and presto,  you have the rate in dollars.  NOT.  There is no index, or table of contents, which makes navigating the guide an obstacle.  As far as I figured you just have to flip through 900 pages until you get to the area you want, then wrestle it out from there.<br />This is not a travel guide.  Rather, it is a restaurant and hotel evaluation report that when used with other guides, can be useful and reliable.  Also, I used the city maps often while driving Italy.  However,  I have never been so frustrated using a directory as I have with &quot;Michelin Red Guide Italia.&quot;  It has the ability to be valuable and useful, but the work that you have to put into it negates much of the worth that you get out (sic. my old computer).

Especially useful is the specialized indexes she provides: romance by the sea, romance with tennis, romance with golf, romance with a horse(!), romance on a safari, romance with a private pool, romance with a private fireplace and romance in a city for convenient shopping (Oops, there goes the romance).<br />Though I could only get to a half dozen of the recommended romantic resorts before I wanted to get back to fish'n in Southern Georgia, I got the general idea.  I applaud the great research that  Katherine Dyson has done, though I take exception to listing huge commercial resorts as romantic (Half-Moon Club, Sandals Resorts,  Disney's Resort etc.).  Also helpful would be a list of the most expensive to the cheapest romantic spots; it is amazing how $$$ affects romance with most men.

Case-in- point, \\"Frommer's Italy 2001&quot; at the front of the guide lists the 'best luxury hotels' and the 'best moderately priced hotels' , but skips a mention of the best budget hotels.<br />After using Frommer's for two weeks I found the recommendations to be right on the money (accurate, concise, and informative - listing some of the best selections in the areas).  The maps in major metropolitan areas (Rome, Florence, Venice, but not Milan!) are graphically laid-out with restaurants and accommodations numerically located each on a separate map (this really helps).<br />A separate large folding map of Italy is attached at the back of the book, is a nice addition indeed. The color photo plates are superb, and especially helpful is the thin chapter &quot;Online Directory&quot; that lists a useful scattering of websites to help you plan your travel.  Very impressive is that most of the listed accommodations have website and e-mail address.  If you get a chance check out [...] and [...]<br />On the short side, but not a significant deterrent, Frommer's gives only nine pages to introduce you  to 3000+ years of Italian history, and covers Italy's art, architect, culture and food in twenty one pages (30 pages total).  Safety, especially thief and robbery is scantily mentioned in the guide and not even listed in the Index,  (Italy has the highest rate of thief and robbery in Europe - See US State Department warning).

For him, these photos reflect  &quot;A history and culture&quot; being erased.  Afghanistan today is one of the poorest, most devastated countries in the world.  The ruling power, the Taliban, is very reluctant to allow visitors into their country because of their fear of the stories the visible suffering would generate.  Because of this self imposed quarantine, Afghanistan is also one of the least understood countries.  Grazda, through his photographs, has given us insights into the plight of these people.<br />I am not sure what it is about death and destruction that captivates a photographer's camera, but it must be a tinge of macabre.  In &quot;Afghanistan Diary,&quot; and through the eye of Edward Grazda, you will get a glimpse of the demented effect that the Taliban zealots have had in Afghanistan.  Their oppressive and  harsh treatment of women is well documented.  The Talibans continue to be in the world news because  they support terrorist training camps and harbor the accused terrorist Osama bin Laden.  Most recently, March 2001, the Talibans blew up several enormous,  priceless, Buddhist statues, which were carved into mountain walls between the second and fifth centuries AD.<br />Grazda's  photographs,  while interesting, are not captivating.  The reproduction of the photos are often too dark, thus greatly diminishing their impact.  If ever a story of struggling common people, amidst despair and depravation,  needs to be told, it is in Afghanistan.  But, this story is not visible here.  Grazda has not laid out the photographs in a coherent  manner.  One photo will be of  buildings riddled with bullets, then another of turbaned, armed Afghanistani's; which then, nonsensically gives way to another photograph of office workers and then a photo of an empty office with a calendar on the wall.  Also, the five pages that journal Grazda's thoughts while he was in Afghanistan were uninspiring.  Though I am grateful for the glimpse into the sorrow of this section of the world, I was disappointed by the reproduction quality, thematic layout and writing.

Though David Stanley is a good, informative writer, he still knacks the expression and fire of the Cuban travel guide writer, Christopher Baker (see review). However, Stanley's economic analysis (in the Facts about Cuba section, which is also  very good) is the best out in a guide book today.<br />The strength of this guide, as with most all Lonely Planet guides, is that they are an excellent source for information that is often disregarded in other guides (i.e., paragliding, language schools, how to get a tour bus to transport you at a fraction of what you would pay for a taxi, etc.).<br />Though I think this guide is ONE OF THE BEST, there are a few areas that, as in the old report card mark stated, N/I - needs improvement.  I found this guide more difficult to navigate than other Cuban guides; mainly because of a paltry index.  The index DID NOT list hotels or restaurants and  this required that I to flip through each section until I found the listing I wanted information on (especially a hassle in Havana).  The maps, though plentiful (68), could use improvement by adding color plates and clear/cleaner definition. The best guide book for clear, easy-to-use maps for Cuba are in Michelin's Neos Guides and Moon Travel.<br />These points noted, I do not hesitate recommending Cuba by David Stanley - 2000.

There are three reasons I can think of to buy this wonderful book.  One, you are an information junky on Cuba and this unique segment of Cuban history must not escape your grasp. Second, and most likely, you are going to this unique Cuban south coast island to explore it and/or dive its great coral reefs, and want the only English language book devoted to this island.  Or, three, closer to my reason for having the book, you are thinking about dropping out of the rat race, maybe on a remote island, and you are fascinated that in the early 1900s (and before) American settlers came and survived the demanding and difficult times.  You want to read about dreams of pirates, ranchers, prisoners and soldiers who for four centuries saw this island a place where dreams come true. You want to read the actual interviews and stories that illuminate the  strength of character needed to persevere and become a survivor; a survivor long before any Caribbean island media, much less a televison hit show.<br />This book is replete with their stories.  Jane McManus saw that the unique pioneers would die out by the end of the 90's and has done all of us a great service by capturing their unique and fascinating stories. The story of Margaret Pitman Rice (1901-1992) who arrived in Cuba with her  husband and children from Toronto because of a treasure map found in a very old turret-wound watch. The story itself is spellbinding and the outcome, unbelievable.  She punctuates the stories throughout the book with scattered black &amp; white photographs.<br />I read this wonderful book while in Cuba and visiting the Island of Joventud.  I had the happen-chance of meeting  Jane McManus while I was in Havana and was even more impressed with her and her work after meeting her. She is an American Journalist that has lived in Cuba for more than thirty years.  I am confident that if, for any or all of the reasons list above, you want to read this book you, will not be disappointed. Recommended	2001-03-21

His anthropological explanation of the people is excellent for a guide book.<br />His expose of religion in Jamaica (especially Rastafarianism) and music (Reggae - Bob Marley, Jimmy Cliff, Garnet Silk) is well written and very informative.

In Kingston,  two of the smaller hotels listed are now closed and prices in the book have risen about at least 30%.  Compared to other guide books on Jamaica (Lonely Planet, Moon Travel, etc.) its description of the budget and moderate accommodations receive less ink thus there is not much for you to make an intelligent choice by (i.e., he writes &quot;14 rooms, with an attractive atmosphere, T.V. lounge and restaurant.&quot;)  Jamaica: A Visitor's Guide introduces you to many interesting facets of Jamaica and if Pariser brings out a fourth edition, I would hope that he would add more descriptions to accommodations and dining and list hotel's e-mail/web pages (a peeve that I have with all guide books).

Five things which should be found in any recommended travel guide: 1) An introduction to the country or region that is as engaging  as it is informative; 2) An excellent section that covers the travel information that you need prior to heading out (visa, passport, health, etc.) 3) The CORE of the guide; accommodations, restaurants, and sights to see, offer you a bias descriptions.  A bias that is based on the writer's judgment and a set of criteria that they use to determine excellence.  Thereby,  you can make an informed decision with confidence.  The writer's feedback must be based on their  actual visit and/or experiences.  Also, this information needs to be current; so that the name, address, phone &amp; fax numbers are still in use.  And, finally,  in today's cyberspace world, email and web site addresses should be also included.  4) Maps. Many Maps. Usable, readable maps. 5) Finally, tidbits, charts, graphs, side bar topics and fun to read caveats.  A guide with these qualities earns a &quot;highly recommended&quot; rating - five stars.<br />Though comprehensive, the introduction (climate, flora/fauna, land, history, economy and government) is slow to engage and only picks up interest in the last portion: people and religion.  I was especially absorbed by Luntta's section &quot;Buccaneers and Pirates.&quot; The most engaging introduction I have yet read is found in &quot;Jamaica,&quot; by Harry Pariser (see review).  Karl Luntta's travel information section is very good.  Every aspect that you need,  and a lot more is covered.<br />Jamaica Handbook excels where it counts, the core section.  Every hotel and restaurant that I checked out conformed to Luntta's evaluations with only a few minor exceptions that will happen to any guide because of the passage of time.  You can fully trust his recommendations regarding what to see and experience.<br />But the guide does not give you email and web site addresses  for any of the hotels.  If you are an information junkie, like me, you will read all of his great side bar pieces (Montego Bay Hustle, The Roots of Love, The Story of Rum, etc.).<br />The Jamaica Handbook is chronically anemic regarding maps.

This Neos Guide must have been written by a committee for the writing is flat and uninspiring.  For example, when writing about Cuba's rich, hot music, this guide states, &quot;Salsa is the music that most people associate with Cuba.&quot;.  The writing brought fastbacks of reading a sterile High School history text, the guide  continues to drone on, &quot;Another kind of music emerged from the mixing Spanish and African traditions.&quot;  `Dear God, please don't let them test me at the end of this, if so, make it true or false test.'<br />Though published in 2000 mainly for European readers, I found some of the information dated;  I.e.,  American Express Travelers Check are accepted at various hotels now,  and MasterCard, unless the International issue, is not --- important information contrary to the guide's information.<br />I found that I paid  about 25% more than the book states in various restaurants.  Also, the listing of accommodations for Havana is scant considering that Havana  has hundreds of venues for lodging.  &quot;Cuba - Neos Guide&quot;  lists only 25 accommodations for all Havana and its suburbs (compared to more than 100 in  Moon Travel Handbook - Havana).  But, then, this is a Michelin Guide  and the guide has selected most of the best accommodations in Havana (excluding the lower end budget hostels and private homes).  The same goes for THE modest number of restaurant listings.<br />Michelin Guides are renowned for their hotel and restaurant evaluations.  Also, Michelin specializes in printing maps and this book does have great maps!  Those two qualities, along with commendable color photos/drawings, are the redeeming qualities of this guide.<br />If you are European and coming to Cuba for just a few days then this guide will be adequate. However, there are significantly better guides (Cuba: Moon Travel, Cuba: Rough Guide and Cuba: Lonely Planet in that order [see reviews]) that I recommend you consider first.

This excellent read will engage you,  regardless of what side of the tracks you were born.<br />I met Bill Brent in Havana, Cuba and saw in his 70-year-old eyes a man with an unique  story to tell. I recognized that age had not robbed him of his forceful character,  a character that had been sculpted like a rock buffeted by external forces.  That day in March 2001, we talked, reminiscenced and slowly sipped our Cuba Libres in his apartment.  Though I had not known Bill Lee Brent before this moment, there was a kindred spirit.  A common &quot;yes,&quot;  that comes from struggling against external forces in life,  and if not prevailing, at least surviving against odds. We consciously wasted away our afternoon, sharing stories about the lives we both have lived, confirming often the overlapping experiences we both went through during the sixties.<br />From his dirt-poor childhood in the South during the thirties and early forties, to his street days and hard jail time through the fifties, Brent's engaging writing never slacks or whines. He struggles to rise above the sludge that he was born into; but he was never released by the downward pull of destiny. Finally, in the sixties, he joined the radical Black Panthers. He rose to the rank of captain and was the bodyguard of Eldride Cleaver.<br />His honest, but critical, look inside the Black Panthers: what they stood for, how they changed, and, when Bill Brent needed them, how they turn their backs on him; is a story that for history's sake needs to be told.  Bill Brent was radical, yes; revolutionary, sure; and deliberate without a doubt.  So, it should have come to no one's surprise that while awaiting trial for shooting three Oakland policemen, when he saw an out,  he would take it.  In July, 1969 William Lee Brent hijacked TWA Flight 151 from Oakland to Havana, Cuba and has never left Cuba since.  As we were parting company, he looked at me and said, &quot;&quot;You always keep what you need handy and you always dream.&quot;  This is his fascinating memoir.

This guide runs a very close second to Christopher Baker's Cuba: Moon Travel Handbook.  It is extremely informative and the basic information section is one of the best.<br />The central part of the guide (accommodations, restaurants and sights) is one of the most accurate on the market (though McAuslan's comments are very terse).  The maps were easy to use and above the average found in most other Cuban guides.  This guide has one of the best bibliographies on Cuba found in a guide book today, but sadly lacks any mention of notable films that can be viewed to gain an appreciation of this country.<br />On the downside, the index DID NOT list hotels or restaurants and this required that you flip through the section until you find the listing you wanted (especially a hassle in Havana).  There were NO email or Internet addresses to speak of  (especially useful for the hotels) even though the published date is 2000.  That is disappointing considering that almost every hotel listed in this book is, and have been using cyberspace for the past few years.<br />The strength of this guide, as with most Rough Guides, is its first hand knowledge that is geared for the budgeted adventure traveler.  The selections that list accommodations and restaurants, included  budget hostels and eateries that are often disregarded in other guides.  A trademark to Rough Guides is the placement of  the history, culture, people, etc. at the end of the guide instead of at the beginning.<br />Over all this is a VERY GOOD, and informative guide, that I strongly recommend.  Only slightly better is &quot;Cuba&quot; by Christopher Baker's (Moon Travel Guides, [see review]) and just a notch behind is &quot;Cuba&quot; by David Stanley  (Lonely Planet [see review]).

Fodor's Cuba is billed on the back cover as providing &quot;simply perfect trips.&quot; In truth this is a VERY basic simple guide that needs much improvement to compete in the Cuban travel guide race.<br />I found this guide far too barren and difficult to use. The entire history of Cuba for the last fifty years gets only eight scant paragraphs in a section call &quot;The Way to Revolution&quot; and &quot;Today and Tomorrow!&quot;  The index DID NOT list hotels or restaurants and this required that I to flip through the sections  until I found the listing I wanted information on (especially a hassle in Havana).  There were only 11 maps and they need improvement.<br />Also, instead of giving the general price of lodging or restaurant meals along with the listing, they give a code (listed in the front of the book) next to the site description ($$$ which = $100 to $150) but, then, that is for a double occupancy in high season.  The guide listed my hotel, Ambos Mundos, as $$$ when I paid only $65 for a single in high season, thus the guide was not much help to me on this regard either. There were no email or Internet addresses (especially for the hotels) to speak of, even though the date of publication is 2000.  Yet when I checked, almost every hotel had email whereby you could make reservations and get additional information and some had there own web page.  Finally, another irritant, which has become common in Fodor's guides, is the intrusive color pages of paid advertisements for various products or service, which I immediately tore out and tossed.  I am under the conviction that I have already paid once for the book and this is double indemnity.<br />On the positive side I found the Havana Dining and Lodging Map very useful; as I did the short list of &quot;must experience&quot; while in Cuba, called 'Fodor's Choice'.

The Ritz-Carlton Dining Room, Buckhead scored 28, 27, 27 . . .  the highest  score in Atlanta.  The remaining 449 restaurants in this guide have a flagship to follow.

Two small maps are what you get to cover 450 restaurants, actually these two maps only list the 40 most popular restaurants.  Another area that may disappoint some is the terse 50 word description for each restaurant, a brief narrative that fails to mention any outstanding restaurant dishes.  If you are looking for a fuller restaurant description, I commend the &quot;Atlanta Restaurant Guide&quot; by Christiane Lauterbach.

We all &quot;see through a glass, darkly&quot; and our understanding is affected by our viewpoint.  Perspective is the capacity to view and understand things in their true relation or relative importance to the world we live in.<br />In North America, when we look at the text of the Bible, we do so from our own &quot;perspective&quot;.  Each reading of the text is read from our own bias.  Often we are unaware of the excess luggage that we are toting with us.  We have integrated into our consciousness the concepts of capitalistic consumerism, democracy, individualism and freedom, just to name a few.<br />Trade places with a poor, oppressed African woman, living with six hungry children, hoping for any messiah to show up; walk with her and consider how she would respond to the teaching of the Bible you read.  How then would you understand a saying out of Ecclesiastes like &quot;There is a time for everything... a time to mourn and a time to dance&quot; or if she read &quot;If you see the poor oppressed in a district, and justice and rights denied, do not be surprised at such things&quot;?<br />What the editors of &quot;Return to Babel&quot;, have collected over six years, is different perspectives from fifteen various authors, all from the non-western world.  Latin American, African and Asian contributors write a threefold commentary on five Old Testament texts (Genesis 11, Exodus 20, Psalm 23, Eccl. 3 and Isaiah 52) and five New Testament texts (Matthew 5, John 1, Acts2, I Cor. 15, and Rev. 21).  The majority of these writers, though educated, are not academic theologians.  They are individuals from every walk of life, who encounter daily suffering and oppression and have committed themselves to social change.<br />To  read outside my own perspective is not only challenging, but also unsettling.  The stories, proverbs, cultural insights of familiar Biblical text never cease to engage me.  The African's read Psalm 23, &quot;The Lord is my shepherd&quot; , from a viewpoint where the people live daily with their domestic animals, caring for them often at a great expense to themselves.  To hear their perspective, their commentary, on this Psalm is refreshing.  Yearly, our world is growing smaller and the panorama by which we look upon other cultures  needs to be deep and wide.

Dr. Walter Brueggemann is the Albert Einstein of Old Testament Theology.  As Einstein could look deep into the expanse of space and extrapolate insight and meaning so too does Brueggemann peer at the biblical text of the Old Testament prophets and give us social, political and spiritual insight.  &quot;Text that Linger, Words that Explode&quot;  is the second in a trilogy of academic and ecclesiastical essays (&quot;Deep Memory, Exuberant Hope&quot; and &quot;The Covenanted Self&quot;).<br />Great interpretation of Biblical prophetic text can be dangerous and subversive to the existing status quo of society.  That is why great interpretation of Biblical prophetic text is so rare today; as in the word's of many church leaders and the contemporary Jamaican prophet, Bob Marley,  &quot;don't rock'a my boat.&quot;  Brueggemann has never quailed when speaking or writing, nor does he with these ancient texts.  He finds power in the reading of the prophetic writings and brings us a contemporary application that will cause many  readers to revive their image of God and reconsider their place in His world.<br />Make no mistake, this is not a spiritual feel good book, rather it is solid Biblical hermeneutics. In &quot;Text that Linger, Words that Explode,&quot; Dr. Walter Brueggemann expounds on various scriptural text, mainly from the books of Isaiah and Jeremiah.  Though every chapter has value, they will be uneven in interest according to your focus.  If you are an Old Testament student or scholar then his promulgation regarding canon, authorship and historical context will appeal to you.  If you are a teacher, a preacher or a lay person interested in studying the Old Testament prophets, then certain chapters will give you wonderful new insight more than other.  Regardless, both Isaiah and Jeremiah and their expos&eacute;s of the people of Judaism are given new life by Dr. Brueggemann.  Recommended	2001-01-22

Blacks dine with Whites, overalls sit across from suits.  When it comes to excellent barbecue, well then, as one life long barbecue diner said, &quot;it don't make no difference, everybody chew'n down good barbecue is equal&quot;.  Though dated, &quot;Barbecue on My Mind&quot; is still reliable, very useful and the best true guide we have in Georgia.<br />So far, of the five barbeque places I visited, using the books listings, one was excellent (The Pig, Waycross, may have the best ribs in Georgia), three were very good and one fair.  In the competitive restaurant world 70% of restaurants go out of business in the first three years.  However, I gather that most of  these &quot;Thirty Best Barbecue&quot;  places still exist today because, they not only are outstanding, but have proven themselves over time.<br />Trey Pope has a wonderful &quot;down home&quot; style of writing that you will enjoy.  He calls `em like he sees `em.  If the building is a &quot;hole in the wall&quot; (many of the best barbecue joints are) then he'll tell ya.  He selected from hundreds of barbecue places and got down to these thirty by visiting them and ordering pork barbecue, Brunswick stew and pork ribs.<br />On the down side the map in this book is a joke... really bad.  You have to know Georgia or have a good map to find the place outside of your area, like Zeb's Barbecue in Danielsville, where?  But for excellent barbecue some of us die-hard enthusiasts will get the truck, load up the dog and put &quot;the peddle to the metal&quot; and make that drive.  Recommended.	2001-01-19

This is not a traditional commentary on Genesis. Lawrence Boadt first  introduces you to Genesis, then separate the 50 chapters of Genesis into four parts:<br />Part One: The World and Its Beginning (Chapters 1-11) Part Two:  Abraham - Chosen by God (Chapters 12-25) Part Three: Isaac and Jacob (Chapters 24-36) Part Four:  Joseph and His Brothers (Chapters 37-50)<br />Next he explains each section briefly, so you will understand how the parts fit together as a whole and why it is the first book of the Bible.  Finally, he takes you through 12 \\"Themes and Images\\" in Genesis (Apple, Eden, Serpent, Flood etc.) and 16 major characters of Genesis (Adam, Eve, Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, etc.).  The uniqueness of this book is how Boadt references the literary tradition found in each theme and each major character.  For example, he notes that Noah's figure appears  in Chaucer's `Miller's Tale', in Hardy's `Far from the Madding Crowd', in Melville's `The Confidence Man', and again in Twain's `The Mysterious Stranger', etc. etc.  Those  that are literature buffs and/or speakers will find this ruminating and insightful.  This alone is worth the purchase of the book.<br />For many who believe the Bible must be read literally, Lawrence Boadt will be difficult to read.  Boadt sees the narratives in Genesis 1-11 as \\"Myths.\\"  He goes on to explain that myths are \\"a story using traditional motifs and themes\\".  Boadt sees the creation passage, the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve, Noah etc. as myths that the Hebrews used to offer a theological explanation of events and our relation to God.  Genesis: The Book of Beginnings' is a book that can enhance traditional commentaries on Genesis, especially with Boadt's literary contributions to themes and characters which bring contemporary relevancy to otherwise historic text.

I am an unabashed afficionado of barbecue, and in Georgia, barbecue is chopped pork, sliced pork,  pulled pork and pork ribs;  all cooked over hardwood coals.  Cooking this way takes time and extra effort (low and slow), but by-golly, by the time the meat is done you have real barbecue, not some chain food restaurant that has a slick menu misnaming what they serve as barbecue.<br />&quot;Genuine&quot; barbecue &quot;places&quot; are unique in that they are often found in shacks, holes in the wall, road stands or occasionally big money restaurant buildings.  But be suspicious of the big fancy restaurant looking places; chances are the old  barbecue master probably died years ago and some `entrepre-manure' grabbed the first person who came in and said &quot;I know how to cook barbecue, you parboil it and smother it with bottled sauce.&quot; &quot;You're hired.&quot;  Lord have mercy . . .<br />Steve Storey, in the introduction, calls this book a directory, not a guide as the title states.  It is a directory, kinda like the Yellow Pages is a directory.  In this directory Steve Storey makes NO qualitative judgement on any of the barbecue served.  At least he tells you that in the introduction.  He states, &quot;we decided to keep our opinions to ourselves and let you be the judge.&quot;.  What this means is that out of hundreds of listings you are left on your own to select a place to visit, and hope you get lucky and pick a good one.  So far I have found one true barbecue place (The Pig, Waycross, GA) and I have visited, and thus eaten, a lot of mediocre to fair barbecue.  One place I visited in Dillard, Georgia  had been sold and was being run by a Greek.  Well, at least the salads were good.<br />Oh, yes I must not forget to tell you that finding the places listed in this &quot;directory&quot; can be down right challenging.  Let me explain, first you pick a county, then you find the county on the  master map, your county will have a region number, whereby you go to the region map and find the county`s name, whereby you will find a group of numbers representing barbecue places (Atlanta/Fulton County has about 50 numbers).  Finally you randomly pick a number from the county's list and go find that listing somewhere in the book  (not by page).  When you get there you will get rough directions on how to find the place.  Good Luck.  Make sure you call before you go.  Three out of the five numbers in Atlanta that I called were out of business.<br />IF you want a true &quot;guide&quot; on barbecue in Georgia get &quot;Barbecue on My Mind&quot; by Trey Pope (see my review).  Though it is dated (1991) it does list the 30 best places for barbecue in Georgia.

You can read the other reviews and they are scathing, but accurate.  I live in Georgia and use I-75 to go south to Florida and, yes, every exit number in Georgia is incorrect and with a publishing date of May 1999,and a three-year-old state announcement that in February 2000 all the exit numbers would be changed, this is a significant faux pas on the part of the author.  And, with all the coupons and advertisements in this book, it does feel like one of those motel discount publications that you can pick up at truck stops and gas stations in every state.  The print quality, paper and really small font size (pica 6!) are a significant distraction, but this is not all the author's fault, there was a publisher involved in this too, eh?<br />So what is there about this book that is redeeming.  What does Christine Marks have that you can't find in a USA Guide, or State Guide?  I was impressed by information on various locations, communities and counties.  Christine Marks did a lot of digging to come up with some very interesting and provocative vignettes.  County information, cultural insights, historic blurbs that were NOT in my other state travel guides.  I am a Bar-B-Que afficionado and I did not know that in October, in Vienna, GA, there is The Georgia Barbecue Championship!  Or that Fried Green Tomatoes are found at the Whistle Stop Caf&eacute; in Juliette, Ga.  I like these tidbits of information and this, and this alone, makes the book valuable to keep.  I also like the concept of the guide following a route, providing information with maps that break the journey down in bite size portions.  These two aspects, especially the unique information, makes me keep this book.  It is my hope that Christine Marks pushes this forward, gets the right exit numbers, larger readable fonts, better paper and printing, and dumps the blatant trashy advertising.  With the number of cars that roam up and down this huge stretch of highway there is a market for good guides. Conditionally recommended.tionally recommended.	2001-01-10

This collection has four books (Annunciation, Last Supper, Crucifixion, Descent) which will be a treasure to all those who love great art, and especially those attracted to religious art.  Each book is beautifully bound in its own brilliant metallic color: gold, silver, bronze and copper.  The unique size and color of the books make this set aesthetically pleasing.  It is a wonderful collection to display on any shelf.  The prints, more than 100 in each book, are of superb quality.  Phaidon, the publisher, is recognized for excellence and elegance in all their printing.  There is scant text; each book has a New Testament scriptural preface, then a brief caption accompanies each image.<br />As the titles project, a central event in Christ's life is elucidated by the world's best artistic Masters; each brings their own commentary to the selected Christological theme.  Most enjoyable, and educational, is the progression through time, starting with early art pieces and finishing with contemporary masters.  From beginning to end, each book is a wonderful journey through time.<br />&quot;Descent&quot; dramatizes the removal of Christ's corpse from the cross.  Hope has ended in despair and the darkest hour now was upon those waiting at the foot of the cross: Joseph of Arimathea, Nicodemus, Mary Magdalene, Mary - mother of Jesus, and John the Beloved.  The details of His death begin.  The corpse must come down, and along with the dreams of His followers, be buried.  No angels, no auras of light, no evidence of divine intervention is found in these 100 plus images.  Rather, each artist throughout the ages illuminates the nightmarish reality of the demise of Christ.  When you view `Descent' you will notice that there is a period of history, starting around the Renaissance to the end of the 17th Century, when the Masters grasped this moment and prolifically paint the removal of Christ from the cross.  Outstanding paintings from the time of Sodoma (c.1505) through Jean-Baptiste Jouvenet (c.1697) fill the largest portion of this book.  Having gone through these four volumes it is my hope that Phaidon will continue this collection.  To stop now and not give us the burial, resurrection and the ascension would be a great disappointment.  This is a collection that I will treasure.  The quality of binding, paper, color reproduction and selection of prints is superb.  Highly recommended.te Jouvenet (c.1697) fill the largest portion of this book.

This is a must for your kitchen cookbook library.  &quot;Saved by Soup&quot; should not be confused as a seasonal cookbook. I love cooking soup during the blustery winter days, and from fall to spring this compact cookbook seldom goes back into the rack.  The summer section in this book is also very good.  You must try Judith Barrett's `Best Gazpacho' and `Chilled Corn Vichyssoise' summer recipes.<br />My girlfriend is delighted over this cookbook, and she does not often cook.  She jumped in and made some very good soups -- try `Real Gumbo with Okra and Chicken' . Together, we have yet to find a recipe that is not very pleasing.  Many, like the `Ligurian Minestrone', are excellent (this is the best Minestrone we have eaten).<br />Now, even though these recipes are easy to follow, and the great color photographs make them more enticing, they are not the &quot;20 minute&quot; type.  Many of them call for fresh herbs and fresh ingredients, but don't despair, Barrett will reward you with outstanding taste almost every time and I guarantee that your guests will clamor for more.  OK, with that having been said, don't forget that most of her recipes are low fat -- less than 3 grams of fat per serving.  Wow, health and great flavor too!  Highly Recommended	2000-12-29

Starting with chosen stories that reflect the ethos of Mexico.  Followed by stories about places and activities that fellow travelers have found worthwhile. The third part is comprised of stories by people who have made a special connection between their lives and interests and the people and places in Mexico.  Fourth is the struggle and challenges facing the country and concluding with &quot;The Last Word&quot; to remind you of the book as a whole.

Unlike &quot;Annunciation&quot; and &quot;Last Supper&quot;, two other books in this Phaidon set, where you can see the changes in the artist interpretation of the event through the ages, the image of the painful and gruesome death of Christ in &quot;Crucifixion&quot; changes little over the 1600 years covered here.  The inhumanity of the crucifixion travels vividly through the ages;  from  the earliest picture,  painted by the monk Rabbula in Mesopotamia (586 AD) to Lovis Corinth's (1907) and Stanley Spenser's (1958) disturbing images.  You can not come away from viewing this book without realizing the pain and suffering that occurred on the cross.

This is the true poignant story of a young woman and her struggles to make dreams come true.  Katherine Arnoldi, raped and left with a baby at 17, was forced, out of necessity, to take a dead-end, hazardous factory job.  Her dysfunctional family tried to crush her and her dreams; her boyfriend turns on her and beats her.  Yet through all of her pain and despair she does not give up.  Arnoldi shows, in her comic book form, that if you hold on and pursue your dreams that you can overcome the ugliest past.  This book is a  treasure.  It is simply great.  And because it is so good you will want to pass it on.  This is a book that can speak to the broken hearts of hundreds, if not thousands, of struggling teenagers, single moms or not.  Her enduring love for her child, her courage to change her circumstances, a little luck, and a few kind people, transforms what could be a disheartening story into an inspiration.	2000-12-23

From the classical Leonardo da Vinci  to the contemporary Salvador Dali the final meeting of Christ and His twelve disciples is recorded by the world's best artist.  Andy Warhol, best known for his commercial art, produced more than twenty large scale works of the last supper,  and the two selected by Phaidon for this text show the mixed feelings that Warhol had towards the Catholic Church - though he regularly attended he would not take the Eucharist.  &quot;Last Supper&quot; is a wonderful book, in a fantastic collection, at a very reasonable price.

Nothing competes with a dog's greeting when you come home.  A wagging tail, a wet tongue on your hand and the occasional vocalization of joy all combine to make the world a better place.  For me the two AKC groupings of herding and working dogs are my favorite and &quot;Ranch Dog&quot; is an accolade to those amazing dogs whose lives are defined by the challenge of ranch work.<br />Ranch dogs, by nature, are full of energy and enthusiasm, but Murdock fails to capture that in her writing.  Her writings of the dogs and the people on various ranches, while interesting, are uninspiring.  I wanted more stories about the feats of these dogs.  I wanted to know more about the various breeds that the ranchers used (the Catahoula, the Heeler, the Border Collie, the Australian Shepherd, etc.).  I wanted to know more about the training of these unique animals.  Murdock's writing was missing a lot. However, Nancy Burgess's black and white photos capture the faithful, industrious, intelligent and affectionate soul of these dogs and the poems about dogs from various authors are delightful.

When I pass these churches I often slow down and gaze at the uniquely dressed women coming out the doors -- all dressed to the nines, and most of them are wearing their crowns.  For the African-American churchgoing women hats are not mere fashion statements they are integral expression of faith and cultural identity.  The Apostle Paul should be thanked daily by all milliners for Paul furthered the fashion of wearing hats to church by writing &quot;Every woman who prays or prophecies with her head unveiled dishonors her head&quot; (I Cor. 11:5).<br />The hats in this book are as unique and alive as the women that wear them.  Michael Cunningham, using black &amp; white film, has beautifully captured the panache that these women and their chapeau's express.  Just as every hat in this book has a woman, so every woman in this book has a story about her hats, and I think you will love their stories.  This is a refreshing, original book that is not only is captivating but anthropological educational.  Highly recommended.	2000-12-16

And these Rights only have meaning if government officials can be forced to obey them. Only  the courts have the ultimate power of enforcement and thus the Supreme Court of the United States of America has the ultimate power.  This excellent book helps all Americans to understand how this Court balances the legitimate powers of government officials and the rights of the people.  Highly Recommended.s Court balances the legitimate powers of government officials and the rights of the people.  Highly Recommended.	2000-12-14

Though this small paperback (100 recipes) has some interesting aspects about it, overall it doesn't stack-up well.<br />After trying various recipes, such as Chicken Pozole and Chicken Palermo, my guest and I came away unimpressed. The dishes were generous but the flavor in most recipes was just fair to good.  There are no photos or drawings and the first 25 pages of the book deal with the 150 years of the Hanover Co-Op.  The strength of \\"Co-Op Cookbook\\" is in the cooking time (30 minutes or less), the easy to follow instructions and most of the recipes ingredients are those that you would normally have..  This cookbook doesn't have the verve of the great cookbooks available today. Conditionally Recommended.	2000-12-13

Excellent maps, great charts and clearly written text makes  &quot;The North Carolina Atlas&quot; a book that needs to be on the shelf of every public library and in the hands of all North Carolina devotes.  Over the last century North Carolina has transformed itself from a struggling southern state to one of the fastest growing economies in the U.S.  &quot;The North Carolina Atlas&quot; provides a definitive analysis of the changes that have created this wonderful state.<br />History, population, urbanization, and economy are transforming forces that molded North Carolina into what it is today.  Each of these sections are clearly laid out so that the reader can make a critical analysis of the change and form an assessment of the coming changes that the future may bring.<br />Especially interesting are the sections that deal with quality of life in North Carolina.  Crime, education, health care, water and air quality, cultural arts and outdoor recreation are profiled and supported by scores of maps, charts and diagrams.

He has captured  faces of children, who through some cruel fate have reaped only hardship in short time on earth.  Yet, despite conditions of despair, some of these children manage a smile, a look of hope, and an attitude that defies their situation.<br />No words or captions are attached to the photos, rather Salgado lets each child convey their own message to you through their portrait.  He brilliantly uses black &amp; white film to heighten the intensity of each face, a face that looks you right in the eye and I swear, talks to you.  If you want to know more about each photo an appendix is provide with date/place.<br />This is book that will stay in my collection, as it should, it is brilliantly done!  &quot;Children, Refugees and Migrants&quot; desires to be prominently displayed in my house and it will be.

The &quot;need to know&quot; what kind of bird you are seeing, no matter where you are in the USA, is the reason to purchase  this useful guide.  Excellent photographs (more than 2,000) and succinct descriptions make bird identification easier.  Though not the best book for beginners (I highly recommend &quot;Stokes Beginner's Guide to Birds&quot;) &quot;Focus Guide to the Birds of North America&quot; is a very good book for intermediate and advanced birders.  Kaufman organizes his book by placing the birds in groups according to their shape rather than color.  Thus, using his methodology, identifying a bird was slower than other bird guides I have used.  Nonetheless, this would be a welcome gift any birders library.  Recommended.	2000-11-26

I am unabashedly a bird lover.  Having birds flock to my feeder is among my top simples pleasures of life.  The ability to recognize the variety of birds is very rewarding.  &quot;Stokes Beginner's Guide to Birds&quot; is the best basic bird guide book I yet used to quickly identify birds (Eastern Region).  The pressing argument among bird guides is whether you identify birds by size/shape or by color (for a good guide that uses size/shapes see &quot;Focus Guide to the Birds of North America by Kenn Kaufman).  Stokes has used plumage color to identify over 100 species.  His full color photographs (separate images of male / female) are wonderful.  I especially like the tips for attracting birds and the condensed information on habitats and population change.  This would be a great gift for a youngster that is inclined towards watching birds and I am sure that any adult would be equally pleased.  Highly recommended.	2000-11-25

One of the best photo journals of the Flying Tiger available in print.  Larry Pistole has amassed the largest collection of original Flying Tigers artifacts in the world and with this outstanding book he shares them with us.  Hundreds of black and white photos chronicle the uniqueness and bravery of these little known American fighting men.  The history through text is scant but the excellent photos and comment make up for it.<br />American volunteer pilots were recruited by Colonel Claire L. Chennault to fight the Japanese in Burma (Myanmar) and China during 1940-42. Flying in battered planes (P-40 Tomahawks) and facing chronic shortages of fuel, parts, and pilots, this small company of warriors nevertheless scored victory after victory over the far larger and better equipped Japanese air force. Using surprise, mobility and unorthodox tactics they out flew the Japanese and brought considerable damage on Japan's air and ground forces.<br />These men, two years before Pearl Harbor, were hired by China to train Chinese pilots and help China in her fight against Japan.  Their heroic bravery was not given its due, mainly because they were outside of the system, they were &quot;volunteers,&quot; but their story seen here in black and white photos speaks volumes of the characters of these few men.  Recommended for all of those interested in the Flying Tigers and W.W.II (especially in the Pacific theater).	2000-11-20

This book should be re-titled &quot;Dour Sayings for Marriage and Divorce.&quot;  When I passed the book to my girlfriend she would not even look through it.  Her terse comment, &quot;There is no JOY! in divorce&quot; probably sums up how most who see the book's title react.  This is a book of somber and dreary proverbs that commiserate the dark side of marriage.  Adages, such as Leonardo DaVinci quote, &quot;Marriage is like putting one's hand into a bag of snakes on the chance of drawing out an eel&quot; typify the selection of quotes.

From relative prosperity  prior 1990 to economic disaster.  How would this affect the life and spirit of Cubans?  This is what Adam Kufeld want to know, and see, thus in 1991, after a 15 year absence,  he returned to Cuba with camera in hand and captured over 100 intriguing and beautiful photographs of today's Cuba.  He has framed a kaleidoscope of life, children, old people, farm workers, doctors, sugar cane and tobacco, working men, beautiful women and of course Castro.  The writing by Tom Miller lacks the inspiration and connection to Cuba of  Kufeld's photos, but then who buys a coffee table book for the writing?  Recommended.	2000-11-06

If you are one of the 7 million people who will take a cruise in the coming year, then Theodore W. Scull's book, &quot;100 Best Cruise Vacations,&quot; will be a good value.  There are thousands of cruises to select from with various destinations, itineraries, ship size and cost.<br />So which ones are the best value for the money?  Which cruises have the best food, personnel, programs, accommodations, design and layouts? In Scull's book, you are introduced to his selection of the world's best.<br />From small ships plying the Amazon or Yangzee Rivers to the behemoth liners of 110,000 tons and 2,600 passengers, Scull provides a comprehensive description of the 100 best cruises by explaining the ship and the itinerary in straightforward commentary.  A side bar with pertinent information breakdown accompanies each cruise description. I especially like the thorough contact information provided to get additional information for each cruise, which includes website addresses.<br />I was disappointed that there were no maps detailing where the cruise travels geographically. Likewise, I was annoyed with the absence of any tables or lists that would break down cruises versus their cost.  Thus, if you are looking for a five-day  cruise for less than $1,000, you must wade through all 100 listings and their cross reference to a dollar sign icon, which designates five levels of cost ranging from $100 to $600 per day (including accommodations, per person, double occupancy, outside cabin), then guess the cruise cost.<br />Scull, a travel writer, has given us a useful resource with which to make a better qualitative choice when deciding on a vacation cruise.  Worth the small investment when considering the financial outlay that any cruise these days will be.  Recommended.	2000-11-06

Paris is listed as the greatest city of the world and the Eiffel Tower is still its most famous site.  If there is a weakness it is the lack of references to follow up your &quot;must go&quot; urge to go to a destination.

Michael Mandel, economics editor at Business Week, has written another economic  apocalyptic book, albeit well documented and educational.  He writes, as do most with financial backgrounds, in a dry manner (and includes a few charts and graphs often associated with financial writing).  His basic premise is that &quot;The U.S. has a New Economy in which the business cycle has been replaced by the tech cycle,&quot;  and we do not know how to comprehend this new cycle, thus we will be bitten on the butt because of our own ignorance.<br />Mandel goes on to underscore that since none of us have lived through a &quot;tech bust&quot; we do not know what to expect. While he really doesn't either, he does give us his prognosis of what could happen during this coming tech melt down.  He states that,  &quot;The downturn is likely to come, as violent and destructive as a hurricane,&quot; and that it will bring &quot;devastating damage&quot; to those with jobs in the IT market.  The coming internet depression will bring a significant fall in household prosperity, and it will bring a loss of wealth, as the stock market tanks, especially for those with &quot;new economy stocks.&quot;<br />One interesting evaluation Mandel makes is how the U.S. rose to dominate the world market in technology and innovation.  He answers the question &quot;Why did the New Economy start in the U.S. rather than Japan or Europe?&quot; by pointing out three important strengths:  First, the U.S. had early deregulation and a very flexible labor market.  Second, we developed a system capable of financing innovative businesses. Third, we had educated workers who were willing to take risk and step outside the safe confines of the protection of large corporations.  Good insight.<br />Mandel writes about the coming depression but refuses to state when, how long and how deep. At the end of his chapter &quot;The Next Depression,&quot; Mandel writes the caveat, &quot;Anyone who puts too much trust in economic forecast runs the risk of finding out that the forecast will be as wrong,&quot; so from Mandel we get nothing specific, just the warning that bad times are a-coming.  It reminds me of my past interludes with apocalyptic Christians who storm the streets crying, &quot;Jesus is Coming, Jesus is Coming soon!&quot; Jesus has been coming for the past 2000 years but we are still here.

Cuba is a visual delight and, with more than 100 color photographs, David Alan Harvey shows you why.  Combine Harvey's images of life in Cuba with Elizabeth Newhouse's terse yet thorough style and you have a perfect match for this book.<br />I have recently visited Cuba and found that Harvey's photography captures the essence of Cuba's greatest resource - the Cuban people.  Strong and proud, though materialistically impoverished, the people of Cuba are rich in relationships, music, dance and defiance. Harvey, a photographer for National Geographic, has spent the last 20 years photographing Latin America and is skilled at capturing people in their everyday environment.<br />Newhouse's chapter on the turbulent history of Cuba is excellent.  Without pulling any punches about the glaring deficiencies of Castro's totalitarian Communist government, she writes with objectivity about life in Cuba and she is able to show, with sensitivity to the culture,  the strength found in the people of Cuba.  &quot;But above all Cuba is music,&quot; Newhouse writes, &quot;expressing Cubans' intense joy in life, sensuality and machismo. Garcia Marquez calls Cuba 'the most dance oriented society on earth. And that Fidel Castro is the only Cuban who can't dance, should have warned the people about him from the start.'&quot;<br />The downside of this book is the publisher/printer's very poor reproduction of Harvey's photos.  Almost all of the photos are too dark and thus rob the effect that David Harvey intended.  Considering that National Geographic is distinguished for its stunning photography, I called the publisher and asked about this blunder and was told that the printer, not the photographer, was culpable.<br />This book celebrates the passion, color and sensuality of the Cuban people, and, even with the gray backdrop of Communism framing their existence, and the deficiency in the photo reproduction, the Cubans are still able to shine through the gloom and darkness.

Love to Mother was an action, not an emotion.  Twice I was with Mother Teresa in Calcutta, India.  Twice I was in the presence of greatness.<br />She once took my hands in hers and said to me, &quot;Love is giving, so go love. Don't use words where your hands can speak better.&quot; Mother was love.  Her two gnarled hands stretched out to bring selfless, pure love to the orphan, the dying, the despised. At the entrance to the leprosarium there is a notice which reads: &quot;Where there is great love, there are always great miracles.&quot;<br />This small, 116-page booklet cannot capture the immensity of Mother's love for all humanity, but it can give you a sampling of her spirit.  The 35 black-and-white photos of Mother Teresa along with her words of wisdom make this an excellent gift or just a book to put in your pocket and read daily, while commuting, waiting in a line, or somewhere in our love-starved world.

Each region is extremely well laid out and the standard information for each town or city (accommodations, eating places, sites to see, etc.) is  accurate and reliable.  &quot;The Context&quot; section is good reading - it handles history, Inca life, music, books, ecology, indigenous rights and the destruction of the rain forest.<br />Good Guides should have good maps and lots of them.  Peru: The Rough Guide does not disappoint - 59 well-drawn maps give you a solid initial orientation.  Outstanding are the multiple sidebars chocked full of meaningful - and practical - information about all aspects of the culture you're visiting, which is the hallmark of Rough Guides.<br />Not helpful was the accommodation pricing codes, 1-8 each representing a price range.  More useful is the price grouping used for restaurants: Budget, Moderate and Expensive. Overall, you can't go wrong with this top drawer guide.  Highly Recommended.	2000-10-11

All turned out great (and since I don't cook when I have to bachelor it, that's saying something!).<br />Though most people do not buy a cookbook to read, I was impressed by the Johnsons' inclusions of cultural and historical backgrounds found on most recipes pages...they were wonderful additions and diversions.<br />What, then, makes an excellent cookbook?  First, great recipes.  Recipes that are: a) begging to be tried, b) well laid out with a readable size print, c) simple and mixable with the normal ingredients and equipment and d)prepared in a short period of time.  Second, when done your results are praiseworthy and your guests ask for second helpings.  Third, a good sprinkling of color  photos.<br /> American Home Cooking has given us all but the last.

In 1995 he was awarded the Cervantes Prize, the most distinguished literary honor in the Spanish-speaking world.  Born in Peru in 1936, he studied in Madrid and later lived in Paris.<br />&quot;The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta&quot; is an insightful portrait into the life of an obscure revolutionary. Specifically, the Communist revolutionaries who, for decades, agitated and disrupted Peru and most of South America. The ways and why of their actions are portrayed in this fictional account of the men and women who acted in a desperate attempt to overthrow the oppression of the bourgeois and imperialist revolutionaries.<br />Author Moario Vargas Llosa paints a psychological portrait of a struggling common Peruvian who seeks to right the injustice in his land. Llosa, through Alejandro Mayta, responds to questions such as, &quot;How much injustice does it take? How much misery and grime much you watch as the wealthy rape your land and use the people as disposable resources? How much before the indignation ignites in the flame of a revolution?&quot;<br />Though provocative, &quot;The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta&quot; is not an engaging read.  For me, it took deliberation and dedication to plow through it.  I was interested because of my current work with the poor in Peru and my desire to read Mario Vargas Llosa; however, I was often tempted to set it down and not resume it.

Her well documented research is a scathing denouncement on a government that purposely remains indifferent to the plight of the peasants.  She has done all those who are interested in economic justice in the Dominican Republic a great service.<br />Yet, for all of her critical analysis she fails to deal with four critical aspect that keep people in poverty: lack of education, transportation [paved roads included], electricity and tele-communication.

For the student of Indian architecture, history or royalty, &quot;The Royal Palaces of India&quot; will be a treasure.  With more than 250  illustrations (206 are in color), this book brings one's imagination alive  and lets your mind wander through the gates of these gorgeous palaces and  forts.<br />Authors Michell and Martinelli explain in a somewhat academic way  how kings, both Hindu and Muslim, held their courts.<br />The power, perks  and privileges that accompanied the royalty are dimly reflected in the  opulent architecture that shaped both the places and the royal life.  It is  hard to imagine, even with the excellent help this book provides, what the  glory and splendor of these  kingdoms must have been like.<br />The monarchs  were &quot;not merely enhanced by divinities, they were ritually empowered  by gods and goddesses&quot; and these palaces reflect, as do the cathedrals  of Europe, a journey past the mundane existence of morality. Many who have  visited India have seen the celebrated Taj Mahal, but it is a tomb to the  wife of the great mongol ruler Shah Jahan. Now, if this is was his wife's  tomb, what do you think his palace looked like?  This is an engaging and  enlightening book.  Recommended.	2000-08-15

This is a stimulating and provocative  book written by a Vietnamese Buddhist monk who attempts, in good will and  world peace, to bring Buddhism and Christianity into a harmonious  relation.<br />Thich Nhat Hanh hopes that, if people would look at what these  faiths have in common, there could be tolerance and acceptance of each  other.<br />To bring harmony to these two religious belief systems is no small  task, and only someone with a large amount of both faith and love would  attempt this.  Christianity and Buddhism are diametrically opposed: Faith  in God. Faith in Self.  So acknowledges Hanh when he says, &quot;In  Christianity faith means trust in God, in Buddhism faith means confidence  in our ability to wake up our deepest capacity.&quot;<br />But then, Hanh has  a large amount of both faith and love, and he is no ordinary Vietnamese  Buddhist monk.  He has been engaged in peace works for almost 40 years. In  1966 he came to the United States and met with Secretary of Defense Robert  McNamara to protest the war in Vietnam.  Pushing forward in his belief in  peace, he went on to develop The Fellowship of Reconciliation, an  interfaith peace organization, with members like Martin Luther King, Jr.,  Thomas Merton and Father Daniel Berrigan.  Through his life, and with the  contact of many strong Christians, he converted to dualism of  beliefs.<br />&quot;On the altar in my hermitage in France are images of  Buddha and Jesus and I touch them both,&quot; Hanh says. He believes that  ignorance brings bondage and disparity, but understanding of another brings  liberation and &quot;unlocks the door to the prison of  suffering.&quot;<br />He acknowledges as a Buddhist monk that Buddhism does  not hold to the belief of God and he recognizes that Christianity is not a  religion of believers in God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.  And in his own,  very unique way, he believes too.  Especially important to him is Jesus  Christ and the Holy Spirit.  Hanh describes his understanding of Jesus  Christ as &quot;one through whom the divine was manifested&quot; but not  the only expression of the divine, &quot;it is said that there are 84,000  Dharma doors, doors of teaching . . .  it would not be very Buddhist to say  that yours is the only door.&quot;<br />In addition to highlighting concepts  of Buddhism, Hanh offers Christians a new prism, a new angle from which to  look at Jesus, the Holy Spirit, their Christian faith and those of other  faiths. He says,  &quot;If you satisfy yourself only with praising the name  of Jesus, it is not practicing the life of Jesus. We must practice living  deeply, lovingly and acting with charity if we wish to truly honor  Jesus.&quot;<br />Living Buddha. Living Christ is not a primer on either  Buddhism or Christianity but rather a compilation of the two by a Buddhist  monk who understands where these two great religions can touch and  sometimes even dance. Though Hanh never gets the oil-and-water to mix, he  does get them to complement each other.  This in itself is a great  achievement.  An index would have greatly assisted in making this a good  reference book as well. Recommended.ly Spirit.

In the ancient city of Delhi there are thousands, perhaps  tens of thousands of Djinns who serve to testify of both Delhi's glorious  and hideous  past.  Delhi is one of the oldest cities in the world and for  the past 3000 years has reincarnated itself.  To uncover its culture and  civilization takes the care and commitment of an archaeologist, or a  journalist.  William Dalrymple is an award winning journalist.  In 1994 he  was awarded the Cook Travel Award.  In City of Djinns, William Dalrymple  paints a vibrant portrait of Delhi past and present with colorful words.  His journalistic research and unique writing skills call forth the spirits  of both times past and present, illuminating for the reader the incredible  history of this city.<br />His humorous and provocative description of how he  spent a year in Delhi, with his artistic wife Olivia, while he researched  the city's history brings contemporary Delhi alive.  True to life  characters, like his authoritative spendthrift landlady, Mrs. Puri, or his  slightly maniacal taxi drive Balvinder Singh, give his settings an unusual  liveliness.  Add India pigeon lovers, mystical healers, an enterprising  group of transvestites (eunuchs), the baffling Indian bureaucracy,  weddings,  parties, funerals and religious holidays and &quot;voila&quot;  you have an entertaining and informative travel/history book.<br />If you are  going to, or ever have been to Delhi, India you owe it to yourself to read  City of Djinns.

I read this unique book while trekking through Ladakh, India - the last place where you can see something of what Tibet must have been like before the Chinese invaded. Ladakh is the highest, most remote, most sparsely  populated  region in India, located on the China - Indian border in what is  deemed &quot;disputed territory.&quot;  Tourists were banned until 1972,  and entry into this region requires a special permit.<br />A Journey to Ladakh  is written by a professed &quot;half - Buddhist&quot;.  It is foremost a  book about spiritual discovery, and secondly a travel log on one of the  world's most outback religious regions.  Andrew Harvey, born in southern  India and educated at Oxford, England, read all he could on different  Buddhist traditions but decided to leave Oxford and return to India for one  year to study Buddhism in its original form.  This ultimately lead him to  Ladakh, one of the last places on earth &quot;where a Tibetan Buddhist  society can be experienced&quot;.<br />The first part of the book is Harvey's  travel journal through Ladakh.  A group of my fellow sojourners plowed  through the first hundred pages and finally put the book down.  Comments  such as &quot;I lost interest&quot; and &quot;dull&quot; were mentioned,  however the book's  value and true worth happens in the second half, when  Harvey meets the Rinpoche (&quot;master&quot;, &quot;realized soul&quot;,  &quot;Buddha&quot;).  It is here, when Harvey records the wisdom of the  Rinpoche, that the text shines, providing universal truths about life and  its spiritual component.  The tenants of Buddhist philosophy can be gleaned  through Harvey's discourses with  the Rinpoche (&quot;There are no Gods in  Buddhism,&quot; &quot;There is only Emptiness - Nothingness,&quot; &quot;To  be freed from a false perception of Self is the end of Buddhism,&quot;.),  but it is in the practical day to day life teachings that make this book  worth reading.<br />The journey to Ladakh is a journey to discover the laws  of the spirit, and the relationship of the spirit to those laws.  What  Harvey has done for you in this book is to start you on a journey . . .  a  journey that explores the very center of being - or in Buddhist terms the  journey into nothingness.

Message in a Bottle lacks the emotional power that Sparks  enerated in his excellent novel, The Notebook.  Meager character development, the lack of  crisis and tedium makes this 288 pages book like going sailing without wind  - listless and boring.  The exchange between the key characters is often  insipid (\\"you were kinda quite tonight\\" she said.  \\"I guess I didn't have  much to say.\\"  He said.  She took his hand, \\"I am glad you were with me.\\"  \\"Yea\\" he said.\\") and the trite dialogue between these two lovers often make  you wince.<br />The melodrama begins with a mid-aged, lonely, single mother  (Theresa) kicking at the waves along the shores of Cape Cod.  When, lo and  behold, she finds a corked bottle that floats into her life.  A bottle that  contains a lamenting (and quite pathetic) love letter.  He whines and pines  over his lost true love, his soul-mate and lost wife -\\"Catherine&quot;.  As  a budding co-dependent she avidly reads each wailing word, and is deeply  touch by Mr. Bottleman.  Any man that you would force to read Mr.  Bottleman's poetic letter would quickly suspect that it was wrote after the  said writer drank the contents of the bottle he was about to use - Cutty  Shark.  So what is an accomplished, educated and cosmopolitan  co-dependant woman to do (the right answer is to throw the bottle and  message back into the sea without the cork)?  Why, she finds out where Mr.  Bottleman lives (Wilmington, NC) and begins her journey of finding this  man, a man with emotional depth,  the man who can offer her finally, for  once, dear God just once,  the same kind of love she has to give (folks you  are going to need a few bottles yourself to get to the end of this book).  Does she find him.  Yes!<br />Does she find the deep, self-sacrificing love  that only Mr. Bottleman can offer?  Of course not - he goes stupid on us  and sails into the gail of the decade.

Lincoln takes us into his world; the world of the African American.<br />The journey begins in the early part of this  century; in Alabama, and focuses us in the tiny town of Athens; not a bad  place to grow-up, unless you're Black.  Lincoln's writing illuminates the  ugly prejudice behavior of whites towards (and, as  Lincoln notes, the  prejudice of  Blacks towards \\"white trash\\") Blacks  that was predominated  the South during the first half of this century.  He reports his sobering  findings that America was and still is split into two societies:white and  Black, separate and unequal.  After driving this point home, Eric takes you  through the changes, notes improvements, but proclaims that America remains  caught in racism and class conflict.<br />In an unusual twist regarding  blacks and Jews, C. Eric Lincoln does a admirable job showing a symbiotic  relationship between the two maligned groups.  To Eric the Jews were  distant cousins in the fight against racism; cousins with deep financial  pockets, legal expertise and limited participation that undergirded the  Civil Rights Crusades.  He sees the relationship as two minorities trying  to gain parity in an intolerant closed-minded society.<br />Lincoln's call for  blacks to reaffirm, (or even regain), their identity as Africans displaced  in America strikes me as a rewarming of Malcom X's ideology.  Though  Lincoln stays short of Malcom X's call for a return to Africa, I feel that  Lincoln has failed to realize that blacks in America are American and a  vital part of it pluralism.<br />C. Eric Lincoln ends his text in a diatribe  of statements,  that he fails to back up with either facts or incidences of  the massive injustice he reports.  For example, he states that the  &quot;national focus is on the wanton elimination of the African America  Male from meaningful participation in the common ventures of American  Life&quot;.<br />The national focus?  Lincoln goes on a tirade against the  incarceration of &quot;black men&quot; at a &quot;unconscionable rate&quot;  as if they have not broken laws, caused injury or done the crime.  He makes  no comment on the victims of the lawless; black or white; he just waves the  flag of injustice and racism.  The destructiveness of self-interest that he  writes about is also found in the arena of black-interest.<br />Lincoln  insists that America remembers that the African minority have had their  lives disrupted, their national integrity as African impugned, their  culture degraded, their politics corrupted and their freedoms commandeered,  taken away or sold off by the white establishment.  He goes on to say that  too little is being asked, said or done to allay the journey from the  &quot;harsh, inflexible conventions&quot; of the past.  He states that  America, especially white America, is &quot;still in the business of niger  making.&quot;  He then closes with a &quot;No-Fault Reconciliation&quot;,  whereby we must get on with the task of building the dream, the dream that  makes us all American.  We must prepare for a new world, a new society  that allows us to trust and support each other.  We are all in need of God  and each other.  Lincoln reaches the end of his manuscript and says,  &quot;Hey, I am a Professor at Duke University and I've got to end this  book on a hopeful text, not the ranting, radical diatribe that I started  with, so he comes up with his \\"no-fault reconciliation\\".<br />Lincoln has  done extremely well pointing out both the history and problems of racism in  America.  His insight into the difficulties then and now for a Black person  to cross &quot;the color line&quot; is extremely useful.<br />However, he  fails to come up with any solutions to how we can work collectively to  bring change into our system and culture.  He lacks answers for the  pressing problems.<br />To say the answer is no-fault reconciliation leaves me  flat.  I also found him critical and short changing the black and white  church.  For Lincoln religion, (IE Christianity for the most part), was  more of the problem that the solution.  He felt that the Black church and  Black preacher kept the system in place and tended to support the  oppression (pg67).  I wondered where he would have put the Black minister  in his triad of &quot;Good, Bad, and Smart Nigers&quot;.<br />I felt that  the few paragraphs that he gave to Christianity were inadequate,  considering the role that the Black and White church played in abolishing  slavery and in the civil rights movement.ault reconciliation leaves me  flat.

This is not a book for those who want to live a comfortable life, avoiding sorrow and despair at all costs. It is instead a moving work intended for readers who have either experienced the suffering in this fractured world  or who are compelled to know more in general about the human condition.<br />In Waiting for Godot in Sarajevo David Toole portrays a world fraught  with endless and often escalating conflicts, a world pregnant with pain and  death. He seeks to answer the pensive questions: How do we come to grips  with the endless suffering in this world? How can we live a good life in  the face of suffering Toole answers by telling us that, in today's world,  we are confronted with three alternatives from which we can choose: despair  (nihilism), tragic resignation (fatalism) or hope (apocalyptic faith).<br />The opening chapter of this book is set in 1993 Sarajevo, Bosnia, at the  height of the slaughter and carnage. Taking place is the stage performance  of Samuel Beckett's play &quot;Waiting for Godot.&quot; Susan Sontag  directs this work during a time when Sarajevo was both battlefield and  concentration camp. &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; is a powerful play that  depicts tragic politics, the art of suffering, dying and, of course, the  eternal waiting that accompanies suffering. Godot, for whom the cast waits,  represents hope, a potential redeemer.<br />In Toole's words, &quot;I began  in Sarajevo and that Sarajevo both is and metaphorically represents a world  of suffering.&quot; This suffering is simply another instance of the  unfolding in nihilism that Nietzsche declared would be the distinguishing  mark of both the 20th and 21st centuries - Sarajevo depicts for us the  despair of radical nihilism.&quot;<br />Make no mistake, this is not a  summer-day-at-the-beach read as the text is complex and challenging. Toole  deals with the philosophy of great minds and thinkers such as the  following: Fredrick Nietzsche, Martin Heideggar, Michael Gillespie, John  Milbank, John H. Yoder and Michael Foucault.  However, do not despair,  Toole's writing is both clear and illuminating. He has done us a valuable  service as he spurns today's doomsayers who proclaim &quot;this world is a  world with no bounds, no constraints and a world run amok.&quot; He  challenges us to believe in a life that has meaning, dignity and God's  presence.

There was a time when a mouse was just a rodent, only spiders had Web sites, surfing took place at the beach and the church was the key force for shaping culture.  Those days are gone.  A new era is upon us and  Christendom must 1) face reality; 2) develop a plan of action and  3)reengage our culture.<br />The reality we must face, for Hunsberger and Van  Gelder, is this: the church has capitulated to the forces of Enlightenment  (forces of the scientific world view) and has given up its key role as a  cultural change agent.  Wilbert Shenk summed it up by saying  &quot;Christendom is spent as a cultural force&quot;; but, and this is a  big BUT, Hunsberger and Van Gelder are hopeful that the church can redefine  its mission and launch an new era of  relevancy in the century ahead.<br />The Church between Gospel and Culture rings out a wake up call,  heralding the arrival of a new era. 14 authors; all thinkers, theologians,  anthropologist and culturist, are the harbingers for the new world to come.  George Hunsberger and Craig Van Gelder (both professors of missiology)  have collected and edited these significant and erudite voices.  The  Church between Gospel and Culture is arduous reading (due the novelty of  concepts, the multiplicity of scholarly writers) and days, not just hours,  need to be set aside to ponder and reflect on the significance of what  these authors have to say about our culture, our era and the massive change  that is upon the Christian Church.  I was persuaded to rethink my role and  mission as a healing missionary.  The call of Christ not to be &quot;in the  world, but not of the world&quot; was made anew to me.  The Church between  Gospel and Culture is worth the effort.<br />When Christianity was a cult  (before Constantine 325AD) the people of \\"the Way\\" (Acts 24:14) were  willing to be counter-cultural.  They were mission to their culture, thus  they challenged the \\"principalities and powers\\" of their society.  \\"The  Way\\" cult could do this because it was not \\"of the world, just in it\\".  Atlas, in our world today the hope for those in Christendom that want to be  real and relevant by their faith may find the only way is by apostasy;  leaving a dying religious system and creating a new cult group that refuses  to drink the cup of modernity and domestication.<br />When it comes to the  future of the Western church I am not an optimist. In the words of Don  Marquis the late U.S. humorist/journalist \\"an optimist is a guy who has  never had much experience\\".  To be optimistic about the future of  Christianity is to be one who has not endured much of Christendom.  I am  closer to the thinking of both Stanley Hauerwas and William Willimon who  brand the contemporary Western Church as a church that accommodates the  world, seeking to market \\"church\\" programs, clawing for a position in and  among the other many agents of society.<br />This is a consequential book.do this because it was not \\"of the world, just in it\\".

I asked Danny-boy if he reads much.  \\"Na, I don't read no more\\",  he said.  \\"I started readin' once, but it confused me.\\"  \\"I got my life to  were its runnin' good enough and if I start readin' those books I just  might have to change it\\".<br />Douglas Hall, and his book, Confessing the  Church, will press you to change, or at the least reevaluate your beliefs.  This is a powerful book.  It was Roger Bacon who said \\"Some books are to be  tasted, others swallowed and a few are to be chewed and digested\\".  Hall's  book is slow reading, for it requires reflection.  Confessing the Faith  must be chewed slowly, and even then I am not sure if most will digest.<br />Hall is on the front edge of both Christology and Ecclesiology.  Douglas Hall sees the Church as a witness; proclaiming and testifying to  the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  Words alone are not enough to Hall, the  people of God, the Church must be found acting or \\"doing\\" their confession  that Jesus is the Christ.  For Hall a Church that does not confess Christ  to the world in word and deed is not being faithful to its nature and  calling.  Christ is the door through which we can achieve a relationship  with the living God, each other and the world we live in.  He believes  that the Church must not only confess Christ to the world but must do so in  such a way that it actually makes a difference - standing and saying what  must be said regardless of the cost.  Hall calls us to confess contextually  Christ; ie. to speak about Christ and his presence and power where it needs  to be spoken and in such a way that it confronts the evil that propagates  and often prevails in our world.<br />Confessing the faith to Hall is being  Christ to this world today.<br />Douglas John Hall, has given to us brilliant  insight on how we as \\"the people of God\\" need to profess (actualize) our  faith.  We are called to be disengaged from the values of this world  system to such a degree that the world recognizes us as different -  strange.  Thus, those who are strangers to God's love and presence, will  take notice of our confession and actions.  They will see that our faith  points to God's character.  A character defined by the person Jesus of  Nazareth.  We are the people of the Christ, and that makes us different.  We are not afraid to confront the evil in this world and we call out for  righteousness and justice for all.<br />Where Hall falls short is in two  areas.  First, he fails to illuminate the character of Christ, the very  identity he calls the Church to reflect.  And secondly, he calls us to  confront the evils and wrongs of this world  without expanding on what  these evils and wrongs are.

For the past fifty years, under  the tyrannical dictatorship of the communist leader Enver Hoxha and his  isolation from the rest of the world, the people of Albania have  languished.  After 50 years of no contact with the outside world what must  the Albanians have thought when they awoke in 1991 to the fast-paced,  competitive world of the 21st century?<br />Northern Albania (High Albania)  is a totally different land than the South.  High Albania  is an intriguing  part of the country that retains separate customs and identity.  Marjorie  Senechal  interviewed scores of ordinary men and women with the intent of  discovering who these people are, what have they been through, and what  does the future look like to them.  She invites the common people of  Albania to talk candidly - and talk they do.  Without the past fears of  being beaten,  jailed, or even killed for expressing their thoughts they  now talk openly about their children, their work, their problems, their  fears and even their dreams.  Each interview is accompanied by portrait  style photos.  Stan Sherer has chosen B&amp;W photography to capture  the soul of this suffering country.  Sherer does a commendable job in  discovering both the ethos of these people and the beauty of this part of  the country.  His photos reveal a balance between the despair and  backwardness of Albania, and the strength of will and hospitality that are  found in its people .<br />The harmonious marriage of text and photos is  divided into four chapters: ancient history, the past 100 years, the  emerging present, and the hope for the future.  In Albania it remains a  daily struggle just to survive.  Yet despite these difficulties,  the  traditional Albania toast -  &quot;Long life to your children&quot; - is a  cry for the future, a future of dreams fulfilled.e, a future of dreams fulfilled.	2000-06-28

BUT	Albania recently was recognized for its critical humanitarian role as a safe haven for the 600,000 Kosovar men, women and children who fled from the carnage of Serbian police and Molosvich's military henchmen. Albania  also was seen nightly on national television as the critical staging area  for NATO during the Kosovo War, March through June 1999.<br />But few know  that the people of this small European Baltic country are descendants of  the Illyrians, who were the first people to use iron for tools and weapons.  As well, few recognize that Mother Teresa, astronaut William Georgry, actor  John Belushi and Dr. Ferid Murad, Nobel Laureate in medicine for his work  in the development of Viagra, are all of Albanian heritage.<br />Even today  Albania remains one of the least-known European countries since it was  isolated by post-war Communism until 1991. Books on Albania in the English  language are scarce, an issue which American-born Albanian Lou Giaffo seeks  to remedy in this engaging but limited book.<br />Giaffo writes Albanian  history from 1500 B.C. to modern times without the drab, cumbersome  academic prose that one often finds in histories. He has a fresh writing  style that keeps the reader engaged.<br />However, there are significant  weaknesses in this work. Most Albanians who I spoke with cite four events  in the last 60 years that significantly shaped Albania: Communism/Hoxha  1945, the Religious Purge 1967, the fall of Communism 1991 and the Pyramid  Scheme 1997. Giaffo does an ample job covering the first and third of these  critical historical events, but he failed to include the second and fourth.  For a historical text with a 1999 publish date, these are significant  omissions, as is the absence of an index (unheard of in any serious  historical text). It is my hope that Giaffo follows up and addresses these  issues in a second edition. As a writer he is both engaging and  informative, a wonderful combination for a writer of  history.<br />Conditionally Recommendedonally Recommended	2000-06-25

Somewhere different, unusual, off the beaten path and not crowded by tourists? Go Albania.<br />For 50 years Albania was literally shut away from the rest of the world by a  fanatical communist dictator.  The fall of the Berlin Wall and the  disintegration of European Communism released the proud and warm people  from the deep sleep. Slowly they are coming alive to the rest of the world.  While previously it was nearly impossible for Westerners to visit Albania,  the door is now wide open. But be forewarned, Albania is the poorest  country in all of Europe, and there are still many practical difficulties  for the common tourist.  The first place to start is with a tour  guide.<br />Since Blue Guide: Albania is the only guide to this country in  print, that alone makes it a valuable travel aid.  Blue Guides are  published by W.W. Norton and are unique travel guides that strongly promote  a country's history, culture and archaeology.<br />Author James Pettifer, a  Balkans expert, has selected the easiest places in Albania to visit;  namely, places where accommodations can be found. He furnishes the traveler  with good, practical information, although it is dated since it was written  pre-1996. The hotels and restaurants listed are almost non-existent and  fall bellow the most remedial standards of travel guides for other  countries.  The guide's strengths are history, culture and archaeology -  and in this area Pettifer excels.<br />If you are traveling to Albania, this  guide will be a good asset - conditionally recommended.	2000-06-25

In the first few years, the international press boosted Albania as  an &quot;economic miracle, (a) Balkan tiger, and (a) rising shining  star.&quot; In 1997, swept up in the mania of a ponzi-style investment  scheme, the Albanian house of cards came tumbling down. It is hard to  comprehend the scope of the collapse - more than 75 percent of the  population lost all their life savings. Riots, beatings, looting of Army  armories, burning of government buildings and rampant mayhem gripped the  country for weeks.<br />Finally, in an effort to stabilize this torn and  devastated country, a contingent of multinational troops had to be sent in.  A collapse of this magnitude does not have a cause; rather, it is a  compendium of factors that cumulate in tragedy.<br />In Albania in Crisis  Daniel Vaughn-Whitehead evaluates the &quot;how&quot; and the  &quot;why&quot; this country fell so far so fast. Writing with empirical  statistical support, Vaughn-Whitehead pulls no punches as he uncovers the  causes of this crisis.

The Dominican Republic government has allowed most of the agricultural land to be concentrated in the hands of large landowners, including the state itself.  <br />The GINI index shows the D.R. as one of the most  unequaled ownership structures in the World.  Vargus-Lundius spends 350  detailed pages supporting the accusation that &quot;poverty and  unemployment [in the D.R.] are mainly the result of a land policy that  concentrates the best lands in a few hands, a credit policy that mainly  benefits the large producer, a pricing policy that tends to discourage  agricultural production and a labor policy that encourages labor imports  [for Haiti].  <br />Her well documented research is a scathing incitement on a  government that purposely remains indifferent to the plight of the  peasants.  She has done a great service to all those who are interested in  economic justice in the Dominican Republic. <br />Yet, for all of her critical  analysis she fails to deal with four critical aspects that keep people in  poverty: lack of education, transportation[ie paved roads], electricity and  tele-communication.  <br />The irony to these omissions is that Rosemary was  raised in the D.R. in a very poor home.  Her own portage out of poverty  came via education;  &quot;Dona Diga, my first teacher used to say  'education is the answer to everything&quot;.	2000-06-19

To travel to England without reading about and seeing some of the world's most beautiful and interesting cathedrals would be some serious shortcomings for any traveler or student of history.<br />David Edward has  selected 18 of the best cathedrals in Britain. It has been said to see a  cathedral you must first understand why it exist and then and only then can  you truly see it.<br />Dr. Edward's book allows you to see beyond the stones  and see the great spirit, ambition and faith that drove the British people  between the 10th and 16th centuries to build the testimonies to God.  Each  cathedral has excellent color plates as well as black and white photos.<br />Yet, being an American, I would not, as the fly leaf does, call Mr.  Edward's British writing style as &quot;lively and stimulating\\" rather he  writes in a scholarly manner, but none the less opens the world of  cathedrals to new towering heights, and rings a few bells along the way.<br />Though his writing can be somewhat starched he never less brings to  light new insights about cathedrals that allows you to appreciate these  towering testimonies to God.<br />You do not have to be a Christian believer  to recognize the imagination, creative spirit, intense labor and force of  will it took to create these towering palaces to God.<br />The Cathedrals of  Britain affirm the aspiration and faith of a people past, yet not lost in  the current generation of Brits.

Colorful and charismatic, the Caribbean is abundant with stories that beg to be told. Pamela Smorkaloff, a teacher at NYU Center for Caribbean Studies, gathers stories from various islands that bring the Caribbean and  its people to life in this book.<br />Smorkaloff's selections seek to  counterbalance the &quot;Europeanizing&quot; of the Caribbean reality. The  authors she selected all have a sense of belonging to a Caribbean  consciousness...&quot;anchored in reality, history and  culture.&quot;<br />From slavery and sugar cane to rural peasantry and cruise  ships, these stories reflect an evolution of identity.<br />Though this  anthology is interesting, the writers failed to engage me.  As is true with  most collections of writers, you have some that enthrall you while others  bore you.  &quot;If I Could Write This In Fire&quot; lacked outstanding  authors and had just a scattering of good writers.

The people of this country are proud of their history, sportsmen, and artistic and musical genius. Yet the  inequity of wealth, growing poverty, governmental corruption, and grave  social tensions have created an attitude within Jamaicans that can be  brash, sassy, rude, and often in-your-face. This is especially true around  the big, all-inclusive resorts, which exacerbate the inequity of  wealth.<br />A good guidebook should give you more than just star ratings on  hotels and restaurants - it should help the savvy and curious traveler  learn about the culture, politics, and people as well as tell you where to  find the best beaches and hottest night clubs.<br />&quot;Jamaica: The Rough  Guide&quot; is a good source for travel in Jamaica, although some content  is lacking.<br />The authors have adequately covered all the basic information  for visiting Jamaica. The accommodation and restaurant sections are ample  enough to help the reader make a decision, but I found the ratings systems  in guides such as Fielding to be easier to comprehend and use. A  significant shortcoming is the lack of web sites or e-mail address...today,  most hotels have e-mail and web sites that make booking a reservation easy  and cheap. Since the guide is a 1999 reprint, this information should be  included.<br />There are some very interesting and occasionally fascinating  tidbits of information found in sidebars on the pages of this guidebook.  For example, &quot;Sexual Stamina Potions ensure a sexual libido in  Jamaican men&quot; and &quot;Ackee: the national dish kills up to 10 people  a year.&quot;<br />Overall, &quot;Jamaica: The Rough Guide&quot; is a valuable  guide and will help you understand this wonderful country.

Dead language is usually the first symptom of dead religion.  5.No one has  final answers.  No finite person or institution has absolute answers. When  we set forth our belief as the only right belief, we are wrong.  6. To  ascribe infallibility to the written world of the Bible is wrong. God is  still alive and speaking and God's word is not captive to history.  7.

To know what is yours is the  purpose of the Guide to National Parks.  Each of these eight guides have a  smattering of color photos, a meager scattering of full-color trail maps  and a brief, but good, highlight of each park's most impressive features.  Guide to National Parks: Southeast Region covers 75 national parks in  Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi,  North Carolina, South Carolina Tennessee, Puerto Rico and the Virgin  Islands.<br />What this guide cries out for is maps, maps and more maps.  What you get is one master map and eight color maps.  That's it... that all  you get to help you navigate 75 national parks - pathetic.<br />The key page  is a two-page Southeast Region Map but there is  nothing linking you from  this map to where in the book the park is described.  The master map  doesn't have any numbers or references.  To complicate matters more there  is no index, so you can't reference the parks name and go to the page.  Rather you return to the table of contents and search there for the park.  Sixty eight parks have no map at all.  For example; Cumberland Island  National Seashore (36,415 acres) no map, or Biscayne National Park (172,924  acres) no map - you get the idea.

Though the Quechuan Peruvian Indian has little or  no education and they remain dresses in &quot;traditional&quot; Andean  dress - shirt, waistcoat, home spun nee britches and poncho, knitted cap  and rubber sandals - they have developed an unique religious belief system  that is based on belief apparitions of divine images and the miracles that  followed such mystical theophanies<br />A devotional Spanish Catholicism was  introduce 450 years ago to the Peruvian Indian a religious system blended  &quot;a rich diversity of pagan, early Christian and medieval traits.&quot;  From this cult blend of Catholicism, animism and Inca religion a flourish  cult, not a stagnant creed would spring.  The color processional feasts and  pilgrimages to the shrines of such events are the heart of the cult  followings.<br />This academic dissertation, though full of valuable insight  into the Catholic and Andean embrace that created will fail to engage and  hold the attention of all but the avid student of ethology, anthropology  and/or religion.  Michael Sallnow fails to build a foundation of knowledge  that the casual reader would need to comprehend the religious  theology by  which Incas initially lived.  Also, Sallnow fails to explain how the Inca  Indian, who was steeped in mysticism, was so easily absorbed  in to  Catholicism's rich imagery.  Conditionally recommended	2000-02-20

If you have considered visiting two of America's most picturesque States you can't go wrong with this guide.  Four important qualities characterize a good or great guidebook.  First, does it provide the introductory  information that every traveler needs: when to go, where to go, what to  bring and &quot;what about&quot; information.  Second, does it contain  reliable and current travel information: lodging, dining, sightseeing,  events, shopping and nightlife.  Third, do we receive the kind of unique  input about the culture, the historic sites and  trivia that sets the guide  apart from its competitors: outdoor information, camping, hiking, boating,  fishing etc.,.  And finally, are there sufficient number of accurate and  detailed maps to allow a traveler to find the sites referenced in the book.  Hidden Carolinas scores very high in all but the last category.  The  introduction wonderfully conveyed the history in an interesting connection  with the lay of the land.  The selection of hotels, restaurants and clubs  were top notch.  Unique to this guide is it's &quot;hidden areas&quot;.  These remarkable &quot;off the beaten path&quot; spots can easily be missed  by the unaware traveler and are frequently left out altogether by other  guides.  The low mark is the paucity of maps (17 for both states).  Maps  to help you locate  sites that are &quot;hidden&quot; should be a  no-brainer.

Judgement and Promise - the book of Isaiah is pregnant with both and Walter Brueggemann is the textual midwife.  Brueggemann (Professor of Old Testament Theology at Columbia Theological Seminary, Atlanta) is first and  foremost a theologian of the text, and his theology emanates from  scripture.  After a lifetime of devotion as a scholar of Biblical text,  Brueggemann sees God living and flowing through, in and  under the  scripture.<br />Throughout the Old Testament, and clearly in Isaiah,  Brueggemann's God is an entangled God.  A God who purposely embroils  Himself in the affairs of a despairing and divergent world.  Isaiah is  God's ordained messenger, sent to challenge, critique and criticize the  false security and faith in Israel's society.  Isaiah begs them to realize  their doomed destiny.  He is calling out relentlessly to Judah, plaintively  petitioning them to beware of the impending apocalypse.  Yet, the people,  steeped in religion, and  mesmerized by the glitter of their materialistic  well being is no  longer capable of scrutinizing the  incongruities,  ambiguities and contradictions that shackles them and leads them towards  captivity.<br />In Bruggemann's commentary Isaiah saw a time of darkness and  despair, where doom was inevitable and the eyes of the people of Israel,  especially the religious and political leaders of Judah, were blind.  This  was a time when the people called by God, redeemed by God, actively  rejected God.  Death and destruction were to follow.  Jerusalem would fall.  The temple would be leveled in 587 B.C.E.  Yet for all of this Isaiah  did not leave the people without hope (Isaiah 40-66); for he saw a time  when promise would follow judgement.  He prophecies of a time for the  people of God when peace, spiritual prosperity and a new beginning would  come.<br />Walter Brueggemann excels in his ability to illuminate the text and  truth for his readers.  As he exegetes the scripture, laying bear its truth  and its relevancy to us today, he calls for the reader to draw their own  conclusions about the application of the text to today's world.  His  commentary on Isaiah is scholarly, but not densely academic.  It breaths  new life into ancient texts.  Isaiah 1-39 by Walter Brueggeman is a  recommended addition to any biblical library, and a must for any student of  Isaiah.cy to us today, he calls for the reader to draw their own  conclusions about the application of the text to today's world.

A Master is known by the  width and depth of the wisdom and truth they emanate.  They are able to  present truth in such a way that it is directly applicable to the lives of  their listeners.  A master in theology  is one who has the ability to make  complex old paradigms understandable and shows how the application of these  maxims has the power to transform both thinking and structure itself.<br />In  God in the Fray, twenty-one accomplished theologians have engaged  Brueggemann's thinking and theology and give their own interpretation to an  often controversial and challenging scholar.  Dr. Walter Brueggemann is  complex, odd and unsettling in his understanding of Yahweh.  His faith and  theology are never static, rather continually on the move, challenging,  probing and often perplexing.  He relentlessly seeks out &quot;a fresh  articulation of whom God is,&quot;  for he believes that the church and its  future rest on a fresh understanding and pronouncement of God.  Brueggemann, who like the very God he follows, resists fitting into any  comfortable systematic category.  He is constantly pressing boundaries,  challenging old God images and pulling down contemporary idolatrous icons  in order that a new awareness will grasp the believer, and in doing so  transform the society in which the church lives.  Most contributors to God  in the Fray have the pulse of Brueggemann,  but some fret over his  theological condition.  Their concern is akin to a medical doctor saying,  &quot;ah, if he would just stabilize we could better define his  condition.&quot;<br />As with any anthology most authors illuminate the  subject, while some tend to obscure; one writer will prophetically speak  into your life, while the next author may drone and ramble.  Thus, God in  the Fray is an anthology, giving tribute to a great man and master.  Recommend.the Fray have the pulse of Brueggemann,  but some fret over his  theological condition.

In his most recent edition (10th Edition) Glassman gives you a trustworthy, reliable guide.  This guide is especially useful for those who are going to spend more that a few days in Guatemala,  for his town to town coverage is the best in print today.  His explanation  of  Guatemala's history, people though succinct, were enlightening.  His  review of  accommodations, restaurants, transportations, tips and much more  are both practical and accurate.  I was especially impressed by his very  readable &quot;Short History&quot; section, as well as his chapter  &quot;Defending the Forest&quot;. .  This would be a &quot;highly  recommended&quot; travel guide but Glassman and/or Off Road Publishing  short-listed the maps (14 small maps).  It is one thing to read about  &quot;Fiestas in Chichicastenago&quot; and another to know where it is.  The index, though better over the last edition, still needs improvement  (I.E. the cover states &quot;more beaches&quot; and there is not one  listing in the index, or in table of contents, under &quot;beaches&quot;) -  the guide is 432 pages.

You can't go wrong with his guide to Guatemala.  His chapter on the ancient  Capital of Central America, Antigua, is one of the best found today in any  guide book.  He not only illuminates the history of  this important Spanish  colonial town (an UNESCO world heritage site and a must see) he also lets  you know the current contemporary situation of Antiqua.  While I was in  Guatemala (1/1999) I checked out his recommendations of lodging,  restaurant, nightlife and they are &quot;right on the money&quot;.  He has  an excellent recommended reading section and he is strong in his editorial  support of eco-tourism.  However, there are some obvious weaknesses : the  maps are few and crude, and the index is entirely anemic.  Recommend.	1999-01-27
2953307:US	53002620	R3DO62G579BXHJ	0802804055	67355384	Reason for Being: A Meditation on Ecclesiastes	Books	5	74	74	N	N	One of the best works available for understanding Eccl.	Jacques Ellul, professor emeritus of law at the University of Bordeau, France, has writen more than forty books, including &quot;The Technological Bluff&quot; and &quot;Jesus and Marx&quot;.  For over 50 years he prayed  over  and meditated on Ecclesiastes and desired to make Reason for Being  his conclusion to his  lifework.  He approaches his interpretation and  contemporary exegesis of Ecclesiastes topically; whereby he looks at the  &quot;themes of vanity&quot; and interacts with these themes from his  contemporary social analysis (power, money, work, happiness, goodness,  justice and wisdom).  Of the dozen or so commentaries on Ecclesiastes that  I have recently read, I found Ellul's work to be one of the best for  bringing balance and contemporary application.  Many critics have label  Ecclesiastes an incoherent collection of a skeptical and cynical writer,  but Ellul sees the Ecclesiastes refreshingly different.  He sees the writer  as a teacher that faces the crude reality of life and demolishes values and  illusions that many hold.  Everything is question by the teacher but the  presence and action of God.  For Ellul the teacher is realistic and  pragmatic, a spokesman of the actual reality of human life who tells it  like it is.<br />Ellul does a brilliant job delineating the contradictions  that permeates the writing of Ecclesiastes.  He notes that contradictions  are &quot;an essential principle of Ecclesiastes &quot; and that truth in  life and about life can not be found without realizing that life itself is  contradictory.  For Ellul Ecclesiastes affirms the true character of human  existence, which itself is essentially contradictory.  He states,  &quot;Qohelet, the teacher, is a skilled surgeon who opens wounds,  including the one wound that dominates human life, and reveals the  incredible confusion in our beliefs and assertions, our absolutes and our  occupations.  Unresolvable contractions forms one of the guidelines of this  book.&quot;  For example, regarding  happiness, Ecclesiastes calls it  worthless, yet he maintains that the only thing that a person can expect in  this life is to take joy and pleasure and live as happily as possible - a  contraction.<br />The two predominant and overriding strengths of Jacques  Ellul's work are his topical treatment of the key issues that the Qohelet  brings up and how he show that Qohelet's words are for us today  contemporary and cosmopolitan.  Ellul underlines how today &quot;there is  nothing new under the sun&quot; regarding the nature of humankind.  We  still face a crisis of morality and philosophy, of human customs and  grandeur, of the foundations of our collective life - a political crisis.  He and Qohelet see a crisis of both the individual and society, a crisis of  both the immediate and the chronic.  The topical treatment that Ellul uses  to illuminate the mind of the Q is refreshingly alive with current day  application.  He integrates the disorder and contractions inherent in our  society today, into the word's and wisdom of the Q's day - over 2000 years  ago.<br />His concluding chapter &quot;God&quot; removes Ellul from the  radical harbinger that he is and places him back into the fold of orthodox  Christianity.  He fails to indite God, as Ecclesiastes did, for breach of  covenant, but he does leave evil and injustice at the feet of God when he  says &quot;everything is made by God, but you can in no way explain or  understand it.... God does everything including all the things that we just  criticized.&quot;  He retains a monotheistic &quot;Christ Only&quot;  theology, whereby Christ is the &quot;only one&quot; person that God  incarnated.<br />Without reservation I would recommend Reason for Being: A  Meditation on Ecclesiastes for any student of the Old Testament.  This book  stands out as one of the most probing writings on the Qohelet today.  What  sets it apart from other commentaries on Ecclesiastes is the contemporary  application to today'ssociety that Jacques Ellul brings.to today's society that Jacques Ellul brings.	1998-12-08

He avoids a quick solution and  bravely faces and retains both his belief in God's goodness and God's  justice when both are juxtaposed with the &quot;enormous suffering with  which humanity seems forever cursed&quot;.  Ultimately Levenson vindicates  God by postulating the belief that God purposely limits His intervention  and power to eradicated evil while showing that God continues His march  towards the &quot;reign of the perfect justice He so ardently  desires&quot;.  No small feat.<br />At the core of Christian/Jewish  Theology is the belief that God is the creator of all - absolutely all -  and he continues to be in complete control of his creation.  The firm  belief in the absolute deity of God has given rise to Levenson's view of  the universe.  The problem confronting Levenson is the concealment or  hiddenness of God when Evil not only persists but prevails.  Levenson,  wrestles empirically with the questions &quot;What kind of God is this God  who fails to do what he is obligated by character to do?&quot; and  &quot;Is a concealed God, a nonexistent God?&quot;.  Because of the  dreadful cognitive dissidence between faith and fatalism Levenson is forced  to come up with an answer that a least adequately helps him and us get  through our despair, pain and injustice and survive the respective nights  of  isolation.<br />The Theology of the Limited God....<br />Provocative in  proposing that God fails, that God can be faulted and even goaded Levenson  push his readers to consider the theological construct - the theology of  the limited God.  Levenson in his reflection on &quot;creation  theology&quot; sees God as the creator of both the world and all forces of  evil that oppose him within the world, IE: disorder, injustice, affliction  and chaos are to viewed as much a part of God as is His creation.  He goes  on to say &quot;God is the author of everything, even of evil.&quot;  God  created these forces to demonstrate His dominant mastery over them.  For  God's Lordship is meaningful only if the powers he subjugates are  formidable.  Levenson underscores this thought by comparing God to an  emperor who has vanquished his foes, &quot;No emperor will achieve heroic  status in the eyes of his subjects if all he forces to march through his  streets is a sunken-chested weakling.&quot;<br />To Levenson, God created this  world out of disorder, injustice affliction and chaos; and thus when  &quot;justice replaces oppression, when disease and death yield to vitality  and longevity, this is the creation of something out of nothing.&quot;  For Levenson creation still goes on each and every time good prevails and  evil fails, thus &quot;we are a junior partner in his continual ordering of  the world&quot;.<br />In the face of evil, when the suffering does not end,  when God's silence and inactivity prevails, when all the &quot;how to&quot;  books fail and the popular confessional theologies are but vain and useless  incantations Levenson gives us three options... 1) Argue with God in the  hope that God maybe &quot;cajoled, flattered, shamed or threatened into  action&quot;, 2) Abandon God and find another god that may resolve your  suffering, 3) Retain your confession in God, believing that God's  deliverance of you from your suffering is not a precondition of your faith  as exemplified by Shadrach, Meshach and Abend-nego (Dan. 3:16-18) when they  entered the flames of the king's furnace.  Thus, to retain your confession  you must also be willing to face and even embrace imminent suffering and  possibly death.<br />In  Levenson mind we can become co-creators along with  God when we partake in reordering the world, by creating good out of evil,  or creatio ex nihilo. We are enabled by faith in God to not only cope with  evil but to transform evil into good.  It is through our obedience and  confession of allegiance to the divine creator that we too become  co-creators, even gods.  Our continued faith in God, a God who may even be  absent from us in the face of evil, is part of the confession of a  co-creator.  We, in our frail humanity, are called to partake in the  creative reordering of this world and ultimately witness, celebrate God's  victory.  Chaos and evil are dependent on God and God alone will  annihilate them.  He will do that by transforming rather than destroying  chaos and evil and we are called to be His witnesses.m evil into good.

They specialize in self-deceit and thus  are People of the Lie.<br />Scott Peck is best known for his famed book The  Road Less Traveled where Peck argues that there is  a link between personal  growth, spirituality, and basic mental health.
