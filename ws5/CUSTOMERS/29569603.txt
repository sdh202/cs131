He tells about what happens to him when he joined the air force. He tells about how his father died of cancer. He tells about how his mother died of heart attack.  <br /> <br />In A Man Named Dave, Dave Pelzer has delievered the fitting conclusion to a monumental series of books about courage and truimph. In this powerful book Pelzer demonstrates, as few have, that it is in the darknest skies that the stars are best seen. <br /> <br />Praise For Dave Pelzer and his New York Times Bestselling Books \\"A Child Called It\\" And The Lost Boy. <br /> <br />Riveting. Neither I nor my sstaff could put it down! Pelzer's unyielding determination inspires us all. He is a living example that all of us have the capability to better ourselves no matter what the odds. One's life is forever changed after living through the eyes of A Child Called \\"It\\" <br /> <br />These words were 18 year old Dave Pelzer's declaration of independence to his mother, and they represented the ultimate act of self-reliance. Dave's father never intervented as his mother abused him with shocking brutality, denying him food and clothing, torturing him in any way she could imagine. This was the woman who told her son she could kill him anytime she wanted to- and nearly did. <br /> <br />The more than one million readers of Pelzer's previous bestselling minionsm A Child Called \\"IT\\" and The Lost Boy, know that he lived to tell his courageous story. But even years after he was rescued, his life remained a continual struggle. Dave felt rootless and awkward, an outcast haunted by memories of his years as the bruised, Cowering \\"It\\" locked in his mother's basement. Desperately trying to make something of his life, Dave was determined to weather every setback and gain strength from adversity. <br /> <br />Dave's dramatic reunion with his dying father and the shocking confrontation with his mother- along with the discovery of the secret past- led to his ultimate calling: mentor to others struggling with personal hardships. From a difficult marriage to the birth of his son, from an unfulfilling carrer yo an enduring frienship, Dave was finally able to break the chains of his past, learning to trust, to love and to live. <br /> <br />A Man Named Dave is the gripping conclusion to his inspirational trilogy. With stunning generosity of spirit, Dave Pelzer invites his readers on his journey to discover how he turned into shame into pride and rejection into acceptance- how a lost, nameless boy finally found himself in the heart and soul of a man who is free at last. <br /> <br />*** Keep in mind: Dave Pelzer is the international bestsellinbg author of A Child Called \\"It\\" and The Lost Boy. He travels throughout the country inspiring hope and resilience in countless and individuals. Davew has recived commendation from Presidents Reagan, Bush, and Clinton and in 1994 was the only American recipent of the Outstanding Young Persons of the World Award.***	2005-06-06

There are these 4 Bailey School Kids who solved a lot of great Mysteries named Howie, Melody, Liza and Eddie. Howie is this kid who is serious about solving mysteries. Melody for me is a little bit bossy sometimes. Liza is this girl who is kind. Eddie is this kid who always goofs off. Each book has to have characters, plot, problem, solution. I was addicted to these books when i was 8. It really makes me funny about Eddie. I have only read as in red The Bailey School Kids at least 31 of them. Sometimes the book may get boring but most of all it's enjoyable. Debbie dadey and Marcia Thorton Jones have written so many books like Bailey School Kids, Bailey City Monsters, Triplet Trouble.... But most of all i only read Bailey School Kids and Bailey City Monsters. I have heard that the Bailey School Kids has reached 52 titles. However, this is the 33th book. Sometimes, when i read books like these it  irritates me. Why, Because when i read Knights Don't Teach Piano, At the ending, I hated it that Lance had to rush back to England. Until now i'm still addicted these books which is now I am 13 years old. I have already visited Debbie and Marcia Thorton Jones's website. If you want to visit it just type [...] Now for the story: <br /> <br />Liza, Melody, Eddie and Howie have another mystery on their hands. When they went to Ruby Mountain for snowboarding, They meet a large man. That's funny, Why would a large man be snowbosrding on Ruby Mountain. Plus, He gives snowboarding lessons. Could he really be a giant lurking on Ruby Mountain? Meanwhile, The kids mweet Jack, a cool guy who loves snowboarding. By the way, the large man's name is Hugh.  <br /> <br />There are so many plots in the story. The main plot is Ruby Mountain where they met Hugh. I wish the Bailey School Kids Books have longer pages. Oh well, It won't do any harm anyway.  <br /> <br />I'm inviting you to join the Bailey School Kids Fan Club. When you join, you get a Membership Card, Bookends, Free Vampire Nail,Two BSK Books called Skeletons Don't Play Tubas and Gargoyles Don't Drive School Buses. I have already joined the club. Until now i am still haunting #34 which i can't find then. <br /> <br />****So keep in mind, Debbie Dadey and Marcia Thornoton Jones are the author of the Bailey School Kids, Bailey City Monsters, Triplet Trouble, Ghostville Elementary. The Bailey school Kids have 52 titles, The Bailey City Monsters have 9 titles, The Triplet Trouble have at least 25 titles, Ghostville Elementary have 13 titles.***** <br /> <br />If i were you, I'll try to haunt all of them!	2005-04-22

Plus, Kristy's Krushers does not do well. <br /> <br />When someone makes a mistake, we should laugh at them, right? We should also bully our neighbors like Bart's Bashers did to Kristy's Krushers. I guess people aren't just kind to your neighbors. Some of them might be bad.

Stine and his Goosebumps series were just starting To be popular to my cousins in the year of 1993-1994 school year [second grade for me]. Everybody was talking about Goosebumps how cool it was. that is, except me. I remember thinking \\"Ther's no such things as monsters\\". Boy i was now addicted to these books too!<br /><br />How wrong i was.<br /><br />Curiosity killed this cat and in the eight years i have<br /><br />read Goosebumps #1-62!<br /><br />Welcome To Dead House was the one who started it all and it is a classic, in this reviwer's opininion. This book is definitely darker in tone than some of his later books, and i really enjoyed it!<br /><br />**** So keep in mind, R.L. Stine has made a lot of books already like the Fear Street, Goosebumps, Mostly Ghostly. When some books are really long that reach pp. 128-139 [as far as i know], they are for the age of 12 and above<br /><br />But if some books have some pages until 111-121[ as far as i know], there are for the ages of 9-11. The Goosebumps series sometimes can make your hair stand on the end because you might not know what will be next. In R.L. Stine's Goosebumps Presents, We all know that Goosebumps Presents have really few pages. But Goosebumps presents is enjoyable because of 8 pages of pictures from the TV Show. Next, We enter in R.L. Stine's Goosebumps Series 2000, As you see There are 25 series in the goosebumps 2000. Like the Original Goosebumps, Goosebumps Series 2000 has only reached sometimes pp. 112-119 so tht is for the ages of 9-12. some Goosebumps series 2000 has reached a page of 122, p 126, that means it's for the age of 12 and above. Next is R.L. Stine's Give Yourself Goosebumps. Give Yourself Goosebumps is that you choose the adventure with 20 scary endings. Of course the pages are too long but ages 9-11 can still read it. There are other stuff about Goosebumps. If you want to visit Goosebumps in the web just type the following [...] and you will see Goosebumps!****	2005-04-12
