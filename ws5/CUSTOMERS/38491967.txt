This book is part of an ongoing series of texts from Microsoft that offers education as to the best use of .NET. The book tackles one of the main problems of computing. Namely, how to write code that will be put into libraries and reused by many others? Arguably, this might even be the central problem in many computing projects.<br /><br />The guidelines given in the text should strike the reader as very much common sense. Take these, for instance: \\"Do not require that users perform any extensive initialisation before they can start programming basic scenarios\\", or \\"Do provide good defaults for all properties and parameters\\". If you have programmed in any language, you should readily agree with guidelines like these.<br /><br />The guidelines also include an excellent discussion about the naming of classes and methods in those classes. This is quite general; applying to any object oriented language like C++ or Java. Indeed, if you program in those languages, consider looking up this chapter of the book for useful hints.<br /><br />The book also continues a nice practice of the earlier books in the series. It has many sidebars with different people offering informal remarks about the adjoining text. Commentaries that can greatly help your assimilation of the material.	2005-10-11

Largely due to the very specialised nature of what they want to do. Linux is no exception. This book stands far afield from a typical linux sysadmin text.<br /><br />The authors choose to explain for two chip sets. Namely for the Intel x86. Natural and obvious, given Intel's domination of the microprocessor market. As for a second choice, there are many contenders, like the Alpha or the ARM chips. But instead, the book describes the PowerPC, which is prominently backed by IBM and Motorola. I suspect this choice might have been influenced by one of the authors being at IBM. Arguably, a credible alternative is the chip set from AMD.<br /><br />But the main thrust of the book is to offer a top down view of linux, drilling as close to the hardware as possible. The code excerpts are in C. (Very little kernel development seems to be done in other languages, and this book is no exception.)<br /><br />At the lowest level, you are shown how to access the drivers in /dev/, which in turn access the hardware. For example, one code fragment explains the reading of the real time clock on the x86. For some developers who might be used to dealing in pure software, these hardware interaction examples may be the most valuable portions of the text.<br /><br />Another merit of the book is presence of 2 architectures that are described. If you are developing for another chip set, the text may still be quite useful. You get 2 case studies here of how linux works. Contrasting these might give insight into what changes you need for your chip set.<br /><br />Overall, this is definitely an advanced book. Having a strong background in C coding is a plus.	2005-10-11

Divided into 8 parts, each being some broad topic revolving around 10g. The first Part is just background, on data modelling and what it means to run 10g under a unix or linux operating system. This Part should be easy review for most experienced readers.<br /><br />Part 2 describes the architecture and schema management used under 10g. And by the way, the book is focused on 10g; not on earlier versions. This Part is well worth understanding. It is here that the basic design information for laying out your database is to be found. You also find numerous utilities provided by Oracle, like the System Monitor, that help your management of the database.<br /><br />Some later Parts are straightforward but somewhat mundane. Specifically about installing 10g and making databases, and about loading data and backing up your data. To a DBA, this are vital tasks; don't get me wrong. But there's nothing too complicated here. And if you are a developer, these Parts can be safely skipped.<br /><br />Part 7, on performance tuning, is also where a developer should profitably check out. In tandem with understanding the basic layout of your tables, this Part may let you overcome bottlenecks.<br /><br />Given the size of the book, perhaps the best way to approach it is to focus on a single suitable Part at a time. Each Part is long enough to ensure a serious commitment of your attention, but still not be overwhelming.	2005-10-11

It clearly explains a lot of the needs that many users might have.<br /><br />For instance, they  might desire to customise Internet Explorer. This has a slew of options for doing so. But many users could find these forbidding. So the text takes you into an understanding of what can be tweaked. You might want to pay close attention to the explanations of the security settings and the defaults. IE lets  you customise numerous privacy options.<br /><br />Ah, there is one option that I have to mention. The book shows how to tell IE to block pop-ups. If you have ever been aggravated by some website that gleefully chucks up an underending parade of these, then you will appreciate being able to cut these miserable entities off at first base.<br /><br />Needless to say, the book discusses far more than just IE. But for many of you, IE is your access to the Web, so the above remarks should give you some idea of the book's efficacy.<br /><br />Other popular usages explained include the playing of audio and video. Plus the handling of digital photos. Microsoft is heavily emphasising using XP as a media centre, and the text offers you an appreciation of what is available here.	2005-10-11

Indeed, a very short introduction, with only a minimal evocation of maths background. But there is enough qualitative explanation so that you can understand the broad historical development. From the Caesar Cipher to a Simple Substitution Cipher to a Vigenere Square Cipher. Then, the text goes into modern ideas, all of which involve using computers to encrypt and decrypt. Notably the invention of the public key system. Truly quite different from all that preceded it.<br /><br />There is also a brief foray into quantum computing. Here, it is mostly conceptual; discussing the possible potential, since current implementations are very rudimentary. The text has no mention of man in the middle attacks and how to guard against these. Pity. Because while this is a very hard attack to perform, if it can done, then it is very hard to defend against. One of the promises of quantum computing is that it inherently offers a simple detection, based on quantum interference by the attacker.	2005-10-11

Read what it was like when the Web was unknown, and BBSs and Algol were cutting edge technology. The hackers seems to hail mostly from Britain.<br /><br />But the book is quite frustrating.

The idea is to transform the PC into a digital media centre. Now, to be sure, there has been a lot of hype about this kind of thing, from vendors. Here, you can see for yourself what is easily achievable by an average or new PC user.<br /><br />Many of the comments in the first part of the book are directed towards a reader who might already have been taking traditional photos for years. (Decades?)  Bond explains a photo editing package called PhotoShow. This can trivially remove redeye from your photos of people that you took with a flash, for example. With traditional photos, redeye was a constant affliction to be endured. But now, it is remarkably easy to remove. PhotoShow has many other features, of course. Like annotating a photo with text. Or rescaling and rotating the photo.<br /><br />Later parts of the book discuss manipulating audio and video. Not surprisingly, these operations are more intricate than simply editing single images. But Bond explains how, with the right software, you can also understand and apply these ideas.	2005-10-08

(Including \\"Tao of Network Security Monitoring\\" by Bejtlich.) But this \\"Real Digital Forensics\\" book breaks new ground. Not in the theoretical modelling of an attack or countermeasures against it. Instead, there are several indepth case studies, that key off data given in the book's DVD. And the latter is a DVD, not a CD. The authors needed the multigigabyte capacity to store the provided data. Even then, these are compressed. This should give you some feeling of the book's emphasis.<br /><br />The authors address a serious lack in this field. How does someone [you] gain experience analysing a real attack? Without already being employed at a company experiencing such an event? In response, the authors made several scenarios that, they claim, reflect what actual attackers would likely have done.<br /><br />This is an experimental book. There is no overarching elegant theory. You are meant to roll up your sleeves and tackle each case. En route, the book shows how, as a defender, you can use several open source packages to dissect the attack, as well as impose countermeasures. Which is another nice feature. Those packages are free. It makes your forensics education very cheap, in terms of explicit capital outlay.<br /><br />Which is not to say that the book ignores commercial forensic tools. But the authors have a clear preference for open source, with which you might well concur.	2005-10-06

Books	4	6	6	N	N	updated undergraduate text	[A review of the 5th edition.]<br /><br />Zant gives an update of his long running book on chip making. It is useful as a quick overview of the salient steps used by many fabs. The text starts with a precis of the industry's history, and, naturally, the seminal and continued significance of Moore's Law.<br /><br />The wafer fabrication pages describe the predominant Chemical Vapour Deposition method. But the book also finds space for a quick explanation of Molecular Beam Epitaxy. Though the latter is still largely a research method.<br /><br />Patterning and photolithography are vital processing steps. You should have a solid grasp of these ideas from the relevant chapters. Later steps of layer deposition and metallisation build  up the circuit.<br /><br />A lot of the text is basically unchanged from earlier editions. Since many key ideas have remained constant for decades. Rather, it has been the industry's singular success in applying those ideas to ever greater precision. Hence, the book explains why the decreasing linewidths (now in the deep submicron of around 0.18) and the move to 300mm wafers have kept us moving along Moore's Law.<br /><br />The book is roughly at an undergraduate level in material science or electrical engineering. [Professionals should seek more detailed texts.]	2005-10-06

He discusses the most recent versions 9i and 10g.<br /><br />The book is geared to both DBAs and developers using Oracle. It essentially dives straight into detailed prescriptions that should improve your coding. Kyte points out that some developers want to treat their choice of database as a black box. Sticking instead to generic SQL statements that do not assume specifics about that database. He strongly suggests that this is badly misinformed. Different databases have different implementations. Hence, having SQL code cognizant of Oracle lets you take advantage of Oracle's strengths. After all, he points out, you paid plenty for that Oracle license!<br /><br />Chapter 10 on database tables was especially interesting. While you might think a table is a table, Oracle defines 9 major table types. Each addressing an important need. Of these, the object table seems to be Oracle's response to the rise of competing object oriented databases. A nifty way to combine relational and object properties and make it compatible with Oracle's main effort.<br /><br />To the extent that the book compares Oracle code with other databases, it seems to be mostly with Microsoft's SQL Server. While IBM's DB2 gets barely a mention. And apparently none at all for the free alternatives of MySQL or Postgresql. But, typically, books on those often do likewise.<br /><br />There is something stated in the book that I cannot let pass unremarked. It asserts that with Oracle, you need to know how it works, but you don't need \\"to know everything inside or out\\". Whereas, it goes on to claim, \\"When programming in C or Java, you do need to know everything inside and out, and these are huge languages\\". Look, for C, this is demonstrably false. C is a small language, in comparison with C++, Java or C#. C has no graphics and no object oriented ability. The classic text on C, by Kernighan and Ritchie, is only 274 pages. While Kyte's book itself states that the Oracle documentation is some 10 000 to 20 000 pages. So which is smaller, C or Oracle?<br /><br />As for Java, by now the Java Standard Edition does come with many classes. Maybe, if you had to write explanatory text for all those, it might approach the 10 000 pages for Oracle. But just as the book says that you do not need to know Oracle comprehensively, so too is this true for Java. How many of you Java programmers really know all those base classes?<br /><br />The book is on solid ground when it sticks to the matter at hand, Oracle. But comments like the above on C and Java can somewhat undermine its efficacy.elf states that the Oracle documentation is some 10 000 to 20 000 pages. So which is smaller, C or Oracle?

Indeed, the ISS is an inspiring multinational effort that would scarcely have been envisaged in the depths of the Cold War. The world wide effort is instructive.<br /><br />American readers who might be more accustomed to NASA's briefings should especially appreciate the information on the European Space Agency and the Russian abilities.<br /><br />Though to some readers, the book will be a frustration. Over 30 years after the Moon landings, and this is how far we have come? Sadly downbeat.	2005-10-03

Lawson gives the Oracle DBA many useful ideas on customising your Oracle database. He pretty much assumes you already possess a reasonable background in Oracle.

It chooses to omit many descriptions of graphics classes. The focus is on the pure computational classes. You can get a fast understanding of the core of these classes. Enough to write simple programs. While 1 chapter is about graphics, it is very skimpy and you should not be encouraged to learn from it.<br /><br />A shortcoming is the lack of exercise sets. Schaum's books are often replete with these. Here, no less than in other topics, exercises are needed. The cover is somewhat misleading. It says fully solved exercises are present. Indeed. But what is also needed are exercises that are NOT fully solved.	2005-10-02

She writes for a still large crowd that is new to much of this. Naturally, the bulk of the book explains how to use the Web. She shows some of the myriad resources available, from geneology to sharing photo images.<br /><br />For searching, she describes the main search engines, Google, Yahoo, MSN etc. For Google, she gives a sidebar on how the word derives from 'googol'. But, like so many other texts, it does not analyse this further. 'Google' is also a pun on 'goggle', where that means to look at something and gape. (Goggles are spectacles, in a related meaning.) Why is it that so many writers can't go beyond Google's official explanation of its name? The name is actually quite ingenious, and more so than just their explanation.<br /><br />Anyway, on other topics, the book spends time showing how to use music, as in buying it online. Or in subscribing to satellite radio, say. Plus, she brings to your attention various sites that hobbyists might frequent, for such activities as scrapbooking and geocaching.	2005-09-30

One might have expected other texts by now. Perhaps this suggests that wxWidgets is not that heavily used? Or maybe since it was all open source, it lacked an advertising budget. So unlike Java or C#/.NET, there was no corporate sponsor to underwrite books on it.<br /><br />Anyhow, this text shows wxWidgets to be a complete graphics system. Portable across all major current operating systems. All the [remaining] unixes and linux. Plus Microsoft's operating systems. And don't forget the Mac or the PalmOS.<br /><br />A reader might immediately ask, why not just use Java, instead of C++ and wxWidgets? Well, it comes back to the efficiency issue. Java excels on the server side of web applications. But the authors explain that there is still a performance penalty compared to C++, which compiles down to native binaries. They also point out that the graphics approach in wxWidgets is to use the native widgets whenever possible. This produces UIs that the user in those operating systems will be familiar with. Whereas Java tends to go with non-native widgets.<br /><br />The length of the book reflects the reality that any comprehensive graphics system these days has to cover a lot of ground. Drag and drop, internationalisation, multithreading, dialogs and much more.<br /><br />In programming complexity, it seems simpler than the XWindows toolkit, which was wretchedly awful to learn.	2005-09-29

It offers the prospect of much finer grained inventory control and management. But along with the improving technical feasibility has come controversy.<br /><br />Lahiri gives a sober assessment of where things stand in RFID these days. The book is a primer on all aspects of the subject, and can be usefully read by someone new to RFID. He explains the various hardware elements that make up a system. From sensors, readers, actuators, and, above all, the contactless tags. A reader might be stationary, or perhaps a mobile handheld device. The latter is envisioned in places like warehouses. Simply being able to \\"point\\" a reader at a box, and get readout of its contents is a wonderful timesaver. Compared to the alternative of having to open up the box.<br /><br />For shipping containers, this ability to inventory the contents is attracting intense interest in current milieu of fears of terrorism, and what might be smuggled inside those containers.<br /><br />But there are indeed limitations in the current technology. Lahiri does not gloss over these. You should certainly pay close attention here. If you are considering a deployment, many of the constraints are here.<br /><br />The book also gives extensive coverage of the privacy issues. These vary from country to country, and awareness of your region's policies is recommended. And the book also warns that you should not expect RFID to replace standard bar codes anytime soon.<br /><br />Overall, it's a pretty balanced treatment. Very promising future.	2005-09-29

He shows how this is harder than just writing PHP to make 1 HTML page. Now you have many pages. Probably divided into various thematic groups.<br /><br />Of those groups, or tasks, he gives examples. Like hooking to a back end database. He chooses MySQL for the latter. Or, how to impose a membership system, with passwords and members-only pages. Plus, how to add a shopping cart and various payment scripts. And he shows quickly how a content management system might be used, so that visitors can read and write content.<br /><br />However, the book's coverage of Web Services is very rudimentary.  In this aspect, the prominent billing in the title is a trifle misleading. If you need a text on it, look somewhere else.	2005-09-28

The text is about what might sit above XML, in the making of a Semantic Web. It explains XML and several of its numerous subsets, like XPath, XPointer, XSLT and XLink. The union of all these is powerful and has led to XML being the most common format for data interchange on the Web.<br /><br />But the problem is that XML does not imbue meaning to that data. Just structure. This needs other efforts. Specifically, RDF and OWL. You get a detailed look at their current abilities. A hope in this field is that those languages will suffice to make Semantic Web services.<br /><br />Indeed, RDF is shown to have nice constructs, each with a \\"sentence\\" of subject, predicate and object. This rule encoding can be (and is) expressed in XML, and it can operate on XML data, given an RDF engine.<br /><br />Exciting possibilities for revving up the Web. Maybe. The question as to whether they are adequate is still open.	2005-09-28

It shows a depth and elegance far removed from those treatments. There is a beauty here in the Boolean expressions that is sadly not appreciated by enough programmers.<br /><br />Along the way, Brown explains Karnaugh maps to good detail. He also ties this into programs that optimise Boolean expressions according to various criteria. So yes, there are actual code examples, just in case you think this is all too airy fairy.	2005-09-26

Well, it's a declarative language. Most actual programming languages are procedural languages. This includes JavaScript. You'll see here quite a different style from coding HTML.

It deliberately eshews a sober tone, in presenting programming challenges. Like making a window of an arbitrary shape, like the profile of a person. We are so used to rectangular windows that this hack can be hilarious to try and show to others.<br /><br />Flenov gives a chapter on networking hacks. Imagine writing a server that, with simple extensions, could reboot its machine upon prompt by an external signal that comes in over the net. Or the server might send out passwords, based on that signal. Such a program is malware; a Trojan. Now Flenov does not actually take you that far. But he shows enough that a capable reader could extrapolate the short steps to the Trojan.	2005-09-25

Cheng reveals that Inventor 9 offers many of the features seen in those more expensive alternatives. You can use this book and its CD to cheaply learn parametric modelling. This is just a fancy way of saying that you can parametrise various dimensions of parts in your object. In doing so, you can gain greater flexibility in easily varying these values, possibly to optimise the design of a composite object using those parts.<br /><br />Inventor gives 4 types of parameters - model, user, linked and embedded. The book details the differences. But the gist of the text is to rise above the low level machinations. Instead, you can grasp and use parameters naturally in your design. Like relating cells in a spreadsheet. Except that unlike a spreadsheet, the inherent graphical ability here leads you to comprehend far more.	2005-09-25

Kaplan entertains us with an erudite tromp through the ancient world of the Greeks and Indians. He quotes from Hindu and Buddhist texts, that often wax lyrical over zero. There is also a hilarious claim that \\"the style of Indian mathematics was to assert principles rather than prove them\\". I don't know Indian history enough to say if this is accurate. But it's certainly funny. (Though maybe not to Indian readers.)<br /><br />Kaplan even takes up with quantum mechanics. Paul Dirac's successful postulate of a negative energy sea filled with antiparticles gave zero an entirely new physical meaning.	2005-09-25

While C has a simple syntax, and lacks object oriented complexity in notation, there are many nuances that catch out unwary programmers.<br /><br />A lot of the questions revolve around the assembly language-like constructs in C, for pointer arithmetic. Very easy to trip up here. And also in the related area of memory (buffer) allocation.<br /><br />If that is not enough to keep you busy, Summit also talks about issues of portability across different operating systems or across different versions of the same operating system. At least you usually don't have to worry about the version of C itself. For system dependencies, Summit covers both unix and MSDOS. While C and unix grew up together, a reality is that much C programming goes on under Microsoft.<br /><br />The references to MSDOS in the text reflect that the book was written in 95. Though even then, Microsft was deprecating DOS in favour of its newer Windows offerings. A newer version of this book might be overdue. Where Summit would no doubt discuss C under XP.	2005-09-25

She describes how Match, Yahoo Personals, Date, eHarmony and others have attracted many. In fact, Match having garnered over 8 million by the time of the book's writing in 03. The basic human urge to procreate has led to these sites being some of the few that could charge membership fees and get away with it.<br /><br />She gives case studies of several people that she interviewed. Only some of these found what they were seeking, by the book's end. But that is real life, eh?<br /><br />The book points out that the biggest problem faced by Match and Yahoo is that their most successful customers meet partners and leave the websites. No repeat business from them. Fundamentally different from eBay or Amazon. Plus, the major dating sites have no feedback on their members. Quite unlike the auction sites, where this is now regarded as standard and necessary. Yet anecdotally, the amount of exaggeration in a dating site's member's description of himself or herself is probably more so than a typical item description in eBay.	2005-09-25

Rarely in a computer science university education will much time be devoted to this crucial topic. But for the professional programmer, Metzger offers a systematic, disciplined approach. Examples are given in Java and C++. Actually, if you program elsewhere, you should still be able to easily follow the logic. He also shows how to effectively use a debugger to install breakpoints and step through code.<br /><br />Experienced programmers should not need this text. There will be little new for you.

The common linux commands have the same names as their earlier unix counterparts. And, gosh, a linux system overall is really not so different from a unix box. Gancorz explains this in detail. He discusses similarities and differences. The biggest of the latter being that each unix is a proprietary operating system. But even before linux began, many unix shell scripts and commands had migrated to most other unixes. The lesson here is that there really isn't a big culture shock in going from one to the other.<br /><br />There is a section in the book advocating storing data in flat text files, as opposed to some binary format. Hear, hear! Though the book could have added several remarks to further strengthen the case. XML has been widely adopted, in no small wise because it is expressed as text. Ditto for HTML. The easy reading and editing of HTML also helped push its success.<br /><br />Another section talks about how often portability is more important than efficiency. As in a shell script that is more portable than a slightly faster C executable, which produces the equivalent output. Just like the use of Java byte codes, versus native binaries.	2005-09-24

Indeed, Sikora offers a quick start to learning Java. He eshews an exhaustive enumeration of every core class in J2SE. Instead, he takes several high level topics and explains which common classes deal with these. A question arises. Can you indeed learn Java from so slender a book? Perhaps. Sikora teaches a core functionality. Made easier if you have already programmed in some other language.<br /><br />For graphics, he leads you right into Swing. No time wasted on the earlier and inferior AWT classes.<br /><br />For input/output, Java is more powerful than C or C++, but concomitantly harder to use. The coding is far more verbose, compared to a simple printf() or scanf() in C, for example. The minimal descriptions in Java given here are admirable in how he found the essence of enough to be useful.	2005-09-23

But it is not all abstract number theory. The recurrent theme is how to compute these and how to use primes in other computationally intensive tasks.<br /><br />The book summarises centuries of effort. Notably with Goldbach's Conjecture about every even number>2 being the sum of two primes. But intriguing issues like the density of primes along the number line are gone into. Along with the Mersenne primes and prime producing formulae.<br /><br />An entire chapter discusses cryptography and related matters. Primes are at the heart of PKI and its RSA implementation. There is even a section briefly covering quantum computing and a quantum Turing Machine. Rather sparse detail because, well, the experimental results are still very new. Only baby steps have been forthcoming. The phase coherence difficulties are formidable. But it is a potentially vast area of future work.	2005-09-23

Perhaps you already have used it elsewhere. More importantly, you should already have the basics of Perl. The book does not start from scratch on it. Though it assumes no prior knowledge of XML. It shows what can be done in Perl, to parse, change and write XML. Numerous modules already exist, especially for parsing. You really do not want to write an XML parser!<br /><br />Once you've understood enough to have your own custom XML files and be able to write Perl to read and display these, then it should get easier. Those initial steps can then easily be modified as your XML data and analysis changes.	2005-09-23

If you are a computer science student, you must learn these at a level that you can at least facilely code using them. What language you do it in is probably secondary. Well here, Lewis and Chase instantiate the pedagogy in Java. A good choice. They have updated this second edition so that it uses Java 1.5 (aka Tiger).<br /><br />They assume you have a rough working knowledge of Java. This is not the time or place to go over basic syntax. Though you should already know the basics of object oriented programming, they give an entire chapter to thoroughly discussing how to do so. In this chapter, you should pay close heed to the section on interfaces. More than many other aspects of Java, interfaces help you build modular code. To explicitly reduce the coupling between different classes, where one class might call the other. Instead of doing a direct call, if interfaces are used to mediate this instantiation, it is a huge boost to modular design. My only gripe here with the interface text is that I think it does not stress enough how useful this is. Only when you've tried to do a large project might you fully appreciate using interfaces.<br /><br />Later chapters show you how the base Java comes with a rich assortment of very useful classes. That implement queues, linked lists, lists, stacks, trees and collections. These can match or even exceed what is available on these topics in the C++ Standard Template Library. While poor old C totally lacks them.<br /><br />I suggest also that you scan closely the chapter on hashing. This is a key and fundamental idea in computing. Lets you search a table in logarithmic dependence on its size, instead of linear dependence. Another excellent Java class.<br /><br />If you want to improve your skill in Java, you need to move beyond just knowing the basic syntax and making UIs. Both these leave you exposed to junior programmers or offshore programmers. Whereas having a deep understanding of the book's topics is harder to learn.

Plus ways to publicise your content. Notably by using RSS so that others coming to your site can readily subscribe. He does not go into the full details of RSS. You need a more technical text for that. But the example RSS file given here is simple enough to convey the essence of what is involved.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he does not discuss blog spam.

It offers a grand sweep of teaching the basics of information technology. To a reader that will not major in this field. In other words, if this is a required text for one of your courses, then it may well be the last text in IT that some of you will ever use. Realistically, you will probably in later years have computer books, about whatever new hardware or software comes up. But those will usually be books far narrower in scope.<br /><br />So there is a big responsibility here. Luckily, Snyder carries it off well. This is not a book about how to turn on your PC or Mac, or how to navigate in a windowing system. He reasonably assumes that you've already learnt this by now. This frees him to discuss higher level topics. Like just what is the World Wide Web? What are the implications of a pervasive global network of computers? Whose reach is expanding daily. Naturally, pretty early in the text, we meet the Web. An entire chapter is devoted to HTML, due to its universal importance. This chapter is fairly low level detail. Most of you won't write HTML.<br /><br />Later on are perhaps broader topics. Like how to find information on the Web. This is more than just blithely typing a query into Google. He warns that there is far more to effective searching than that. You need to develop some feeling for which websites and other information sources are reliable.<br /><br />If you thought HTML is low level, he goes deeper. In simple terms, he tries to explain the innards of a computer. To demystify what must surely be inexplicable to some. He also does this with algorithms.<br /><br />Social issues are also extensively dealt with. The privacy you might have in an electronic world, and how this might come under attack through viruses and other malware. Or even by phishing. It is a good sign of the updated nature of this text that he gives an explanation of this recent scourge. And how you might avoid it. Though the suggestions he offers are all manual, and not programmatic. Which still exposes the unwary to phishing.

Amusingly, Hunter states how certain questions should not be asked of job candidates in the US, due to non-discrimination laws. But he then immediately proceeds to broadly hint (nudge, nudge, wink, wink) how the interviewer should indirectly ferret out such data, if you deem it germane.<br /><br />He then goes on to suggest that interviewees should adopt the dress of the executive and banking industries. Wretched idea. A spineless conformism. Do you want to have the chance to hire the best people or not? His advice can cause you to lose some creative and brilliant programmers who care little about a dress code or those employers who set store by it.<br /><br />Sure, some top notch people will readily conform. But others won't. And the truly talented do not have to work for you. You are competing for them, more than the reverse. For a purely, self interested viewpoint, you should not impose a dress code. Maximises your chances of getting the best.	2005-09-23

He correctly distinguishes between new technology that causes existing social interactions to be more efficient or faster, and those that make truly new social mores. For the latter, he suggests that biotechnology may ultimately fall in this category. Its potential for life saving or life extending advances may cause far reaching social upheaval.<br /><br />His views are a good counterpoint to much hype about technology. Naturally, he cannot resist remarking on the Y2K imbroglio. How this was largely puffed up in an echo of the dot com and telco zeitgeist. A fairy tale of its times.<br /><br />The book is useful in giving you a more nuanced perspective on technological change. It even dares suggest that earlier times experienced more fundamental changes!	2005-09-22

But C++ still keeps moving along. This book chronicles recent tested innovations. It describes free code in the Boost libraries, that has been contributed by volunteers across the world. Karlsson speculates that several of these classes will soon be adopted into the official Standard Template Library. Perhaps. But the point of this book is that you don't have to wait for that official imprimateur to start using Boost.<br /><br />The book's snapshot of Boost lists 58 libraries. Karlsson gives thumbnail summaries of all these. He then proceeds to explain in detail 12 of them. Space considerations dictated this. The choice  that he made is somewhat subjective. Based on my own background, I would have wished for more details on Boost.Graph. I've had to write my own code to find adjacency matrices and lists, and a comparison with what Graph offers would have been interesting.<br /><br />Come to think of it, most of the Maths and Numerics libraries sound useful. The Boost.Random might save you having to code a robust random number generator. Especially if you need one that exhibits high randomness. Maybe for crypto work? Speaking of which, look at Boost.Math. It has routines for finding the greatest common divisor and least common multiple. These are workhorse capabilities in number theory. With crypto often making heavy use of such methods.<br /><br />While Boost.Integer and Boost.Numeric Conversion may let you write safer code. So that you can better detect overflows.<br /><br />Needless to say, your interest may well differ from mine. Certainly, mine differed from the author's. But even the summaries that he gave are intriguing. And the libraries he covers more deeply are useful in their own ways. Perhaps to you, too.	2005-09-20

About 10 years ago, VRML was all the rage. But that died in the dot com implosion. In part because of the lack of computational and bandwidth ability.<br /><br />Now the technology has progressed much further, and Kim shows us interesting new possibilities. The book does not really go that far in research, however. It's more of a first text in the field, for a graduate or undergraduate level course. The material discusses both hardware and software. This field is like robotics, where hardware must always be considered.<br /><br />The so-called structured approach of the title can simply be understood as maintaining a good three dimensional model, that stays consistent as objects move around.

For the acutely interested reader, this encylopedia is well worth perusing from cover to cover. It is not that long that this is an arduous task. Nor is it that highly mathematical that you will take months doing so. The level of mathematical treatment is moderate. By that I mean it is less than in journal papers. To be sure, you need a strong maths background going in. And previous exposure to various crypto ideas, notably public key infrastructure, would be good.<br /><br />For Web usage, people worried about the rising levels of malware might see what the book offers as possible countermeasures. As ecommerce and other activities become more frequent, the possibility of man in the middle attacks increases. Plus, the incredible recent surge in phishing and pharming has led some to suggest that strong cryptographic methods for authentication of messages and web pages might be useful. Keep in mind that this is not necessarily a given. Other methods are possible which avoid cryptography. (I am the co-inventor of several of these methods.) This is something that an astute reader should keep in mind when going through the text. Step up from the details of the various crypto procedures and ask yourself if there are ways to avoid using these, and still prevent attacks. The entire mindset of this book is about using crypto. While it is a dreadful cliche to say 'think outside the box', perhaps you should try to do so here.<br /><br />There is even a discussion of quantum cryptography. Which may be an ultimate, unbreakable method, if it ever becomes feasible. The quantum systems are so delicate, especially if coherence needs to be maintained over macroscopic distances, that one might reasonably wonder about the eventual efficacies. There are two main postulated usages. One is to break an existing encryption. The other is to prevent a man in the middle attack. It is in the latter that coherence may be more of a problem. For the former, one can imagine a spatially limited, microscopic or mesoscopic system, in which the decryption is occurring.oscopic system, in which the decryption is occurring.	2005-09-17

Thus to an American reader, this book can be interesting on several levels. Perhaps as a sociological commentary on how Japanese society has accepted and accomodated the pervasive use of the phones. To an extent not currently seen in much of the US, except possibly amongst teenagers in large cities. The book is a fascinating read of how quickly an technological item has become part of the fabric in Japan. The passages on phone etiquette also suggest what might also eventuate here.<br /><br />On a business level, the book can be used for ideas into future usages, in Japan or elsewhere.

The diverse range of the essays is a good reflection of Turing's genius.<br /><br />The essay on making a self-replicating Turing machine reflects earlier speculations on what might more generally be considered a self-replicating Neumann machine.<br /><br />There is a palpable sense of loss in the book. Turing died at a relatively young age. What if he had lived decades longer? He could have seen the immense flowering of computing, in hardware and software.

It describes the high level functionality that is possible, on top of using Java as your base language. The authors choose Tomcat as the Web application server, and jBoss as the EJB application server because these are popular, open source and free. However, they point out that other servers can be used. Namely IBM's Websphere and BEA's WebLogic. Both are J2EE compliant. So if you are using these, you can still gain from much of the example code in the book and its accompanying website. While the design advice should carry over unchanged.<br /><br />All the J2EE standards are explained. JMS, RMI, JNDI... Plus also being able to use Java to read and write XML. This latter topic is perhaps not really enterprise level stuff. I'd regard it as more on the lower level of J2SE. Simply because even if you are doing a non-networked application, and so perhaps not using J2EE at all, XML capability can still be good in using data files.<br /><br />Now in 2005, Java J2SE is at version 1.5. But the book's details about deploying under J2SE 1.4 are valid. 1.5 is essentially a superset of 1.4.	2005-09-17

Not by image enhancement via Photoshop, as so many other books do. Instead, it recommends trying simple steps in the real world, that might actually be faster than several hours in front of your computer. For example, if you have a black, shiny item, then polish it so that smudges and fingerprints are not visible in the photo. And take that photo against a white background, for high contrast.<br /><br />This is the general tenor of the book. Practical, non-high tech steps. A good counterpoint to other eBay books.	2005-09-17

Currently, computational genomics is in its infancy. The amount that is known is surely orders of magnitude less than what will follow, as biologists investigate further the development process at higher levels than the DNA.<br /><br />So in a sense, Tavani hopes to raise awareness now. He discusses various problems with the use or abuse of information about people.  As computational genomics can find out more about a given person, what social ill effects might result if the information got out to unauthorised parties? Who has a right to the data?<br /><br />Plus, what if advances in understanding are made as a consequence of a person's data. Does she or should she benefit, beyond receiving any possible therapies? Bluntly, can she collect royalties from something derived from her body?	2005-09-16

Here, the topics include networking, XML and reflection. The number of XML classes is less than for the others. But they give solid ability to read and write XML data. The XML functionality seems on a par with what is currently offered in Java 1.4 and 1.5.<br /><br />The importance of the networking classes is because so much of our efforts revolve around the Internet these days. So you can find out  how to make a request to a web server using http. Plus classes for credentialling and security. There is even a neat little IWebProxy interface, for getting to hosts using proxy servers.<br /><br />Under the rubric of reflection, .NET also includes internationalisation [i18n] issues. They call it globalisation, which I think is basically the same thing. There are classes that encode culture-specific data, like calendars and languages. Microsoft has built out .NET with scads of this information. It's a global marketplace for  your efforts, right? .NET lets you take advantage of this.<br /><br />Like the first edition, the book goes beyond being a mere printing of man pages. Each class gets example code that may often be the simplest way to get a quick understanding of a common usage of that class. Plus the informal remarks help this understanding along.	2005-09-16

You know the rudiments of programming animation in some language, but want to add more realism to the actions in your games.<br /><br />The point of this book is to teach you how to go from understanding simple but useful physics equations to implementing these numerically and efficiently in your game. Probably the most obvious context are the equations of motion - where your objects obey gravity. And they conserve momentum and energy, up to a point. That is, you can build in friction into your system, for more realism. Ideally, all of this should make your game more plausible to a player, by conforming to her real world intuition.<br /><br />The book also gives extensive coverage to collision detection methods. In many games, 2d or 3d, if you have objects moving around, how to quickly see when they might collide? Efficiency is  often a key consideration.<br /><br />Having said all this, it probably does help if you have had several undergraduate courses in physics and maths. So that what the book brings up doesn't throw you for a loop.	2005-09-16

It shows how you might get email from anywhere in the world, containing spam or bogus offers, like \\"dates\\" with attractive women, or money offers from relatives of dead dictators are common come-ons.<br /><br />The book warns against other perils. For instance, the https connection is used to prevent a third party listening in on your communication with a website. Many financial websites use this, when you are presenting a password. But any website can use https. Even a bogus one. Sometimes the latter might use it, in part to fool people who think that https per se confers validation of that website.<br /><br />Phishing is correctly described as the most damaging of current Internet frauds. The book outlines characteristics of many phishing messages, and how they often [mis-]direct you to a fradulent site (\\"pharm\\"). However, the only solution offered by the text is that the reader should beware of such messages and should not click on links in any that she believes to be phishing. (Let alone enter personal data in a page linked to by the message.) There is no technical answer suggested to defeat phishing. Basically, the reader is on her own. Phishing is still a relatively new phenomenon, at least as compared to spam.<br /><br />In contrast, the book goes into a bundle of antispam techniques, such as blacklists, whitelists, signatures, Bayesians and reputation filtering.	2005-09-15

It offers numerous suggestions on improving sales on your site. Mostly, it deals with B2C sites targeting a mass audience. Though the authors also say that it applies to more complex B2B sites.<br /><br />Perhaps the best advice is simply to methodically deconstruct your visitors' pathways through your site. When you change a page or series of steps, it is imperative to quantify this effect on a sample of visitors. eBay and Amazon are justly renowned for this experimentally rigorous approach. So too should you aspire. It gives you a tangible feedback loop within which you can test hypotheses.<br /><br />The authors also have other useful guidelines. Notably, and simply, to write well the text of your web pages. Hard to argue with that. But testing is the most important idea of the book.	2005-09-14

It is not clear why the authors chose C into which to teach data structures. Of course C can do this. But other languages like C++, Java and C# could have been chosen. And those give object oriented functionality that could have been put to good use in the implementation of these structures. The book never really elaborates about the choice of C.<br /><br />Anyway, the material is clearly written. It gives good treatments of arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues. While for trees and graphs, the discussion is rather basic. In general, the algorithmic depth here does not approach the standard texts by Sedgewick, Aho or Knuth.<br /><br />The last part of the book is a set of chapters devoted to problems and their solution codes. This may have merit to you, if you have been searching for good exercise sets. A distinctive aspect of the text.	2005-09-14

This is one of the core backbones of the Internet. The book explains how the infrastructure has stood up against massive expansion since the dawn of the Web.<br /><br />Considerable effort went into reinforcing the redundancy and quick response of DNS. For those interested in such details, and in the commercial jockeying between the various DNS Registrar companies, you can turn to this book.<br /><br />As for the future, an exhaustion in IPv4 addresses looms. Eventually, we will have to migrate to 128 bits addresses in IPv6. While the domain names can remain constant, lots of behind the scenes twiddling needs to be done for a successful transition.	2005-09-14

Client side and server side. All of these have been covered before in other forums and books, but he offers a clear exposition of the dangers.<br /><br />Take SQL injection. If you do not have your web server filter the user's input in a web page submitted by her browser, and you blithely pass her string to your SQL engine, you are asking for grief. You're begging for a cracker to stuff a SQL command script to sabotage or exacavate your database. Thus too for shell command injection, where your server might inadvertantly execute that as a shell command. Remember to filter user input!<br /><br />Cross site scripting and Trojans are also explained. Unfortunately, while the Trojan discussion is understandable, it is far too short.<br /><br />There is no discussion of antiphishing methods. Though in the Trojan chapter, an example fake email would qualify as phishing. Perhaps the author saw no technical solution for phishing. And this book is about technical solutions.	2005-09-14

Like the MITS Altair 8800, widely considered the first personal computer. Of course, the Apple II is included in the book. And who can forget the Trash 80? Or the luggable Osborne? The latter was called portable. But luggable was thought to be the better term.<br /><br />Game machines like the Ataris and Nintendo are also in the book. Here, undoubtedly, many of you did indeed squander days and weeks (months?), when you should have been swotting.<br /><br />The photos are very cleanly done.

They reckon that you know Java. Which version is not especially crucial, though the text suggests 1.5. Using 1.3 or even 1.2 would still let you do most of the puzzles.<br /><br />What they provide is to probe Java for nuances usually neglected in texts that are explaining Java to a newcomer.<br /><br />A good way to use this book is to read each puzzle and then refrain forcibly from turning the page to the solution. Yes, the text is carefully arranged so that a page must indeed be turned to get at the latter. Grit your teeth and think carefully about the puzzle. No sweat, no gain.	2005-09-13

These suggestions are used by Sun in its documents and are a very clean and internally consistent guide. Of course, it is not restricted to descriptions of Sun's products. A lot of care has gone into the guide.<br /><br />Plus, the suggestions are not just for printed documents. Nowadays, a lot is expressed in languages with links, like HTML or PDF, and the advice pertains here too.<br /><br />For illustrations, you are shown how to display interactable icons differently from non-interactable images. Subtleties, to be sure. But taking these into consideration makes for a clean document.<br /><br />On the subject of documents with links, a chapter has cogent suggestions on the proper usage. Like avoiding overlinking, which is a common flaw amongst writers new to this. Also avoid linking with anchor text that is generic, like \\"click this\\". Instead, use more descriptive strings to help search engines classify the document that is pointed to. Assuming that both documents will be on the Web. But even if not, they might still be in your internal corporate web, and you might have an internal search engine spidering these. The strings will help the engine better classify both documents. This chapter may be the most vital of the book.	2005-09-13

Quite aside from the cost, I'm not sure this is so useful for some sites.<br /><br />There is some elementary analysis of your web access log. So you can get a measure of how successful your efforts are. But this chapter is very inadequate. There are free analysis tools available; instead of thumbing manually through the log.<br /><br />If you are tempted by this book, then there is a far better and more sophisticated treatment given in \\"Search Engine Marketing\\" by Moran (IBM 2005). It contains more helpful and better written details on how to write your web pages. Makes Stanek's book appear very facile and inadequate.	2005-09-13

Its attraction is the clear language and objectivity of its assessments of the myriad types of hardware and software associated with personal computing. Buttressed by technical explanations of new features, like command queuing, or how to set up a tri monitor display.<br /><br />Even if you have no specific need in mind, this guide is nice for its overview of the entire PC arena.

It brings together methods for enhancing images and manipulating video. A very visual book. The methods do not involve programming. Even the sections of designing web sites are just that. The coding of those designs is delegated to the programmer.<br /><br />The authors keep technical jargon to a minimum. Which may appeal to some readers. The methods described are not covered in as much detail as in book devoted to Photoshop, say. But one lesson conveyed here is that you don't need comprehensive knowledge to start doing useful and creative work.	2005-09-12

The author was motivated by the realisation that simply finishing a PhD was insufficient in itself to qualify that person as a good supervisor. There are issues in being the latter that simply don't arise when you were a graduate student. Avison offers this book to bridge the gap.<br /><br />Over half the book concerns matters than  could arise in any research field, not just information systems. For example, any cultural differences between the supervisor and student. Or perhaps gender issues? This is fraught with difficulties and perils for both sides.<br /><br />Later in the book is a discussion of items specific to information systems. This section actually seems the less useful to me.	2005-09-12

Its elements are an excellent overview of the most important Premiere elements. Like the Clock Dissolve, which lets you dissolve from one image to another. A highly used method.<br /><br />But the book is more than just a recital of Premiere methods. Equally valuable are the author's suggestions of good usage. Perhaps the main thing to beware is not to use a fancy special effect for its own gee whiz sake. The narrative should always make sense, and within this, you can sparingly use special effects.	2005-09-12

The book uses some rigour in asking by turnover is often so high in software developers. It posits various hypotheses, and shows the results of several surveys that tested these. The book should be useful to an IT manager trying to reduce attrition in her workforce. Also perhaps useful to the developers themselves. For it shows that their personal dissatisfactions might in fact be quite typical at other companies.<br /><br />The book also explains that developers work in a field where job changes are often seen as helpful to staying current with the changing technology. And that developers might be loyal to a project rather than a company. Both of which reduce the barriers to hopping.	2005-09-12

She takes us back to the years when the semiconductor industry was born, and shows us how Noyce helped make it flourish in Silicon Valley.<br /><br />A striking passage describes how Noyce anticipated the observation of negative differential resistance in a tunnel diode. Some 18 months before Leo Esaki in Tokyo discovered it. Esaki would win the Nobel in Physics for his work. In one of these what-ifs, Noyce could easily have taken that for himself.<br /><br />By the way, the book's explanation of negative resistance is a trifle awkward. The quantum mechanical phenomenon cannot be easily explained to a general audience. (As a grad student, I had the same problem of discussing this about my research, to laymen.) But if it puzzles you, remember that it also eluded a lot of people in the 1950s.<br /><br />You might already be familiar with the broad outlines of how Noyce, Moore and others worked for Robert Shockley, and then left en masse in disgust at his management style. But Berlin furnishes here far more detail than is commonly known. About how Noyce agonised and reluctantly left Shockley.<br /><br />Likewise, with the later tale of Fairchild Semiconductor and how Noyce and Moore would in turn leave that. This time to found Intel (with Grove). Berlin gives much more detail on this broad outline, that explains the motivations of Noyce and his associates.<br /><br />Some readers might be amused to see that the CEO of Fairchild resisted handing out stock options to employees, in the grounds that this was \\"creeping socialism\\". Which played no small part in the exodus of its best people.<br /><br />The book describes a Silicon Valley that has vanished.	2005-09-12

Notably on Turing's crucial contribution to the Enigma project at Bletchley Park during World War 2. It is no exaggeration to say that his insight into decoding the German encryptions saved the lives of thousands of Allied soldiers.<br /><br />Valuable also is a reprinting of Turing's \\"Treatise on the Enigma\\", which was only declassified in 1996.

Ceruzzi defines the modern computing era as post World War 2. His narrative shows a twist perhaps unappreciated by current readers. Nowadays, all computers use semiconductor chips. Mostly made of silicon. But the use of such chips did not become widespread till the 1960s. For the first 20 years, computers used tubes. (Yuk.)<br /><br />He explains why tubes were eventually abandoned, as being too bulky and slow compared to silicon based integrated circuits. There are several crucial landmarks scattered throughout the text. Like the invention of the integrated circuit by Kilby and Noyce, and that of the microprocessor by Hoff and Faggin. Curiously, the invention of the transistor in 1947-8 goes unremarked. With no mention at all of one of its inventors, Shockley. A grievous oversight, since he started a group, with members like Noyce and Moore, that would later prove crucial in developing the industry.	2005-09-12

The treatment works upwards from Newton's equations into the seminal Navier-Stokes equations. From these, various physical configurations, like pipes and flat surfaces, are discussed. Exact solutions are derived, where possible, and approximate solutions where not.<br /><br />Laminarity and the onset of turbulence are also prominently highlighted, with the use of the Reynolds number as the single most important indicator of the transition between the states.<br /><br />The authors also do not neglect experimental considerations.

He presents a sophisticated comparative study across several communist countries that suggests that a central cause was the rise of corruption within the governments. Where, of course, these were co-extensive with the Communist Parties of the countries.<br /><br />But Holmes argues that the corruption was ultimately only a symptom, albeit a most egregrious one. The basic cause was a lack of legitimacy of the Communist Party, other than by force. While this sufficed to bring each party into power, the decades of peace that followed necessitated a gradual moderation.<br /><br />The book goes into describing various types of corruption, as determined in the Soviet Union and other countries. Along with an indepth look at how the authorities tried to respond to corruption. Holmes also tries to suggest why the countries experienced so much corruption. Like the moderation of force mentioned above. Or an increasing cynicism amongst the nomenklatura, leading to a frenzy of each person for himself.<br /><br />Holmes does not compare the effect of corruption between the communist countries and, say, several developing countries like Nigeria, Congo or Indonesia. Where it has been cited as one of the main causes of continued mass poverty. Though perhaps this would usefully be the subject of a later book.	2005-09-11

Books	4	1	1	N	N	issues are still being played out	In the euphoria of the end of the Cold War in the 90s, this book raised a discordant tone. Its authors offered evidence that Russia and its ethnic Russian majority still yearned for the imperialism that was the Soviet Union.<br /><br />This neo-imperialism was investigated in several of the book's papers. Where the targets were considered to be the 'nearest abroad' [Ukraine, Belarus and Baltic], the 'near abroad' [Caucasus, central Asia and Moldova] and the 'far abroad'.<br /><br />The book gives interesting views into the struggle within Russia, as it tried and tries to come to accept a diminished status. In the time since the book came out, the borders have remained stable. But the issues are still being played out.	2005-09-11

The state mostly relegated women to be homemakers and to have children.<br /><br />There are hilarious passages on what the communist government deemed to be the 'socialist family type', instantiated by a father, mother and 2 or 3 children. But this was not so funny to those, especially of course women, who did not fit into that idealisation. Say if a couple divorced, for example. Corrin studies how this negatively impacted the woman's self image, mediated as it was by a strong societal stereotype.<br /><br />Her book is a serious and critical analysis of Hungarian society in the post war era.	2005-09-11

You need to be disabused of one thing. The speech recognition on the Mac that this book refers to is far, far from the science fiction depictions of interacting with an intelligent machine.<br /><br />\\"Yeah sure, I know this\\", you might reply. But for many who have never used speech recognition packages, there may well be this subconscious expectation. Let's be clear. The recognition in some products amounts to recognising simple words or phrases that are commands. So instead of using your mouse to popup a menu and pick an item from it, you can the item. Neat, but far from being able to say a complex phrase and have it \\"understood\\".	2005-09-11

And how Karabagh became the site of a small war and an ongoing refugee problem. At least for American readers, they might have some familiarity with this issue, due to the large Armenian-American diaspora.<br /><br />Another chapter shows the turmoil in Georgia, around the Abkhazia  and South Ossetia regions, that led to more turmoil.<br /><br />The book also discusses how Turkey and Iran are drawn, perhaps reluctantly, into the troubles, as each tries to advance its interests.<br /><br />You get a good education into the complexity of the issues, and an anticipation of future conflicts.	2005-09-11

Well, actually, given that the book was written in 1993, the transition was still ongoing then. However, 12 years later, it can be reasonably said that the events described in the book turned out well, overall.<br /><br />For example, some articles discuss how the state owned enterprises [SOEs] were moved from government ownership to be privatised. While the process certainly had hitches, there was not the wholesale looting by oligarchs as seen in Russia.<br /><br />The book ends with speculations on prospects of integration into the west European economies. Much of this in fact came true, and Poland later easily joined the European Union, as the strongest of the former communist countries.	2005-09-11

Somehow, these had to be either shut down or converted to civilian uses in a market economy. A daunting problem.<br /><br />The book's editors present papers on how to deal with this conundrum, written in 1993-4. The interesting thing about the book is that such suggestions were not from US analysts, but from Russian and Ukrainian experts. Various routes to privatisation were put forth. The social obligations of defense factories were also a complication. Many had to support the towns they were in, as an explicit responsibility. Naturally, this greatly increased the difficulty of selling off the factories.<br /><br />Different ideas are explained in the book. Like technocratic conversion. Where a defense factory would have a civilian subsidiary that made civilian products. Letting the parent still keep an expertise in arms production.<br /><br />A readable account of the myriad difficulties.	2005-09-11

The book is a good attempt at peering into the future of mobile computing. In part, it does this by looking at the recent past, and the various projections made then about upcoming mobile trends. These predictions are evaluated against what actually happened. A sobering comparison. A lot of hype happened in the 90s dot com and telecom era. And mobile computing spanned both fields. Resulting in massive overbuilding of telecom networks and overbidding for 3G licenses. Billions of dollars, euros and yen were squandered in those efforts.<br /><br />So one lesson from the book is that predictions are always fraught with uncertainty. Hopefully, this engenders some caution and humility amongst the authors of the book's papers, and in the reader.<br /><br />The book studies future mobile technologies and wonders how these might turn out. Useful research ideas. Though nothing I read here really seemed to be a gripping, Eureka-type vision.	2005-09-10

For using feeds, making feeds and mixing feeds. Most readers will probably deal with the first part and maybe the third part.<br /><br />Using feeds is explained as being able to aggregate data from websites offering these using RSS or Atom methods. From which, you can see how to recast the output into HTML pages for your website. Or maybe send it to your mailbox. Actually and more realistically, to the mailboxes of those who visit your website and ask for this feed.<br /><br />Orchard deliberately does not go much into the fine distinctions between the different and incompatible RSS standards. Or likewise with the various Atom formats. More technical books can discuss these points ad nauseum. But Orchard is aiming this text at a programmer who just wants to put together a news feed, and does not really care about lower level details.<br /><br />Making a news feed is the second part of the book. Only a fraction of readers will head here. It's not easy to produce original content, after all.<br /><br />The last part of the book is essentially an advanced continuation of the first part. You are shown how to embed higher level logic into processing the feeds. With an extensive example on using a Bayesian to try to identify news articles that might be of interest to your readership. Be aware that the Bayesian method is not perfect. Occasionally,  you might get an incongruous article.<br /><br />Definitely, Orchard has produced a nice programming book. (In Python.)	2005-09-10

The book makes for dry reading. Looks like it was written by a committee. But it presents a global picture that is possibly the most comprehensive available.<br /><br />There are interesting observations here, with massive implications for certain countries, and ultimately the entire world. Sometime in the next few years, before 2010, the world's urban population is expected to surpass the rural population. For the first time in history. In subsequent years, the trend will continue, with urban growth in the less developed countries rising. In total, the book projects that in 2030, the world's urban population will be 2 billion more than currently. With most of this increase in the developing countries. The developed countries should see only a slight net increase in their urban populations.<br /><br />For the developing countries where the urban growth is expected, how will they cope? Many already have overcrowded cities. With inadequate sanitation and housing and jobs. The jarring expectation of still more masses is the central problem facing many governments. Hopefully, the book might be used by those governments, as a guide to these trends. Though the book really does not go deeply into discussing how to alleviate the trends.	2005-09-10

It attempts to educate the reader in the common types of malware and cyber attacks that are now seen globally. The scope of the threats vary. Some are the equivalent of graffiti on billboards. Breakins to computers just for the heck of it. Hooliganism, as the book calls it.<br /><br />But there are more serious attacks. Phishing-style, for example. Where financial fraud is being tried on an unwary user. No adequate technical answer is given to this by the book.<br /><br />Further along the scale of severity is cyber terrorism, or even cyber war. These are disguished by the former being done by groups unaffiliated with any government. While the latter is, or might be, performed by one government on another. Thus far, few real and damaging examples of cyber terrorism have surfaced. Nuisance value events that might be construed as cyber terrorism have occasionally surfaced in recent years.

He develops the concept of assembly programming, with plenty of examples for the reader to understand. Plus, he then takes the next step in showing the evolution of computer languages. By showing how C code can be implemented for hardware interfacing and microcontrollers.<br /><br />For the hardware being interfaced to, Reese makes the standard choice of an analog to digital converter and a digital to analog converter. Some things never change. I remember in 1982 a course in microprocessors where we tackled the same problems.<br /><br />The idea is for the student to get a good grasp of how software ultimately is expressed in controlling a piece of silicon. The microprocessor is a Neumann architecture. So the ideas here can be seen to apply all the way up to supercomputers that use the same architecture.<br /><br />Even if the reader is intent on programming higher level tasks, the book gives good grounding in showing how code optimisation can work at the lowest level.	2005-09-10

There are several out there, proprietary or free. Here, Hatch explains in depth the free PostNuke system. It's a spinoff from PHP-Nuke, an earlier free CMS. (Though the book doesn't really go into any comparisons between the two.)<br /><br />PostNuke uses PHP and the MySQL database. If you like, you might consider PostNuke to be a very \\"webby\\" way of accessing MySQL. It is laid out in an explicitly modular fashion, with each component describing a block of functionality. Hatch shows how this partitioning is in no small part responsible for a lot of its success. Many independent developers have been able to easily put together modules specific to their websites. Several chapters are devoted to examples of these modules. A chapter each on user interaction, communities, online gaming and money making. Within these chapters are numerous case studies.<br /><br />It would certainly help you if you were already cognisant of PHP and HTML. Knowledge of MySQL is also good, though not as important. The module coding is in PHP, and that is where most of your time will be spent.	2005-09-10

But Taylor gives enough explanations of various key applications. Like Postfix and Procmail and SpamAssassin. This is still not a simple book. For example, SpamAssassin's classification of an email as possible spam is a statistical assessment based on a set of rules typically seen in spam.

Choosing which of these to use to implement your web site application can be very difficult. The problem is that most texts are each about a particular choice of technologies. In contrast, this book offers a vendor neutral analysis of the main offerings. Which is the best virtue of the book.<br /><br />The authors explain the main methods for remote application development. Like Remote Method Interface [RMI] or Remote Procedure Calls [RPCs]. Heavily pushed by Sun Microsystems and others during the 90s. Also in that decade was the rise of CORBA and SOAP. These addressed the problem of code compatibility, when a program written in one language wished to call a routine in another program running on a different computer. Alas, CORBA's binary nature and overall complexity was soon revealed.<br /><br />Then the book surveys the more recent Web Services. This has garnered its own slew of acronyms and standards - WSDL, UDDI, WS-BPEL etc. Just trying to keep a coherent picture of all this is very daunting.<br /><br />Plus, let us not forget Microsoft's massive push into .NET, to compete with Sun's J2EE. There is much common functionality between this. Though .NET binds you to Microsoft's operating systems, and J2EE can be used outside Sun's machines.<br /><br />Kudos to the authors for trying to help us through this mess.	2005-09-10

Perhaps the most distinctive aspect is its YaST [Yet another Setup Tool]. Readers experienced in unix will recognise parallels with AIX's SMIT. Here, YaST lets a sysadmin who might be inexperienced with the linux command line cope with the complexity. By hiding it behind a user interface, that can be either terminal based or X Windows based graphical mode.<br /><br />YaST has a simple and useful grouping of typical common sysadmin tasks. Notably installing and removing software and patches. But it's not just for software. YaST is shown to handle hardware configuration, of various types of devices like CD drives, graphics and monitor, printer, scanner and so on.<br /><br />Actually, even for an experienced Novell linux sysadmin, you might well be inclined to use YaST whenever possible. A great time saver. Understand though that it won't help you when there are very specific and specialised tasks, where these might involve custom writing of scripts, for example. But the point about YaST is that it frees up your time to concentrate on those harder problems.	2005-09-08

There have been numerous specialised books on robotics, going back decades. Almost always from a research perspective, and dealing with once-off custom designs. Yet in the last 2 years, a toy robot, called Robosapien, has proved wonderfully popular in the mass market. Samans shows why Robosapien can be considered more than a toy. Perhaps even a tool for advancing robotics.<br /><br />The book blends two themes. The predominant one is how to modify your Robosapien. Samans explains the deliberately extensible nature, which appeals to many tinkerers. It is rare, indeed, for a mere toy to be so open. Typically, a toymaker locks down the toy, and might even sue any hacker with the gumption to publicly tweak the toy. But here, Robosapien's maker [WowWee] takes the completely opposite tack. The book documents some of the numerous ways to indulge your tinkering. Notably including using your personal computer as a controller.<br /><br />But the book also explores another theme. It uses Robosapien as a case study of a different approach to robotics. Designed around BEAM - biology, [analog] electronics, aesthetics and mechanics. The idea is to seek inspiration from biological evolution, since the best ideas may well have been tried out and found successful in nature. Then, these are reimplemented in mechanical form, preferably using analog electronics to control the functions. Instead of having a master CPU that has code to handle every possible contingency, which is impossible.<br /><br />The first theme turns Robosapien into a seriously cool hacker's dream. The second theme turns the book into somewhat of a textbook, that may well be more persuasive than many robotics tomes.	2005-09-08

With various projections made by the author's company. Yet you may want to be cautious. A lot of the data about companies can now be easily obtained on the web for free. The basic financials and specialisations and product lines should be accessible this way.<br /><br />Now, for a small IT firm, getting enough information on it via the web can be problematic. But this book won't give it to you anyway. It only covers the top 500 IT firms worldwide, with an emphasis on US firms.<br /><br />Perhaps only if you have found in the past that the trends projected by Plunkett were accurate and useful for your needs, should you contemplate getting this book.	2005-09-06

Speculating on possible new types of businesses that might arise for mobile computing. And the technical constraints of current and future systems.<br /><br />The authors rise about issues about current 3G deployment, or lack thereof. Instead, they ask what might constitute an improvement. What the authors are really looking for is another killer app. Something so viral that millions of users will gladly and quickly adopt. Unfortunately, none of the speculations seem that compelling thus far. No fault of the authors. Though perhaps if you really had such an opportunity, you would surely try to raise funding to implement it, rather than write a research paper.	2005-09-06

No pretty colours or fancy graphics. Just a slim compendium of diagnostic hacks to be performed, probably under conditions of high stress. Lucas assumes you have some prior networking experience with TCP/IP. He claims you don't need much actual experience with a Cisco router to use this book. His reason is interesting. Those routers need to work continuously and in practise they and your network often do. Until an occasional breakdown. But the high MTBF means you might have little actual hands on with the router. Ironic, eh?<br /><br />It should be said that the book is not really about what to do if the router is bad. Rather, it is about the more realistic case where something has come unglued on your network. Lucas shows how the router can be an invaluable tool in tracking down the problem.	2005-09-06

If you are worried about the threat and want a reliable source of information, that is not alarmist, then consider this book. It describes not just phishing, but various technical countermeasures that have been attempted. Alas, the long and short is that most of these are of limited utility.<br /><br />A blacklist of known phishing sites is vulnerable to zero day events - the delay from when the messages go out and when the site is identified as phishing and taken down by its ISP.<br /><br />A two factor hardware gadget scales badly when people have accounts at several financial firms, and also at places like eBay or Amazon or other online retailers. There is no standardisation of these gadgets, even in the banking industry. Imagine having to carry around 5 or 6 of these for your accounts. Not practical.<br /><br />The authors suggest examining the HTML source of some suspect messages. This depends on the user correctly identifying those messages. Then, the source can be very confusing to anyone not experienced in HTML. The source for the mail pages at Yahoo and Hotmail, for example, are very intricate, due to all the links and ads they put around the message.<br /><br />Various toolbars are described in the book. These use heuristics (rules of thumb) and blacklists to try to assess if a web page or email is phishing. The blacklists have the defect noted above. And the heuristics are subjective.<br /><br />Then there are the various email authentication plans. SPF, Sender Id and Domain Keys. But these authenticate the sender. They say nothing about the contents of the messages. Any of these will not stop spam, let alone phishing. Plus, the industry has not been able to agree on even one of these as a standard.<br /><br />Encryption is mentioned in the text. But expecting users to be able to handle encrypting and decrypting the bulk of their messages is hopeless. Beyond the ken of most of them, who do not even understand the significance of the various browser certificate warnings that they currently get.<br /><br />User education is stressed by the book. In part because of the lack of effective technical answers. Yet here, some percentage of naive users will always be with us. And they are disproportionately vulnerable to the phishing. Plus, the phishers refine their methods. Towards perhaps setting up pharms that are very convincing. And maybe using man in the middle attacks with these pharms.<br /><br />By contrast, there are over 10 anti-phishing US Patents Pending, co-invented by me, that are qualitatively totally different from the industry methods given in the book.

He explains the very latest 2006 version of AutoCAD. Necessarily, in an introductory book, he does not go very deep into the full extent of AutoCAD. But given just a minimal maths background on your part, you should be able to quickly lay out simple two and three dimensional objects using his advice. That maths mostly involves a good grasp of trigonometry and algebra.<br /><br />If you are already familiar with the 2005 or earlier recent versions of AutoCAD, then avoid this book.

This subject is one of the key conceptual underpinnings of computing. For those of you desirous of a deep understanding of the complexity of a problem or algorithm to solve a problem, then the text furnishes good explanations.<br /><br />All the classic problems are here. Knapsack. Travelling salesperson. And various black box approaches. The key demarcation in the text is between a problem that is NP complete and one that can be solved in polynomial time. But a virtue of the book is that even with an NP complete problem, it may well be possible to derive approximate solutions that are polynomial complete.<br /><br />It's certainly not a simple book. Some of the problems are very hard. But that leaves room for you to improve on the current methods of solving them.	2005-09-05

The trendy, made up word 'infotech', that is used in the text as a 'cool' shorthand for information technology. Maybe indeed at some time in the future, infotech will become the accepted term. But right now, it has minimal usage. Ah yes, and then there is the 'speed of innovation'. Clearly, thought has gone into the title.<br /><br />The text itself is based on a report by the authors in 2000 for the US Department of Commerce. In fact, instead of getting this book, I suggest you read that 2000 report, at technology.gov/reports/itsw/Digital.pdf. While the book has updated material, the bulk of it is unchanged from 2000.<br /><br />In the 2000 report, the authors analysed anticipated demands for IT workers in the US, based on various IT labour market trends. Of course, the dot com era ended that year. Followed by deep retrenchments in IT, and a parallel growth in offshoring. In this respect, the 2000 report may actually be more useful to you than the 2005 book. Because you can now assess how accurate the authors were in 2000. If you think they are still worth reading, then perhaps get the 2005 book.	2005-09-05

Especially when there is already AutoCAD 2005 out, and AutoCAD 2006 will be released soon? The tardiness of this book is a little strange.<br /><br />Ok, if you are new to AutoCAD, then you need to learn the basics. And in all probability, the majority of the book's explanations about the 2002 version will apply to the 2005 and 2006 versions. AutoCAD has been out long enough that the basics of two and three dimensional modelling are well established and stable. So the book won't be a total loss, if you already have it.<br /><br />Then again, if you haven't gotten the book, try a different, more up to date version. You should not have to get a new book for every AutoCAD annual revision. But getting a more recent book means that you can usefully retain it longer than this 2002 book.	2005-09-05

While many users consider the Internet and the Web to give unfettered world wide access to any resource on the net, the reality may sometimes differ.<br /><br />The book has case studies of the policies of several countries - United States, Italy and Germany. Reinforced by further analysis of Canada, India, Brazil and Switzerland. All these are democracies. Yet it is interesting how even between democracies, national policies can still make a difference. To some readers, the most interesting comparisons may be between the US and India. Between the largest industrial democracy and the most populous democracy. For India, enabling affordable access, especially to its lower income groups, is a key driver of its policies. By contrast, the US has been relatively successful in propagating access to most of its communities. In India, this is just starting. With all the current to-do about offshoring, especially to India, imagine if they could fully educate their people and put most of them on the web.	2005-09-04

In a sense, the book describes a cusp. Ten years ago, when the Web was still young, it was mainly the technologically adept who used it. But now, in the developed countries, and increasingly in many developing countries, it is a mass medium. It has gotten this way partly by being easy to use. But also because powerful usages have emerged, that are attractive to many. Like searching for information, or auctions.<br /><br />The book offers insight into how this incorporation is proceeding. With suggestions as to future directions. Possibly driven by more [unexpected?] usages that have yet to be developed.	2005-09-04

He offers to teach you two dimensional drawing with what has been for years a fully three dimensional package. He asserts that in the headlong drive into three dimensional design, something might have been lost in the education of engineers. Namely a firm grounding in the ability to do two dimensional layout.<br /><br />I cannot say that I fully agree that this has been a deficiency in recent education. But perhaps for some students it has. If so, you may want to turn to his book to cover this deficit. The book should not be hard, one hopes. 2d stuff is much simpler.

The book looks into how effective long distance teaching and learning can be, when you do this with the Web. The contrast is with traditional teaching, where the instructor and students are in the same classroom. And also with the earlier implementation of long distance education - doing this by correspondence.<br /><br />The Web can give far greater immediacy and feedback than earlier long distance methods. No surprise. But consider the word 'communities' in the title. It means more than just a student asking questions of the instructor. The book also looks at the extent to which a community can exist amongst students who have never physically met. Again, the Web offers great promise. Thus far, it is hard to quantify solid numbers for this effect. But plausibly, the Web could indeed enable this new form of education.	2005-09-04

But its appeal is not just to the user. Reyes explains how it was made from the ground up to be easily extensible by programmers. He illustrates this at length, with over 150 hacks developed by its fans. These are grouped into sections like performance, menus and navigation.<br /><br />But you may want to try and thumb through the detailed contents and then through the hacks, to see if any catch your fancy. Because the book can be used in two ways. Firstly, to get ideas about new extensions, by seeing what has already been done. (A lot!) Secondly, to scope out if any of that earlier work is worth installing on your machine. To either end, the book naturally refers to websites where the extensions can be found. The book is a hardcopy portal.<br /><br />You should also be careful. The very flexibility of Firefox can mean trouble if you go to a computer at a publicly accessible place and use it there. Think of a library or cybercafe. Several of the extensions can be used by a phisher to mislead what you see when browsing. Firefox on your machine can help protect you, and the book talks about this. But on an unknown machine, some extensions can be turned against you. The book never talks about this aspect of Firefox. It's not the fault of the author. He's part of the Firefox community. They are all so fired up about it. Which is cool. But they largely neglected to consider that its ease of programming can be a weapon turned against the unwary user.	2005-09-03

It will not teach you Microsoft Access in 24 hours, for example. There is a lot covered here, and if you are new to Access, it will certainly engage your attention for some time.<br /><br />In essence, Schneider does not \\"just\\" teach you Access. Learning it is also about learning SQL and designing relational databases. Access is Microsoft's front end to its SQL Server database. The book shows how it is a very powerful user interface that eases the design and building of a database.<br /><br />For instance, Access has forms. Powerful constructs that let you input data and test this data for the underlying tables. You can put built in checks about the validity of the data that will be typed into a form. A trivial but important example might be that a box in the form that should expect an integer will indicate an error if a number with a decimal point is entered, or if letters are entered. Schneider points out that checks like this makes data input far more efficient. I would differ only in saying that perhaps he does not emphasise this enough. While you, the database designer, can have the most intricate sets of interrelated tables, this avails little in practise if the data entry clerks type in contaminated data. All your planning can come to nought. You should spend time beefing up your forms with as many checks as feasible.	2005-09-03

It is rare to see a book as detailed as this on infiltrating a Microsoft machine. Hoglund and Butler give a serious, hard core technical account of several ways to subvert the operating system by the successful installation and running of a rootkit. A slight irony here. The \\"root\\" in rootkit refers to the super user's account name on a unix machine. But the market reality is that Microsoft machines dominate the desktop.<br /><br />A key appeal of the book is the amount of example code that helps you, the programmer, understand how a rootkit works. While the book certainly gives good high level descriptions of rootkit strategies, the examples make these flesh.<br /><br />To some of you, it will be saddening to see that certain sections of the book omit those examples. Possibly the authors wanted to veer on the side of caution on those topics.<br /><br />There does seem to be a slight tension in the book, regarding who would use it. Black hats or white hats. The authors stoutly claim that sometimes you can have perfectly good reasons to design and deploy a rootkit. Granted. But undoubtedly, others will derive nefarious utility from the text.	2005-09-03

In this field, X10 is by far the dominant controller. Soper explains why, by describing numerous varied ways to have it control items in the typical household. It is probably simpler to read this book than thumb through the official X10 documentation. Soper does not require that you have a deep technical background to implement the book's methods.<br /><br />Aside from the specific automation methods, he also offers a chapter on planning what you might want to and be able to automate in your home. Here is where you can start, to devise an overall plan, in a top-down fashion, rather than plunge into hooking up one or two gadgets. That can come later. The chapter is good for helping decide, especially within the constraints of a budget, which surely applies to many readers.<br /><br />The book also points out a strong point about the latest X10 devices. These can be wireless, hugely easing installation. No awkward and unsightly wires trailing along your floors and walls.	2005-09-03

Essentially, Miller has made an illustrated guide to computer usage.<br /><br />Not just of the software. The book carefully starts off with step by step explanations of the various common hardware parts. With photos showing explicitly how to plug your machine together. Miller is taking nothing for granted here about the user's background.  Don't laugh. Even the starting steps of where do I plug the keyboard cable into? And the mouse cable?

Well, Shimonski gives it a hearty try. Actually, I'm sure the title is tongue in cheek. Absorbing this book will take most readers longer. But only a few hours at the most.<br /><br />He has managed to strip unix down to a core of simple and often used commands. Mastery of which takes you through many common unix situations. If you come from a Microsoft or Mac background, what may strike you about this book is the almost total absence of screen captures. Where'd the GUI go? Culture clash, you might say. The reality is that historically, unix arose before bitmapped consoles. But, even today, as you should hopefully understand from the book, you can be more productive at the command line.<br /><br />Speaking of GUIs, though, Shimonski does briefly explains X Windows, which is the native windowing system of every unix implementation.<br /><br />The deliberate brevity of the book means that he can only touch about each topic.

Can it really replace Microsoft Office for some of you? These are the key questions that the book addresses. Many more people use Microsoft Office than OpenOffice. And if you are one of those, you've probably built up an expertise in it. Plus, you have files written in those formats. How easy is it to migrate?<br /><br />Perry deals with this at great length. He goes through each program in OpenOffice. Explaining how to use it, assuming no prior knowledge on your part. The most important of which is probably Writer. In an office environment, that is what most of us do. Perry reassures you that OpenOffice understands the Microsoft file formats for Word, Excel, PointPoint or Access. More than anything else in the book, you need to appreciate that you are not giving up much (if anything) by moving to OpenOffice. You can still read those legacy files, and you can write documents in those formats and send to others using Microsoft Office.<br /><br />Interoperability is a key virtue here.<br /><br />Now as for the OpenOffice programs, they are no more difficult to learn than their Microsoft counterparts. Serious sweat has gone into making them as intuitive and powerful as possible. All the common operations that you might expect in a word processing program or spreadsheet are here.<br /><br />Note that OpenOffice does not guarantee an exact functional mapping from Microsoft Office. So there are indeed steps you can do in the latter that are not possible in the former. But for most users, these should be uncommon operations.<br /><br />The book and its CD also cover Firefox and Thunderbird. But more as an afterthought. While the coverage is well written, it tends to be less detailed than about OpenOffice itself. I somewhat agree with the previous reviewer, who considered these to be a bit of an add on to the book. Nonetheless, it was competently done by Perry.	2005-08-31

Inspired no doubt by competing texts that can often reach $100 or more. This book is one of the alternatives.<br /><br />One might ask, how can this text be so cheap? Is the student or the instructor giving up anything by using it? Well, for one thing, there are savings due to no colour diagrams or plates. These can add considerably to the cost. Or, more cynically, they are an (extra) excuse for the publisher to jack up the price.<br /><br />Another saving is that the black and white figures are often maps. While the figures that are of paintings, say, are credited to the Library of Congress. I am not sure, but perhaps the latter does not ask for a royalty from the publisher.<br /><br />What it means is that this text is in some way like a text from 30 years ago. When colour figures were still relatively rare, due to cost. Plus, most of this book is plain text, that you actually have to read. Imagine that! Contemporary texts have a surfeit of colour, and not just in the figures. You know, coloured boxes of emphasised text etc.<br /><br />As to the actual text in this book - it is well written and easily read. You give up nothing by using this book. Also, the very topic of American expansionism means that the multitude of maps is very apropos. You can get a sense of manifest destiny that imbued this growth.	2005-08-26

When massive social and technological changes transformed American society. Most of the book concerns not so much the political events, vis a vis other nations, but the internal fluctuations and tensions inside the US, that often drove societal changes.<br /><br />Commendably, he also offers incisive analysis of the literature and arts of this period. Bundling all this in a chapter called \\"The Culture of Affluence\\". Indeed, the time span is long enough that we can now reasonably though cautiously take a measured understanding of such events. Many of which now have the glow of nostalgia in the popular memory.<br /><br />One might also wonder if the author will live long enough to write a third edition. While the coverage in the book ends around 1995, shortly after the Cold War. In the benefit of hindsight, that was a very natural stopping point for the narrative. Well, we all know what has happened in recent years. It will be interesting to see his comments in a future edition.	2005-08-26

He focuses on Latin America, where in the 90s, military rule tended to be replaced by elected governments. The book goes into the interplay between a president and the parliament. In the process, Jones also investigates the difference in this relationship, when the legislature is unicameral or bicameral.<br /><br />There are also differences in how the legislature is elected. By proportional representation or a winner takes all in each seat.<br /><br />His book could well do with an updating of the intervening 10 years. This is about double the time of existence of several of the democracies. Which, perhaps surprisingly, have all survived the interim.	2005-08-26

He shows that you can do many things in linux that can be done in other operating systems. Notably, the use of OpenOffice, in place of the Microsoft Office suite.<br /><br />The most contentious point of the book is probably the author's choice of the linux distribution [\\"distro\\"] that is on the CD accompanying the book. He advocates Linspire, a commercial offshoot of Debian linux, and that is what you will find on the CD. Personally, I don't distinguish [much] between the linux variants. But to some of you, Linspire will be problematic.<br /><br />Without going into the pros and cons of Linspire, those of you who object are probably not the intended audience anyway. If you know enough about linux to prefer another version, then you don't need the book. The more basic point is that if you're new to linux, Linspire is a perfectly acceptable choice. And I say this as a user of the Red Hat and Fedora variants. Besides, Linspire is a variant that explicitly and strongly targets users with a Microsoft background. Offering a transition that is claimed to be as painless as possible.	2005-08-26

It covers a time when the US struggled to patch itself together after the Civil War, to its emergence as a global power by 1900. And thence into intervening crucially and decisively in two world wars. Plus the protracted struggle of the Cold War.<br /><br />What this means, for example, is that the discussion of the US in the world wars is necessarily abbreviated. Little detail about battles like Midway and Leyte Gulf, except, more or less, to say that they occurred. Instead, the book devotes considerable space to the home front - the domestic American experience of war.<br /><br />It does offer an interesting coverage of the sinking of the Maine, which precipitated the Spanish-American War. The US went to war, blaming Spain for the sinking. But within a few years, that view fell out of favour in the US, with an inquiry concluding that the sinking was accidental. Indeed, most current history books that cover the period offer this as the explanation. However, the book points out another inquiry, decades later, by Adm Rickover, that suggested terrorism. It says that whatever contemporary view might be held also reflects the events of the current period.<br /><br />The most recent events covered by the book are the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. The book was printed shortly thereafter, and little substantive could be added about the events and their consequences.	2005-08-25

Loss surveys the popular American media in the 1960s. He shows how it echoed and in turn fed back on the burning issues of the times. The Vietnam War and the civil rights movement.<br /><br />There is discussion of politics at the Federal level, with the actions of US Presidents being key events. But Loss manages to tie this all into a narrative that also encompasses analysis of the rock and roll scene and the counterculture.<br /><br />The book is aimed at an undergraduate or high school reader, as a quick synopsis of trends that Loss traces back to 1945 and the emergence of the US from the Second World War. He hopes to whet the reader's appetite for more detailed reading of these vast topics.	2005-08-25

As the editors point out, traditional biographies have focused on white, male, Anglo-Saxon examples. But in counterweight is offered this book. Hopefully, the reader will gain an appreciation of the complexity of American society.<br /><br />The choices in this volume may include people unfamiliar to you. [Which is a salient strength of the book.] Like Sarah Evans, an educator and elected official [sic] in the 1890s, when women had no vote. Or Susan Picotte, the first Native American female doctor.

The essays let you compare across countries the performances of these parliaments and their interactions with the rest of their governments. The book studies what are arguably the four main countries - Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Mexico.<br /><br />It should be said that the inter-country comparisons mostly have to be done by you. Each chapter is written by a different author, and focuses on a particular country.

To further shorten their other text, \\"America's History\\", by almost 50%. Yet they seem to have succeeded. The book has a logical narrative flow. That does not feel like a standard text. Quite expertly done. When you consider that very disparate topics are covered. Like reform in the Progressive Era, or the emergence of the US as a world power. But somehow, each chapter segues gracefully into its successor.<br /><br />The book also starts each chapter with a human interest anecdote. To try and bring the chapter's theme down to an easily comprehensible scale. And thus to motivate the reader into absorbing the broader mass of the chapter. The book is well suited for a general audience.	2005-08-25

The field is still developing rapidly. Plus SOA has by now subsumed many standards or specifications. The totality of which is daunting to assimilate.<br /><br />Erl does a formidable job in helping you overcome these obstacles. In essence, he shows that SOA has 3 main parts - a service, its description, and messages that pass between services. Where a service encapsulates a piece of logic that is meant to be modular and reusable. This per se is really little different from subroutines, which have been with us since Fortran and Algol. After all, think of all those massive Fortran libraries that have been built up for scientific and engineering uses. But with SOA, a key difference is that the parts or players are inherently distributed over a network. Unlike the monolithic Fortran executables.<br /><br />The book shows that SOA potentially lets you build a loosely coupled, distributed system. Where the messages and descriptions play the pivotal part in enabling this. And these rest on XML, as the base technology. You should be versed in XML prior to commencing this book, especially with the usage of XML namespaces in defining terms.<br /><br />Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of SOA is the messages. These can have high levels of detail (and security), which can offer suggestions as to routing and meaning. As well as providing for authentication and tests for non-modification during passage. All this lets the services be stateless, inasmuch as the messages can encode stateful information. The statelessness enhances the modularity and the composability of SOA networks.<br /><br />Also, if any of you have had experience in writing client-server programs, using Remote Procedure Calls, then the loose coupling of SOA can be attractive. RPCs invariably led to a tightly coupled system that was often hard to maintain and modify.	2005-08-24

These were the bleak years for the Allies, and Britain's actions might be understood in part by remembering this.<br /><br />The events in Yugoslavia during those years are shown by Trew to be very tangled. Bitter struggles between the Chetniks and the Ustashe, who were the Croat fascists. Plus there was often conflict with the Muslim Bosnians and with the neighbouring Italians, who eyed parts of northern Yugoslavia.<br /><br />Trew's book will be valuable to those wanting original source documents for the times. By way of comparison, there are 200 pages of text, followed by 130 pages of references, where these are often original sources.	2005-08-20

The book addresses several of these issues.<br /><br />Like privatisation, probably the most important. Under Communism, the state owned all the property. So when Communism fell, how to hand this over in an equitable fashion to the people? The book describes how Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary handled the matter. Different solutions, but related.<br /><br />Overall, and with the hindsight of the intervening years, it could be said that those countries did a fair and credible effort. While not perfect, they avoided the wholesale handover to the oligarchies that occurred in Russia.<br /><br />The book also delves into the establishment of a stock market in Hungary. While in established capitalist countries, a fundamental justification of a stock market is to enable small, growing companies a means of attracting capital, that was not the case in Hungary. Rather, it aided in the privatising of large companies, that were formerly wholly government owned.	2005-08-20

The papers in the book were written in 1992 and 1993, shortly after the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe. At that time, there arose speculations about the possible routes that the newly independent countries might take, both politically and socially.<br /><br />The book discusses various possible implementations of free market liberalism. And the desirability of these, concomitant with varying degrees of social justice or a welfare state. Some chapters naturally tend to be discourses on the philosophical underpinnings of democratic capitalism.<br /><br />Amusingly, perhaps, the word capitalism is largely deprecated in the text, in favour of liberalism. One might speculate that capitalism still retained an undesirable aura, after decades of Communist rule.<br /><br />Enough time (already!) has elapsed since the book's publication for you to mull over the accuracy of the authors' musings.	2005-08-20

Where this economy was not at the level of western Europe, but still more advanced than the Third World.<br /><br />Specifically, they considered how computer numerically controlled machine tools might spread throughout the Hungarian manufacturing sector. In retrospect, this was a good choice. CNC tools were indeed an advanced technology, driven by progress in computers. But they were also applied in a traditional industrial context. So there was plenty of Communist-era data to compare against. In part, this reflected the Communist preference for heavy industry, and the tangible metrics of productivity those engendered.<br /><br />Hence, CNC tools offered the possibility of improved quality and quantity, where these could usually be readily measured. Which drove their adoption throughout Hungary.	2005-08-20

I'm from the linux/Java world, and am familiar with Ant. So the NAnt discussion was very relevant to my experience. Holmes explicitly says that this book is not a comprehensive guide to the abilities of either package. But in some ways, while not comprehensive, it may well be better than a text devoted to either [or both]. You can see in Holmes' text, very plausible ways for why and how you can use those packages. Going through the chapters, he delves into a detailed practical application. Helps you build a context in which you might use the tools for yourself.<br /><br />I was unfamiliar with CruiseControl.NET. But ended up being impressed with how it lets you do this agile, continual integration. On the broader issue of explicating issues in code delivery, I tend to agree with a previous reviewer, Koskela. Who stated that the book doesn't give a bigger view than that of the tools. Though it certainly does that well.	2005-08-19

(2nd Edition)	Books	4	11	12	N	N	has a bootable linux CD	[A review of the 2ND EDITION, August 2005.]<br /><br />A nice feature of the second edition is that it comes with a BOOTABLE CD. Another linux enthusiast, Klaus Knopper, came up with a popular variant of linux, now named Knoppix, that can be booted from a CD. Gagne uses this approach so that you can \\"test drive\\" much, though not all, of what he shows in the book. In other words, on your Microsoft computer, you can boot off the book's CD and try the various linux applications and environment for yourself. Without having to install linux or do anything to your existing Microsoft installation. Cool.<br /><br />The utility of this is hard to overstate. If you have no background in linux, you might naturally be trepid in converting to it. But now, you are not limited to just reading the text and admiring the screen shots. You can actively try out the Knoppix linux desktop. And the OpenOffice applications that come with it. These have much of the functionality of the Microsoft Office suite. But OpenOffice is free. Gagne stresses this. A very capable free word processor. Ditto for a spreadsheet. Etc.<br /><br />Linux even has a portfolio of games. Gagne describes a bunch of them. Poker. Mahjongg. Solitaire and others. Comparable to the default games that come with a Microsoft operating system. Though, in fullness, you should be aware that the latest non-Microsoft games, especially the twitch ones, tend to be written for the Microsoft platform. There are not really that many powerful, popular games for linux.	2005-08-16

It is most certainly not. SEO has a well deserved reputation as being one of the shady neighbourhoods of the Web. Moran and Hunt are not two smarmy coves wanting to beguile you about \\"chasing the algorithm\\".<br /><br />Rather, they explain what this SEO thing often boils down to. The many subterfuges that its proponents practise, to gin up their search engine rankings. Or, the SEO \\"experts\\" sell these techniques to naive or complicit customers, under the promise of higher organic rankings. (Organic refers to rankings that are not paid for.)<br /><br />Moran and Hunt describe several common SEO methods. Like having the web server recognise a search engine's spider when it visits the website. Then, the server returns the spider a page different from what a human in a browser would get. More elaborately, another method involves forming a link farm. A set of websites, perhaps run by different owners, that cross link to each other, in the hope of beefing up their page rankings at the search engines. Often, these link farms are characterised by links that do not arise naturally out of the text of a page. Instead, you usually get a set or table of links to \\"partners\\". Furthermore, these links are typically for very non sequitar topics.<br /><br />The authors strongly urge you not to go down this route. Instead, they advocate something your high school teacher told you. Write text that is as interesting and useful to a reader as you can make it. They discuss many more subsidiary details, but this is the gist.<br /><br />Ultimately, it is these eloquent and useful writings, in the form of your web pages, that will attract links from pages that are themselves highly ranked. Even if you have to manually beseech those other pages' authors to consider adding a link to you. Because they will read your pages, to assess if these are of any interest to their readers. Also, when regular readers read your pages, the better those are written, the more likely a reader might buy what's on sale, for example.<br /><br />Good writing improves your bottom line.<br /><br />En passant, pages 346 and 347 have a lovely summary of the war between the search engines and the search spammers.

But she is often expected to understand and apply common statistical analysis on data, especially if she is a graduate student.<br /><br />Patterson offers a relatively easy approach for her to acquire this knowledge. By using spreadsheets, like Microsoft Excel. Or, for that matter, she might even use the free OpenOffice spreadsheet. These now come with many common statistical functions, to compute mean, standard deviation and other metrics. Plus, a spreadsheet can often display tabulated data, in various graphical forms, like bar graphs or pie charts. There is no need to learn a language to find the statistics, and another language to graph the results.<br /><br />Another benefit is that the spreadsheets are now widely available on many personal computers.

So the code given in the recipes should be easy for you to follow, even if you're still fairly new to this game. Of course, you can always copy a recipe if it solves a problem of yours, without worrying about the mechanics of the code. But it's good to be able to understand what it does in detail.	2005-08-13

Hopefully, you should find it easy to follow. HTML's rapid success was due in no small part to this ease of use. It is also not a procedural language, though sometimes it is mistakenly called that. What Barksdale shows about HTML is that it is a declarative language. That is, you say that certain text should be written in a given colour or font style or size, and at a certain relative location on the page. You tell the browser what you want shown, and it has to implement that.<br /><br />But Barksdale goes beyond HTML. As a display language, it is very limited. Whereas he shows how you can use JavaScript as a client side [ie. running on the browser] language, to perform actual programming tasks. JavaScript is a good functional complement to HTML, as you might appreciate.	2005-08-13

Smith focuses on more powerful and also more complicated methods available within CS2. [Though as an aside, the moniker CS2 seems so clumsy. Like an HP product label.]<br /><br />Of these, perhaps one of the most powerful ideas is layers. That you can compose an image out of several layers. Where each layer can essentially be manipulated independently of the others. And the objects in a layer can thence be moved around, relative to another layer, until you get a satisfactory juxtaposition.<br /><br />It is worth your time to thoroughly study what Smith has to say about layers. Because without layers, an image is often no more than a collection of coloured pixels. Layers are like object oriented programming, to use a rough analogy.	2005-08-13

Enough to get you productively making simple three dimensional objects and manipulating their properties.<br /><br />But, if you are migrating to AutoCAD 2006 because you need a new feature within it, you should probably consult a more thorough text. Chances are that the latest features are refinements that most new users would not be dealing with, and thus not covered by Omura.	2005-08-13

Neural networks get a detailed explanation.  You can see how back propagation is used for feedback in setting the weights. The level of detail is sufficient for you to understand and use a third party neural net package that you might acquire. Possibly, it may be enough to let you code your own package from scratch.<br /><br />Other methods are also outlined. Like auto-clustering. This finds any clusters [broadly defined] in the data, without much tweaking of parameters.<br /><br />Evolutionary ideas like genetic algorithms are explored. Very powerful, though coding these can be tricky.	2005-08-12

IBM has put out a copious amount of documentation on each, and on how they fit together. Yet the sheer amount of this can be daunting to assimilate. Which is where this book comes in.<br /><br />Hoskins provides an overview that is readily understandable. Plus he appears to be independent of IBM, which gives him more leeway to make objective assessments.<br /><br />I'm reasonably familiar with the WebSphere, DB2 and linux that he describes. In these alone, IBM has invested massive resources. His description of these 3 squares with my knowledge of them.<br /><br />The overall attractiveness of On Demand is still unresolved by the book. IBM and others are promoting this utility-type computing, to only limited success thus far. You should also note that On Demand is a marketing term by IBM that seems more intuitive than autonomic computing or utility computing.	2005-08-11

As the Web becomes more heavily used, it attracts attackers or predators, who often look for novice, unwary users. The book explains how people often let down their guards when conversing with strangers on the net. Where this communication might be via email, Instant Messaging or other modalities. It has been observed that the anonymous, remote nature leads some people to confide things that they would not to a stranger they met in person.<br /><br />Anyway, Andert offers practical suggestions to limit your exposure through such inadvertant actions. You are also warned to beware of giving up too much personal data on some purported web site, or in a response to an email. The data might be sufficient, possibly in conjunction with other facts that could be amassed about you, for someone to forge your electronic identity.<br /><br />Perhaps, though, Andert could have omitted the \\"911\\" from the title. Very US-centric. Other countries don't use this as the emergency phone number. It detracts from the global appeal of this book.	2005-08-11

For the latter, we see glimmerings already in economic-oriented websites like eBay, or more general websites like craigslist. Or even in the massive multiplayer role playing domains. The latter may in fact be currently the most comprehensive virtual communities on the net. So he discusses what they might look like, decades hence.	2005-08-11

Perhaps music or graphics or video or text? Or combinations thereof. If so, then Seitz suggests that you should be concerned about protecting your content. Especially given the continued rise of peer to peer networks like Kazaa, Morpheus or Napster. These have been responsible for massive unauthorised copying of music. It is also expected that video copying will increase as more users get broadband and computers with bigger disks to store the video.<br /><br />Seitz explains various methods of embedding a discreet watermark into your content. In such a way that it does not degrade, say, the visual or audio aspects of the content. But so that if you or your agent comes across a file with suspected unauthorised content of yours, then this can be easily verified by checking the watermark.<br /><br />Of course, someone on the other side can try to remove the watermark. So much of the complexity of watermarking revolves around trying to defeat this.<br /><br />Seitz offers his book not just to a programmer who might write the watermarking code, but also to the author or artist who creates the content. You can get a valid understanding of the level of current watermarking methods, and their limitations.	2005-08-11

The idea is to investigate any correlation between a country's levels of literary and its long term economic performance, where the latter might be measured by per capita GDP and the annual growth rate in it, for example.<br /><br />The survey was done in several major industrialised countries. Canada, Germany, Poland, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and US. The survey studied 3 types of literacy - for prose, document and numbers. The prose literacy concerns dealing with everyday textual material. While document literacy is about more formal situations, like job applications or being able to read a bus schedule. The numeric literacy deals with the ability to handle simple chores like balancing a checkbook.<br /><br />The survey also divided its participants into several occupational groups, some blue collar, some white collar. In general, groups with higher social status or income tended to have higher scores in all 3 metrics. No surprise. The survey also compared these groups across countries.<br /><br />The sheer amount of data summarised in the book is impressive. Very useful as source material for policy makers.	2005-08-09

Almost by definition, an elite is difficult to get to.<br /><br />But, after some travails, the authors were successful to some extent.

In doing so, and aiding its growth, has been the use and development of several languages. Naturally, Schafer starts with the language that birthed the Web - HTML. Actually this needs its dual (\\"twin\\") on a server, http. But Schafer discusses http in a later chapter devoted to CGI.<br /><br />Hopefully, you should be able to appreciate that HTML is simple. In fact, of all that the book discusses, HTML is the simplest language. Several initial chapters walk you through HTML. It must be stressed that mastery of HTML is needed to make sense of the rest of the book.<br /><br />The later languages either extend the scope of an HTML file, or they generate the file, roughly speaking. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) lets you easily factor out common definitions that are used across multiple web pages, where you can imagine that each web page corresponds to a file storing it. Schafer explains how to use CSS to simplify management of a set of HTML files. A centralised way to set common fonts and the like. More robust.<br /><br />But HTML is a declarative language. Good, because laymen can more easily understand and write such languages. It's easier to say what should be done, than how to do it. But for the times when you need more expressive power on the browser, Schafer offers JavaScript. A procedural language that actually has nothing to do with Java. [The coincidence in names was a marketing ploy.]<br /><br />Schafer does not ignore the server. CGI is given, as the first generation attempt at server side code. Its limitations spawned the use of Perl, PHP and Python for easier parsing of user input and generation of new dynamic pages.<br /><br />Each of these languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Perl, PHP and Python) is often the subject of its own book. No surprise then that Schafer explaining all 6 gave us a book of this length!	2005-08-09

The book is mostly directed towards undergraduate students, who might desire a precis of the subject.<br /><br />He goes through elementary probability theory. Rolling of dice. What randomness means. The Gaussian [bell] curve of the normal distribution. Chi-square distribution. F distribution. Plus, very importantly, how to test hypotheses with some rigour, given these tools.<br /><br />While the maths is certainly still as true now as in 1976 when Henkel wrote the book, you may want to consult a more recent and more comprehensive text. The graphics in his book are rather limited. I used texts like that as a student, and they don't bother me. But current students are probably more used to texts using far more elaborate figures. In part this reflects cheaper printing costs. But also overall, it has probably yielded statistics books that are easier to understand.	2005-08-09

A compilation mostly drawn from dead societies. Much of this reflects decades of research by dedicated scholars, who sweated over deciphering Mayan glyphs. A task initially thought to be impossible.<br /><br />The book also shows that the terms used in the Americas of &#34;Hispanic&#34; or &#34;Latino&#34; are totally inadequate and insulting when describing those who still have some nature heritage. Those labels are of the European adventurers [or freebooters or imperialists].<br /><br />Reading the deciphered poetry and narratives shows a richness that does not hark to Castile or Cadiz.

These are both usually in the real world context of you travelling to some place. That's why you're getting a laptop, right?<br /><br />The battery situation can be frustrating. He warns not to lose work. Depending on your choice of laptop, power consumption might be an issue. The faster the laptop, the more power it uses. There is a complicated reason to do with CMOS technology used in most of the laptop's microprocessors, where the power consumption is proportional to the clock frequency. But the main thing is to be aware that speed comes at a price.<br /><br />As far as hooking up to the Internet, Gookin shows that things are reasonably easy nowadays, and getting easier. The latter is because more wireless access points emerge in cities, and more hotels, libraries etc have wired access. Remember to change the default passwords on any networking software you run, before having it go out on a strange network.	2005-08-08

But Thomson shows that indeed Photoshop's virtues extend to this sphere. It will probably surprise a few of you as well.<br /><br />I should say straight off that Thomson will not convince every calligrapher. In such a traditional field, the ambience of holding a fine fountain pen, the aroma of the wet ink on the page, and the tactile feedback of writing your mark on the page will dissuade many from Photoshop's offering.<br /><br />But there are others who might be interested. Calligraphy is, or it can be, a form of art. And by now, Photoshop has ensconced itself in the palettes of many artists. Likewise Thomson shows that if you focus on the pure imagery of the calligrapher, then Photoshop can take you there.	2005-08-08

And they are still not fully realised. Essentially, the book asks if, at some future time, our interaction with computers will fundamentally change.<br /><br />Our current interaction modes may one day be regarded as hopelessly primitive and awkward. Technology constrains us to, most commonly, a keyboard and mouse. Speech recognition is steadily improving, but is not quite as robust as it should be.<br /><br />The book speculates that maybe we might interact with a computer that assumes a \\"persona\\" or character. A radical departure from what we do at present. But much has to happen. At the very least, heavy improvements in artificial intelligence are needed to buttress that character, so that it can interact meaningfully with us.	2005-08-07

He is also a fluent writer, who has refined this long running text into its 6th edition.<br /><br />The content is by far mostly the same as the 5th edition. When he explains the basics about the layout of a computer in a uniprocessor architecture, with memory chips, disk drivers, motherboard and the like, then the details don't change from year to year. Obviously, newer, better items emerge continuously. But the ideas covered in the earlier editions are still very much germane.<br /><br />The book is not just about hardware. Norton then shows what is software, and the myriad types that can run on your machine. Which elides gracefully into networks of computers and the largest of all, the Internet.<br /><br />If you already have an earlier edition of his book, you may want to forgo this one. But otherwise, his book is well worth consideration.	2005-08-07

An excellent and up to date handbook on the burning issue of protecting your digital content. The burgeoning popularity of p2p networks like Morpheus and Kazaa for unauthorised copying and dissemination of audio and [increasingly] video gives urgency to the issue.<br /><br />The book's chapters fall broadly into two types. One is about encrypting your data so that only authorised customers can access these with some type of key that you furnish.<br /><br />The other main theme of the book is watermarking or fingerprinting. I use the terms synonymously here. Here, the problem is not so much copying, but for you to later prove that a particular file contains your content. There's some bloody ingenious stuff in these chapters. All about surreptiously embedding a watermark that does not detract from the content's functionality. So that, for example, if it is your audio file, a listener won't notice any degradation. Likewise in imagery. But you can expect a technical opponent to remove your watermark. If it is a JPG file, perhaps he might compress it slightly, and hope this does the removal? The chapters go deeply into this back and forth of tactics.	2005-08-07

You might naively think that cellphones work, so doesn't that prove the thesis? Certainly, cellphones are vital to this discussion, in part because the cellphone networks underwrote the research and development that proved that one type of mobile network is practical and easy to use.<br /><br />But there may well be other types of networks. For remote Internet access, say. And when users move from cell to cell, the problems of updating the user on the network are not simple. The book also goes into how to efficiently send non-trivial amounts of data to a moving user. Caching issues can be very difficult.<br /><br />The book has many challenges that you might want to research.	2005-08-07

Moore offers in plain language a sober analysis of how the music business works. He discusses issues that many amateur musicians might be unaware of.<br /><br />Plus, a contract offered to a new, hitherto unsigned band is often badly skewed in favour of the label. The band has very little leverage and it's not a level playing field.<br /><br />Moore also discusses the typical cut from the royalties. Taken by the label for the cost of promotions. Like mailing free CDs of the band's music to radio stations and reviewers. Unwary musicians often don't realise how much of their already minimal royalties can get eaten up this way.	2005-08-06

When it did so, it was soon regarded as a classic. The intervening years have done nothing to diminish that assessment. Turkle has updated it to form this second edition.<br /><br />By and large, her analysis in 1984 proved on the mark. As computers have improved in power, and become smaller and more portable, their users tend to identify with them. And here it should be said that the cellphones of today are considered, and are indeed, computers in the context of this text. Certainly, a typical cellphone has a raw computational capacity exceeding the personal computers of 1984.<br /><br />To some readers, the most puzzling thing may be why some users so identify with their computers, or half-jokingly, attribute personalities to them. There seems to be some innate urge in many people for this.<br /><br />Needless to say, suppose we project out another 20 years. The trend is for more such behaviour. The sophistication and personalisation possible in those future mobile machines makes this inevitable. And this is even NOT assuming any breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, which might endow the devices with true personalities.	2005-08-06

The predominant theme of this book seems to be uncertainty. The Web has shaken many professions, and library science is one of these. A rather sleepy discipline that has been used to centralised control of databases has been jolted into stress. Not the least because search engines are now most people's first resource for finding information.<br /><br />The essays speculate as to possible ways the profession could go. But there is an optimistic note. If information becomes universally available and pervasive, then there might be a greater need for those who understand how to look for trusted data, and how to navigate the Web in an intelligent manner that a search engine cannot yet aspire to.<br /><br />It should be said, in passing, that the issues in the book are not confined to US or Canadian libraries.

For all the power of the latest computers used in encryption, they are merely idiot savants.<br /><br />Given the author's background, it is a pity that he could not have striven to write more, about strictly declassified matters.

Well, actually, the prospect of such. In practice, of course, the player loses, on average. So it really is instant losses.<br /><br />But unlike real, physical casinos, an online casino has much less labour overhead. And no need to build a billion dollar edifice in which your customers play. So an online casino has some advantages over its offline counterparts. It also has disadvantages. Of those gamblers who go to Las Vegas, for example, many do so for the physical experience. Like being in a group, going to a different town, seeing the floor shows and so on.

Its papers are very short and are mostly meant to be thought provoking, as opposed to being scholarly papers submitted to peer reviewed journals.<br /><br />There was one amusing comparison in one paper. Between people browsing on the web and pigeons trained by Skinner. A light hearted but not entirely joking analogy that pokes fun at the shallowness of much web browsing. Such, the web now puts the world at your fingertips. But most users never aspire to any deep purpose, given the richness of access. Are most of us pigeons?	2005-08-06

The images are boldly coloured and sometimes just seem to reach out and grab you by the lapels. The tour is actually fairly brief, in terms of the coverage of XP's features. But in fairness, Maran is not offering a comprehensive exposition. Instead, for the beginner, she deems it more important to convey the typical common tasks that you will want to do. Later on, you can consult a more detailed text for the extra stuff.<br /><br />The text is also well suited to a young audience. Though by no means limited to them.	2005-08-06

Unlike some other books, this does not start with the description of what a single computer is. Instead, it starts at the network level, by explaining in simple terms the Internet and the World Wide Web. It shows why the two are different. Whereas the reader might well regard these as synonymous, she now learns that the Internet in fact predates the Web by over 20 years.<br /><br />This putting of the Internet and Web first in the book is telling. It acknowledges that for many people, the computer exists primarily to access the network.<br /><br />But of course, the book should, and it does, go on to explain the hardware and software of a computer. The hardware is the classic single CPU Neumann design. The software is shown to be the operating system and applications that run on it.<br /><br />The book also contains numerous exercises that help the reader assimilate the ideas in the text.	2005-08-06

In plain language, adorned with only a minimal of jargon, he helps you plan and install your network. Where this can be purely wired, wireless or a combination of both.<br /><br />He also draws your attention to network security. Especially if you have wireless nodes. Without care, these can be easily detected by someone wardriving around your neighbourhood and then used as her connection to the Internet. If that's all she does, you might say, what's the big deal? But there is no assurance that she will merely use your network as a passive conduit. She might also launch attacks against your machines. The book suggests how to protect yourself.<br /><br />It's really not that difficult to set up your net. Perhaps the best advice about this book is simply to get started on it. That initial hurdle may be the hardest.	2005-08-06

Sherman offers instructions into how much you can do with Google. Way beyond its signature searching ability. Perhaps the most obvious and successful is its news feeds. An excellent way to read from newspapers all over the world.<br /><br />Also, in its regular searching, Google stores old versions of many pages it spiders. Sometimes you may find this useful, when a website deletes some of its content before you got to it.<br /><br />Plus, there are the thousands of newsgroups. Ironically, some of these predate Google and the Web itself. They hark back to when the Internet communication was a much simpler text-based mode.<br /><br />For programmer types, Sherman explains the Google API. Which lets you write code that programmatically hooks up to Google, without the drawbacks of screen scraping.<br /><br />With several of the Google options that Sherman describes, it is unclear what profit Google ultimately makes out of them, beyond just mindshare. But I guess its search profits are so lucrative that it can afford to bleed on these other options.	2005-08-06

Who would have thought when eBay started up, selling trinkets, that jewelry would rapidly form a multimillion dollar niche? Not a small niche at all.<br /><br />Gordon goes into the practical details for both buyers and sellers. The book's paramount theme seems to be how to avoid getting ripped off. Unsurprising, considering the high valued nature of the items. For professional sellers, detecting fake buyers is vital to staying solvent. Whereas real buyers tend not to do this as a profession. So while a buyer might suffer a loss due to a fake seller, it's not like being put out of business.<br /><br />But, if you follow her guidelines and use some common sense, you should have good chances of a successful transaction.	2005-08-06

Far more useful to job seekers, and perhaps even more lucrative to Weddle. Perhaps the only reason for the book is to target a readership that is unfamiliar with the Web.<br /><br />But for people who regularly use the Web for work or socialising, having a website that can have the latest data, and which is highly searchable, unlike a book, is far better.	2005-08-06

Giaglis gives a systematic study of mobile businesses that currently exist in major countries. Of these, the vast majority involve the use of cellphones. The key issue is what makes some applications successful and others not? On such answers are millions of euros, yen or dollars bet.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest question mark is the US market. The largest single national market in the world, as measured in US dollars. (Though the Chinese cellphone market now has more users, their revenue is much less.) In the US, will applications successful in Japan, Korea or Europe also succeed? It's a little frustrating that he does not discuss this to greater extent.	2005-08-06

For example, Bradley offers suggestions regarding finding information about people on the net. Helping you craft more directed queries to the search engines, for example.<br /><br />Plus, he explains how there is still a lot of information not accessed by the search engines. Commonly called the hidden web. [Think Lexis/Nexis or the Science Citation Index.] Typically you can get paid access. His advice is useful in explaining the existence of several large commercial caches, and how you might get to them.<br /><br />Then, he also talks about meta search engines. That take a query and spin it out to various actual search engines, and collate the results for you. Very useful.	2005-08-06

He describes the DES, which stood for over 10 years as the definitive method for encrypting data. We see how this attracted the strenuous efforts of some very talented cryptographers to break it.<br /><br />The book is worthy in showing some of the personalities involved in this struggle, if one might use that term. It puts flesh on what are otherwise often just journal papers describing breakthroughs, but which often give little information about what it takes in people to discover or invent such things.<br /><br />Look, most of us will never meet cryptographers in person. So this book may be a good substitute.	2005-08-06

She addresses this to the sysadmin or IT manager.<br /><br />She points out that one of your most vulnerable points is when your users are targeted by social engineering. She cites phishing as a particularly virulent incarnation. More generally, you need to educate your users against bogus inquiries, by email or otherwise, that try to get them to divulge such data as their passwords.<br /><br />Then various types of electronic attacks are explained. Typically to try to gain root access on a unix/linux machine [or the equivalent on a Microsoft machine]. To fight this, you can use various Intrusion Detection or Intrusion Prevention Software. Some of which is free open source, others are proprietary.<br /><br />There is a good description of Denial of Service attacks, and their worst form - Distributed DoS. Countermeasures are available, though somewhat limited.<br /><br />You are also well advised to run a virus scanner and update its signature database frequently from its vendor.<br /><br />In short, Harrington offers much practical advice.	2005-08-06

Seiter may be correct. The Internet has certainly seen its share of hype in all types of fields. And the education of young children is one of these. Much of the so-called educational opportunities available on the Internet to them are rather limited, as Seiter points out in her analysis. In part, this may be because vendors cannot figure out a viable business model, since their audience has no or little direct purchasing power. But the more compelling reason may simply be that an effective educational website is far harder to develop than might be apparent. And that no one to date has succeeded in doing so.<br /><br />So what we are left with is the equivalent of commercials masquerading as education.	2005-08-06

Maybe the best aspect of Warren's book are the numerous examples it cites of actual fraud mail. He writes for a reader who is a novice with computers. It is such a readership that is most vulnerable to all sorts of electronic fraud attempts. The good news from the book is that you do not have to be some sort of computer guru to avoid falling for electronic scams.<br /><br />Warren describes what might arrive in your email. Purporting to be from a relative of a [dead] important person, offering you a commission of millions of dollars if you will help him or her. There are other types of come-ons in your mail. All seeming too good to be true. This is where the book's education is useful. Basically, if it is too good to be true, that tells you something.	2005-08-05

But Matthews took the approach of emphasising illustrations showing what you can do with Photoshop. A natural fit, given what it is used for.<br /><br />So, deliberately, the amount of textual content is relatively minimal. Instead, you are shown in detailed graphics how to accomplish common tasks. Like touching up images. Or cropping or rescaling. Along with very little jargon to learn.	2005-08-05

Email and browsing are the most prominent. The first two killer apps. You can see that the Internet and the Web are not synonymous. Though many people use the terms interchangeably. It was the development of HTML and its partner, HTTP, that gave rise to browsers and the World Wide Web.<br /><br />The book also explains other usages. Always striving to minimise the technical jargon. Though you do get enough of the latter to at least now have some understanding of what they entail.	2005-08-05

Trying to learn it can be formidable. So naturally, along comes a Dummies text to alleviate the pain. As with all the books in this series, no prior knowledge of the topic is required of you.<br /><br />But perhaps it is telling that the book is over 600 pages long. Even in an introductory text, this shows that you can learn a lot about its \\"special effects\\" [if I may use that phrase]. The writing style is deliberately casual, and the use of jargon is minimised. Of course, the reference nature of the book is the main reason for its length. But Obermeier shows that much of Photoshop is understandable even to a new user.	2005-08-05

Instead, they present cogent explanations of why and how you might have a virtual team in your company. A common reason is to reduce expenses. As offshoring continues, it might make sense to have some members be from and in a country like India or China. Plus, having a project being worked on 24 hours a day can mean a quicker time to market. And that can be more important than the salary savings.<br /><br />The authors point out many practical problems that can arise when you try having a virtual team. All these might be resolvable. But that is by no means guaranteed. The book's suggestions do offer aid, that may be germane to your company.	2005-08-05

The expected audience for this book is a reader from electrical engineering or computer science.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, the Internet gets a lot of attention. Graves goes through the OSI model, explaining in detail what each layer does. There is usually a chapter on each, to give you an idea of the amount of detail involved.<br /><br />Given the Internet Protocol, various higher level protocols are explained. The alphabet soup that includes ARP, RARP, DHCP, FTP and HTTP. Where the latter is the crucial one that gives us the Web.<br /><br />Not that the book is exclusively about the Internet.

A wide gamut of ideas.<br /><br />For example, there is a good discussion of new clustering techniques. Closely related, and in practice inseparable, are visualisation methods that can be applied to such clusters. The sheer mass of information in the clusters makes strong visualisation a necessity for a manual comprehension of the data. If nothing else, it can be used to see if the clusters make sense, in the context of your application. The text describes an example implementation, to retail data. But a careful reading of the methods show that they are potentially quite general.	2005-08-05

Okin offers a more indepth explanation of what the Internet is, and how it grew. At a level very accessible to the general reader.<br /><br />He traces its development from the ARPANET and the early days. When email was the first \\"killer app\\". Though the term is an ananchronism, and would not be invented till over 20 years after email. Email catalysed the first growth of the Internet, helping it spread to many universities and a few computer companies.<br /><br />Okin then explains how, and still very recently, in 1991-2, the development of HTML and HTTP and the writing of the first browsers became the second killer app. This gave rise to the World Wide Web and the exposure of the Internet to a mass audience.<br /><br />He offers a technically accurate and readable narrative of a still growing Internet.	2005-08-05

In some ways, the \\"multimedia\\" in the title is unduly restrictive. It is the \\"networking\\" which conveys the broader scope of the book.<br /><br />The book also tries to look forward. Several authors offer their ideas as to future trends. It's a tossup how these might turn out. But overall, the book conveys the dynamic, freewheeling spirit of the Internet.	2005-08-05

Where these are driven by an increasing focus on knowledge intensive skills.<br /><br />It posits that several roles will have to adapt. Learning is seen as being increasingly not just the formal primary and secondary schooling, plus perhaps a tertiary degree. Instead, it is meant to be an ongoing lifelong activity. This will require a recalibration by educational institutions, as to who their customers are. Expect an increase in \\"adult education\\" extension courses, over and above what already exists. Plus, that even the definition of an educational institution might change. In part, to reflect a growing online pedagogy.<br /><br />People will also have to change their expectations. The book delves into suggestions that people must expect and be willing to seek out new sources of skills.<br /><br />To some extent, all this was discussed decades ago. By luminaries like Alvin Toffler in his seminal \\"Future Shock\\". Well, it is a bit of a shock to realise that here we are in the 21st century and some of the earlier postulated changes did happen and are happening.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see how the book's ideas play out.	2005-08-05

In other words, there is nothing here about any unauthorised key sequences or third party plug-ins that actually let you cheat. [Not that you would do that, eh?] Rather, the intent is ultimately to sell more copies of the game. Not of this book. By showing you more sophisticated abilities and strategies inherent in the game.

Mann shows at length how there is massive promise for enhancing the quality of life for elderly and disabled people, via the intensive use of computerised technology.<br /><br />The book delves into the many possibilities. Consider the ability for an electronic bracelet, say, to monitor its wearer's vital signs. It could summon assistance across a wireless network if the person suffered a heart attack or stroke.<br /><br />Or take a person confined to a wheelchair. Now, some wheelchairs can climb stairs. Still pretty rare and costly. But this might change for the better. Also, the person might be able to control more of her home surroundings, like opening and closing doors or windows, via electronic means.<br /><br />In perhaps the most extreme case, a person might be very paralysed. Here is perhaps the greatest possibility for lifestyle improvement, separate from medical advances on that person's condition.<br /><br />Without understating the effort that has yet to happen, the book is a very promising glimpse of the future.	2005-08-05

Just a few years ago, the very idea of an online auction site that anyone could use would have been pure science fiction. Then along came eBay. Now we have this book, which is not even about the general experience of selling or buying on eBay, but just on taking photos of items you want to sell. Talk about specialised!<br /><br />Yet the authors have a very valid point. It has been recognised that having a well taken photo, or several photos, of an auction item can tangibly boost the number of bids and ultimately the final price. [Quite independently of this book, there have been studies of eBay auctions that have quantified this effect.]<br /><br />To this ends, the book gives many tips as to optimising those images. Having a well lit object, perhaps in a pleasing background. Or sometimes, if an object can be scanned using a flatbed scanner, doing that instead of using a camera. Certainly, a scanner is usually easier and quicker to use. So when should you do so?<br /><br />The authors' judgment about the esthetics of the photos seems pretty good. While you might quibble about a few of their assessments, it's mostly very common sense.	2005-08-05

He warns of the increasing encroachments against your computer. The biggest single danger is that this might be your home computer. Not a computer at your workplace, for which you might be able to ask a sysadmin for help.<br /><br />So it's you and Tittel against the 3 menaces. Be aware that the terminology in the text and title may vary from what others use. Often, malware is taken to include viruses. I think he chose to break viruses out separately from malware so that the title would outreach to more people. Malware is still somewhat of a techie term, while spyware and viruses have broader recognition.<br /><br />Naturally, since we're discussing personal computers, the text tends to focus on those running a Microsoft operating system. But in fact, much of his advice applies to Macs and linux/unix machines. Though users of the former 2 types might take heart in knowing that most viruses or worms won't go after their machines.<br /><br />Tittel explains that increasingly, it's harder to draw clear lines between malware, spyware and adware. But he shows how to use existing anti-malware products that can scan for these and remove them. These products use combinations of signatures of known malware, and also search for \\"strange\\" activity that is typical of malware.

A particularly virulent type of malware that has increased enormously in the last 2 years. He suggests that you scrutinise the links and be very wary of any message that asks for personal information; either in a reply, or in a web page pointed to from that message. Unfortunately, the phishers continue to refine their tactics and many users simply aren't savvy enough to follow Tittel's suggestions.

Encouraged by massive hyperventilating by its proponents. In contrast, this book steps back and offers a more dispassionate and nuanced analysis of the zeitgeist, for surely the movement deserves that label.<br /><br />You get background as to the social motivations and the history of the movement. Which is shown to predate the Web and linux. GNU in the 1980s was all about alternatives to proprietary operating systems and compilers.<br /><br />The book can help you dial down the hype. Yet, ultimately, it offers a broadly positive affirmation of the movement. There is shown to be no impediment or logical flaw to cause open source to not stop growing. Rather, the book suggests that both proprietary and open source software will always be with us, albeit in a sometimes uneasy coexistence.	2005-08-03

A key point of the book is that going with open source can be a very pragmatic decision about speeding up product development. Because no matter how innovative your people are, the chances are high that due to sheer numbers of other people, you can use open source code developed by the latter.<br /><br />One does not have to buy into the entire open source mindset to acknowledge that there is merit in accessing external code that is useful. If for no other reason than that your competitors might already be doing so. Reimplementing an open source application takes time to write and debug. So sometimes, look outside your company.	2005-08-03

While Haletky does go into how to install linux and various common applications, like OpenOffice, this book differs from most linux texts. He discusses at length the realities of users already having legacy documents, and experience, with Microsoft applications. Especially Microsoft Office. While OpenOffice can do the most common tasks that Microsoft Office does, it cannot do many specialised operations. If you have specific need for the latter, you should stay with Microsoft.<br /><br />There are certainly pros and cons associated with moving from Microsoft to linux. Haletky gives a lucid and balanced treatment of these. Migration \\"might\\" save you money. But it is by now means a given.	2005-08-03

A persistent theme in the book is how it is more than just about C# as a language. The authors suggest [strongly] that a key advantage about the language is its extensive integration with .NET and the ease of coding. For the latter, the book gives a brief tour of Visual Studio highlights. Like the ability to bookmark places in source code files, and a \\"Back\\" button. Very much following a well-proven and popular browser usage. Plus Visual Studio shows C# files in a tree format, which permits an easier overview of a large source file.<br /><br />Part 2 of the book deals with the C# syntax. Comprehensive. If you have programmed another object oriented language, then you should not have any problems here.<br /><br />But later sections in the book may actually be more interesting and useful to you, once you've mastered the syntax. Several chapters show how to use C# with ASP.NET. To easily write more powerful dynamic web pages. Quite aside from C#, you also get a quick, effective education in ASP.NET. With an editing environment where you can drag and drop components from a toolbox onto the web page that you are making. Intuitive, with less chance of error; which enhances your productivity.<br /><br />The most advanced section is perhaps that about Web Services. In the computing industry, this topic is still somewhat inchoate, but much has been done to flesh out SOAP, WSDL. Including notably WS-Security. The book demonstrates how to construct a Web Service. Some of you may be interested in the Microsoft-specific Web Services Enhancements, version 2. It offers interesting utilities that may be of merit for a specific Web Service that you want to build. These tend to be along the lines of improved security. [Though it is unclear the extent to which the industry is using WSE.]	2005-08-03

For someone new to this approach, it's a very neat and elegant idea, where you treat functions as the independent variable.<br /><br />However, readers may also want to try more traditional texts, like Goldstein's \\"Classical Mechanics\\". The latter offers a more refined treatment that places the variational problems squarely in the context of physical applications.<br /><br />Kumar's book has merit in offering a greater choice of problems that you might tackle, on this topic.	2005-08-01

You can quickly get started on any of its applications with minimal reading of a manual or text, like this one. The authors of OpenOffice spent considerable effort ensuring that a new user could rapidly do useful work.<br /><br />Of the applications, possibly the most heavily used is Writer. It does not have all the features of its Microsoft analog. But the basic operations of changing fonts, colours, etc, are present. If you have any previous experience with the Microsoft application, then Writer's abilities will be very familiar.<br /><br />Likewise for the other OpenOffice applications. None of these can match Microsoft's offerings for sheer quantity of features. But perhaps Horst shows that you can get enough for your needs.	2005-08-01

Kuipers' PhD gives us an advanced treatment of the problems of implementing Quality of Service in the current [and future] Internet. He shows that the problems are hard, but overcoming them can give us new services or applications for the Web.<br /><br />The treatment is heavily mathematical. You need good prior knowledge of routing algorithms and especially of those used in Internet packet routing. His ideas are very applicable to IPv6 if, or when, that becomes commonly deployed. Of course, part of the reason for its delay is that some basic methods, like its QoS and routing, could still do with improvement. Hence, the relevance of Kuipers' work.	2005-08-01

Kamiya et al attempt to answer that in this book. It is a collection of papers from Japanese authors that gives good insight into the progress being made in Japan. Researchers from non-Japanese universities and companies might want to give careful scrutiny to the papers presented here.<br /><br />The first two parts of the book are a high level discussion of the commercial prospects, with a natural emphasis on the Japanese market. But the remarks are also apropos to any other advanced economy. These papers can be gainfully read by non-engineers as well as engineers.<br /><br />Later parts of the book are more technical. The audience here appears to be engineers and physicists. For example, we get details on quantum dots and lasers and LEDs made from those. With possible lower activation current thresholds as one motivator for research on them.<br /><br />Overall, the book gives a stout yes to femtosecond photonics being a viable commercial technology.	2005-08-01

As linewidths keep decreasing for transistors on chips, and as clock speeds keep being pushed up, the accuracy of electromagnetic simulations is vital. This gives circuit simulations that can be relied upon, without having to continually write new circuits to silicon [or GaAs].<br /><br />The book goes into the myriad ways that Maxwell's Equations can be numerically solved. Finite element/meshes take up a large portion of the text, naturally. Also, there is a good discussion of gate simulation. A gate is the key component of a transistor, so its interaction with the source and drain needs accurate modelling. Related to this is a discussion of modelling the capacitances of various circuit elements.<br /><br />Some portions of the text are more esoteric. Like the modelling of superconductive effects (Cooper pairs etc) or of phonons. While these will certainly be of interest to some readers, most will be interested in the standard circuit simulations.	2005-08-01

For a competitive edge in business, it helps to be able to analyse your data in unique ways. This text gives you a thorough education in state of the art data mining. Appropriate for both a student and a professional in the field.<br /><br />The extensive problem sets are well suited for the student. These often expand on concepts in the narrative, and are worth tackling.<br /><br />The central theme in the book is how to classify data, or find associations or clusters within it.<br /><br />Cluster analysis gets two chapters that are superbly done. These summarise decades of research into methods of grouping data into clusters. Usually hard to do, because an element of subjectivity can creep into the results. If your data is scattered in some n-dimensional space, then clusters might exist. But how to find them? The chapters show that the number of clusters and the constituents of these can depend on which method you adopt, and various initial conditions, like [essentially] seed values for clusters, if you choose a prototype cluster method like K-means.<br /><br />The descriptions of the cluster algorithms are succinct. Why is this useful? Because it helps you easily understand the operations of the algorithms, without drowning you in low level detail. Plus, by presenting a meta-level comparison between the algorithms, you can develop insight into rolling your own methods, specific to your data.<br /><br />Part of my research involves finding new ways to make clusters, and the text was very useful in explaining the existing ideas.	2005-08-01

She might also be new to programming, in any language. Consequently, the book steps carefully through various key ideas, like object oriented programming, polymorphism and recursion. These, and other ideas, are reinforced by extensive self review questions and problem sets. Something worth considering by a lecturer searching for a text to accompany a course.<br /><br />It is good that the graphics examples focus on using Swing widgets. The original AWT widgets get only a passing remark. Which helps a newbie avoid coding in these.<br /><br />The book has extensive appendices. Too extensive. Appendix M, which lists the Java class library, is superfluous. It describes the standard Java classes that come with J2SE. For each class, it lists the variables and constants, constructors and methods. Along with brief explanations of the intent of many of these items. The Appendix takes up almost 160 pages. A sizeable fraction of the 900 pages of the entire book. The problem is that the appendix is basically a rendition of the standard documentation that Sun supplies with Java. Little value is added by Lewis and Loftus. This appendix should have been entirely dropped. Instead, the reader could have been directed to the appropriate Sun URL. Or, indeed, been asked to search the web. Because it turns out that the manual pages written by Sun are widely mirrored by many websites.<br /><br />Or, the manual pages should have been in the CD that comes with the book. (If the pages are already on the CD, then Appendix M should certainly not have been written.)	2005-07-30

If you are inclined to adopt it, then the book offers comprehensive support, whether you are brand new to linux, or an experienced linux sysadmin. Along related lines, the book can be used for either sysadmin purposes, or by a general user.<br /><br />For the latter, don't be taken aback by the size of the book. You do not have to sequentially plumb through most of the book before applying it. Many chapters can be read in any order, depending on your needs.<br /><br />For general purpose usage, Chapter 8 is worth looking at. It covers surfing, email and reading newsgroups. The first two tasks were, and remain, the killer apps of the Internet. For surfing, the book recommends Firefox, which might be described as an improved Mozilla (from which it was derived). Somewhat surprisingly, given the 1100 odd pages of the book, only a few pages are devoted to Firefox. The authors may have taken the view that Firefox is so simple to use that there was little else they could add about it.<br /><br />For sysadmins, the book offers help with crucial and common tasks like running an Apache web server or a database server. For server side applications, open source solutions running on linux are a very attractive configuration to many, and the book addresses this need. The default database server that arrives with Fedora is MySQL. Which is the most popular open source database server. However, the book also includes guidelines for using PostgreSQL.	2005-07-30

The numerous proofs in each chapter have that rigour. Yet what may be more important is how the text remains accessible to a primarily undergraduate audience.<br /><br />The book is not just a compendium of common algorithms in computer science, and proofs about them. The authors place a stronger emphasis on motivating how to develop an intuitive understanding of the problems that the algorithms address, and of how to shape new algorithms. Or, possibly, apply or modify existing algorithms to new problems.<br /><br />If you compare the text to Knuth's classic \\"Art of Computer Programming\\", then you might find Kleinberg and Tardos more accessible. (At least for undergraduate readership.)<br /><br />Also, the extensive exercises at the end of each chapter often have contexts germane to the Web. For example, the links in web pages are used to motivate problems in graph theory, where we have directed (unidirectional) graphs, due to the one way nature of links. More generally, the recent, contextual nature of the problems may appeal to some students. Knuth had many exercises listed in his books, but they can be too abstract for most students.<br /><br />The text also has an interesting chapter on NP problems. The authors address a very practical situation. Even if you find that you have a problem that is NP complete, it is not necessarily the end of the story. For real life reasons, you may have to find an approximate solution that is computationally feasible to evaluate. The chapter offers suggestions and examples that may be of help. (More formal texts might merely stop at proving NP completeness.)	2005-07-30

For a sysadmin who needs a quick, easy to read, guide to Active Directory. Specifically, to the most common tasks that you are likely to face. Hunter explicitly avoids a comprehensive discourse, in order to give you this quick guide.<br /><br />Logically enough, the first chapter is on installing Active Directory itself. It is scarcely 40 pages. You should be able to absorb it in an hour or so, even with no prior background in this topic. Then the actual installation time itself doesn't seem so lengthy, from the chapter's descriptions.<br /><br />On an ongoing basis, Chapter 3 might be the most useful. Hunter explains the typical day to day tasks on Active Directory that you might face. Again, less than 40 pages.<br /><br />The book also has a chapter on large scale deployments. The advice in it seems fine. And Hunter put in the chapter to ensure that she covered this topic. I do wonder, though, about how realistically it fits into the book's goal. A large deployment strongly suggests a sysadmin who will have to devote considerable time to installing and running it. Of necessity, she will probably have to consult more comprehensive texts, given her level of responsibility. Whereas this book might be envisaged as targeting a smaller deployment, on just one or a few machines.<br /><br />To be sure, you should certainly get a full reference book on Active Directory, if you are going to be running it. But consider using that mostly as informational backup, and perhaps using Hunter's book as the daily guide.	2005-07-29

The cost of it strongly suggests that the main buyers will be libraries, rather than individuals. With over 100 papers, the book is very up to date. Its theme is one intersection of physics and chemistry. At a level where the molecules are being modelled with quantum mechanics.<br /><br />There is an extensive and detailed explanation of how one goes about building the electronic structure of the molecules. Essentially, the book is mostly about computational quantum chemistry. For all the practical cases involve the extensive use of computers to find the eigenfunctions or orbitals.<br /><br />From these, we see a buildup into a resultant spectroscopy. Where the latter might be used as diagnostic tools to infer molecular structure.<br /><br />There is also discussion how, at a higher level [ie. larger length scales], the quantum mechanical modelling can be averaged out into a classical molecular dynamics approach. Where the latter retains enough realism to be useful. And with the advantage that more molecules can be modelled.	2005-07-28

Algorithms that are very useful in computing. And how these can be coded in Java.<br /><br />The explanation of the algorithms requires a reasonable amount of mathematical sophistication on your part. They all relate to discrete maths, and cover topics like sorting, random number generation and graphs. The complexity of the discussion is less than that in Knuth's \\"Art of Computer Programming\\". Perhaps more akin to Sedgewick or Aho's algorithms texts. There is a fair amount of abstraction that you'll have to deal with.<br /><br />The other task in the book is explaining how Java is well suited in which to code these algorithms. Weiss also makes good use of the Java interface ability. If you think of an algorithm as being implemented in a subroutine [ie. a procedural approach], then the book uses interfaces to let you design a program at a higher level, and making it quite modular and independent of specific implementations of given algorithms.<br /><br />The book does deal with Java 5. But perhaps the most important aspect of Java used in the book is the interface. So the book is quite germane even if you are using an earlier Java.<br /><br />But what if you program in another language? Is the book relevant? Quite possibly. Firstly, some other languages, like C#, have interfaces. More importantly, if you regard the algorithms as the most important aspect of the book, and you are a skilled programmer, then coding is the easier aspect.<br /><br />A remark to a lecturer: If you are teaching a course and are contemplating this book as its text, be careful. Try to ensure that the expected background of your class is compatible with the book. For example, if they will be experienced Java programmers, but have little maths knowledge (and this combination is certainly possible), then the book may not be very useful to them.	2005-07-28

Take Jackson's \\"Classical Electrodynamics\\" for example. Beautifully written, with elegant explanations of Maxwell's equations. But the problems given in such a text are often those with purely analytic solutions. These are certainly desirable. But the reality is that a lot of actual modelling of electromagnetic problems requires a computer to find the answer.<br /><br />Different methods are useful. Of these, what is now called methods of moment, has emerged as one of the most powerful, as shown in this book. It is a technique that can be coded to tackle many integral equations that arise when you have a nontrivial geometry to consider.<br /><br />The book is indeed rather specialised. But for some of you, it will save rummaging through research papers describing the method.	2005-07-28

Somewhat monumental in scope. Basically because the intended audience is quite diverse. He suggests that you could fall into any of these categories - system administrator, programmer, or new Linux user. And if you are a sysadmin or programmer, your prior experience with Linux might vary from none to considerable.<br /><br />The book also attempts not to play favourites concerning the various Linux distributions that exist - from Red Hat, Novell/SUSE, Debian, Knoppix and others. These essentially have a commonality of functionality which the book documents. This approach may be better than trying to discern the comparative advantages of each distribution.<br /><br />He also follows this when describing the two most common shells used in Linux - the Bourne shell and the T shell. Each is considered important enough to warrant its own chapter. You can take your pick as to which you prefer.<br /><br />Yet again, this is done with the two text editors, vim and emacs. In the unix world, the debate between their proponents has spawned innumerable threads in newsgroups. Basically, vim is simpler to use but emacs is more powerful. Anyway, he gives each editor its own chapter, with enough details in both so that you can decide according to your own preferences. If you really can't decide, just plump for one at random and stick to it. Both are good enough that you won't go wrong.	2005-07-27

The user interface is beguilingly simple to learn. And this has characterised Macs over their 20 plus years. But you can learn here that under the simple UI is a ton of complex capabilities that you can access.<br /><br />En route, if you can dedicate yourself to systematically go through this book, you learn a version of Unix. Which by the way, and to good first approximation, is equivalent to learning much about linux. Of course, this is not the primary intent of the book. But it is an unheralded extra virtue.<br /><br />With regards to Unix, you can learn how to use the command line. While the UI lets you do many common tasks, there is a limit even to the ingenuity  of Apple's designers as to what should be enabled at the UI level. The book has a relatively short chapter on the command line. For serious, specialised tasks, you may well end up carefully perusing the chapter.<br /><br />On more general issues, Miser covers the most common usages of any personal computer. For browsing, the Mac has a default browser called Safari. You may not need to consult the book's notes on it, if you just do standard browsing. Then for email, the book shows how the Mac has an application for easy use.<br /><br />What adds to the book's heft is its description of higher level, value-added applications that Apple has astutely used to build up the Mac's cachet. As in listening to or managing a music collection with iTunes, or even making music with GarageBand. More elaborately, running iMovie to be your own movie director. While it should be no surprise that Miser gives extensive coverage to the iPod and how its use can be integrated into the use of a Mac.<br /><br />You can think of these sections of the book as being a useful and detailed adjunct to various skimpier books that describe those applications. Here, Miser's narrative lacks the often vivid multihued illustrations in those books, but makes up for this with more comprehensive details of usage. Though some of you might wince at this turn of phrase, the book elucidates a \\"Mac lifestyle\\".akes up for this with more comprehensive details of usage.

Conceptually, you can think of the book as two interwoved parts. The first part is explaining generic linux, or even unix, operations. Applicable to a Red Hat or Solaris machine, perhaps.<br /><br />More pertinantly, the book goes into SUSE-specific abilities, with a natural emphasis on maintaining a secure system. The book is clearly directed at a sysadmin in a corporate environment, as opposed to a hobbyist with a home computer. So robustness and defending against malware are constant themes.<br /><br />For example, you may want to offer anonymous ftp writing to your machine. By default, this directory often ends up in /var. Which means that users could, inadvertantly or not, end up filling the partition that /var/ sits on. Bad, because /var holds a lot of system log files, amongst other items. So the book suggests putting the anonymous ftp write directory on its own partition. Some other sysadmin books totally ignore this situation.<br /><br />Careful attention should be paid to the last sections of the book, which discuss instrusion detection. A good precis of the main tools is furnished - for Ethereal, Nessus, nmap, Snort and others. You get enough details in the overview to understand their usages and their comparative advantages.	2005-07-26

Savitch goes comprehensively through the core classes that come with the standard Java distribution. Also, he uses Java 5, which is the latest major release of Java. If you are going to start learning Java, you might as well start here, instead of using a text that deals with earlier versions.<br /><br />It turns out that Java 5 also gives notational simplifications, which may help the new programmer. For example, suppose we have \\"int i\\" and \\"Integer x\\". In earlier versions of Java, you would have had to write \\"i=x.intValue()\\" to assign from x to i, or \\"x=new Integer(i)\\" to assign from i to x. Experienced Java programmers will shrug and say, \\"so what?\\". But they don't need this book anyway. For a beginner, some of the earlier Java notation or formalism can be bulky. But now in Java 5, you can just say \\"i=x\\" or \\"x=i\\" and the JVM makes the appropriate conversions internally. So long as you understand this, the new notation is better. It makes the code more concise and readable. Which even for experienced programmers should be desirable. Easier to understand and debug.<br /><br />It should be said that Savitch goes much further into other aspects and improvements in Java 5. Without gainsaying his efforts, I think the above is the most understandable thing to appreciate about Java 5.<br /><br />Another positive aspect of the book is the plethora of worked out examples and problems in each chapter. For the latter, answers are also furnished at the ends of the chapters. But if you want the most out of this book, retain enough self discipline to devote serious effort to the problems before checking the answers.<br /><br />Savitch also brings up the topic of patterns. It reflects a roughly 10 year old realisation in computing about the importance of this to robust and rapid coding. And it also aids in the efficient communication of solutions between programmers. Seeing it migrate to a beginner's book like this is a good sign. If you can learn just the overall concept of a pattern, as well as several specific and important patterns given in the text, then you get off to a good start in programming. In any language.<br /><br />Sure, when you don't even know the syntax of Java, patterns can seem a little abstract. Just like interfaces. But when you get around to writing thousands of lines of source code, or having to maintain or extend such code bodies, then patterns and interfaces really show their utility.<br /><br />Note in passing that the book is not really an algorithms text. The most involved it gets in this aspect is a brief discusssion of sorting methods. If you're after algorithms implemented in Java, try elsewhere.a beginner's book like this is a good sign.

Conn demonstrates how using a standard PC, it is possible to install and use Squeak.

Bhushan deals with the nitty gritty practicalities of making a disk drive, circa 1996. You might reasonably expect that most of the book's details have deliberately been kept proprietary by the disk manufacturers.<br /><br />But by whatever means, the book was published. You get a wealth of details that might take an R&D group years to learn on their own. Keep in mind that the emphasis here is on the mechanics. So don't expect a discussion of IBM's usage of the Giant Magnetoresistive effect, for example.<br /><br />The book should make you appreciate the incredible mechanical constraints under which disks operate. They can spin for years, with the heads not crashing into them, but separated by mere microns. Truly amazing manufacture.	2005-07-25

In office, he was despised by many of his opponents, in no small part because of the way he took office after Whitlam was sacked in 1975.<br /><br />But after leaving office in 1983, he moved closer to the centre of Australian political thought. Of which you can consult this book for his own words. At times introspective, he also discusses calmly many issues relating to Australia that concern him. Aborigines. South Africa's apartheid, against which he was a long time opponent. Immigration, especially from Asia. And Australia's relationship with the developing countries of Asia.<br /><br />Keep in mind that the book was written in 1986. Fraser is still quite active in 2005. He should consider updating the book. He has never been shy about expressing an opinion.	2005-07-25

Like a recently reviewed Kirk-Othmer text that was from 1995, this reference book could do with an updated edition. Indeed as I write this, perhaps that is in the works. The current volumes were published in 1989 and were an excellent synopsis of the uses of lasers in this field.<br /><br />But there has been much progress with lasers in the interim. The book touches briefly on the femtosecond pulsed lasers. Actually, these were then using pulses on the order of 100 fm, and it was all still very experimental. Now, in the last 16 years, the usage of pulsing in the sub-100 fm range is far more common for studying fast reactions, amongst other applications. Though to what extent these lasers are used in polymer work, I do not know. But a newer edition might disperse this uncertainty.	2005-07-25

One huge change has been the recent economical fabrication of blue and green lasers, pioneered by a Japanese researcher. From a product standpoint, this enables a huge market in next generation DVDs, that use shorter wavelengths to read the DVD. Hence we get DVDs with higher capacity. And you can probably think of other uses too.<br /><br />The above was only one example of a significant event in the field that occurred after the 4th edition.

Perhaps you are pondering migrating to it? To change operating systems can be fraught with uncertainty. Even if you are confident about the new operating system's reliability, how much do you have to learn to be productive in the OS?<br /><br />Hsiao gives an answer for linux. He chooses to describe what is currently perhaps the most popular version, Red Hat's community-based Fedora. Naturally, the book has copious descriptions of what the desktop looks like, and the common operations  you can do using this operational metaphor. You know, all that drag and drop stuff. It's been over 20 years since the Mac popularised the GUI desktop. And the main ideas are now the same across many operating systems. So if you're coming from elsewhere, adapting to the Fedora desktop should not cause any heartburn.<br /><br />The book also reflects the reality of competition amongst operating systems. Two big reasons that people use computers are for doing office related paperwork and for browsing the Web. So the book (and its enclosed CD) carefully devote time to explaining how to use OpenOffice.org. A suite of applications that is the open source analog of Microsoft Office. Some of you are undoubtedly well familiar with the latter. If you compare that to the book's coverage of OpenOffice, you can see that broadly speaking, OpenOffice can do much the same as MS Office. Though it should be said that OpenOffice lacks much of the specialised commands available in MS Office. If you don't use those, then the book's explanations of OpenOffice should meet your needs.<br /><br />The other big thing in the book is its description of the Firefox web browser. A Mozilla-derived browser that has won accolades from many for its ease of use. If you want to go beyond the really obvious usages of Firefox, the book can explain more intricate things you can do with it.<br /><br />If you already know some linux, you might be impressed by the book's treatment of the two most common text editors that come with it - vi and emacs.

It has an informal choice of Java programming topics, where these are unlikely to be seen in other, more comprehensive and conventional Java texts. Plus, Holzner uses the latest major release, Java 1.5.<br /><br />To be sure, you really must have some nodding acquaintance with Java. Not necessarily 1.5, mind you. But part of the book's focus is that it does not waste your time going over basic issues like syntax and the core classes.<br /><br />The book exposes you to more than just the standard Java 1.5 distribution from Sun. You should already know that the latter has two sets of widgets - the original AWT and the newer Swing, where Swing is often considered to be better than AWT. But there is another widget toolkit, called SWT. Freely offered by IBM. It has been well received by many Java programmers as being superior to AWT and Swing. In Chapter 8, on making a custom web browser, for example, Holzner shows the virtues of SWT. Purely in terms of broadening your Java experience, it is worth checking SWT out.<br /><br />Holzner also puts in a strong plug for Eclipse. An Integrated Development Environment that is free and open source. (It also originated from IBM.) It offers the promise of a very nice, high productivity context in which to code your Java. Its proponents suggest that Eclipse and Java can match any Microsoft IDE for coding VB.NET or C#.<br /><br />You see, if you treat the book correctly, it's not the topics themselves that are the most important items. Don't get me wrong. They are certainly interesting in their own right. Rather, it's the broadening of your knowledge en route that is the book's main attraction.	2005-07-24

Microsoft has made powerful IDEs for its languages. And the open source Eclipse can be used for Java. Along these lines, Ducasse offers his book. It teaches Smalltalk using the Squeak IDE.<br /><br />The twist is that Squeak uses the visual metaphors of robots and robot factory, to convey the crucial concepts of objects/classes. As Ducasse explains, Squeak can be directed at an audience that is perhaps of high school age or even younger. So a clear visual feedback between example code and what the student sees then happen is vital, given her limited background and possibly limited attention span.<br /><br />Squeak uses Smalltalk in part because that is a very minimalist language. If you come from C++, Java or C#, you may be struck by its simplicity, compared to the oodles of classes and notational intricacies of those languages. Which of course also makes it easier for a young student to learn Smalltalk or Squeak itself.<br /><br />I wonder a little about the book itself, though. A motivated high school student could easily use it. But for some younger students? In that situation, it may well be that the book could be best directed at a teacher, who can then instruct from it.	2005-07-24

There are plenty of books on linear algebra, going back decades. But Dorier gives a meta analysis of the teaching of the subject. Which is something almost universally lacking from other books. Each instance of the latter gives its author's pedagogy. And indeed most texts are fairly adequate at teaching.<br /><br />Dorier tries to logically discern which methods might be more effective. Kudos for trying. You might not necessarily agree with all that the text suggests. But you get something to ponder, and possibly to improve your teaching skills.<br /><br />Are there similar books for other branches of maths and science?	2005-07-22

This book of necessity overlaps with those, to various extents. Here Mollin offers more of a general introduction and guide. Pitched to those outside the field. Whereas his other books are directed to students in cryptography. Hence, this is not a maths book, per se. The historical perspective is nice. Gives you an appreciation of what people did before computers transformed this field. Caesar ciphers, substitutions etc.<br /><br />But in the post WW2 era, high speed electronic computers made a wide impact. Mollin explains how this enabled public key cryptography. Based on the asymmetric effort needed to factor a very large number, compared to generating that number by multiplying a set of primes together.<br /><br />Mollin also looks at the future. Specifically at quantum computing. While early results are intriguing, it is still unclear if this approach will ever prove practical.	2005-07-19

Spanning decades of refinement. What you get is a very polished and well written text, that has incorporated feedback from generations of students.<br /><br />The book starts by describing matrix manipulations and determinants. These are very tangible things to most maths students. Accordingly, explaining how to take determinants or to invert a matrix lets you build confidence in your knowledge. Also, these topics lends themselves readily to many problems for you to do.<br /><br />After this, the book heads into more abstract territory. Null and range spaces and the rank nullity theorem, for example. You are exposed to the concept of an abstract vector space. Which invariably some students always trip over. So the grounding in the early chapters can mitigate this awkwardness.<br /><br />The last chapter touches lightly on the interesting applications, like chaos and fractals. But mostly to pique your interest in proceeding further in the field.	2005-07-19

Yet in a somewhat mechanistic way, it does teach the basics of XML. Enough so that you can understand DTDs, Schemas, mixed content mode  etc. Where, for example, you hopefully appreciate that mixed content should be avoided if you are defining a new XML application. A little ironic, because XML came from SGML, and the latter is often used in mixed mode.<br /><br />If you need a quick way to learn XML, this book should be adequate.

Perhaps you might not appreciate this from a reading of Clements, if you have never had any experience with the other chip set. But those who have will certainly thank Motorola.<br /><br />As this review is written in 2005, the 68000 family is still selling well.

Preferably both, maybe.<br /><br />The statistical terminology was mostly unfamiliar to me, and I've had a couple of years of undergraduate stats classes. Thus, the bulk of the book was over my head. But it should be said that the SAS code performs many of these functions, leaving you to concentrate on the higher level, manual assessment of the results.

He argues that you should expand your horizon beyond the confines of national boundaries. Whether you are an individual investing your own money, or, say, a mutual fund manager looking for an asset class to deploy into. Or, and perhaps especially this, if you are a corporation trying to find new clients or partners or suppliers.<br /><br />The book attacks the recent offshoring debate in the United States as ultimately misguided. As a wry aside, Ohmae points out that 15 years ago, there were fears about Japan overtaking the US. Something you just don't hear about anymore.<br /><br />His take on offshoring is that it is inevitable. The technology that enables it is becoming ever cheaper, after all. He suggests that you try to take advantage of it, by changing  your strategies to operate on a global stage.<br /><br />There is one remark in the book that I must take issue with. He states that in 2000-4, the Australian economy expanded strongly, for unknown reasons. Not so at all. For one thing, the strong demand from China for minerals and food certainly helped the Australian balance of trade. But Australia is more than just mining and agriculture. The interest rates stayed low, triggering  a boom in real estate investment that was instrumental in growing the economy. This may of course come to a bad end later. But the economy's expansion was very much due to known reasons.	2005-07-19

The many examples and problems will greatly help you acquire the expertise, if you can knuckle down and tackle them.<br /><br />The other utility of the book is in learning the various numerical methods, independent of the specific language of Matlab that they are implemented in. There is a possible advantage to doing so with Matlab, as contrasted to coding the methods in a general purpose language like C or Java. Since Matlab is already optimised [in some sense] for handling such methods. And especially with easily accessible and powerful graphing routines readily at hand. In other languages, a lot of your effort will inevitably be focused on writing this routines, as opposed to actually dealing with the numerical methods themselves.	2005-07-18

So it was with some interest that I went through this book. While I can't tell which was his contribution and which was the other author's, the combined effort is an elegant rendition of particle physics, circa late 1980s.<br /><br />A merit of the book is who it is pitched at. It is not really for a generalist outside physics. Rather, it seems best suited for the physicist (student or not) who is not in particle physics. Non-physicists may be surprised at this, but particle physics can seem strange and forbidding even to physicists. The text gives enough detailed physics to satisfy a physicist; that he is indeed getting enough of the real stuff to gain insight.<br /><br />While the title does say it is for scientists, I wonder a little about how accessible the book might be to a typical chemist or geologist.	2005-07-18

Where the latter is perhaps for a non-chemistry major. Moore writes straightforwardly about basic concepts like Avogardro's Number and molarity.<br /><br />There is also some coverage of organic chemistry. Of necessity, this goes little beyond definitions of the main organic types, like ethers, esters and aldehydes. Organic chemistry has a rich network of synthesis pathways that the text can only touch the fringes of.

IBM and others have been strongly pushing the concept of Grid computing. (Sometimes known variously as utility computing.) And IBM Press has come out with several books related to this topic. Whereas Wells gives you an independent appraisal of the concept, as applied to running a database.<br /><br />If you hope that Grid computing takes off, this book is a good sign. Because one of the main commercial applications will surely be for running large databases. So Wells describes what is involved in distributing such a database across different nodes of the Grid. Naturally, issues like security of the communications between the nodes arises. Especially if the nodes are not in the same operations centre. You have to consider if it suffices to be able to ensure that a message is unchanged. Or do you need a stronger measure of encrypting that message?<br /><br />Anyway, the book delves into these and other issues of database management. The brevity of the book suggests that it is still early days for deploying databases on a grid. Many of the topics may well grow significantly in complexity if this deployment becomes common.	2005-07-18

Essentially a unix text about sed, awk and Perl. Ostensibly, it has to do with computational biology and the parsing of the various common data formats in that field. But a perusal of the book shows that the scope is more general. The biology formats are used as case studies. If you are in high energy physics, for example, and you have accelerator data in some other format, the book might still be of use in helping you parse out what you need.<br /><br />The sed and awk discussions could have be written 10 years or more ago. Those programs have been very stable. Whereas Perl has undergone relatively rapid changes. In fact, as the book indicates, Perl is far more powerful than sed or awk. It is a fully fledged programming language that can take you some time to master. The book doesn't give a comprehensive coverage of Perl's abilities. But for the expected reader, it may suffice.	2005-07-18

The book makes the point that traditional inventing tends to focus on purely technological considerations. Often done by people with engineering or scientific backgrounds. But for a successful commercial product, the authors suggest SET - social, economic and technological. All these should be investigated and integrated into a final product.<br /><br />The motivation will be germane to many companies. Because now quality manufacturing is surely being performed by you and many of your competitors. In the last 20 years, such keynote ideas as Motorola's Six Sigma and Wal Mart's supply chain optimisations have percolated throughout the world. Quality is necessary but no longer sufficient. Unless you want to be the lowest cost producer in your industry. But by definition, there can only be one such in each industry. For others to survive, the book offers hope through embracing innovation.<br /><br />It points out that innovation cannot be commoditised. This may be your only enduring advantage. Plus, the book emphasises instituting a process of continual innovation. You have to expect that not all your resultant products will be hits. But by repetition, you can be like a casino house. Turn the iron hand of statistics to work in your favour.<br /><br />Also, the book's cover is a really cute, funky attention grabber.	2005-07-17

The authors discuss a variety of methods, and furnish example code written in Fortran. A good indication of the serious nature of the book comes in seeing that right at the second chapter, it discusses solving nonlinear systems. More elementary books often neglect this, or put  give more emphasis on handling linear systems, since these are amenable to matrix techniques.<br /><br />The choice of Fortran for coding underscores that language's continued dominance of numerical work in science and engineering. Though if you are skilled in another language, you may still want to consider this book. The descriptions of the algorithms are explicit enough that you should be able to code from those in your language.	2005-07-16

For those of you who have read Asimov's columns in Fantasy and Science Fiction, or his many stories and textbooks, this biography could help fill out your knowledge of him. For example, you may have heard of the Nobel Laureate chemist Urey. Asimov was his student at Columbia, but apparently Urey took a dislike to him and considered him a flake!<br /><br />White also furnishes analyses of Asimov's major writings, like Nightfall, the Foundation series and the Robot stories. Prior to this book, you'd have to look back to Joseph Patrouch's \\"The Science Fiction of Isaac Asimov\\". That was published in the late 70s, and while well done, of course could not cover Asimov's works since then till his death. Plus, Patrouch's book was not about Asimov's life, per se. So White's book adds somewhat more.<br /><br />There is one unfortunate and very glaring omission to the biography. Not a single photo?! Perhaps some of you might suggest that since Asimov's fame was as a writer, we have little need for photos. However, I suspect that most readers would want at least some photos - of Asimov when he was younger, and of his family. Or maybe of him winning some of his numerous prizes. Other biographies of writers usually furnish these. White or his publisher could have paid the copyright holders of some Asimov photos in order to reproduce those in this book. Sure, this would have increased costs. But it is typically a necessary part of any biography.<br /><br />This omission from White's book is really puzzling. He says he received the cooperation of Asimov's wife, who is also writing a biography of Isaac. Surely, if she aided White, some photos could have been forthcoming? You might wonder as to how accurate is White's claim of cooperation. Did he just cobble this book together from the publicly available sources?	2005-07-15

The original default AWT widgets have been largely supplanted by Swing widgets. These are more powerful and usually easier to program, as shown in this text.<br /><br />While the hacks are not meant to be a comprehensive sweep over all the Swing widgets, there is enough variety amongst them to easily show you the abilities. The coding is useful in providing relatively succinct examples. UI programming is often very wordy in the source code. But the hack examples convey working solutions notable for their brevity. In and of itself, this is a virtue of the book. For it shows that Swing can be concisely applied. Less typing, and easier to understand. Which also means easier to debug.	2005-07-15

Firstly, as mobile computing usage increases, the extra computational capabilities introduced in new chips can act to drain the batteries even faster.<br /><br />Secondly, even for non-mobile devices, the techniques of this book have merit. As feature lengths keep decreasing, the number of transistors per unit area increases, and so does the power consumption. The text points out that this can be a formidable constraint to further advances in performance.<br /><br />Plus, quite aside from the above, you can also choose to read the text as a good primer in current, overall, VLSI ideas. For example, the debate  between having 4 transistors or 6 transistors represent a memory cell illustrates well various tradeoffs that you might have to make in design.	2005-07-14

The breadth of coverage of methods is good. So too is the level of detail.<br /><br />The book makes you appreciate how hard the task is of finding these darned viruses. In general, you are trying to discern malware intent in an arbitrary file. Where this file is often binary. But, as Szor is careful to explain, there can certainly be source code viruses as well. These could be in Postscript, PDF or scripting files. He also points out that the Microsoft Office data files are really binary programs, that run under the Microsoft Office applications.<br /><br />The book shows the considerable level of ingenuity on both sides of this struggle. As in how antivirus companies like Symantec often run a suspected virus in an emulator, stepping through the code. But in response, some viruses try to detect if they are being run inside an emulator. How they do this is very crafty and simple. (Shades of the \\"Matrix\\"!) It is examples of tactics like this that give the book its worth.	2005-07-11

The title is a cheeky pun. State refers both to the presence (or absence) of virginity, and to the German city states and provinces and their ideas on the roles of women. The text shows that these roles could often be encapsulated in how the male dominated societies regarded virginity in women.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly perhaps, the roles also reflect the class divisions of these societies. Strasser also relates this to the role of the Catholic Church in Bavaria in reinforcing the social mores. Readers familiar with more recent societies, like 19th century Britain, might see echoes of gender issues.<br /><br />Along the way, the book also has interesting tidbits or glimpses into these vanished societies that would otherwise be lost to dusty archives.<br /><br />While the tone of the book is scholarly, it is not closed off to non-specialists in history and feminism. Newcomers to these fields should be able to follow and enjoy the narrative.	2005-07-11

This second edition should be well received. It encapsulates the changes in the unix world since 92. Most importantly, it shows the rise of linux. A rise that is still unabated.<br /><br />Broadly, the structure of this edition matches the first edition. Rago was brought in as co-author after Stevens died in 99, and he has deliberately kept this consistency. I was glad to see that Rago kept the exercises at the end of each chapter. Many computer books seem to dispense with this, which can be a pity for anyone who needs hands on tasks to learn from.<br /><br />The threading chapters are a significant change from the first edition. Not simple reading, but they do reflect powerful ways to possibly optimise your code. The biggest cost for you may be the effort you need to invest in understanding the coding issues in these chapters. Rago's code examples are deliberately short, and necessarily somewhat artificial. But they do demonstrate well the various threading issues.<br /><br />Of course, other chapters have had minimal alterations. How much have terminal I/O or pseudoterminals changed in 10 years? Those chapters may be old friends to you.	2005-07-09

But seen in the context of the travails of various minorities scattered throughout the region. The bulk of the attention is on the Jewish communities. It should be said that the book can be depressing reading. We see repeated pogroms and lesser discriminations being visited upon the Jews. By \\"nationalists\\" in every country. Serbia, Greece, Poland ...<br /><br />Especially pernicious is what she describes during the First World War. When combatants on both sides would routinely revile Jews as potential sympathisers for the other side.<br /><br />The US, in relative contrast, comes off pretty well. At least as compared to the at best studied indifference or cynical manipulations by the European Great Powers of minority affairs. Where typically, a Power would try to stir up trouble in an opposing Power, but simultaneously holding down its minorities.<br /><br />The book has disturbing relevance in today's Europe, where the Balkans are still restless. It also provides a context for the ongoing struggles towards normal relations between such countries as Poland and Russia.	2005-07-03

You can read the book at two levels. Firstly, and simply, as a good backdrop to the growth of Los Angeles and San Francisco. The narrative helps give more flesh to a time of great urban expansion, that is nowadays often cursorily discussed. Since that expansion was in turn dwarfed by the ever greater growth after World War 2.<br /><br />But at another level, the book shows how while women might not have been able to hold formal reins of power, in practise, they had more leeway. It is this informal exercise of power that is well described. The merit of the book is in showing that the commonly accepted view of women having little power in that time is perhaps oversimplified. The historical scholarship demonstrated by Simpson is impressive and amply rewards the reader's attention.	2005-07-03

The authors' suggestions can be fruitfully applied in all 3 fields. Perhaps the most striking comment in the book was that your perceived reality is primarily kept in your internal models of the world. Much of your sensory input is discarded by the brain. So that you \\"see\\", but at a deeper level, you may not really see. The latter is especially true if your model does not detect anything amiss in a cursory analysis of the input, so it thinks everything is as expected. Hence, it discards much of that input. There are indeed sound evolutionary reasons for this. For it is changes in the environment that can signal the presence of a possible predator or food source.<br /><br />But for you in a modern environment of your career, this can be bad. Because unless you are careful, you might miss the significance of changes. The book calls these outliers or inconsistencies in your mental model. A scientist understands that this can often lead to progress, if it reveals a shortcoming in a current model. To a scientist, this is no revelation. But most laymen don't appreciate that this approach can be used more broadly. To a programmer, this can be interpreted as devising and running strenuous tests on your data and programs. Even apparently harmless bugs might lead to uncovering more serious defects.<br /><br />The book talks much about intuition, which is based on deep experience. Insight is mentioned, but then virtually nothing more is said about it. As an inventor, I would have wished for far more discussion on insight. It is a conceptual leap that, on a few rare and precious moments, can lead to great advances.<br /><br />The book does have a flaw. It cites Extreme Programming [XP] as one recent innovative method. The authors have not adequately researched this topic. It has been a fad that has yielded very little in actual successful projects. The book quotes XP as being used in Daimler/Chrysler and other companies. If you are not a programmer, you may be unaware that the first commercial use of XP was at Chrysler. A fiasco. Late, overbudget and ultimately abandoned. Cf. \\"XP Refactored\\" by Stephens and Rosenberg. They comprehensively explain its shortfalls.<br /><br />However, if you ignore the book's mention of XP, then it can indeed be very useful in aiding your thinking.g used in Daimler/Chrysler and other companies.

But rather from the vantage of a designer or developer.<br /><br />However, you might know that there are already many books for website developers. In contrast, Suh aims at a higher level.

He points out that the Internet has shifted power to the customer in 3 ways - more information, more options and simpler (or easier) transactions. He then gives several examples of companies moving in this direction.<br /><br />But there is another example he could have cited here which may be especially apropos, since you are reading this review. The example is Amazon. When searching for a book, it gives a huge amount of information, including reviews. But amongst the extra options Amazon offers is its Marketplace of third party sellers. This was a very hard decision for them to implement, because, unlike eBay, they would be offering the same items as other sellers. But since they would get a commission from the latter sales, they could still garner revenue.<br /><br />Another advantage Amazon offered, over eBay, and which falls in the rubric of simpler transactions, is that buyers send their credit card information to Amazon. Much easier and safer than an eBay transaction.<br /><br />While the book in a later chapter discusses how Amazon offers more information to customers, the previous two reasons could have been further discussed. As these lead to a very simple illustration of Urban's argument.	2005-06-25

Each major topic in this field is well covered. Firewalls and packet filtering are clearly done. The preferred choice of example router is from Cisco. But the principles are obviously applicable to devices from any competing vendor.<br /><br />The book also recommends egress filtering; which is not often discussed in other texts. It helps guard against your net being used to send out malware. This helps the overall environment of the Internet. Moreover, there is also a tangible benefit to you. By doing egress checks, you can detect if one of your machines has been subverted. Which is always good to know.<br /><br />VPNs are given an entire chapter, due to their importance. The book also goes beyond talking about Intrusion Detection Systems to discuss Intrusion Prevention Systems.

Harris directs his writings towards a dyed in the wool NetWare sysadmin, who is now confronted with Novell's new fangled Open Enterprise Server. The Open refers to an amalgam of the closed shop NetWare with the open source world of linux and its various network utilities. More to the point, the Netware sysadmin faces a qualitatively different approach.<br /><br />So if trepidation is in order, Harris combats it with plenty of details as to how to transition. Not that NetWare is being abandoned, he emphasises. But the positive approach you should take is that your NetWare skillset and marketability can be enhanced by learning about OES and its linux leanings. For example, the book shows how the Apache web server and the Tomcat engine can interact with NetWare. If you do not already know those packages, now you have a context to do so. And outside NetWare, knowing Apache and Tomcat is no bad thing, career-wise.	2005-06-20

Luckily, the book shows that serious work has also gone into providing you with UI tools to tweak the XML.<br /><br />If you are still new to XML, the book may be useful as a motivator by showing non-trivial examples of how to use it.

Love goes into enough detail to give practical guidance with code mods. But he also writes clearly of the reasons behind the various kernel operations. The choice of using the current 2.6 kernel means this book may be more relevant than earlier linux kernel texts.<br /><br />A point of some amusement is the table of supported linux architectures. Surely some of these will be exiting the stage soon. Who is going to keep developing linux for the DEC Alpha or the 32 bit MIPS?<br /><br />Don't be put off by the Novell logo on the cover. Love works for them and they approved the book. But in going through it, there seems to be no pro-Novell slant.

McFedries gives useful tricks across each of the Microsoft Office 2003 applications. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access and Outlook. A certain amount of prior knowledge about each would be useful to you.<br /><br />The PowerPoint chapter was the easiest to understand. Perhaps because PowerPoint itself is straightforward. Its output tends to be simpler than grunging up an intricate function relating several cells in Excel, say. Also, the PowerPoint chapter has good style guidelines that may be more important than the specific tricks discussed.<br /><br />The Access chapter may be the hardest. Access is essentially a very nice UI and a stripped down SQL ability. While you might not need to know SQL, much of the chapter's points involve set manipulations that are functionally equivalent to ideas in SQL. The level of abstraction here is the highest, across the Office applications.<br /><br />The book also goes into ancillary offerings like SharePoint and VBA.

Notably Novell, as described in this book.<br /><br />The first 3 chapters are a good, vendor-neutral explanation of open source and why you might want to go with it. The advice is commendably objective. For these chapters alone, you may want to seriously consider getting the book.<br /><br />The remainder of the book explains Novell's proprietary offerings. It suggests possible advantages in adopting their Open Enterprise Server. The level of discussion is moderately technical. Seems mostly directed as an overview for management.<br /><br />En passant, I have to remark on a list of 10 reasons, given in chapter 4, claiming that Novell \\"is the best choice as a partner\\". One reason is \\"Novell has more resources and talent focused on delivering enterprise class linux and open source technologies than any other vendor\\". I am very dubious about this. IBM is much larger and has been offering this type of linux support for several years.	2005-06-13

It is true that when fully configured with your music tests, it is quite easy to use. But a lot of this operational simplicity is due to complexity being pushed off onto a Mac or PC.

But the author correctly suggests that you consider downloading the newest version from Apple directly.<br /><br />The book has an amusing chapter on toys for the iPod.

There really is not a set of chapters of traditional text. Rather, Binder has chosen almost a slide show format. Each page is dominated by a diagram and bullet points therein. At the bottom of the page are a few short paragraphs expanding upon the diagram. This approach has the virtue of focusing your attention on the diagrams. The visuals are indeed strong.

From the vantage of a SQL user, it is a dumbed down SQL implementation. But it has a very nice GUI that pure SQL engines like SQL Server or DB2 lack.<br /><br />So most of the hacks in the book relate to GUI issues. But a minority pertain to the SQL limitations, compared to SQL Server. Access cannot make an outer join, for example. But hack 53 provides a workaround, just in case you need to do so.<br /><br />Another group of hacks illustrate how Access can be used in combination with Microsoft Office. Microsoft has cleverly provided ways for Access users to integrate their tasks with Word and Excel. In one case, Excel can reorient your Access data. Or, more broadly, many of Excel's functions can be used within Access. These methods key off Microsoft's strengths in a mature Office suite.	2005-06-09

For one thing, these tend to be much better illustrated. Kemble's book was written at a time when diagrams were expensive to incorporate, even in black and white. Newer books offer an easier time, with graphics for major topics.	2005-06-08

Perrin's book gave important experimental validation of Einstein's theoretical thesis.<br /><br />The book shows Perrin's meticulous attention to detail. You might appreciate the sheer tediousness of some of the observational techniques. Nowadays, much of this would be automated. But Perrin had to do everything manually.	2005-06-08

You are expected to know the rudiments of at least one of these languages. It might be worthwhile to have this book around, as a possible quick time saver, if you're debugging.<br /><br />Looking over the gotchas, one sees how the ambitious scope of .NET has sometimes caused problems. In any given language, you know that certain names cannot be used for variables or classes, because they are reserved keywords. But .NET lets you mix source code from different languages. If you do this, the reserved keywords in C#, say, effectively expand to include keywords in those other languages. Something you never had to worry about before.<br /><br />Another gotch arises due to arrays. In C#, the array size is one more than the maximum allowed index. In VB, the array is made with that maximum value. Inconsistent.<br /><br />The book has other items that are more intricate. Some of these might be new to you.	2005-06-06

He's branching out. His trademark twisted sketches generously decorate this book. Possibly an inspired choice of illustrator by the author. It syncs with the irreverent tone of many of his explanations of business terms.<br /><br />Put it this way. If you ken to the spirit of Dilbert, then you may well enjoy this book as a companion text. Dilbert concentrates on technical issues. Sturgeon broadens the scope to most any type of company. Chances are, you might already be familiar with most of the terms. But perhaps not with the spin given in the book.	2005-06-05

This portion of the book is not dissimilar to other books on advanced C++ or Java.<br /><br />But C# lives within .NET and Microsoft offers Visual Studio 2005 as the IDE for C#. The only thing comparable in those other languages might be a text on using Eclipse as a Java IDE.<br /><br />So for some of you, the attraction of Liberty's book might simply be to learn what productivity improvements VS2005 offers. You can, and probably should, read the official Microsoft documentation on VS2005. But Liberty provides an independent analysis that is possibly more concise. He focuses not on a comprehensive explanation of VS2005 features, but only on those that he deems actually useful. You'll have to consult the book to see whether you agree.	2005-06-04

Brickner offers a Microsoft Windows user a simple way to try out linux. By booting from the book's CD. An elegant formulation that dates back over 20 years, to earlier operating systems, where you might have an emergency, read-only medium to boot from.<br /><br />In the linux world, Knoppix is the best known bootable linux. This book uses a slightly different version, which it calls Move. If you boot Move, the book shows how it runs the KDE interface, instead of the Gnome. The KDE should be easy for a Microsoft user to grasp. Plus, it comes with several virtual desktops. Only 2 by default, but you can have up to 16. A great increase in your workarea. You should definitely try this, assuming that you decide to boot from the CD.<br /><br />The book just talks briefly about the differences between Move and Knoppix. But I doubt if a Microsoft user would care. Even a regular linux user might feel the same way.	2005-06-03

If you came to Java from a C/C++/unix background, as most of us did, then you've used make. Which can certainly still be used for Java apps. But the book shows how Ant has carried the idea further.<br /><br />Notably in its use of XML files for control. This lets Ant key off the tremendous expressive flexibility of XML. So useful is the idea that about half the book seems to cite XML examples.<br /><br />The book also goes into integration of Ant with other utilities. Like CVS depots for version control. And for testing builds in an automated manner, Ant can easily work with JUnit. It may well be that the integration explanations are the most useful parts of the book, for they go well beyond simple, standalone usages of Ant.	2005-06-03

This era of Reconstruction and the Gilded Age saw the US rise to a world power. He describes the projection of US imperialism into the Pacific and the Americas. The observant reader might glimpse the unabashed enthusiasm for empire, as the US strove to match the European powers.<br /><br />Amusing and long forgotten anecdotes are recountered. As in the appointment of a Secretary of the Navy who had never been out in more than a rowboat. But Beisner also often mentions incidents of neglect by Congress, or of lost opportunities. Serving to show that US foreign policy was never a single, overarching doctrine. But the sometimes inconsistent result of many forces, political, economic and social.	2005-06-01

Yet during that decade, there was a cultural flowering in the American Negro community. Centred at Harlem. Huggins takes us to that place and time. The narrative is enhanced by one key trait. This book was first published in 1971. The research that went into it was done in the late 60s. Several influential persons of 20s Harlem were still around and the text gives their direct experiences, from interviews with the author.<br /><br />In this way, Huggins provides a primary text for future students and historians. But given the 30 years that have elapsed since publication, that is who current readers are.<br /><br />The book shows how even with the severe strictures on Negroes throughout much of the US, a spirited culture could still arise and thrive.	2005-06-01

In pre-dot NET, ASP was a clever way to make dynamic web pages on a Microsoft web server. This book shows that under .NET, ASP has built on and extended that idea. As for instance, being able to do state management. A powerful idea that can be vital in building a complex web application and minimising the coding and debugging time.<br /><br />The book also covers XML usage. You can integrate this deeply into your application. Plus, XML is the basis of Web Services. The entire last section of the book (3 chapters) is devoted to this.<br /><br />On a forward looking note, Web Services offer exciting future innovations that can span many machines run by different companies. ASP is explained in the context of furnishing and using these Web Services. You also get an explanation of Web Service Description Language. The only failing of the book is that in going over WSDL, it omits to mention Business Process Execution Language. This has been out for over a year. It is far more expressive than WSDL in providing a declarative format for an aggregation of Web Services. Surely ASP can use BPEL?	2005-05-29

Ok, you can implement a set of interrelated classes and get everything compiled and run. But, and you're aware of this, there may be refinements in coding that elude you. So Meyers offers a cookbook of 55 improvements. I'd agree with the cover's claim that these recipes are indeed specific enough to be useful. Take the suggestion about deferring variable definitions as long as possible. This minimises the chance of creating unused variables, which has an attendant cost in computing and memory, if the compiler is not smart enough to omit them. Plus, there is a cost in harder coding and debugging, if the definition of a variable is many screens before its first usage. Such a contrast with earlier languages like C or Fortran, where you have to define all the variables upon entry to a subroutine. This example also shows an unheralded merit of the book. A bunch of recipes are also germane in other OO languages like Java.<br /><br />The only gripe I have is with the suggestion of declaring data variables private. I certainly agree with it. But this is one of the first things you learn in any introductory text on an OO language. It really seems unnecessary here, unless the author is just padding out the book.	2005-05-26

Broadly, it closes various security holes in the default XP setup. There is more to SP2 than this, as Culp explains. But the closing of holes should be your first focus, if you are a sysadmin.<br /><br />For instance, a nice improvement involves Outlook Express. Previously, when it received an email addressed to a valid user, it would inform the sender. But this meant that a spammer could find out which of her addressees at that destination were valid. So she could purge invalid entries. And the valid ones now become more valuable, including for resale to other spammers, simply because they are known to be valid. So those users would end up getting more spam. Grr! In the ongoing struggle against spam, Outlook's approach was too permissive. SP2 now stops this notification.<br /><br />Another change that does not involve security, but improves the user experience, is a stronger ability for blocking popups. Very useful against some websites who put you into an infinite popup loop.<br /><br />The book starts by assuming that you have installed SP2. It can equally well be read beforehand, as a reason to do so.	2005-05-25

Then the book takes the next logical step by going to helium and thence to heavier atoms. LS and JJ coupling and other refinements. Such material is now quite well known and you need this for a solid background.<br /><br />But the book also has much more recent material. On quantum computing using qubits. These attempt to use the quantum states of small groups of atoms, to perform computations fundamentally different from current digital efforts.

Here, he specialises to the important case of nuclear systems. The text continues the impressive depth of theoretical detail evident in that earlier book.<br /><br />You can get a thorough grounding in the theoretical aspects of modelling a nucleus. The many-body treatments are sophisticated. It does mean that the text may not be the easiest to read. Not through any flaw in the writing, but due to the inherent nature of its subject. It would really help you to have prior acquaintance to Feynman diagrams. In terms of actually being able to generate these, and get numbers, like cross sections, out of them.	2005-05-25

The success of it led to the incorporation of many new features. Most important of these being perhaps the ability to write object oriented code. The sum total of these features causes a blurring of a difference from \\"full\\" languages like C++ or Java.<br /><br />While it is still possible to program using much of early Perl, this book's aim is to educate you as to the new material. Yes, Perl's scope is now impressive. What with a comprehensive regexp, bidirectional pipes, Unicode and more. How much of this to take in from the book is up to you. Thankfully, the chapters seem mostly independent of each other. So at this level, you have random access, which means you don't have to read all of the book. Each chapter, however, has a strong narrative sense of progress. You should read a desired chapter end to end.<br /><br />A little irony here. Remember claims by some early proponents of Perl that you could skip the complexity of C++'s STL, for example? Or, more recently, to avoid the bulking up of the class packages in standard Java. Perl now has the same symptoms of success.	2005-05-24

Here, Monday identifies several useful patterns in WS usage. We're talking about a collective, distributed computation here. That is (or can be) usually asynchronous. Another book (\\"Remoting Patterns\\" Wiley 0470-856629) discussed patterns for a general distributed case.<br /><br />But Monday focuses on what might emerge as useful within the strictures of WS. Especially if we use Web Services Description Language or Business Process Execution Language. In terms of example code, he chooses Java to express this. But the text makes clear that the patterns are of course independent of any given coding language. (The WSDL and BPEL and other WS variants are declarative languages.)<br /><br />You may find the book useful if you are new to WS. It gives a higher level view of what might be done. Whereas other WS books could be concentrating more on the WS syntax. Also, you may find out whether BPEL is sufficiently expressive for your needs. BPEL was conceived in large part because WSDL ran into limitations. But BPEL itself needs a practical workout by developers.	2005-05-23

In cutting prose, they explain why XP has serious problems in any practical implementation. They highlight the first serious use of XP, in Chrysler. Which ended in the project's cancellation after 4 years of effort. But somehow, the XP proponents tried to sweep that under the rug.<br /><br />The book explains why XP is so brittle. For it to work in a large project, all its aspects need to be implemented. If just one is not, then it endangers the entire operation.<br /><br />Pair programming and collective ownership of code is shown to be deeply flawed. Any group of programmers is likely to have members varying widely in ability. Programming is an elitist field. Talent matters in any complex project. But those aspects of XP invariably invite programmers to tinker with and degrade code that was written by better programmers. Who then have to repair the damage. The aspects do favour a weak programmer, because her bugs get fixed by others. But a real danger to the project is that your best people leave in disgust.<br /><br />The authors discuss this and other topics in very readable detail. Hopefully, they will disabuse you of any illusions about XP.	2005-05-23

[A review of the 2nd EDITION 2005.]<br /><br />If you follow the database field, you will know of IBM having published a series of books explaining the details of DB2. These have been well received by DB2 users and are probably considered authoritative on it. Seems like Kyte is doing the same here, with regard to Oracle.<br /><br />The book is offered with comprehensive, fine-grained explanations of much that Oracle's databases can do. The book is also structured to be more than a (heavy) reference tome. You should be able to teach yourself Oracle from scratch using it, and assuming only a prior knowledge of generic relational theory and SQL.<br /><br />Regarding the book's size, Kyte points out that the official, full Oracle documentation spans some 10 000 to 20 000 pages.<br /><br />In a nod towards a common situation, chapters are supplied for writing C or Java procedures. Databases have to interface with the real world and these languages are often used. Some of you will like Kyte's preference for writing Java code instead of C.<br /><br />The only puzzle is that the book explains up to Oracle 8.1.7. Yet Oracle's top version is now 10g, which has been out for over a year.	2005-05-22

Such that you end up with one big and robust computer. The attraction is price. The machines use commodity hardware and linux is free. As opposed to an expensive monolithic computer.<br /><br />The book's audience appears to be a sysadmin or network designer. Very details oriented. Much attention is given to system utilities that you will need to monitor this network that is the cluster. A big benefit of the book is in simply educating you as to what utilities have already been written under linux, to support clusters.<br /><br />The clustering described in the book does not seem to encompass mentioning Beowulf clusters. The latter is an alternative approach that has seen some adoption in scientific circles. I'm guessing that from what the book describes of a linux enterprise cluster, that the omission might be because linux now has the equivalent capability.	2005-05-21

Concentrating on kinematics. Unsurprisingly, because most videogames depict things in motion. Hence, if you've already had that amount of physics, you are in good shape for the book. You can now focus on the coding aspects.<br /><br />The entire book is about simulations. The code isn't that difficult to grasp. Perhaps the hardest aspect to some readers will be reconciling the two mindsets. How do you map from a set of physics equations to a computational representation?<br /><br />The book also slides into object oriented programming. Useful if you are new to this idea. The simulations of various bodies lends to a very natural projection of a code object (a \\"class\\") onto a physical object that it simulates. Good pedagogy.	2005-05-20

Some of the text pertains to any current Microsoft operating system. More broadly, some lessons can be applied across any choice of operating system. Like that on planning Internet connectivity.<br /><br />The book is aimed at both those who want to learn about such networks and those who want to pass an MCSE exam. But realistically, most readers will or should fall into the second group. For you, the book should be a good fit. While the authors say that the layout is oriented around skills rather than MCSE domains, there is still a strong focus on delivering what you need to pass the exam.<br /><br />The layout is good for review. With usually a page of text on a topic and an adjoining page of screen captures. But it can seem occasionally confining, if you had hoped for a lengthier discussion of some topics. The format is too restrictive for a first time encounter of its subjects.	2005-05-20

Didn't look like an O'Reilly book, at first glance. No 19th century style woodcut on the cover. Seriously, though, Date presents what you might call a \\"clarification\\" of a relational database usage. He takes issue with current SQL implementations. But to gain from this book, you need proficiency in SQL and some understanding of relational databases. Not for the tyro.<br /><br />If you also hail from a pure maths background, that will aid in understanding. He revisits the basic concepts of relational databases; injecting considerable rigour into defining these. Perhaps most importantly, he shows why nulls are very bad in a table. Relational theory is built on Boolean logic, but nulls force a ternary logic that can screw everything up. And duplicate tuples (rows) are almost as bad. The fact that all current SQL implementations routinely permit nulls and duplicates shows their limitations.<br /><br />Rather unsettling, if you thought that db2 or Oracle were the last words in this field.	2005-05-20

Instead, Zalewski goes back to the basics of IP and TCP. Much of the book revolves around low level fields in the IP or TCP headers. And how different operating systems often have different policies about filling these fields. A Microsoft OS and a Unix OS would initialise a TTL with different values. So what? Well, a passive surveillance of traffic might give a reasonable guess as to the OS, based on observed TTLs coming from that machine.<br /><br />Other aspects also come under similar reductionist scrutiny. Some of you with a maths background might appreciate the book's analysis of the pseudo random number generators using in making sequence numbers. There are 3 dimensional plots of these outputs, which show very different shapes for different OSs. More importantly, most do not exhibit good randomness. Zalewski eloquently demonstrates these shortcomings.	2005-05-17

It's probably accurate to say that the testing is as important as the teaching. The book is geared explicitly to letting you do numerous specific tasks (or problems). Vital in internalising the information in the lessons.<br /><br />Actually, the main narrative is itself very action oriented. You are taken through detailed pathways into Excel. Hence the book is good for those who have trouble learning from a standard text that they might typically find to be too general. Another usage context is if you need a quick refresher; especially on specific operations.<br /><br />The problems themselves don't seem too hard. The biggest issue may simply be finding the time and resolve to go through some rather lengthy ones. But then again, the problems are not meant to be trivial \\"one-liners\\". There are other books, notably by O'Reilly, of the cookbook format. Where the \\"recipes\\" are one or two pages of steps you do with some program. These certainly have merit, when you are looking for solutions to simple queries. But the GO book is more at a project level, with inherently lengthier tasks.	2005-05-15

Superficially, you might first think the book will teach you how to use a computer. You know, like an Idiot's or Dummy's book. But Beekman has far broader scope. The book is not about learning to use a particular type of computer or software package. Rather, he steps back to give a survey of all that computers can do and indeed might do in the future. This is a forward looking book, after all. Most importantly, he describes what can happen when you connect computers together. Into the Internet and thence the Web. Arguably, the book is as much about the latter as anything else.<br /><br />In many ways, this feels like a well written history book. The perspectives herein and the sweep of the discussions has those cadences. Explicitly reinforced by numerous sallies into computing history. Gives the reader an appreciation for broad and continuing trends. Not just for esthetics. A major aim is to help the reader cultivate her own understanding of these trends. So that in her own career or habits she can benefit from anticipating what can be done with computers.	2005-05-13

Though he does not couch it in those terms, and Microsoft would certainly not put it that way, that is how it could be regarded by a frustrated Visual Basic 6 programmer. When VB.NET was released, the attraction to programmers was the access it gave to the entire .NET platform. But many VB6 programmers found that a massive incompatibility emerged. Plus, VB6 was a very mature product, with many optimised features that were lacking in the migration.<br /><br />The good news in the book is how Microsoft has striven to answer many of these issues. More generally, the book describes refinements that should make your life easier. Not just in VB. A lot of the text delves into ASP.NET. Which is a corollary expertise you should cultivate. I think the title should make some reference to ASP.NET, so extensive is its discussion.<br /><br />Purely as one improvement, there is now a Web Site Administration Tool that lets you configure your ASP.NET web parameters. In the past, you had to hand edit the XML file. Very error prone. Overall, the book is like this. Talks about numerous improvements.	2005-05-12

Berkun touches upon many aspects of leading a technical group. Of all his remarks, I found the most relevant to my experience was when he talked about where ideas came from. He devotes a chapter to this. As an inventor, it was the most germane to me. While your background is probably different, being able to come up with original ideas and implementing them is a good ability to cultivate. Both in the context of project management and more broadly in any technical sphere.<br /><br />Berkun points out that creativity can be enhanced by persistent mental exercise. And that if you have had good ideas in the past, you should recall carefully the environments in which these occurred. Any commonalities imply that you might want to reproduce these in the future, to increase the odds of more good ideas. I and possibly many other inventors would concur. Creativity can be fickle and you need to tip the odds in your favour.<br /><br />Yes, if you are a hard core techie, this can seem frustratingly intangible. But important ideas might not arise from a low level focusing on solving a bug list. That may be necessary in your work, but insufficient for a broader vision.	2005-05-12

He called it MIX. It was quite representative of the actual assemblers of the time [late  60s]. But time and Moore's Law marched on. The 8 bit nature of MIX grew increasingly outdated.<br /><br />In response, Knuth gives us here a massively upgraded version, called MMIX. It operates on 64 bit wide data. Yay! Still a classic von Neumann architecture, mind you. But very spiffy. MMIX also has 256 general purpose registers and 32 special purpose registers, where these all are 64 bits wide, naturally. Plus, MMIX lives in an address space of 2**64 bytes of memory.<br /><br />Unlike the Intel or AMD chips, which are CISC, Knuth opted for a RISC MMIX. So learning the opcodes is very rapid, if you have dealt with assemblers before.<br /><br />This little text gets you up to speed in MMIX. Consider it as prep for the full volume 4, when that comes out. [Prof. Knuth, it's late.]<br /><br />But this MMIX book is utterly unlike any other assembler book. It comes replete with programming problems (and answers) of considerable intellectual heft. Conventional assembler books simply don't do this. Their problems tend to be mundane and trivial. This book lets you find surprising conceptual depths hidden under a deceptively simple language. Compare this to chess.	2005-05-08

But, as it is a reference manual, it does not attempt to teach you MySQL or the theory of relational databases. For a given MySQL command, the book's explanation is succinct and useful. Provided you already have a background in the area. Much of the book's discussion is probably already available in equivalent form in the online help. But hardcopy is nice to have.<br /><br />Going through the functions, what you might appreciate about MySQL is that many of these are generic SQL functions. If you come from any other SQL implementation, your background will be relevant to much of the book.	2005-05-08

This book certainly claims so. It is a strong endorsement of the new Firefox. Whether or not this might be so to you, the book is certainly a well put explanation of Firebox. In some ways better than a standard text on a given computer program. Have you ever noticed that most of those pointedly ignore the details of a competing product? So that a book on Oracle's 10g might shun any nitty gritty comparison with IBM's DB2. Here, there is very pointedly a detailed feature comparison with IE. Not all the features of IE or Firebox are covered. But enough to give you an idea of the differences. When comparisons are made, there is no mincing about.<br /><br />Quite aside from all this, the book also discusses Firebox being able to easily handle the wildly popular RSS and blog feeds. Though any unique abilities here will surely be transitory. The browser contest may be heating up, but Firefox isn't shown here as having any lasting advantage that IE [or Opera or...] can't implement in their next iterations.	2005-05-07

The book divides into two parts. The first deals with pure ADO.NET improvements. Many of these. Perhaps the most tangible of which can lead to you writing less code, and hence [hopefully] more robust code.<br /><br />It will depend a lot on the reader, but for me, I found the main thrust of the book to be in the second section. Which concentrates on showing how ADO.NET handles XML. You can see how it can publish relational data very naturally in an XML format. Indeed, the book shows how XML has the expressive power to also represent semistructured data that is inherently awkward to store in a relational database. (Except perhaps as a blob. But that just treats it as an opaque unitary entity, which is of limited use.)<br /><br />A constant message in this part of the book is showing how System.XML is thoroughly integrated with ADO and with all of .NET. Professionally, if you are dealing with ADO or any other aspect of .NET, you need to bone up on System.XML.	2005-05-05

With an understandable emphasis on the Internet. To those readers who might consider computer networking synonymous with the Internet, the first few chapters explain otherwise. Like the telephone networks. Originally all analog, they are now mostly digital. Halsall goes through the sundry alphabet soup of ISDN, ADSL, SONET and the like. He shows that one of their defining characteristics is a circuit switching approach, which gives a very high reliability.<br /><br />The book also covers recent developments in wireless nets. Including the infrared Bluetooth and the cellphone nets. Where the latter arguably affects as many people as the Internet.<br /><br />Finally, as he ascends the protocol stack (which is another concept clearly explained), he gets to the Internet. Detailed exposition of DNS, which is one of the core functionalities. Email is also gone into, as this was the first killer app of the Internet. As someone who is involved with antispam technology, I found his description of the email structure and relaying to be concise and spot on. A good level of explanation that covers all the key points.<br /><br />Naturally, for all of the book's topics, you can find entire books devoted to each. But the encapsulated view of the book is hard to beat.	2005-05-01

Holzner presents a concise and logical unfolding of PHP, and without taking 1000 pages to do so.<br /><br />The first 4 chapters are about using the basic syntax. Much the same as several other languages like C or C++. The if-else and switch statements will look similar to what you're already used to, for example. There are the open and closing notations for a code block to get used to. But this is pretty simple.<br /><br />The real point to the language is given in later chapters, on handling HTML in web pages and making forms and being able to validate these. Here, you really need prior acquaintance with web servers and HTML, to fully appreciate what Holzner explains about PHP.<br /><br />He also gives more advanced usages. Where PHP can be written in an object oriented manner. A relatively recent thing in PHP. Also, he shows how to hook up PHP to a back end relational database. For the latter, he chooses MySQL. But Postgresql or any other RDB could probably also do just as well.	2005-04-29

The bias is in favour of open source tools, if only because these are free. The book goes deeper than just explaining how to run Nessus or Ettercap or... [etc] Most chapters involve the writing of plug-ins or extensions to those tools. Actually, another criterion for a tool to be covered in this book seems to be if it has precisely this ability to be extended by any competent person (like you).<br /><br />Thus, the book is directed slightly more towards the network programmer than the network sysadmin. Though this is by no means a sharp demarcation, I hasten to add. In fact, you might be a sysadmin dissatisfied with running your current Intrusion Detection System package simply just out of the box. If so, try actively programming plug-ins using this book, to adapt the IDS to your actual network situation.	2005-04-28

The book goes into many reasons why this should be so. It suggests that unlike the vast majority of technical innovations, which trickle down slowly from the developed countries, the wireless Internet's uptake may actually be comparable or even faster in some of the latter than in the former.<br /><br />Cell phones are the main example. While it might be objected that these do not typically use the Internet Protocol, with time that difference will disappear. Take the rise of Voice Over IP as the prime example. The book makes the cogent point that cell phones in a developing country are attractive because they can be deployed almost immediately. Whereas landlines might well take a year (or more) to install. And these necessitate a much greater physical buildout, which explains part of that delay.<br /><br />Plus, cell phones can be used quickly as a vital means for farmers and others to gain access to information. Where previously this might have been the monopoly of middlemen. Thus, there could be a quick boost to productivity and income in low-income groups.<br /><br />The book also suggests that the mass uptake of these wireless gadgets may lead to innovations rising out of the developing countries. Certainly, the potential sheer size might give them leverage in terms of having devices made that are affordable to them.<br /><br />Very promising future.	2005-04-25

The didactic style is the same. So too is the very distinctive Tex typeface. (You know that he invented Tex, don't you?)<br /><br />Of course, there are the problem sets. This little book has two sections. In each are 112 problems. Strewth! Knuth thoughtfully gives an estimate next to each of how long it will take you to solve it. Those estimates probably refer to someone of his calibre. I've attempted most of the problems in his earlier volumes and could typically only get within a factor of two of the time estimate. And this was only when I could actually solve a problem.<br /><br />The book addresses a gap in the literature of computer science. Research papers in journals or books of conference proceedings do not usually present you with problems. While introductory texts do, but those are simple. Very difficult to find a solid compendium of challenging problems.<br /><br />Such is the attraction of this book to me and perhaps to you. The potential readership is exclusive and self selecting. The only drawback is the wait for the rest of Volume 4.	2005-04-25

One is those seeking to learn SQL. The other is those wanting to learn Postgresql. Naturally there is some overlap. But consider the first group. There are indeed several good texts on the theory of relational databases and using SQL to access and change these tables. But the books often deal at an abstract level that does not use a specific SQL implementation. Which makes it very hard to learn SQL. As a practical matter, you need to commit to an implementation, even just as a pedagogic decision. Well, as the authors explain, Postgresql is a good choice. It conforms broadly to SQL92 and is free open source. (The only other major free alternative being MySQL.) After all, you typically can't get onto a free copy of Oracle 10g or IBM's dB2 to learn from.<br /><br />So just from this standpoint, the book gives you a solid learning experience with SQL. Eminently transportable to a job involving a proprietary SQL, like those mentioned above. Of course, those have unique tweaks. But the methods described here are universal to the field.<br /><br />Now what if you want to actually learn Postgresql? There are chapters on using it from the command line and so on. The book also devotes a chapter each to getting at Postgresql from C, PHP,  Perl, Java and C#. Typically, you are unlikely to need all of these chapters. But it shows the flexibility of the database.	2005-04-25

Though it must be said that this is best done with respect to Microsoft's languages of choice - C#, VB.NET and SQL Server. But if one of these is indeed your coding language, then the book offers a grab bag of tips.<br /><br />The guts of this book are in one chapter - Debugging. Avery correctly points out that without debugging, Visual Studio is just a tarted up text editor clamped to a compiler. The 8 hacks in this chapter are thus pivotal in the book's potential utility to you. If you have ever used any debugger, then the chapter's concepts will be familiar. Like setting breakpoints at selected lines or functions. Or debugging a running process. Plus, Visual Studio has special means of debugging SQL Server. For some of you who have to maintain code for the latter, this ability can be Visual Studio's best feature.<br /><br />Now if only Visual Studio were cheaper!	2005-04-25

And in related ways, so too has the idea of a parseable news feed. To try and enable all this, the book explains RSS and Atom. It's directed towards programmers working on a web site.<br /><br />It is an awkward book to read, as it describes the RSS versions 1 and 2. Unlike other standards or software packages, where a version 2 supersedes version 1, here the RSS versions compete with each other! Yes, they are similar. But not quite. It is this dissimilarity that will give you heartburn. Hammersley explains that in general, when you connect up to an RSS feed, you can't tell which version it supports. So you have to grunge your code to support both. Grr!!<br /><br />Worse, as he continues to explain, sometimes a newsfeed is not fully compliant with either version. Due to a combination of poor programming by that supplier and ambiguities in the interpretations of the RSS versions. Plus it gets \\"better\\". Some feeds are not even valid XML. Yuk! So you have to decide who liberal your parser should be. Analogous to the poorly formed HTML pages out there on the web, and the subsequent decisions by browsers as to how tolerant they should be of these.<br /><br />Hammersley has done a decent job explaining RSS. It's just a miserable subject to code.	2005-04-25

This at least is one conclusion from the papers in this handbook. They describe the active areas of investigation. Despite the massive increase in computational power available to reseachers since the 80s, and better algorithms, pattern recognition still faces unknowns.<br /><br />Closely tied to this is the entire issue of what constitutes robust computer vision. The book gives examples of applications where better methods would have tangible uses. Like being able to identify objects in a video stream. Or recognising human faces. The latter problem has achieved some prominence due to a heightened anti-terrorist mood since 2001. So at least some problems can usually get the researcher adequate funding.	2005-04-24

There have been several books written by participants in failed dot coms and telco startups, about their experiences. But this book is an overview of the entire phenomenon. Unlike other texts, it covers both the technical and financial aspects.<br /><br />Be warned that this is not a John Grisham novel. It is necessarily dry in parts, as the author explains the technical innovations that made the Internet and Web viable to a mass audience. But he also goes into discussing the survivors, like eBay, Amazon and Yahoo. Just a fabled few that came through the mass extinction. We also see massive fraud, especially for WorldCom, which falsely claimed that Internet traffic was doubling every quarter, instead of yearly. This was to prop up its stock. But it also rippled through the entire telco industry and the dot coms, by promising growth that never came in the expected time frame. So that many of those companies went broke first.<br /><br />The book is a salutary warning of the damage that human excess and unbridled optimism can wreck. Yet, he concludes that the Internet is still inexorably growing.	2005-04-24

In the field of multiple/concurrent processing, there is still a variety of hardware offerings. You get a discussion of trends. Most importantly of whether the Intel or AMD chipsets might predominate over more specialised chipsets for future architectures. The economics of mass produced cpus suggests that you may want to hedge your bets as to what you commit to.<br /><br />Further up the food chain, the book goes into various software approaches, especially with an eye towards being deployed on Web servers. Unlike some specialised multiprocessors, which might be mainly used in science, the Web servers have broad appeal. Here, Enterprise Java Beans, object pooling and other subjects are gone into. However, while this section of the book may have broader appeal, it is more comprehensively covered in other texts.	2005-04-24

Snort is renowned for its rule language and its vast flexibility. It is a reasonably high level \\"script\\" that seems more declarative than procedural. Ok, I'm speaking a little figuratively, but if you scan the rules, you might see what I mean. The chapter explains how to build rules of varying levels of complexity, depending on your needs. One neat trait is the profuse range of options for detecting traffic around the machine running Snort.<br /><br />Of course and inevitably, the default rules base has grown and it is regularly updated. Currently, these defaults number some 3000, and few sysadmins have the expertise to understand all of them. So one recipe tells you how to get and run an updater program (Oinkmaster). Though you are cautioned about letting it change your rules automatically.<br /><br />Other recipes expand upon the rule scope in interesting ways, like looking for p2p or Instant Messaging traffic. You might be responsible for a corporate network that bans these, perhaps. Here is a simple way to show a supervisor how you can stay on top of the problem.	2005-04-24

The text is straightforward and accompanied by well chosen illustrations. The book centres on using KDE as the desktop UI, instead of Gnome. Perhaps it could also have given more equal coverage to the latter?<br /><br />If you are perhaps coming from a Microsoft computer background, then the types of tasks should be familiar.

How to design such a formidable device? Wolf gives a decent explanation to the student or engineer. You have to be careful here. The term VLSI has been in wide use since the 80s. There are scads of books with \\"VLSI\\" in their titles. Yet an unwary reader might end up trolling an obsolete text. With Wolf's book, the material reflects current design standards.<br /><br />One clear difference between his book and a text from, say, 1990, is the relative deprecating of small scale circuit design. To be sure, he does explain various techniques for putting together simple circuits. These are still necessary skills. But much higher level design skills now come into play when dealing with millions of transistors.<br /><br />For instance, scrutinise the chapter on floor planning. The real estate taken up by interconnect is a significant fraction of the chip. Being able to optimise subsystem layout according to various criteria like distributing a clock with minimal skew or distributing sufficient power is vital. Luckily, it is not all rule of thumb. The chapter delves into various methods to aid you.<br /><br />The book should give you a good exposure to VLSI ideas.	2005-04-23

Spanning over 2600 pages, it is offered as a comprehensive summary of computer science. Logically, the book's first section is on algorithms, as these are the building blocks for much that follows. The algorithms discussed are quite diverse, ranging from cryptography to data structures like hash tables. The level of detail here is not as great as Sedgewick's books, let alone those of Knuth's Art of Computer Programming. But that is really due to space constraints.<br /><br />Later sections of the book go into such topics as data visualisation. Something you wouldn't have seen in such handbooks twenty years ago. This section covers both the GUIs of programs as well as usability issues. An important and very topical section concerns various fields of science, and their myriad intensive computational demands. A natural close relative of the visualisation section.<br /><br />Hopefully, you already have some background in computing. The handbook is not meant for a tyro to usefully peruse. But for the experienced user, it can be a boon.	2005-04-23

He is attempting to cover a lot of ground here. Firstly, by explaining how to use Microsoft Windows XP for various tasks, primarily in a standalone mode. Mundane but important details like how to setup a network in your home, or office, for that matter. And how to react to hardware problems. Notice I don't say \\"repair\\". Because nowadays, it's simply not economic for anyone to repair most broken hardware.<br /><br />But perhaps the main thrust of the book is in the interaction of you and your computer with the rest of the Internet. Email and surfing the Web, naturally. For these, computer security has become a huge problem, as spam, viruses and other malware have proliferated. These tend to target XP because of its predominance. (Linux and Mac users often get a free pass.) So Perry goes into some detail about countermeasures or precautions that you can and should do.<br /><br />It should be said that you won't need to read all of the book. It's well suited as a reference. Just refer to what you need.<br /><br />Broadly, the book is certainly optimistic in terms of how you can benefit from XP. Just take certain precautions!	2005-04-22

This entire field is in a state of flux as many companies, including IBM, Amazon, eBay and Microsoft, search it for a killer app. The book and the field groan under the weight of a slew of acronyms - SOA, WSDL, SOAP, UDDI, WS-Security, BPEL and more. Unfortunately, there is little that you can do about this but pay attention.<br /><br />The key idea in the book is of Service Oriented Architecture. It gives us a loosely coupled system; made of nodes that asynchronously communicate using message oriented protocols. A non-blocking mode that greatly improves the robustness of the entire system. The book goes into all this and far more.<br /><br />A major merit of the book is that it is very up to date. Including an explanation of Business Purpose Execution Language. This is the latest big innovation in Web Services. It grew out of the realisation that Web Services Description Language was not expressive enough to describe intricate business logic across different interacting Web Services, even in a declarative format. So BPEL was devised to handle this shortfall. Essentially, any other book on Web Services that omits mention of BPEL is now obsolete.	2005-04-22

Here, the emphasis is on a higher level than, say, the crafting of algorithms. The scope is for systems analysis, design and implementation. He explains that the traditional waterfall method had many shortcomings. Its monolithic stages often proved unwieldy.<br /><br />The book goes into alternatives. It also gives a good overall treatment of such ideas as formal specification and architectural design. With an entire chapter focusing on the key ways to have distributed systems architectures. Unsurprisingly, CORBA gets the most extensive description. A reflection of the amount of effort that has gone into using it since the late 80s. However, there is scant mention of its drawbacks. Most important of which has been that the exchange of binary data has been very brittle.<br /><br />He mentions p2p and Web Services, as contrasting approaches. Where the latter uses XML to exchange data in a readable format. This has been widely seen as a big advantage over CORBA, but the book doesn't mention it. Given the continued rise in Web Services, perhaps a future edition of the book could give it more coverage?<br /><br />The most controversial part of the text might be the section on Extreme Programming. Its characteristics are well described. But perhaps not enough on its disadvantages. Like the idea of collective ownership of code. Not all programmers have the same ability or expertise. Some programmers are far better than others. It is very bad to have a tyro unwittingly change code for which she has insufficient understanding. While the author may not necessarily agree with this, he should at least describe it.<br /><br />Other sections of the book, especially on testing software and validating critical system parts, are quite lucid and should excite little disagreement.	2005-04-22

Firefox was released just a brief time ago and here is a book to help explain why you might adopt it as your browser. The chapters reflect the current concerns of many. Immediately after an introductory chapter, there is one for guarding your privacy. Firefox comes replete with strong measures for its password manager and has detailed cookie control. Even nicer is a way to stomp popups and for blocking images.<br /><br />The book also offers help with blogging. Though perhaps this may not be all to the good for some of you, if you already spend too much time reading or writing them.<br /><br />As for the companion topic of Thunderbird - it seems intriguing. Its best feature might simply be its coordinated integration with Firefox. But without the latter, I couldn't discern much advantage beyond whatever mail client you are currently using. The functional space of mail clients has seen relatively little innovation in recent years. Most clients have comparable functionality and Thunderbird by itself seems likewise.	2005-04-21

Alas, many might not be fully aware of the numerous tweaks you can perform. So this book tries to educate you. Naturally, a lot of the hacks relate to the desktop. The book allocates a chapter each to the KDE and Gnome desktops. It does not play favourites by suggesting one is better than the other. So the authors pragmatically support both.<br /><br />As a sign of the book's recent vintage, there is one hack involving Firefox. But given that this browser's rise has scarcely halted, if there is a future edition of this book, we can expect far more hacks on Firefox.<br /><br />Perhaps it is a good sign of linux's security that the only mention of viruses in the book is in the context of running Microsoft Windows emulators or in reading Microsoft Windows documents.	2005-04-20

She imagines that you are a novice at all this. So the book walks you through the main aspects of computing. Unsurprisingly, several chapters are devoted to Microsoft Windows and its Word and Excel programs. Reflecting its dominance of the desktop. But the book isn't exclusive. It gives respectful coverage of the Mac; acknowledging its ease of use. Plus unix and linux get an all too brief mention.<br /><br />For many users, a key attraction of a computer is to interact with others. So the two killer apps, email and the Internet, each get a chapter of common sense guidelines.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book has weaknesses. It avoids completely any discussion of Instant Messaging, Internet Relay Chat, peer to peer networks and blogs. And no mention of using your computer to play or record music or video. All these are massively popular, and it is a sad shortcoming that a reader will find no assistance with these in the book.	2005-04-20

From over 300 authors in the Python developers community, who freely contributed their suggestions. So much so that the editors had a difficult time culling down into what they consider to be a minimal [!] set of 338 recipes. A big expansion and update over the first edition, which dealt with earlier versions of Python.<br /><br />O'Reilly has been experimenting with innovations in technical publishing, and this book is an impressive example. It is a natural manifestation of the open source movement and the power of the Internet to bring such a community together. So while superficially from the book's cover, it looks like many other O'Reilly books, it may be a harbinger of future efforts. And not just in Python.	2005-04-20

Instead, its main merit is a focused, problem-based approach. For long established subjects like calculus, say, the usefulness of having extensive problem sets for a student to tackle is apparent. And thus there are indeed plenty of texts to supply those problems.<br /><br />But for the mobile wireless field, most standards and implementations are still so new. There has been little time for some author to come up with a suitable and indepth suite of problems, until this text. The comprehensive nature of these may be very attractive to a lecturer. Plus, the author also offers an adjunct solutions book.	2005-04-20

The reader can clearly see that the stages of development vary vastly between countries.<br /><br />The book can also offer you a cautionary note about the potential pitfalls in investing in a wireless venture.

Firstly to let Australians more easily connect with each other, in the country. And then to give them far more access to information from the rest of the world. The book describes in detail how in a swift 10 years, the rise of the Web created these gains for Australia.<br /><br />While parts of the book talk about the pre-Web Internet, realistically as far as the average Australian is concerned, it was the Web that makes a difference.<br /><br />The book is a serious study of various aspects of tbe Web that arguably are helpful to Australia. If you are looking for a simple introductory book on the Web, this is not the one. Rather, it is more of a sociological study.<br /><br />Another beneficial aspect of the Web has been the ability for ex-pats to stay in touch with home. The book doesn't delve much into this. But no longer are you confined to waiting for a week-old Australian newspaper, grudgingly coaxed from a London or New York newsagent. Plus of course the many newsletters and mailing lists that are now offered from Australia.	2005-04-18

Scarcely over a decade since the Web began, there is still considerable uncertainty about using the Internet for certain types of communication. Perhaps the greatest struggle has been over how to perform effective educational instructions via the Web.<br /><br />Some of you will appreciate a little irony here. Sloane's publisher maintains several web pages for this book, so that readers can go to these and interact and hopefully learn more. However, if you try that, you will see that most of the material is very minimal. The page for \\"lecturer support material\\" has very little content. While the page for \\"Useful links\\" has none. All this compares unfavourably to other publishers who have invested far more effort in using the Web to support their books.<br /><br />Unintentionally, the book reveals some of the confusion as to the best use of the Internet for teaching.	2005-04-18

He and Hans Bethe (who also died recently) were some of the last luminaries left from the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos. This book, which was produced with the assistance of the Los Alamos Historical Society, is his biography of Oppenheimer, who directed the Lab during the War.<br /><br />The book gives numerous personal anecdotes of Oppenheimer, including after the war. But it is perhaps the war years that will attract the most interest.<br /><br />The book's technical accuracy is also excellent. Many biographies of scientists that you might read are written by people who often have at most an undergraduate degree in those fields. So sometimes the scientific explanations might be slightly off. But Bacher was a top physicist, and the technical observations in the book are spot on. At Los Alamos, Bacher headed the engineers, who actually built the bombs, while Fermi headed the scientists. Bacher reported directly to Oppenheimer.<br /><br />Bacher is renowned for one impressive achievement. (Amongst others.) In 1945, when the hemispheres of fissile material were made (each half a critical mass), it was found that they were too large to fit into the bomb casings. It was too late in the war to redo the casings. So Bacher held each hemisphere in his gloved hands (\\"It felt warm\\") and lathed it down until it fitted into the casings. He probably remains the only human being to have ever done so.	2005-04-17

There have been several books written about the Project and Los Alamos. But these have naturally concentrated on the technical difficulties, which were awesome, and on the scientific top brass.<br /><br />Instead, Brode shows what it was like for someone not directly involved in the research or engineering, to endure the isolation. Where this was deliberately and stringently enforced due to wartime secrecy. The book gives a backdrop's depth to that strange, wonderful society. Possibly, it is worth reading as a adjunct to the fictional books that have scenes in the wartime Lab. Helps you assess how accurate those authors were in their depictions.	2005-04-17

Sadly, often these originals might be scattered across many musty journals. Or those journals themselves might be in tattered shape.<br /><br />An alternative, insofar as 20th century physics is concerned, is offered here in this weighty set of 4 books. They reproduce the key papers in a century of revolutionary thinking. Appropriately, the first volume deals with Einstein's Special Relativity, as these papers tended to appear early in the century. The second volume shows how he and others expanded this into the sweeping elegance of General Relativity.<br /><br />But surely it is the third volume that will attract the most attention. It deals with the rise and impact of nuclear physics. Above all of course in the Manhattan Project. But also in the long decades of the Cold War, as physicists were mobilised on both sides.<br /><br />No doubt with each volume, knowledgeable readers may quibble about papers omitted. But given the space limits, the editors have done a fine job. All the included papers are rightly landmarks.	2005-04-17

The level of writing seems to be directed at students of politics or economics.

Be careful about exposing your communications as clear text, that can easily be evesdropped by anyone nearby.

The authors heavily downplay the formal maths aspect. No predicate calculus and no proving of theorems. Of necessity, the Normal Forms are explained, including the contributions of Boyce and Codd to this development. Simple relational tables are used for illustration. This topic lends itself easily to diagrams of interrelated data sets held in tables. Which is probably more visually understandable anyway.<br /><br />Perhaps the most important chapter is on making a conceptual model of your system or problem. In a top down approach, you start here. And it can be rather intangible until you build up expertise. Subsequent chapters show how to parlay the conceptual model into a logical model and then into a physical model. Important steps, to be sure, but secondary. Focus on the essentials.	2005-04-16

The intent is to reduce the defect rate in software. With an emphasis on doing this when we have several million lines of source code. All the more so if the application might involve safety issues or be critical to its company's bottom line.<br /><br />Humphrey points out that the writing of such large code might typically follow practices used for code bodies orders of magnitude smaller. But that this leads to far too many defects. He explains that PSP offers a discipline for the individual programmer to follow. And how this can be scaled to a team of programmers.<br /><br />PSP stresses investing in design time and review time, relative to the actual coding time. It's big on writing down the times spent on these stages, so that you have actual quantities to see and from which to get metrics. You cannot improve what you cannot measure. The review time is considered a good investment, for finding bugs here is inherently more productive than relying on a downstream testing stage or user feedback.<br /><br />Perhaps the most contentious aspect is whether to do a review of your code before compiling it?! Many will not. After all, the compiler can swiftly find the syntax errors. Why waste time looking for these beforehand? Isn't this a retrograde step? The book's rejoinder is that syntax errors might be considered to be distributed like more serious logic errors. Hence, if you review before compiling, and find 80% of the syntax errors that the compiler finds, then perhaps you only also found 80% of the logic errors. Opps?<br /><br />A simple and ingenious self diagnostic tool. But despite the logic of this, water will flow uphill before any significant portion of programmers adopts this method. Pressing 'make' or its equivalent to do a compilation is simply too easy. The book is on far more plausible ground describing the other aspects of PSP.	2005-04-15

Stirs the imagination of anyone who loves science fiction.<br /><br />But the book also has a \\"serious\\" aspect. You can get useful tips on how to start making such art. The book describes the main software packages used by professional artists. Photoshop is the dominant package. But what is neat in the book is how artists often use several packages. Typically, they might be making a three dimensional construct, and then rendering a two dimensional image. Photoshop does not have 3d modelling. So you have to use other packages like Maya. But then, when rendering, Photoshop can be applied to touch up the 2d image. Since often, the 3d packages can indeed to very sophisticated operations like ray tracing, that make photorealistic images.<br /><br />Paradoxically, an artist might then want Photoshop, in order to enhance that image into something unearthly.<br /><br />Most computer graphics books that deal with commercial packages are usually dedicated to only one package. With scarcely a mention of any alternatives. This book can be used for operational integration. And also for its evaluations of the strengths and weaknesses of the packages.	2005-04-13

Because no one would try to intrude onto your Apache server. Besides, you don't mind a stranger being able to to that anyway, eh? After all, surely there is nothing important on your server's disk and in the computer on which it runs?<br /><br />If  you agree with the above, then stop reading.<br /><br />Otherwise, reflect on a symptom of our times. As intrusion attacks become more sophisticated and your Apache perhaps has to guard valuable data, then its security has been promoted to an entire book. Basically, all of its material has been discussed elsewhere, but often scattered across the literature.<br /><br />Here, Ristic gives an extended discussion of many aspects. Some of this involves educating you about related topics. Especially a PKI and how to integrate Apache with it. The book skims over any serious crypto complications, but explains how to use such a system.<br /><br />Ristic also devotes a chapter to Denial of Service attacks. These can be low tech brute force affairs. Or perhaps a cracker might mobilise a massive botnet to launch a DDoS, which is the more dangerous form. There are ways to militate against these. But since the book is about Apache, it does not devote enough space to the use of an Intrusion Detection System or Intrusion Prevention System, in conjunction with upstream routers. Apache by itself is not enough to defend against the worst DoS attacks.<br /><br />The book also mentions phishing. It claims the problem is hard and that there are no quick remedies. It's a reasonable assessment of the commonly understood state of the publicly known antiphishing methods. Though this does not preclude the deployment of better methods that are not yet publicly known. [I am the co-inventor of 15 US Patents Pending on antiphishing, which our company plans on implementing.]	2005-04-13

The first part of the book goes heavily into describing the main variant forms of Agile development throughout the world. Of course, Extreme Programming is a very vocal variant. But there are also other noteworthy versions, like the Crystal methodology and needless to say, the book's subject - Iconix. The book gives the authors' views on why Iconix, with its rapid iterations, but still using a serious initial modelling and use cases, is superior.<br /><br />The authors sound plausible. But if you read most any book on program development, they might all sound likewise. The differences between Iconix and the other Agile variants seem fairly small. Though they do seem important to the authors.<br /><br />The second half of the book is a non-trivial case study of a project worked on by them. It is indeed rare for this level of detail to be given to a single example. The merit is that you can get a serious scrutiny at how Iconix unfolds on a real world task. To some of you who might find the first part of the book to be rather intangible, this case study may have more substance.	2005-04-13

To a large extent, the chapter topics can be recognised by a sysadmin of any operating system - managing disks, running jobs, handling processes and so on. But some chapters are indeed very Microsoft-specific. Dealing with the Registry, IIS, Active Directory and Exchange Server.<br /><br />All the recipes have the merit of being quick to read and understand. Which is the attraction.

There is a slight defensive tone about the latter purpose, given the Enron fraud meltdown.<br /><br />There is an elementary discussion of the physics involved in power generation and transmission. To give the reader a basic understanding of what actually happens. Including the physical limits of a transmission line on the amount of current that it can bear. As well as the transmission losses incurred when selling energy over long distances.<br /><br />But much of the book deals at a higher level. Notably, explaining how to comply with government regulations, including the various regulatory bodies, where these might be at the Federal or state level. Not surprising, given the Enron scandal, which is still unfolding, and the heightened government scrutiny over the entire utility industry.	2005-04-12

Other books might give lesser amounts of detail. And then, a particular book usually describes only how a given operating system does its storage. Carrier goes further on both counts.<br /><br />He describes how Microsoft, Apple, BSD, linux and Sun do their disks. Though Microsoft's FAT and NTFS get the most extensive coverage, due to the prevalence of disks using these formats. Hierarchies of disks are also covered, like the RAID levels. Plus logical volumes of disks, which span actual sets of disks.<br /><br />The cutting edge topic is forensics. It is to this end that he explains throughout the book how knowing certain details might aid you in recovering data. Consider his discussion of slack space as one example. He shows how if an operating system does not overwrite this, then a post mortem can reveal fragments of an earlier, supposedly deleted file. (Gosh!) Similar to how an operating system might delete a file by erasing the pointer to the file, but not the actual contents. I'm simplifying here. But perhaps you can see the utility in knowing exactly how files are kept and removed.	2005-04-11

Newtonian gravitation, two body problem, and motions of celestial bodies. Where it starts to get interesting is in explaining how to find the orbit of such a body, based on a minimum number of observations. Clearly aimed at the astronomer in you. Then the theory is developed further into the n-body problem, with the 3 body problem being an important special case.<br /><br />But the truly modern material is in the discussion of interplanetary flights. Takes some time in the book to actually get to its ostensible topic. Hohmann trajectories are given wide coverage, because in our current level of technology, our spacecrafts are fuel constrained, more than anything else. Hence we make trajectories that minimise to the utmost fuel consumption.<br /><br />The book then recaps several missions. Notably the Grand Tour by the two Voyagers to the outer solar system. Wonderfully successful.	2005-04-11

Yet there were still clearly common attributes of the town's culture, than spanned those intervening years. The scientific elite of the town in both 1988 and in the book's period, had an insularity. Bred in part perhaps by the sheer intellectual fascination of the problems they were working on. And which they could not explain to outsiders.<br /><br />But the book also explores the working class sections of the town. A group often overlooked in other \\"official\\" histories. It explains informal demarcations of the time, in the social mixing.<br /><br />A further nuance was not just class but ethnicity. New Mexico was and is a relatively poor, rural American state. Many of the locals were Hispanics, trying to scratch out a living on poor soils. So the lab was always able to find a plentiful labour force. Which had some resentments against the elite, often Anglo scientists. In 1988, this was perhaps not as pronounced. But still present.	2005-04-11

It was a seminal study of how mathematics developed in the ancient world. Cajori focused on the classical realm of the Mediterranean world. But then also in more recent times, when Europe was in its Dark Ages. He explains how the Arabs and Indians gave their contributions. Especially the role of the Arabs in, albeit inadvertantly, nurturing the maths knowledge painfully accrued in past millenia.<br /><br />Unlike recent texts, there are no snazzy diagrams or whatnot to enliven the narrative. Figures in books were very expensive to arrange in the 1910s. But the writing itself remains lucid.	2005-04-11

There have been many good accounts of its technological history.  Here, Steinberg and his co-author give a different take. Steinberg is an architect who settled in the San Jose area shortly after the war. He was commissioned to build many homes over the next 60 years.<br /><br />This book is his recollections of the times. How the Valley grew and grew in influence. And so too did the prices of houses. Spiralling ever upward in a trend that was only occasionally reversed. We also see cameo \\"appearances\\" in anecdotes of his dealings with the famous technology leaders that arose in the Valley.<br /><br />For those readers who want a broader sense of what might one day be considered a belle epoque, that goes beyond the merely technical, see this book. It provides an ambience for those times.	2005-04-11

The level of physics and maths required is moderate - one year or so of freshman courses.<br /><br />The important materials are explained. Silicon, gallium arsenide and others. Kasap also provides many diagrams to illustrate key ideas. Plus, this is clearly meant as a student's textbook. Many examples of problems are worked through. To some students, this may be the clearest way to understand and apply ideas.<br /><br />Kasap also found ways to greatly simplify standard mathematical treatments. Expands significantly the size of the audience who can appreciate the ease of understanding. Because a longstanding issue in materials science has been that texts were often written by physicists, for physicists or physics majors. Often leaving them too abstruse for engineering students, who also had a need for comprehending the same ideas.	2005-04-11

Basically, Access is Microsoft's way of letting you easily set up a database. This book shows how to use this front end. There is a substantial amount here, because Microsoft loves massive user interfaces. Or, more seriously, because controlling a database is no simple task, GUI or no GUI.<br /><br />At least here you are presented with short lessons. One or two pages each. If you have a specific Access need, the contents page that lists the lessons should be consulted. You never know. Sometimes the answer, or a close relative of it, may be suggested by a lesson.<br /><br />The conceptual boundary of the book is given in the last chapter, on advanced topics. Here is where you see integration with other Microsoft offerings like Excel or Word. These lessons are fine. But they are more noteworthy for hinting at far more intricate abilities.	2005-04-11

Of course, rarely is the invention under dispute as pivotal as the laser, which is one of the distinguishing tools of the 20th century.<br /><br />Several other reviewers have commented that Townes, Maiman,and Schawlow made huge contributions to the field. Yes, but not the invention of the laser. Their contributions came afterwards. Nor were those later contributions under contention by Gould. So when a reviewer makes the above remarks, it is a non-sequiter. Either the reviewer has totally misunderstood the book, or he is deliberately introducing irrelevancies because he can't get around the basic point.<br /><br />This point was established after long litigation. Gould had clearly conceived of the idea, and had it timestamped. Under longstanding US Patent rules, that idea and its timestamp trumped all others.<br /><br />Another point mentioned by several reviewers was that Ted Maiman at Hughes Research Labs was the first to reduce it to practice. That is, he was the first to make a functioning laser. But for decades, it has not been a requirement of the US Patent Office that the reduction to practice is necessary in order to be awarded a patent. This wasn't just some rule made up especially for Gould to benefit from. The gist of being awarded a patent is that you have to describe the invention in sufficient detail for someone skilled in the art to construct it. You [the inventor] do NOT have to construct it. Someone ELSE must be able to do so.<br /><br />Think about it. In general, it is a key property of a patent. That not only the inventor, but someone else can produce the invention. A patent is not a secret recipe.	2005-04-11

It teaches both computational physics and the use of C++ in writing object oriented code. Clearly, if you are already know one of these topics, but not the other, then the book is a natural fit. You can concentrate on what is essentially half the book.<br /><br />The more challenging task is if you are unfamiliar with both. Well, it is reasonable to assume that you know some physics, say at the first year undergraduate level. And perhaps you have done some programming, in a procedural language like Fortran or Basic.<br /><br />The amount of abstractions, or rather the level of difficulty in this, is less than in a typical physics text that is explaining Maxwell's Equations or Einstein's Special Relativity. The physics in the book revolves around trying to compute certain numbers in an efficient manner.<br /><br />While from a programming standpoint, computational physics examples are given as an important use case, to help the student grasp the OO concepts.	2005-04-11

Books	4	4	4	N	N	much unknown	Cosmic rays are something that the general public has heard of, but typically has no idea what it is. Well, Clay hopes to dispel some of that ignorance in this brief text. He explains that these are nuclei often travelling at very high speeds; often several percent of the speed of light. Just being nuclei, without any accompanying electrons, means that they are highly charged.<br /><br />Which gives rise to the experimental methods to detect and study them. Ranging from balloons carrying detectors high in the atmosphere to ground-based detectors. The experimental aspect of this field can be somewhat colourful.<br /><br />But where do they come from? Why so energetic? He goes into several possible explanations. Possibly from stellar reactions deeper in the galaxy. But it is contentious as to what those reactions are. Some cosmic rays are known to come from our Sun, and give us insight into its structure and composition.<br /><br />Much is still unknown in this field.	2005-04-10

This book helps explain what some of the advances are. It gives basic material about radiation, photometry and the like. There is an important explanation of how the atmosphere has traditionally limited the resolution of images (at least in the visible spectrum) due to turbulence. Which leads the book into some of the attractions of space-based telescopes.<br /><br />But the book also goes into how ground based telescopes are overcoming the atmospheric barrier. Using adaptive optics in \\"smart\\" telescopes. This lets them cancel out the effects of turbulence, on the time scale of that turbulence. Very impressive. We can push to the instrinsic limits of the optics.<br /><br />The book takes you to the frontiers of modern astronomy.	2005-04-10

The book explains how from the equations of GR, a massive star that is in the line of sight between us and a distant bright star can cause the production of multiple images. Several of these have been observed in the visible spectrum. Eloquent images.<br /><br />Thus, the book also goes into the observational evidence for such lensing. This involves testing the light from the purported images, to affirm whether or not the spectral properties of the images are similar enough that they are in fact images of the same star. Are the redshifts the same, for example?<br /><br />It is also shown that the lensing also gives us a diagnostic handle on the star doing the lensing. Very useful, as the star might be so distant in its own right as to preclude several other types of analysis.	2005-04-10

But part of its success is that it can be used as an all-purpose \\"smart\\" table. So much so that a comprehensive text on Excel can easily span a thousand pages, if it seeks to fully explain all its capabilities. The irony about such a text is that the original use in making a financial statement can be obscured. Try reading one of those texts. While its author might be knowledgeable about Excel, how much accounting does she really know?<br /><br />Rubin's book is a response to those texts. He is a practising accountant (CPA). He focuses on a reader who needs to write a real financial spreadsheet.  And who probably does not care about loading an image into a cell, or making another cell a clickable hyperlink.<br /><br />Thus the book has a very utilitarian feel about it. He has stripped down Excel, to explain only what you might plausibly need. This also makes the book far quicker to read, if you are time constrained. Perhaps the best thing about this book is that it is not really a computer book. (In the sense described above.)	2005-04-10

It goes over the main concepts of numerical analysis, which the authors call \\"scientific computing\\". Same thing, really. Unlike earlier years, where someone studying this field would have to write out her own Fortran code to apply the methods, we now have MATLAB. The authors chose this powerful package as one in which to explain and implement the algorithms.<br /><br />These algorithms are essentially unchanged from what a book on the topic might have described, 20 years ago. Finding numerical integrals, roots of equations, solving linear systems of equations etc.<br /><br />But using MATLAB helps streamline any coding. And you are encouraged to code, in the problems supplied by the book. There are even answers to some of these. So quite apart from understanding the concepts, a bonus is that you can become quite adept at fully using MATLAB's abilities as a research tool.	2005-04-10

Typically these are covered in very theoretical books, that describe high level abstractions, with little in the way of code for the reader to experiment with. Hardy offers a different approach. There is still an advanced treatment of the topics. Where these range from cryptography to genetic methods to quantum computing and others.<br /><br />But he gives you C++ and Java code, to simulate various systems. A great benefit in aiding your understanding of what are often research level matters. In which case, if you are a new researcher, like a grad student perhaps, then you might be able to get up to speed quicker.	2005-04-10

But certainly it is richly endowed with diagrams that illustrate many key computing concepts. What is distinctive, compared to earlier books, is how he starts off with chapters on the Internet, web and electronic commerce. He explains how the Internet and the web are not actually the same thing, though in general parlance, people often confuse the two. The web dates from the rise of http/html and the first browsers in 1992-3. And e-commerce really only starts in the late 90s.<br /><br />By doing so, he's acknowledging the importance that the Internet has become to some many of us. Even and especially to someone entering the study of computing. Whereas you might pick up another text on computing, written this year, that delves into a lot of theory, but scarcely mentions the Internet.<br /><br />The rest of his book is fairly conventional. Though with many illustrations, as mentioned already. The emphasis is on software. The hardware gets a good but brief coverage.	2005-04-10

He gives a history of various existing wireless networks, where these were not necessarily deployed with an aim for use with sensors. So we see the Aloha network that spans the Hawaiian islands. And how the dispersed nature of the islands led to the development of this network some years ago.<br /><br />He walks the reader up the protocol stack. For the physical layer to the data link to the network layer. The stack is used as a way to understand the similarities and differences between the various networks. (Think of a periodic table in chemistry, as a good analogy.)<br /><br />Then, he goes into explanations of topics like antenna design. Very practical for any wireless network.	2005-04-10

Here the authors focus on helping with your PC's hardware. This includes both the hardware in the PC itself and any common peripherals or network that the PC is associated with.<br /><br />Unlike the earlier Degunking books that I've seen, this starts off with a nice convenience. Four pages at the very start that summarise the major steps you can do. Lists are also given for various time limits under which you have to perform the tasks. Handy.<br /><br />Some advice seems quite mundane. Like tips on how to best physically clean the PC. But then the skill set of readers can vary greatly.<br /><br />Outside the PC, perhaps the most useful chapter for many is on making a wireless network, or connecting your PC to it. The authors carefully spell out the security precautions that you are strongly urged to perform. They stress that wireless can be far more insecure than wired. Heed this advice.<br /><br />There's even a brief mention of HomePlug. Making a network via the power supply in your house. This is still pretty raw and the book compares it to where WiFi was in 2000 - \\"expensive, bleeding edge\\". But maybe that will not deter you.	2005-04-10

Throughout the book, most figures are annoying. They are screen or window captures. The authors chose the quick and dirty way of doing this and then pasting them into the text. But the resolution of the resultant printed images makes the contents out of focus. Yes, perhaps if you squint hard enought and interpolate, you can deduce the text. But this is what I mean. Annoying.<br /><br />The chapters do offer amusing fictional plots that give tactics on both intruder and defender. Part of the appeal of the book is that these roles can switch. There are enough technical details supplied in the text to make the tactics credible to a computer person.<br /><br />The discussion on the limitations of MD5 to a crafted collisions attack is well done. Very sneaky. Though still quite speculative, as the text rightfully points out.<br /><br />The Strike Back chapter describes Armpit - a tool written as a \\"human detector\\". It is run as a daemon on a server. It permits access to resources only if the client browser can interpret Flash. This is seen as tantamount to implying that there is a human at the client, and not an automated attack tool, since most instances of the latter cannot do Flash. But this just begs the question. Surely if Armpit becomes common, it gives incentive for future attack tools to be able to run Flash? The narrative gives no technical reason why a cracker cannot take this logical countermeasure.<br /><br />More importantly, the book fails to recognise that Armpit is a challenge response method. Those of you familiar with antispam ideas should realise this immediately. Plus, Mailblocks has a patent on challenge response. It would have been useful for the book to discuss whether this patent (or any others) could make any infringement claims against the company that wrote Armpit.	2005-04-10

Hitherto, IDS have been popular, to detect such incursions into your network. But sterner tactics have evolved. An IDS is essentially passive. This book explores the concept of an Intrusion Prevention System.<br /><br />The strongest configuration is to put an IPS inline. So that it sits between the Internet and your computers. It parses the network traffic at any or all of the 5 layers, from data link to application. In its most intensive incarnation, it can analyse application layer data and modify these before passing them on. Plus, of course, it can block suspects attack messages, even in a zero-day mode.<br /><br />The discussion is fairly technical. A good prior knowledge of UDP and TCP is needed to make sense of much of the text.<br /><br />The book is also careful to warn of the pitfalls of using an IPS, especially inline. False positives and negatives. It is very hard to correctly find all the attacks. That is, to be able to implement a robust rule set to remove attacks from the traffic.	2005-04-09

Whether to do this on your own servers or to use an external provider. A nice and distinctive way to get a linux sysadmin's attention.<br /><br />The rest of the book then goes into the details of many linux and networking issues. The latter is covered because you are not assumed to be running just one machine. In general, you have several, often on a private net that is connected to the Internet. So, if you are looking for advice on configuring firewalls, for example, then it is provided here.<br /><br />Given the importance of email, there is a chapter on running a mail server - usually sendmail. My speciality is antispam, so I looked with interest on the details furnished here. But antispam measures are only briefly covered. It talks of using blacklists of spammers in sendmail, but only applied against mail relays connecting to the machine. No mention of using a Milter filter that pulls out domains from links in the message body, and checking these against the blacklist. Which has emerged as a key antispam method.<br /><br />The book also completely ignores Knoppix. This is a valuable tool for sysadmins. You make a bootable linux CD. For diagnosis of a machine if it crashes. Or if you think it has been subverted by malware. Knoppix has gotten a nice uptake from some sysadmins and you should know about it.	2005-04-09

Tomlinson offers an overview of the main issues that you may have to deal with. These include designing the database and, very importantly, limiting the scope of the project. You should be careful not to attempt too much in a first GIS project. Rather, attention should be paid to devising explicitly the remit of the project, and what it will not attempt to do.<br /><br />The examples in the book can be very useful in helping you do the above. Treat them as case studies that illustrate the manifold ways to intensively use geographic information.<br /><br />The book also shows how GIS has invigorated geography. For decades, it was a relatively sleepy field. But the availability of massive amounts of geographic information and cheap computing has turned this field into an exciting place for the new century.	2005-04-08

It came out when TQM was red hot in management circles. Since then, experience with TQM has dampened a lot of that initial ardour.<br /><br />Various chapters of the book are solidly written, though. See the discussion about the different types of contracts - Firm Fixed Price, Cost Plus and others.

Authoritatively written, but aimed at a general audience at the high school level of education or higher. Students should be able to find topics here of quite diverse interests. Oceanography, of course. Tidal waves and tsunamis [the latter being quite topical in 2005]. Readers can get an appreciation of the marine ecosystems throughout the world, and their intricacies.<br /><br />There is also descriptions of the economic importance of many human activities in the oceans. From fishing to oil exploration.<br /><br />This text might inspire some students to follow future careers in these fields.	2005-04-04

So the chapters are designed with the new Perl 6 features explicitly demarcated and usually at the start of each chapter. The book emphasises what is different about Perl 6.<br /><br />But it is also more than for Perl 5 readers. The book can be read as a complete explanatory text on Perl 6 OR Perl 5, for someone who has never programmed in any version of Perl. It shows that Perl 6 is in part a competitive response by the Perl community to the presence and influence of other languages. Overall, this evolutionary pressure benefits you, as a Perl programmer, by giving you a more powerful language.<br /><br />For me, the most interesting section was at the end. There's a nifty discussion of possible set operations, implemented in a simple syntax. Plus other more abstract computer science topics. Try exercising your imagination by perusing these pages, even if you can't see an immediate need for them in your coding.<br /><br />Also - it was good form for Walters, in an earlier review, to say that he wished he could've blogged without rating his own book.	2005-04-04

While she concentrates on the Pro version, the text helpfully describes differences with the entry level Basic version, that is strictly for a single user. And she also compares what the Pro lacks vis-a-vis the more expansive (and expensive) Premier and Enterprise level solutions.<br /><br />If you have used other Missing Manual books, you might discern that this text seems to have more intricacy than most of those. In part, this could reflect the subject at hand - your accounting. By its very nature detailed and quantitative. Those who need this product tend to be highly motivated to knuckle down and spend the necessary time to read all the details. Other texts on other products might describe consumer level products that are recreational. A book like this, you read because you have to.<br /><br />In the text, I found the most interesting remarks were about the optional Merchant Services offered by Intuit. Where you can get a merchant account through them, that lets you accept credit card payments from your customers. You'll have to evaluate the cost-benefit details compared to going to a bank. But potentially it's a great time saver, that lets you outsource a lot of the hassle of handling credit cards. If that is probably not a core competence of yours, it's worth considering Merchant Services.	2005-04-03

He's condensed into 63 items guidelines that promise to be useful to many C++ programmers. Naturally, you're expected to already be conversant with the basics. You can write and compile a C++ program. But rather than produce a huge tome, he offers tips that are 3 to 4 pages long. Pragmatic and quick advice. The tips are also random access. You can pick an item and it rarely depends on earlier items.<br /><br />This does mean that there is a slight grab-bag ambience. When you read a typical book on coding, it is often necessarily linear. Dewhurst has a different emphasis.<br /><br />The items are also not that difficult. Deliberately so. Dewhurst avoids the more intricate but relatively rarely used aspects of C++. Nothing on template metaprogramming, for example.	2005-04-03

This book tries to provide a rational and non-sensationalistic basis for protecting your home computers. Plus, and perhaps more to the point, to safeguard you and your family from online predation.<br /><br />There is necessary but mundane background on the basics of computer hardware and software and networking. But the book quickly moves into numerous spying methods. For surveilling a PC, browser, email, IRC and Instant Messages. Basically, for all the common modes of usage of a computer. The authors show that there are some disturbingly powerful programs and hardware devices floating around out there, available to anyone.

BFK captures keystrokes and screen captures, and can periodically email this data to any address on the Internet. A bloke could have some fun with this.<br /><br />A utility of the book is simply alerting you to the existence of programs like this, even if you never avail yourself of it. Which leads into the last section of the book - countermeasures to various methods described earlier in the text. Parse it carefully.	2005-04-01

There is little here on the elementary, standalone syntax and usages of VB.NET 1.1. That is adequately covered elsewhere. The emphasis is on hooking to databases. Where these are SQL-based, in most practical cases. The text gives much detail about constructing in VB the various SQL commands to be sent to the database server, as queries or statements. And, of course, to parse the results into something meaningful under VB.<br /><br />You are also offered more. Standing between your VB application and the database is ADO. Microsoft has devices the latter as a uniform front end to different databases, to simplify access. Well worth knowing.<br /><br />Now if your application also involves a web UI, then you can refer to a section on integrating VB with ASP for making those web pages. For completeness, it was added to the book. Though keep in mind that this ASP section is a less crucial part of the text, compared to learning about ADO.	2005-04-01

While many of us easily surf the Web, there is room for you to be more creative; to assert your interests in a positive and cool manner.<br /><br />The author starts from a very minimal configuration. He explicitly wants you to type in HTML. There are products available which can hide much or all HTML from a website developer. But the author seems to believe, and I think, correctly, that you'll ultimately gain more understanding by getting down into the HTML itself. Takes the mystique out of it. Besides, the examples in the book don't involve much typing.<br /><br />Most of the HTML tags are explained. Plus, by necessity of setting up a website, he also introduces issues that you will have to deal with. Like choosing an ISP to host your site. And on what basis do you make that choice? Do they have 24 hour technical support, for example. Or do you really need this? There's more, of course. Enough to keep you busy.	2005-04-01

Along with various software that lets you analyse the data for yourself. Any of you in research who've had to write software should appreciate the amount of effort that has gone into the coding of that software.<br /><br />The book also provides you with a very recent (2004) assessment of the best current understanding of pulsars. With many references to the original research papers.<br /><br />But the combination of text and website is a harbinger of future astronomy books, as volumes of data keep increasing.

Their editors have amassed a chronicle of key inventions and discoveries, spanning the history of human civilisation. Some 400 inventions are explained. Albeit briefly, because of space considerations.<br /><br />The book tries to put these into a context of ever onward and upward. Though in the historical periods (especially antiquity), these inventions must have been repeatedly invented and forgotten.<br /><br />As an item of terminology - the \\"inventions\\" also include things which are arguably discoveries. Like the positron. It certainly existed in nature before physicists were aware of it. Though algebra might indeed be an invention, to some who would regard it as a pure construct of the mind. But others, especially some physicists, would pay that no heed; saying that such things exist independent of human consciousness.	2005-03-30

The term has become so loosely applied that some have argued for more rigour. Which Steiner provides here. While he does not claim that the topics in the book span all that might be correctly called nanotech, they cover much of it indeed.<br /><br />He devotes a lot of discussion on the making and uses of quantum dots. Which are in fact typically at the nanometer length scale. There has been rapid progress in the improving of fabrication of devices using the dots. Notably for infrared detectors and lasers. The latter offer lower threshold currents than \\"conventional\\" solid state lasers.<br /><br />But nanotubes and the like are also favourably mentioned. Along with the exciting prospect of integrating Germanium and Silicon onto the same device. This may let us build fully combined electronics and optical functionality onto the same chip, and have that be made using much of current Silicon fab technology. A possible improvement over using GaAs chips for optical applications, and then trying to integrate those with Si chips for the standard electronics.	2005-03-30

Naturally, with each revision, more features are added. So where do you start learning? Well, this book breaks down the effort into small lessons. A single lesson does not seem that hard. The lessons are also buttressed by a review and quiz (with answers) at the end of each chapter.<br /><br />Hopefully, you should not find anything too difficult here. MS Word fundamentally deals with stuff (text and images) that are WYSIWIG. Relatively few abstractions. The lessons have the virtue that you can perform an operation and usually see its effect immediately in front of you.<br /><br />The most advanced and abstract idea is at the end - writing and running macros. A chance at programming! Any of you programmer types will dig this. Though what you can fully do with macros is only hinted at.	2005-03-30

I am commenting on the edition that just came out in 2005.<br /><br />Writing a distributed application is probably one of the hardest things to do well in programming. The authors describe the travails of other, mostly earlier attempts. DCE/RPC, CORBA, DCOM, COM+, Java RMI, EJB and Web Services/SOAP. Each had some disadvantages. Though Web Services appear the most promising. However, if you are coding such that all the machines will run .NET, then the authors suggest .NET Remoting. This is the key factor in whether you choose this over the vendor independent Web Services.<br /><br />As you'd expect, the book gives a thorough explanation of Remoting. In which perhaps the best chapter is that on Tips and Best Practices. It cuts to the core of what you can best do with Remoting in its current incarnation. In this chapter, you get good, frank talk about limitations with Remoting. Most notably, not to use events or callbacks when you have a server and many clients. This makes sense, as they explain, but will go against the grain of many accustomed to GUI application development.	2005-03-27

What with the cool shades of green and the musical instruments backdrop across the chapters. But in spite of this, and not because, it is still a decent read.<br /><br />Jones makes a good case fo adopting PHP-Nuke to develop out and maintain a small website, that solicits user input in the form of content that will usually be later published on the site. The modules are more than just for making web pages. There are also crucial hooks to SQL databases. Which you'll need for more realistic scenarios.<br /><br />You should know some HTML before venturing here. A lot of his code examples become easy to follow with this background, along with some experience of the basic operation of web servers. He discusses HTML page layout and how the program does seem to make development easier. But it is primarily for managing content, of course. Graphical layout is adequate but not really even in its remit. (For that, check out Dreamweaver for a more comprehensive treatment.) It's the manifold abilities like users having journals and making submissions and the like that are the focus.	2005-03-26

Namely XML and Web Services.<br /><br />The book goes through a lot of necessary but mundane stuff concerning user interfaces, server control and ADO.NET. Yeah, to know VB.NET, you need this material. But more significant is the long exposition on XML. It is now a de facto standard for markup of structured data. Within the entire .NET portfolio, it is pervasive. And also in the J2EE world. The book shows how Microsoft has integrated web development and VB.NET tightly into using XML. Well worth understanding.<br /><br />The other big buzz is about Web Services. Here the discussion is not as indepth. The basics are covered. But Web Services Description Language is only tangentially invoked. And what is seeming to be a more powerful language, Business Process Execution Language, doesn't even rate a mention. Perhaps this is why the title says \\"beginning\\"? There could well be a sequel in the works, to cover these.	2005-03-26

The tone is scholarly, with many references to important previous papers and texts. The book is targeted at developers and senior programmers. Much of it deals with the different levels of abstraction, and how you move between these. So that if you have designed a project using patterns, then this is a high level structure. The book offers aid in migrating this into a framework, which might be considered a reification of the patterns.<br /><br />An extensive survey is also given of various design/modelling tools that are available. These might be open source, proprietary or of the academic research type. One easy thing you can do with this book is to use its analysis of these tools. This is doable without having to wade through most of the rest of the book.<br /><br />The book will not be an easy read to some. A lot of material is covered and a considerable amount is fairly abstract. Without significant prior experience in design and coding, you may miss the full meanings and appreciation of much of the text.<br /><br />It makes a typical computer book look trivial.	2005-03-23

He warned of the perils of malware and of cracker attacks on corporate databases. Especially by social engineering.<br /><br />He presents several case studies of insecure privacy applications. He analyzed the commercially deployed systems of Alexa, DoubleClick and others. Showing how cookies and server side bugs could lead to users being tracked. In some cases, as they perused many different websites that reported their activities to a central site. Other books have talked about how cookies could be misused in this way. But Curtin's analysis goes beyond a typical generic treatment and can be more instructive to you.<br /><br />The malware of 2002 that he warned of has increased in sophistication and danger. No sign of abatement, so keeping the book's ideas in mind is a good idea.	2005-03-23

A certain cynicism seeps through, as he describes having to endure occasional (?) management stupidities.<br /><br />On many things, you may regard him as spot on. As when he talks about how some companies are de facto sweatshops. Where the management routinely expects programmers to put in tons of unpaid overtime. (Hey, the programmers have [some] stock options, don't they?) Worse, some managers when recruiting might downplay any such tendencies. Kudos to Duncan for his response. When he is being interviewed, he deliberately says any such hypothetical management would be morons. Or stronger words to that effect. (Heh heh.) Basically to test if they were forthright in the interview, by inciting them if they weren't. Perhaps you, too, might consider such an approach.	2005-03-23

Mason explains that though CVS is widely used, that very usage led to a keen appreciation of its limitations. Like not being able to version directories. Which essentially makes them second class compared to files. Yet, in projects of any complexity, the directory tree is a key manifestation of your attack on that complexity. Subversion acknowledges this by making directories versionable.<br /><br />Naturally, Mason also gives a good general discussion of what versioning is. You may not need this if you are already facile with CVS. But for others, it has merit.<br /><br />For me, having used a proprietary product, Perforce, Subversion seemed much simpler. Of course, Mason cannot help mentioning that it is open source and free.	2005-03-19

Where you might have one computer or many scattered across a network that you do not control. (Think Internet.) But text explanations they offer are lucid. And the readership is expected to be highly experienced. So it's very reasonable that you can take high level descriptions of translate these into design documents and ultimately, a functioning system.<br /><br />Of all their patterns, the first one, Lookup, is perhaps the easiest to understand and leads logically into the other more specialised patterns. Also, for Lookup, there is a rather comprehensive list of use cases. Very instructive, in showing that this very first pattern has such wide scope. As in LDAP, CORBA, UDDI, JNDI, Jini and p2p implementations like JXTA. All these have some variant of Lookup as a core and non-trivial central feature. Yet this may be the simplest pattern of the book!<br /><br />A good treatment, to motivate you to continue further and appreciate the other patterns.	2005-03-17

If you imagine a cycle to be like a human generation of 25 years, say, then some 370 years have passed since its debut! Which may explain the allure of this book to some. Perhaps you were too young to have been rubbing shoulders with Wozniak and Jobs at the San Francisco Homebrew Computer Club in 1975. Heck, maybe you grew up with the Web and browsers. (Punk.) Owad gives you a time tunnel. Hands on wiring and then coding in a dead assembly language. Feel what it was like for Wozniak.<br /><br />The book is even educational. Imagine that! Today's software is all covered in GUIs and GHz CPUs and Gbyte disks. Many programmers rarely (if ever) code in any assembler. A merit of the book is that it takes you back to the basics of computing. Sweating out assembly may give you a better appreciation of what all that high level source code you pound out ultimately has to do.<br /><br />If you are going to indulge in trying out the material, you should get more into the spirit of its time. Try playing a cassette [sic] tape of Abba or the Eagles, while coding.	2005-03-16

If you liked the characters and logic in that book, you will probably be attracted to this. Rather didactic in parts, with schematics of, say, the heliopause at the outer solar system. These diagrams would not be out of place in a science text. Benford actively tries to educate his readers. At times this leads to dry passages in the text.<br /><br />Did you know that Benford's research area is plasma physics? He parlays that expertise into envisioning vast alien intelligences that are basically sparse plasmas. A very evocative image. Along these lines, he makes a valiant effort to portray truly alien minds interacting with each other, and with humans. The effort is commendable. His aliens are not humans dressed up in funny skins, acting as aliens, which is what a lot of science fiction depictions end up as.<br /><br />But I am not sure that he truly succeeds. While yes, the aliens do come across as different, I found the resultant read to be rather dull and sterile.	2005-03-14

This is an interesting offering from Savitch and his publisher, Addison-Wesley. They have bundled Savitch's 5th edition of \\"Problem Solving with C++\\" with several CDs that let you learn C++ within Microsoft's .NET environment. The bulk of this package is still Savitch's book. The CDs are certainly an attractive convenience for learning. But keep your priorities straight. If you do not know C++, then it is the book that should be focused on.<br /><br />The book does start from scratch in C++. But the elementary material is dealt with thoroughly and quickly in the early chapters. A considerable portion of the book explains pointers and all the travails they can cause. In C, often the hardest problems come in inaccurate pointer manipulation. As a superset of C, C++ faces all these issues. So Savitch's chapters on pointers are perhaps the ones you might study most carefully and slowly.<br /><br />For the diligent student, the extensive sets of problems are a clear beacon. So too might be the dependency chart. It appears early in the book, and graphically shows, for each chapter, what previous chapters you need to know first. Very practical aid.<br /><br />As for the CDs that come with the book: Learning Microsoft's Visual C++.NET may be attractive to you. The development environment makes coding easy, with many graphical conveniences to find classes and methods of a class. Plus, this particular version of C++ has a significant presence in the marketplace. So careerwise, knowing it can help burnish your professional qualifications.	2005-03-13

The book has a CD with Oracle 10g for Microsoft Windows, and an associated Developer's License. You will need to install it to handle the many exercises he poses. (Another plus of the book.) But one can easily imagine an experienced developer getting the book for the CD alone.<br /><br />Now if you do need to learn Oracle SQL, de Haan proceeds at a careful pace. He gives you the syntax in understandable chunks; not too much to overwhelm. SQL syntax diagrams can be formidable in their full glory. But piece by piece, you should be able to assimilate the content.<br /><br />de Haan has also tried to keep to standard SQL syntax, as much as possible. At the level of an expected reader of the book, this is probably best. Oracle specific variants (just like other vendors' variants) tend to arise in more advanced contexts.	2005-03-13

As you might expect, the authors devote substantial space to how you might design the network; often with a firewall and DMZ. Inevitably the firewall will be attacked, so there's a lengthy foray into the various attack vectors and your countermeasures. Variants of a Denial of Service are perhaps the most common attacks. However, there's no analysis of the most virulent form, a Distributed DoS.<br /><br />I found the best strength of the book was its analysis of the various vendors offering products in this field. It's an up to date study of many key vendors. Cisco, Symantec and Novell, of course. But also much smaller entities like Tero and Net Continuum. The authors furnish an independent assessment of each company's main products.<br /><br />Other chapters talk about things like routing protocols and network switching. Important certainly. But you can find this material in other networking books. If you are considering this book, go for its comparative advantage of the vendor studies	2005-03-12

They approach this by using patterns as the key conceptual thread that binds the book together. Now, to some extent, the basic EJB functionality has been stable for several years. So at one level this book won't (and cannot) reveal any more EJB functionality than several other books already published.<br /><br />But if you regard patterns as crucial organising ideas in their own right, then this book may appeal to you. The patterns are higher levels of usage of EJBs. That perhaps other books have not made so clear, or even mentioned.<br /><br />Another distinctive feature is a frequent comparison of the EJB components and usages to COM+ counterparts. Every other EJB book I've seen totally ignores COM+, as being in another universe perhaps. In contrast, the authors hope the comparison helps give you more perspective on EJBs. Now, they do also compare EJBs with CORBA. Here, you might also benefit by seeing how EJBs can improve over CORBA implementations. The COM+ may be more pertinent though, as Microsoft seems to be pushing this heavily.	2005-03-12

Previously, or more to the point, in most current linux machines, the security was somewhat of an ad hoc approach. This is mitigated by a formidable array of open source IDS tools like Ethereal and Snort that let a sysadmin often successfully depend her network and machines.<br /><br />But as the frequency and virulence of malware attacks has increased, the Selinux of this book may be a timely reinforcing of the operating system. As McCarty explains, this book is geared towards a sysadmin, as opposed to a programmer. It discusses the new things you should know. Especially the concepts of role based access model and of domains. The former has shades of DEC's VMS, which had a very mature implementation. Or those of you with mainframe experience may also recognise familiar ideas.<br /><br />Programmers may find the book a little sparse, as mentioned above. But possibly McCarty is devising a sequel for them.	2005-03-12

A lot of the heavy lifting has been done for you in two modules - GD and ImageMagick. The chapters on those expose you to simple subroutines that you'd expect in any graphics package.<br /><br />But Wallace extends the scope to the usage of Postscript and PDF modules. Some Perl developers recognised the need to output in these formats, for compatibility with much professional documentation. So here too, you can take advantage of a lot of prior sweat.<br /><br />For completeness, the book also has a section on supported vector graphics and animation. Specifically how to use SVG and Flash in Perl. This is perhaps a more specialised need than the previous modules. But good to have here, for some of you.<br /><br />It should be noted that the book is not really about teaching graphics programming, per se. Wallace assumes you're already up on this. Rather, the book is about the modules and subroutines that give you the elementary graphics implementation vocabulary.	2005-03-12

The uses are manifold. If you are still new to ASP, the coding of the components gives many extended examples for you to learn from.<br /><br />More to the point, you might already be writing in ASP for your website. Thus you might want to see if any of these prebuilt components might save you some development time. The authors have tried to make components that will likely often be required in a website. Like a file uploader or RSS reader.<br /><br />The only component I wonder about is the Chart. It lets you add pie charts and histograms of data from a SQL Server onto a webpage. Well coded. But surely there is by now a proprietary or free package for ASP that does this charting and far more elaborate graphics. It seems such an obvious need and the .NET platform is important enough that some company would have built such a package. Then again, your graphics needs may be straightforward enough to use Chart, or a simple modification thereof.	2005-03-08

But Aaserud takes us on a more focused tour. He looks at Bohr's role as director of Copenhagen's Institute of Theoretical Physics, in the 1930s. The intent is to study Bohr's ability as a director, in keeping a nuclear physics research group funded, year after year.<br /><br />Before the Second World War, this was a far trickier proposition. Then, nuclear physics was seen as pure science; decoupled from the real world. (An attitude that would radically change after the war.) So we see Bohr in a different light. He had clear talents in being able to wheedle funds out of wealthy benefactors. Of course, having the prestige of a Nobel clearly helped!<br /><br />The book also has an extended discussion of the pre-war refugee problem. Mostly Jews who were denied positions in Nazi Germany, and who sought these at Bohr's institute. He made valiant and often successful attempts to get several of them jobs. But from the vantage point of today, with hindsight, one has to wonder if they should have looked further afield (like outside Europe).	2005-03-08

Assumptions that had to be made in the 1980s, due to computational restrictions, like a two dimensional simulation, instead of a three dimensional one, have been abandoned.<br /><br />The book gives you an idea of the state of modelling, as of 1999. Plus, as its necessary companion, climate observations. The book emphasises the correlation of these as necessary to improving the models. An expertise in the pure computational algorithms is not enough.<br /><br />Given the ongoing advances in computing hardware, some aspects of the book are undoubtedly already slightly behind the times. But most of the ideas are still current and useful.	2005-03-07

The uptake has continued unabated since Flickenger published this book almost two years ago.<br /><br />Readers would benefit from an upgrading of this book to a newer edition. For one thing, the latest hardware offerings from vendors could be discussed. But also the IEEE wireless standards have moved forward. While the book doesn't go into the details of these, a newer edition could explain what the implications of the changing standards are on you.<br /><br />For one thing, WiMax is starting to emerge as an alternative to WiFi. It may not be fully defined yet, but it's close enough that planning might start on using it. Its proposed maximum range far exceeds that of WiFi. Though there is the tradeoff of ultimately fewer users who can share this bandwidth over a given region.	2005-03-07

He relates Teller's life in the context of World War 2 and the Cold War. A rather bleak backdrop that reflects the sombre nature of the story.<br /><br />Given the background of the audience and the length of this slim book, there is little discussion of the complexities of Teller's long life and the controversial issues and passions he evoked in many.

Books	4	4	5	N	N	good arguments on both sides	Leventhal summarises a workshop in 2001 that argued whether nuclear proliferation and nuclear power were separable. The book has strong, articulate arguments for and against this claim. Whatever your current views on this issue, you might profitably gain by reading the book. It does not present straw dummies on one side.<br /><br />Overall, it seems from the book that there is at least a weak, causal connection between proliferation and power. Some countries can indeed use the public claim of installing nuclear power plants to aid in the clandestine assemblage of fissile material and weapons. Or, perhaps, without even going so far, to build out a physical and human infrastructure, to enable a later rapid breakout if the need is perceived to arise.	2005-03-07

Perhaps the best thing about the book is the exposure you get to ArcView, which is one of the major GIS products out there in the marketplace. The book assumes no prior exposure to GIS. But if you are majoring in any of the earth sciences (geography foremost amongst these), then using GIS has now become a de facto mandatory requirement of your discipline. The book takes much of the mystique and difficulty out of using GIS.<br /><br />The book's brevity means that it does not go into any topic in detail. Perhaps the authors are planning sequels along these lines?	2005-03-05

Its authors have a long involvement with the development and teaching of the language. The book presents itself as a definitive text on C++, much like Kernighan and Ritchie's C manual is for C. So it teaches exhaustively on the attributes of C++ and also on what you can do at the preprocessor and compiler level.<br /><br />The presentation style seems to echo K&R and is roughly at about the same level of difficulty, in terms of how concepts and syntax are explained. No flashy multihued graphics in the book. The authors have eschewed these in favour of a few schematics to illustrate key ideas like pointers, where you really do need some diagrams.<br /><br />As a very useful aid, they have included many exercises, sprinkled through each chapter. Some exercises are rather simple. Which is perhaps deliberate; to give you confidence in items you can easily tackle.<br /><br />Not having seen an earlier edition, I am unsure how substantive the differences between this text and its predecessors really is. C++ has been pretty stable for several years. Unlike still changing languages like Java and C#. So if you have an earlier edition of the book, you may not necessarily need to upgrade to this edition.	2005-03-05

Newcomen, Trevithick, Stevenson and Watt. Yet today, we measure power in Watts, not Trevithicks or anything else. Of the four, James Watt is the best remembered. How did this come about? Was he perhaps the greatest of them? Marsden takes us back two centuries to answer this.<br /><br />From Marsden's narrative, Newcomen seems the more perceptive inventor, compared to Watt. Yet we see how Watt had a driving passion for business that led to great success. Quite possibly, some of his methods may attract ire nowadays. But Henry Ford and other industrialists would no doubt have found much in Watt to be understandable and commendable.<br /><br />Marsden suggests that Watt's tenacious enforcing of his patents may have stifled development of improvements to the steam engine. Perhaps. But even so, consider this. Any such impediment would have the advantage to Britain in other fields of invention. For it would show that patents were highly enforceable. A strong patent environment may have contributed to Britain's industrial lead, that lasted a century. So even if Watt's methods led to a tactical slowdown, strategically it bolstered Britain. Keep in mind that prior to the Industrial Revolution, throughout most of previous history, there was no such thing as patent protection. So innovations were often kept secret, if this was practical. Keeping progress glacially slow.	2005-03-04

Where you face strong constraints in available memory, screen size and lack of a mouse. Plus network connectivity might be low bandwidth and intermittent.<br /><br />His analysis is mostly within the context of .NET Compact Framework. You can regard this as a slimmed down .NET/C#, analogous to the way that J2ME/MIDP is a reduced J2SE.<br /><br />Several chapters transcend the Compact Framework context and apply equally well to any development environment for mobile code. Like the chapter on using a state machine to model your application. Or the chapter on whether to use XML for data interchange. These chapters, like the rest of the book, have examples in C#. But the examples are short and clearly enough written to be understandable even if C# isn't your cup of tea. So you can use the examples as pseudocode, to port to other languages.<br /><br />Actually, a closer scrutiny of the book reveals that most of it is written in a logical and general enough manner to be handy for any mobile development. The guidelines in most chapters can be thusly used.	2005-03-04

But if you already have just a modicum of experience with XP, individual articles in the book should be easily understandable. Albeit rather terse, as befits a reference, and the traditional style of many O'Reilly books. But this brevity is a strength of the book, coupled with the extensive coverage of topics. Most articles can be read in a few minutes, and give you the gist of what can be done. Without you having to read multiple chapters in some other book.<br /><br />Though perhaps the section on the Internet Explorer could be expanded. Given its market presence, this may be a well thumbed section of the book for some readers, and more details here might be convenient.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest surprise of this book is Tim O'Reilly's name on the cover, as one of the authors. I remember him writing a lot of text for the X11 Windows texts in the 80s, when his publishing business was getting started. Nice to see him still actively writing technical material these days.	2005-03-04

Amazingly, as I write this in 2005, he is still alive, at the age of 99.<br /><br />The papers are really written for a physicist. All research level, and may not be that meaningful to others outside the field. Ah, but to a physicist, it is remarkable that you can read a paper on quantum mechanics, written in the 1930s, when the subject was so dazzlingly new, and know that the author is still around, and quite lucid. Many papers cite research by other great figures, now long gone. But they were all his contemporaries.<br /><br />Kudos to the publisher for collecting these papers into one book.	2005-03-01

As with other books in this series, little prior knowledge of this subject is assumed. Instead, he describes in plain terms what many common capabilities exist. Some of these may indeed be used with formidable complexity, like having a cell be an intricate function of many other cells. But by offering simple examples, you can see how to utilise these features.<br /><br />By the way, this example of a cell being a function of one or more other cells is of course the key idea of a spreadsheet. It dates back to when they only existed in hardcopy form. While Excel now offers a large portfolio of features, this is still the most important and fundamental one. If you study this book, ensure that you have this knowledge well understood.	2005-03-01

The book is not really about inventing, per se. Despite what the title says. A careful read of the contents reveals relatively little discussion about the raw inventing process. That is, how does one come up with an original idea that can be patentable? It may well be that such a question has no answer.     Rather, the book's contribution is to show the reader that, if you make something that you think is worth patenting, what are the necessary  steps to do so. It explains how you can protect your invention from others. It focuses on steps that can be specifically described to you, and then performed by you. Like how to file a Provisional Patent Application. And how you can now do this electronically. (Which wasn't always the case.) While some of these steps are unique to the United States, in general they apply in most countries.    There is also a brief discussion about copyright issues in the book. But it is tangential to the main topic.	2005-03-01

After all, it was only within the last hundred years or so that astronomers had the ability to seriously look and understand further distances.<br /><br />The historical unfolding given here since Babylonian times encompasses a gradual increase in understanding of our solar system. The gain in knowledge is glacial. Measured in centuries and  millennia. But with the rise of the European astronomers, and thence of Newton's equations of motion, it was possible to systematically understand planetary orbits. And to deductively look for unknown planets. A successful search that culminated in the discovery of Pluto, and was probably a high water mark of Newtonian mechanics.<br /><br />The book ends with NASA's outstanding Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecrafts, that performed a grand tour of the outer solar system in the 70s and 80s. Perhaps, when you consider that this book was written in 2003, the author might have devoted more space to the subsequent missions. Still, he furnishes a good synopsis.	2005-03-01

But basically any book on teaching the general properties of Java tends to cover this to some fashion, since Java is fully object oriented.

This book puts forward one of them. Namely that technological progress can be understood in part by analogy to biological evolution, as a series of continuous and incremental innovations, that arise out of the gestalt of the inventor's environment. The authors argue eloquently, with much cited research to buttress their arguments.<br /><br />Certainly, most inventions are indeed incremental gains in understanding. But one might say that if you take the evolution analogy, there is also a corresponding hypothesis akin to punctuated equilibrium. Namely that sometimes, an inventor or scientist really does make a fundamental discontinuity in understanding. In a way that a continuously innovative procedure would have been extremely unlikely to garner. In science at least, the best examples may be Einstein's General Relativity, and Claude Shannon's Information Theory. Nothing like either was even remotely contemplated by their contemporaries. Ok, granted, the book talks about technology, not science. But at some fundamental level, the discussion of progress encompasses both.	2005-03-01

The first discordant note to this comfortable assessment occurs if you scan the image more closely. She is holding what sure looks like a modern pistol.<br /><br />So it's more complicated. Well, the text turns out to indeed be a traditional hard science fiction tale. There is a parallel universe, with a different, backward Earth. The hero, Miriam, gets to traverse between these worlds. Specifically between the two North Americas. Where the other one is some squalid medieval morass, where the peasants are held down by a feuding aristocracy.<br /><br />If you do like parallel universe stories, and especially those set in the United States, then this book may be compared to the classic Lord Kalvan series by H Beam Piper. Or, indeed, Steve Stirling's Nantucket or Conquistador books.<br /><br />Perhaps the only discordant note I found with the book was the implausibility of how the other side makes its living, by arbitraging what it could provide on its side, that others in our America could not easily otherwise perform. In Stirling's Conquistador, he provides a logical economic scenario that is lacking here.	2005-03-01

Hitherto, the latter has been the choice of many robotics designs.<br /><br />He puts a lot of detail into the text, of how to use linux as the embedded operating system in the robot. To address the issue of whether linux is up to the demands of real time running. The ideal reader should be proficient both in linux device drivers and in constructing robots. The text is probably not ideal for someone new to either field.<br /><br />To motivate the reader, Edwards provides several examples of functionalities to be built into the robots.

Just enough is covered to enable the description of basic circuit elements - resistor, capacitor and inductor. And to describe the AC impedance of a little circuit.

Hans Bethe won the Nobel Prize in physics for his work on stellar evolution. He is perhaps the most senior figure from the Manhattan Project still living.<br /><br />The essays are nontechnical, and mostly discuss the nuclear arms race. Many were cowritten with other prominent scientists, like Richard Garwin. These essays span the Cold War, and most have a common theme of how to avoid a nuclear war.<br /><br />The book concludes with essays by Bethe on other prominent physicists that he has known. Freeman Dyson. J Robert Oppenheimer. Richard Feynman [who got his PhD from Bethe]. The essay on Feynman echoes what Bethe said in a memorial lecture for Feynman, given at Los Alamos in 1988, shortly after Feynman's death.

The author takes physics equations, labouriously discovered over centuries, in terrestrial environments. He applies them logically to the vastly different circumstances of a star. Yet, step by step, he shows how we can arrive at an understanding of stellar processes that jibes with much that was observable in the 1930s. A tribute to the precision and insight of his thinking, as well as to the power of physics to model phenomena anywhere in the universe.<br /><br />Actually, in the subsequent decades, the equations derived in the book held up quite well as coherent explanations of stars. While the field has moved on, the explanatory pedagogy given in this book may still often be seen in recent astrophysics texts.<br /><br />Another reason I recollect this book is that in 1983 when I recently had arrived at Caltech for a PhD in physics, the physic Nobels for that year were Fowler (Caltech) and Chandrasekhar. For their seminal works on stellar evolution. Fowler recommended to some of us new grad students this book as still the best on the subject.	2005-03-01

It acts as a common framework for understanding quite different effects. To some extent, this framework contains, not unexpectedly, a standard treatment of solid state physics.<br /><br />But unlike a typical solid state text, Kao then goes on to discuss in detail subjects like electrets and pyroelectrics. While you can certainly find many research papers on these subjects, standard texts tend to avoid them, as being perhaps too specialised.<br /><br />Kao seems to have filled a useful gap in the literature. The level of discussion seems suited for a graduate level readership. (It's a trifle advanced for most undergrads.)	2005-03-01

The authors explore the theme of radical innovation. Of the creating of breakthrough inventions that can in turn create new markets and experiences. The book cites many examples. Perhaps most notably that of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). As is well known to many in technology, PARC developed the seminal concepts of a mouse, icons and window based user interface. Though sadly Xerox benefitted not a whit from this.<br /><br />A constant question in the book is how to discover those breakthroughs. Or, restated, how to devise an environment that can nuture such events and the people that bring them about. The authors assert that what they term \\"open innovation\\" can never lead to breakthroughs. However, truly original creativity is such a fragile and intangible thing that the book doesn't really offer a deterministic approach to finding and applying it. But perhaps no book can.	2005-03-01

He does not waste your time teaching this. Instead, he gives an advanced usage mode. Where perhaps you would like to make designs in a programmatic fashion.<br /><br />There are several ways this could have been done. But Autodesk decided to enable (in a manner of speaking) an \\"API\\" that is Visual Basic for Applications. To be sure, there are programmers versed in C++, Java, C# or other languages that may well look down on this choice. But VBA is a decent programming language. Being descended from Basic, it may not have some of the notational elegance of C++, say. Still, you can express a lot of computing logic in VBA.<br /><br />Most importantly, VBA enables object oriented coding. The book points out that you have two types of objects. Those you can define within VBA, as in any other OO language. Plus the very natural objects that arise in your AutoCAD design. If you study the book carefully, you can see how these two types can often be finessed seamlessly together.<br /><br />Suppose your background is engineering, and not computing. So that explains your AutoCAD experience. Perhaps you've never had OO programming before. The logical mapping described here is an excellent way to learn the more abstract OO concepts, for you can relate these directly to your expertise.	2005-03-01

It brings together several papers on fluid mechanics, where each paper is distinguished by one or more snapshots of fluid flow. Inspiring to the researcher, in much the same way as perhaps hardcopies of VLSI designs are to the chip designer.<br /><br />But the papers and diagrams here also serve a serious purpose. In fluid mechanics, a lot of qualitative understanding can arise from studying such diagrams. Not the least because sometimes modelling the equations leads to massive sets of numerical results, which might have to be understood visually. And in the book, the diagrams are of actual experimental results, not simulations, but the idea is the same. You often need some diagrams to understand the underlying phenomena.	2005-03-01

Realistically, many of us live by, if not through, our PCs. So you still need one.<br /><br />The authors cover hardware and software problems. Many. Like your disk getting flaky and crashing. Perhaps just a function of time.<br /><br />But in some ways, the software issues are the ones that have grown, as compared to a book of this ilk written ten years ago. Now, the authors devote a chapter each to the areas of Internet fraud, spam and junkware. A sad sign of our times. The discussion on Internet fraud talks briefly about phishing, amongst other topics.  While the advice on avoiding it is good, the chapter perhaps does not give enough space to this hugely growing blight. In the two years to the end of 2004, it rose some 7000%. It has emerged as a danger to many, especially those new to the Internet. Far more dangerous than being spammed by rebates, which is another topic in this chapter, to which a similar amount of space is allocated.<br /><br />There is also an amusing chapter on various other Internet hazards. In part, it declaims about the possible perils of meeting people online. You know, online dating and all that. And, like, gee, shall I meet him/her in person? In a dark alley, perhaps?

Chadwick is not widely remembered these days, which is why Brown's biography of him is a salutary reminder of his achievements.<br /><br />We see how Chadwick's life spanned the seminal developments of modern physics, to which he made his worthy contributions. The book is also a good exposure to the international academic environments before World War 2. Especially the traditional British ivory tower.<br /><br />It is the chapters on WW2 and later that we see Chadwick, and indeed physics generally, emerge and interact strongly with the real world. His efforts in directing the British contribution to the Manhattan Project may indeed be mostly overlooked today. But that may be primarily that the remembrance of the entire British effort was always overshadowed by the prodigious investment in manpower and resources that the Americans were able to bring to bear, in developing the atomic bomb.<br /><br />Chadwick's involvement in the Manhattan Project was certainly appropriate. The chain reaction involves a heavy nucleus capturing a slow neutron. Which triggers fission and the production of more neutrons and excess energy. As the discoverer of the neutron, and the premier authority on how to generate and manipulate these, he was one of the obvious, key members of the Project.	2005-03-01

A pack of startups has been established; each trying to dominate this field. And ATT and other large phone companies are also starting to jump in. With all this, the average VoIP user expects it to be virtually indistinguishable from an traditional phone experience.<br /><br />Well, that is where this book and you come into the scene. To make that simple user experience requires a huge amount of technical work. The book gives you a detailed appreciation of what that involves. This VOCAL is \\"only\\" one VoIP implementation. But it may be attractive, because it is open source. The book's authors were instrumental in designing VOCAL and offer the book as the definitive text on it. They give a lot of functionality, with the added promise that it is very scalable.<br /><br />I cannot discern from the book how VOCAL will fare against well funded proprietary VoIP solutions. But at least VOCAL seems to give them serious opposition, as a credible and free alternative.	2005-03-01

The book certainly has an impressive coverage. It talks about most types of digital modulation techniques, like Pulse Code Modulation. Plus, there is an explanation of random processes and simple probability. Necessary because of the inherent stochastic nature of much of communications. Which then leads directly into information theory, and the key Shannon concepts of how to find a quantitative measure of information in a channel with a given signal power and noise power.<br /><br />Understand, though, that the very breadth of the discussion means that Hsu often only has time for a brief venture into each topic. But, then again, the book's title does say \\"Outline\\". This is really a review book, rather than a text from which to learn material for the first time.	2005-03-01

But this book on robotics is a worthy rejoinder. It can be regarded as an advanced text in classical mechanics.<br /><br />It shows how mathematical treatments of rigid and non-rigid body rotations and displacements are necessary to correctly model robot manipulators. Plus how holonomic constraints can be used to determine system behaviour. Engineering students also get exposure to the use of Lagrange's equation in robotics. Typically nowadays, Lagrange's equation is taught in pure physics courses, with engineering undergrads having little need for it.<br /><br />One implication is that some students might need to upgrade their maths background before turning to this book. (Maybe you should have paid more attention in some classes!)	2005-03-01

Small wonder, then, that over the years, many probability distributions have emerged in the literature, where these involve underlying random variables with Gaussian distributions.<br /><br />One problem is that often these higher level distributions cannot be expressed analytically. Just like the problem with a basic Gaussian. So often, the distributions must be expressed in tabular form, as given by the book. In related wise, the book usefully furnishes graphs that let you understand distributions more readily.<br /><br />All this is good. But the numerical nature of much of the book would lend itself more conveniently to it being presented in a CD. These days, when a reader is confronted with a table of values in a book, is she expected to type these in by hand into her computer?	2005-03-01

Logically, the book starts with discussing hardware problems. Simply because if you can't overcome some of these, you won't have any software problems. Frankly, this hardware section is the most important part of the book. Grubby, but often occurring issues like how to run ethernet between rooms or floors in a building. It's things like this that make some people opt for wireless connections. Much cleaner and easier, right? Well, Ivens explains that you get other problems. Like a greater risk of evesdropping. Or your wireless transmissions might be blocked by metal objects in your environment.<br /><br />Don't take the \\"Home\\" in the book's title too literally. Much of the book can be germane to you having to set up a network in a workplace.<br /><br />A lot of the book's value is in how Ivens plainly and simply explains the problems and their fixes. In very nontechnical terms that make it clear what you can do to resolve the problems.	2005-02-27

Accordingly, IBM has built up a huge portfolio of functionality in WebSphere. And it has published a series of books explaining its usage. By definition, these books should be considered authoritative.<br /><br />So why should you even look at Neat's book? For one thing, he offers a different viewpoint on explaining what you can do with WebSphere. Remember that most users of WebSphere are companies that will have to invest considerable time and money in understanding and using it. Simply having a second written opinion on a particular aspect may help your understanding. And the cost of that (ie. the cost of this book) is trivial compared to the time it might save you. Let alone the cost of bringing in a consultant.<br /><br />Another reason for the book's utility is simply that Neat is independent of IBM. It gives him greater flexibility to make objective assessments; particularly if some of these are negative.<br /><br />One consequence of his independence is that the book devotes substantial space to issues involved in running WebSphere on Sun machines. Now IBM does offer WebSphere across a wide range of hardware. Naturally, including their own servers. To the best of my recollection, their WebSphere books simply do not give the extensive Sun coverage you will find here. Neat gives a realistic acknowledgement of the market presence of Sun for web applications.	2005-02-27

While it is being strongly challenged, especially in China, it should still be the first platform for cellphone developers to target. This book explains how within broad parameters, Nokia has opened out its models for developers. It has chosen to use a mobile version of Java. The book shows how to use this and MIDP to develop your application (which is probably a game).<br /><br />One of the authors, Yuan, wrote a book on J2ME recently, and you may perhaps consider this Nokia book as somewhat of a sequel.<br /><br />If you're already facile in regular Java, transitioning to this book should be easy. Perhaps the biggest change is the dumping of the Swing and AWT widgets. Simply too heavy for the resources of a small screen and limited power. Hence, graphics-wise, you may find coding rather constraining. But that's the reality of any cellphone.<br /><br />Another difference shown by the book is that there is now often an emphasis on audio and video capture and playing. At least, as compared to standard desktop applications.<br /><br />The authors and Nokia have produced a very cleanly laid out and logical presentation.	2005-02-27

The ideal audience for this book appears to be an IT manager or perhaps a programmer. The discussion is mostly at a level above actual programming. You don't need working knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, Java, web servers or other related topics.<br /><br />The book delves into key ideas of organising a web service, such as what is an n-tier application. Cryptography also gets good coverage. A qualitative explanation is given of the Public Key Infrastructure and Certificate Authorities, without descending into the maths of number theory.<br /><br />Malware is also covered. Though, given its increasing severity, perhaps a more extensive analysis may have been warranted.<br /><br />Overall, the book places all these topics in the context of building and running a large e-commerce service. If you do wish to go in this direction, the book is a good start. Though you will certainly need more specialised texts later.	2005-02-26

This book merely assumes that you have access to a browser on your computer. It doesn't even need Internet access, though that doesn't hurt. Davis shows how by editing simple text files, you can cobble together HTML pages and JavaScript code within those pages. You are taught JavaScript. It has many of the features of any langugage. Conditional expressions, loops, etc.<br /><br />He has produced a nice, minimalist approach. An experienced programmer might quibble about the limitations of JavaScript. But what the heck. If you are new at programming, you'll easily learn all the key ideas here. Plus, you'll pick up some useful knowledge of HTML along the way. Given the ubiquity of the Web, knowing both HTML and JavaScript can be quite useful, jobwise.<br /><br />Also, you can compare the differences in coding HTML and JavaScript. The former is declarative, the latter procedural. Davis doesn't seem to go into this, but his approach lets you learn both styles.	2005-02-26

Perhaps like those you see so often in magazines. Well, Photoshop has many ways for you to accomplish this, as demonstrated here. Other simpler books invariably show how you can include various image files into a Photoshop document and then do some elementary special effects. Trouble is, such efforts often yield crude results.<br /><br />By contrast, artists in this book explain far more graceful techniques. Such that, collectively, a final image may reasonably be regarded as artwork in its own right.<br /><br />The nine example chapters let you see different methods and together they demonstrate not a single correct way, but a spectrum of approaches. Which may encourage you to experiment. In this sense, the book is open ended, if you adopt this attitude.	2005-02-25

Where the server controls a subnet of computers that depend on it to connect them to the Internet, or for other resources. Bauer emphasises throughout how to secure the server. Starting with a top down risk analysis and a designing of a perimeter network; typically a DMZ. So he carefully suggests what belongs in the DMZ and what belongs behind it.<br /><br />He deprecates cleartext network communication, in favour of ssh and SSL for remote access. The book has concise explanations of various intrusion detection systems like Nesses and Vlad. Though perhaps if you do decide on using Nessus, you may also want to consult books devoted to it.<br /><br />Overall, the book is a sobering and cautionary tale of current computing. With the best practices recommended here, you can remain reasonably secure.	2005-02-25

This once science fictional dream has now become an everyday reality. Alas, as this book mentions, such a reality also includes many annoying problems.<br /><br />One way to read this book is to divide those annoyances into two groups. The first group is the little things, like tweaking the various Microsoft Office products. The second group of annoyances can be more troublesome. Like viruses/worms and spam. Malware.<br /><br />Consider spam. The universal scourge. The book has a good, quick discussion of the main antispam techniques, like Bayesians or hashing. Plus advice that is a little cynical, but realistic. Like how the Can Spam act has largely proved useless. Or how you should not use naughty words in your outgoing email, to minimise chances of it being tagged as spam by your recipient's email provider.<br /><br />Hotspots are also discussed heavily, due to their popularity and often insecure mode of operation. There is a great danger of someone running a packet sniffer. So your key communications should use https, if you are engaged in sensitive matters, like using your credit card.  But the book does not go into how a phisher could launch a deadlier man in the middle attack. Where she replaces the hot spot device with her own, or subverts the device's software. Then, she runs a pocket universe, where she might have copied the websites of various banks, and she directs http queries to those banks to her fake websites [pharms]. This method totally negates https. Granted, it is technically quite hard to do and so is still somewhat uncommon. But the book should warn of it, if you want to stay ahead of the curve.	2005-02-24

This book tries to assuage that interest, updated to 2004. It covers in detail many aspects of the company's tumultuous history.<br /><br />Some tidbits are mentioned that other books on Apple often omit. Like how along with Jobs and Wozniak, there was another co-founder, Wayne. But he sold his interest for around $2k, before Apple went public. Linzmayer estimates that had Wayne held his stock, it would have been worth $500 million in 2000. Ah, the what-ifs. He says that Wayne seemed genuinely unmiffed by this. But the reader must surely wonder otherwise. Like the story of the fifth Beatle. The divergent fates of Wayne, Jobs and Wozniak might be seen as a parable of Silicon Valley.<br /><br />The book describes events up to 2003-2004. Just in time to include a discussion of the smash hit that is the iPod, and of ancillary packages like iTunes. While perhaps these are too recent to be easily evaluated, Linzmayer doesn't shirk from offering a timely analysis.	2005-02-24

These include electron-hole recombination, where the free electrons and holes are inherently a stochastic process, based on underlying quantum mechanics.<br /><br />This idea is also investigated with related effects, like interband transitions. Most standard texts on semiconductors might treat these transitions at some aggregate level, to derive steady state current, for example. But it also means that the basic transitions can, in and of themselves, contribute to the noise fluctuations in that current.<br /><br />As circuits keep shrinking in size, and currents fall, such phenomena might become more important as limitations to device performance. It is well worth keeping in mind the mesoscopic effects analysed here.	2005-02-20

Part of it is just aptitude. You really do need a natural fluency with maths to go far into physics. But even so, there are basic physics ideas that can be usefully understood at a qualitative level, by those who will take no other courses in physics. It is perhaps for such students that Knight addresses his book.<br /><br />He tries to grab your interest. In part by describing ideas as eloquently as he can. But also by suggesting experiments that illustrate key ideas, and which are hands-on, without demanding abstruse maths sophistication on your part. And which do not need elaborate and expensive apparatus to set up. He has derived these in large part from his own, long experience in teaching physics. Hopefully, you might learn something from this text.	2005-02-19

In part because it is a developed country, with the resources to spare for a modest investment in various observatories scattered throughout Australia, as discussed by Haynes. But also because by default, about the third of the night sky cannot be seen by the northern hemisphere. So Australia's main rivals in this regard are only Chile and South Africa.<br /><br />The book does cover a history of astronomy in Australia. Starting with the efforts of Aboriginal astronomers. But perhaps to many readers, the most interesting sections are on the contemporary front. Here, Haynes explains the contributions in the many areas of the spectrum. Including the telescopes of Mt Stromlo and Siding Spring. Which were quite considerable monetary investments, by Australian standards.	2005-02-19

Surely an ambitious goal, and one that many might be reluctant to undertake. But the book strives to explain how a proper management level understanding of XML can enable these changes. It is not a book about the detailed syntax of XML and its associated standards. That is properly the remit of the programmers themselves, to understand and apply.<br /><br />Rather, the book aims at a higher level. Even if your current digital data takes on many disparate formats, you can use XML to implement a consistent metadata view. This is stored in XML and at the very least, lets you do rich searching through corporate data. Without necessarily changing any of the latter.<br /><br />The book discusses far more. But the above can be a conservative approach that lets you gather easy benefits from just a partial XML deployment. Just getting used to thinking about metadata can benefit you as a  manager, by exposing new ways of thinking about your company's assets.	2005-02-19

Of necessity, much detail has to be omitted. But the authors show skill in explaining the essence of the scientific method, and why some societies, like the Britain that started the Industrial Revolution, were able to apply it successfully.<br /><br />It is not a book about the intricate details of the sciences.

The authors have clearly spent much time traipsing through the vast areas of Western Australia. Arguably, they have seen more of it than many of its locals, who tend to be congegated in the Perth metropolitan area. Thus, somewhat ironically, a ready audience for this book might be people in Perth that wish to get out and see more of Australia's largest state.<br /><br />Overseas visitors should be cautioned about the book. Even though it does give the size of WA, the sheer immensity and dearth of people may still be surprising. Twice the size of Alaska, and with scarcely 2 million people. Well over half of which are in Perth. The book strives to convey the feeling of desolation once you leave Perth, and you should do well to keep that in mind.	2005-02-19

All the major players are there. Shockley, Bardeen, Brittain, Moore... Now storied names in the field. The basic key ideas are explained well enough for a nontechnical reader to grasp.<br /><br />The book also goes into describing technologies that are now obsolete, and certainly were in 1990. Like magnetic cores, or vacuum tubes. It explains the success of Moore's Law, though perhaps even the authors would be surprised by how now in 2005, it still is chugging along.<br /><br />The book deserves a new edition.

Typically, standard history books might only give cursory mention of these inventions. But here Fagan gives them their proper place.<br /><br />The limitation to a total of 70 is of course arbitrary. But probably as a practical necessity, he needed some means of constraining the size of his subject matter. In any event, it is hard to argue with his choice of inventions. All of these were pivotal to those who used them.<br /><br />The illustrations in the book are also a pleasure to view.

Even for a book on the history of science, it is awfully specialised.<br /><br />But if you are indeed a physicist, you may find the book interesting, with possible insights. The chapters are written by various prominent physicists. Most notably Brian Josephson, who won a Nobel for his eponymous junction.

In the midst of headlines about possible nuclear weapons being acquired by rogue states, this recent book is quite timely. It addresses what is a slightly puzzling issue. Why, 60 years after the use of nuclear weapons, are there still relatively few nations armed with these weapons? Some projections made in the 1960s postulated that by now, if we hadn't blown ourselves up, there would be scores of nuclear armed nations.<br /><br />Part of the book explains why this did not come to pass. But the more urgent analysis is devoted to suggesting how in fact it might still come to be. The politics of regional rivalries in east Asia, south Asia and the Middle East is studied. There are knock-on effects of one nation possessing such arms, triggering a  frantic effort by its neighbours to also do so.<br /><br />One thing to note is that the technical obstacles are less than ever before. While still exceedingly nontrivial, the case of Pakistan illustrates how a moderately sized developing country can develop such weapons, given sufficient will and resources.	2005-02-19

To a large extent, the book tries to speak about general principles of design. As opposed to tying the knowledge to a given fab process or a current linewidth.<br /><br />The emphasis is on CMOS design. Which is fair, since this is the most common digital technology in use. Though earlier pMOS and nMOS efforts also get a mention, along with BiCMOS, where the latter is perhaps most useful in high speed applications.<br /><br />At the systems level, you get a good discussion of such items as using a clock to synchronise actions across a chip. Alternate circuit ideas are also covered. Though space constraints mean that the book can't really go into these in the detail that they warrant.	2005-02-18

The writing quality is not bad, and he gives a good coverage of the most common methods used in the industry.<br /><br />Whether some of these prove practical in your situation is another matter, of course. If you have existing standard cells that you must use, or conform to, and a fab with specific design rules, then some BIST methods might be precluded.	2005-02-18

There's not much time wasted over explaining the basic HTML tags and how to put them together into a simple page. Instead, the book moves right along. Into more advanced issues like using base URLs to simplify your links by factoring out a common origin of data. Or how to format many pages by using CSS. Both internal and external.<br /><br />As a practical matter, your website might need to support itself with banner ads. So the book shows how frames can be used for this purpose. Then, if you want to spruce up the interactivity on the client side browser, for someone going to your website, there is a long discussion on using JavaScript. The level of programming here can get quite involved, depending on your needs.<br /><br />The book, like others in this series, is pretty focused. It's deliberately not as long as more comprehensive texts on this subject. But it aims at being more succinctly readable, for someone in a hurry.	2005-02-17

You need to realise this. The book only gives cursory mention of bidding on eBay. When you read elsewhere of people making a living on eBay, it is invariably through selling.<br /><br />Accordingly, the book is laid out in a very focused and visually easy to follow manner. The authors go over the main topics you need to master. Like monitoring an active auction of yours. Then after it (hopefully) successfully closes, how to follow up to ensure payment.  By now, the eBay website has scads of details in each area. Can be overwhelming to a new seller. So the authors try to make the information not turn into an overload.<br /><br />The eBay store is heavily discussed. Sellers of many items often gravitate to running these. Here, the book is a little out of date. It says the store has a monthly fee of $9.95. Well recently, eBay raised this 60%. Crickey! It triggered numerous protests by some of their best sellers. Claiming a de facto monopoly.  So the book is well written about HOW to sell on eBay. But keep a healthy cynicism if you read it. Because it does not really discuss WHY or IF you should.	2005-02-16

Hence all the to-do about Kazaa, Gnutella and BitTorrent. But along comes Stanhope with his explanation of what you can do with Groove, to put a different spin on matters.<br /><br />He shows how you can use Groove as a framework for ad hoc groupware, for a set of users scattered over the Internet. Prior to the Web, the concept of groupware certainly existed in the 1980s. Groove is a natural extension of those ideas. Plus others that have also proved fruitful. Like using XML to encode configuration settings. And Groove supports several programming languages, like C++, Visual Basic and C#. Alas, no Java at this point.<br /><br />The book can be intense. The author assumes you are already experienced in one of those languages. He dives in quickly into the gritty details of coding. Which is probably what you need.<br /><br />Stanhope deserves credit for helping show that p2p can be used for valid and serious purposes.	2005-02-16

Here, life sciences encompasses both the biological sciences and various social sciences like finance and economics.<br /><br />The authors customise the course via numerous examples and problems in each chapter. To be sure, in the text, outside the examples, it is a straightforward explanation of the important ideas in caculus, like finding derivates and solving differential equations. Which is as it should be. The maths is independent of the applications, after all. But much of the value of the book to you is in those examples and problems.<br /><br />There is a fascinating plethora of problems. I will only cite a few: Modelling a foot and mouth disease epidemic. Alcohol concentration in a person's blood as a function of time. Rate of pollution entering a lake. The Gini coefficient of income inequality in a country.<br /><br />The book shows that the uses of calculus in the life sciences are myriad and worthy of your understanding and appreciation.	2005-02-16

And in the last 10 years, there have been more products out on in the marketplace, that apply this idea.<br /><br />But if you want to delve deeper into the field, this book will give an appreciation of the complexity. Hansen takes you beyond a simple brochureware explanation. The subject combines electronics and mechanics, along with control systems. The discussion is sophisticated. Hopefully, the maths won't deter you. Though it can be formidable, even to someone with an undergraduate degree in engineering or the physical sciences.<br /><br />He also gives a good discussion of the various commercial usages.	2005-02-15

Often, so that you can use PLL, rather than designing them from scratch. So Brennan's book might prove useful in getting you up to speed on the key concepts. Like how to get a stable signal, and how to minimise noise.<br /><br />But he also puts in considerably more detail than that. Directed at the electrical engineer who will have to design a PLL from first principles. The maths and circuit theory here is a little more involved.	2005-02-15

A lightweight and potentially handy companion to a practising engineer or engineering student. The most common terms in materials science are covered here, in clear, technical descriptions.

Often described in formal maths language that can be offputting to a newcomer without that background. The merit of Riordan's book is to show that you can often understand and design such databases, without recourse to such formalisms, which greatly expands the potential audience for the book.<br /><br />There's scarcely an equation here. But you can understand the essence of different normal forms and what Boyce and Codd contributed to shoring up this field. Instead of equations, the author demonstrates what may be more intuitive to many of you - Modelling diagrams that show relationships in a visual form that is easy to grasp. You can see how a diagram can convey the essence of many relationships, and thus form the skeleton of a database. This visual understanding may be one of the most useful teaching results of the book.<br /><br />Riordan uses Microsoft packages to demonstrate how to make example databases. Commendably, she writes broadly enough that you should be able to recast these examples in another database if you wish.	2005-02-14

But I am uncertain how distinctive the text really is, in providing any unique and advantageous insight to a university undergraduate struggling with a physics course.<br /><br />Which is not to say that the material is wrong or poorly written. Clearly, the authors have distilled a lot of effort into composing the text, and assembling a diverse set of problems and examples. Where these are often chosen to pique the reader's interest, by invoking real life situations that might be germane to her.<br /><br />The biggest problem this book faces is that there are several other long standing physics texts, now deep into their n-th editions. Mindshare is a difficult thing to acquire under these circumstances.	2005-02-14

By a group of soldiers for a nation that barely knew or appreciated their devotion.<br /><br />Some other groups of Negro combatants in World War 2 have been fairly well known. Like the Tuskegee pilots. But few readers might have hitherto known of this accomplished tank battalion.<br /><br />Sasser writes of a thankfully different America. The casual and pervasive racism described in page after page is now mostly history. What some readers might find especially infuriating is some of the descriptions of the combat experiences in Europe. Where racist attitudes amongst white officers often caused the battalion to enter combat with less equipment or training than white units.<br /><br />The book is timely, and long overdue. Many of the soldiers who served in the battalion have died. The book gives them and the survivors some belated public recognition.	2005-02-11

Here is its latest sysadmin manual. The size of which is a good indicator of the capabilities built into it.<br /><br />Maybe the biggest change from earlier versions is how much of the code base for versions running under (linux, unix, MS Windows) has now been unified with that for z/OS. The immediate and ongoing beneficiary of this is IBM itself; greatly simplifying maintenance and extensions. Opaque to outsiders. But to a WebSphere sysadmin, you also benefit. Because basically most operations are true across these operating systems, it increases your marketability.<br /><br />The only minor omission I could find in the text is that the chapter on Web Services could need enhancement. Or, rather, that WebSphere itself have greater Web Services ability. The latter field is changing rapidly and perhaps WebSphere deliberately wants to stay a pace behind, in order to see what new features are actually useful, before implementing them. For example, Business Process Execution Language is rising, as a more expressive language than WSDL, to describe Web Services. If BPEL persists, perhaps the next version of WebSphere might support it?	2005-02-07

He gives a very readable description of how email grew since 1969. Alas, as he points out, those were innocent days, when social pressure amongst the few academic users sufficed to restrict anything like spam. And besides, the audience was too small for spam to be economic.<br /><br />But now with millions of users, spammers have great incentive to spam. The book takes you through nice descriptions of various spammer tricks.  Also discussed are the main antispam ideas, like Bayesians, challenge response and blacklists. The conclusion is sobering. Goodman is unaware of any solution to this open wound. The spammer maggots continue to gorge themselves on the Internet.	2005-02-07

Plus a fluency in Java, by the way. While I have the latter fluency, I'd only met AOP briefly in a few papers.<br /><br />Under the familiar O'Reilly cookbook format, the book has guidelines on various difficulties you might be having, when running AspectJ. It's a superset of Java. The new syntax is not so difficult to learn. True, it's more involved than writing a new class, that conforms to existing Java syntax. But a good Java programmer should quickly grasp how to implement crosscuts or advice.<br /><br />As to the broader issue of whether you should use AOP at all, the book is silent. It tells you well how to use AOP in the form of AspectJ. But you need to decide, based on externalities, whether to take it up at all.	2005-02-06

Schwartz is one of the best known proponents of Perl and he offers expert advice in this book. It is a collation of what he regards as his best essays. These appeared over the last 10 years in columns he wrote for Web Techniques, Linux Magazine, Unix Review and Perl Journal.<br /><br />For Perl programmers, it's useful to have these essays in easy reach, as opposed to thumbing through your back copies of those magazines.<br /><br />The essays are grouped into broad categories. For those involved in web applications, you might turn to the chapters on CGI and on HTML and XML. Though I do wonder a little about the former choice. Nowadays, CGI tends to be deprecated, in favour of JSP or ASP approaches. Mainly because CGI coding turned out to be so dreadfully awkward. Granted, Perl helped mitigate some of this, but even so, the demand for Perl CGI scripts might have fallen since the 90s.	2005-02-05

After all, taking a derivative or finding an integral is independent of what field that might have come from.  But here Hoffmann gives the context. Broadly, it is for the social sciences. The elementary material is the same everywhere.  What distinguishes the material here are the examples taken from those fields. Hopefully, it will help motivate you to understand the basic techniques.<br /><br />There is also a shift here from books of earlier decades. Then, there was often less emphasis on the level of calculus needed. In part because computational resources were far less, so things might have been treated more qualitatively. Plus, in finance and economics, modelling has become very important for quants. Hence, this text also importantly discusses numerical applications, using contemporary computers.	2005-02-04

Sendmail is probably the most common mail transfer agent on the Internet. The book describes how the latest sendmail supports a Milter interface. So that you, as a sysadmin or programmer, can write a program, usually in C, that implements a filter of your choice.<br /><br />There has been various documentation on how to do this. Often scattered throughout the Web, and at various levels of competence and detail. But finally here, we have an entire book devoted to comprehensively explaining Milter.<br /><br />It should be said that the authors deliberately don't go into details of what filters you might write. That is an open ended topic which is properly your remit, not theirs.<br /><br />But as a bonus, there is a superb chapter on spam. It concisely goes into explaining techniques spammers use to obfuscate their mail. You can find out why blocking spam on the basis of checking subjects is essentially useless, for example. The chapter describes methods that other books on spam rarely go into. Actually, even if you have no intention of using Milter, you may want to consider the book for this chapter alone.	2005-02-04

Chang covers the 3 major divisions of chemistry - organic, inorganic and physical. Which accounts for the weightiness of the book. Crammed with material that can keep a diligent student quite busy and, hopefully, appreciative.<br /><br />You are presented with a very refined text, in its 8th edition. Reassuring, because it has successfully come out in so many previous editions. Hence, you can read the text, confident in its proven usefulness to many earlier students.<br /><br />The online component, ChemSkill Builder, may also be useful to some of you; letting you gauge your understanding.	2005-02-03

Sherman shows how enthusiasts have coalesced into local groups, all over the globe, to dive into these outdoor activities, where each player carries her trusty GPS.<br /><br />Most of the contests take part in rural areas and offer a nifty excuse for exercising and socialising. Sherman gives tips on how to best equip yourself, aside of course from that GPS. These are mostly traditional common sense guidelines for anyone hiking.<br /><br />One thing you can get from the book is that aside from the geocaching, nowadays pure hiking has changed. Many hikers bring along GPS for safety and convenience. Some traditionalists look with askance on this, however.<br /><br />Readers might recall how GPS was originally developed by the US military, and when GPS devices were heavy and expensive. Here is yet another instance of a military spinoff that followed Moore's Law and added on popular civilian usages.	2005-01-31

Other books in this series have discussed the Macintosh and other Apple offerings, where indeed typically Apple provided only a paucity of information in its manuals. But for Excel, Microsoft does offer comprehensive hardcopy documentation. This book is really one of a numerous set of third party offerings that try to improve on Microsoft.<br /><br />The strongest argument for this book is that it appears to combine a comprehensive description of Excel with a conciseness of that explanation. In other words, it really doesn't belong in the Missing Manual series, but rather in O'Reilly's regular and long running series of texts, that share these properties. You know, the books with the purple covers.<br /><br />Granted, the book is bulky. But that reflects over a decade of Excel being continually refined and added to. The conciseness of the explanations means typically some prior exposure to spreadsheets in general, and Excel in particular, would greatly aid your understanding.	2005-01-31

Think instead of this book as describing New York's Time Square, pre-1980.<br /><br />The book's topics include death, god and scum. The latter having websites for the cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer, and the Columbine High School killers. You, too, can become one of their fans.<br /><br />Other more \\"friendly\\" topics are such gems as toilet humour and the Church of the SubGenius.

Especially those active from 1988 to the present; the period spanned by her musings. You might consider her output to be the written equivalent of Scott Adams' Dilbert.<br /><br />Her essays are sometimes quite insular. But arranged in chronological order, you can get a tracing of global trends in the programmer's experience. The first part of the book, up till 1994, is pre-GUI. When most programmers dealt with textual I/O. The second part delves into the glories and excesses of the browser and the dot com era. While the last part is the aftermath. All this is told from a British perspective, which may be the greatest appeal of this book to an American reader. Especially concerning the dot com. See how the British also fell under the same spell.<br /><br />Oh, when starting the book, try first reading the appendix. It has droll translations of British jargon used in the text.	2005-01-31

Anderson essentially provides 9 use cases of programming MS Office 2003; one per chapter and written in Visual Basic. These cases can be valuable to you on several levels.<br /><br />Firstly, if you are new to Visual Basic, then the book gives extended examples to improve your understanding.<br /><br />Secondly, and obviously, to see how you can program the various and myriad components of Office 2003, from the UI to accessing a database and using XML. Very nontrivial, as you might appreciate from the level of detail in the chapters.<br /><br />Thirdly, it is to find that one of the chapters actually fills a current need, and so you can just copy its code, perhaps with only some simple changes. While the book certainly suggests you can do this, it may actually be rare in practice.	2005-01-30

The book delves into the mixture of Spanish, Mexican and native American influences. Some writers hark back to a Spanish heritage, while others keen to a Mexican influence. The region covered encompasses both Mexico and the United States.<br /><br />It is clear, though, that the analysis would be best appreciated by those who know Spanish, and have already read most of the authors, in that language.

In part, this might be because you are aware that AI has been studied intensively in academia for decades. But you are interested in practical and successful deployments.<br /><br />In this sense, the book is quite optimistic. It explains the mainstays of AI. Along the way, we meet such things as the Turing Test to see if a machine can mimic a human. Also, we see MIT's Eliza. Famed since the 70s, despite its primitive text interface.<br /><br />For current applications, the authors give a good survey of the field. From manufacturing case studies to finance. Like discerning good credit risks. The book also discusses neural nets, which are sometimes seen as a different and competing approach to AI.	2005-01-29

This is similar to the pre-Web Usenet newsgroups. In both, it is easy to encounter poorly written or hastily composed screeds. A total waste of your time. But here Graham and Burton come to our rescue. They offer editorial choice. A nice filter. We see well chosen essays that are actually literate and interesting. (More so than my scribblings here.) The essays are fairly traditional in representation. None of the New Wave experimental fad of the late 60s. Possibly because once you've read hypertext in a browser, the traditional printed page can seem limited.<br /><br />Which is also ironic. That these essays are all out there on the Web, freely available for your perusal. Yet here they are in a book.<br /><br />Of the essays, those by the woman working in a porno store are the funniest. The graphic descriptions she provides of the clientele are memorable.	2005-01-29

Very much a hobbyist's flavour, with a hands on approach emphasised. Wise tries to take a lot of the mystique out of the subject. He downplays any complexity in the design.

The complexities of which help drive the need for a book like this. Holden doesn't just confine himself to explaining procedures on the eBay website. He goes into ancillary topics like what the selling of seasonal items might involve, or the finding of wholesalers of items that you might buy from, and then resell on eBay.<br /><br />While he discusses both buying and selling, you quickly find that the attention is focused on being a heavy seller. When you read elsewhere of people supporting themselves on eBay, it is by being  these sellers. So a lot of the utility of the book is in the advice around building up sales, where the mechanics of running auctions is really a lesser detail.<br /><br />His advice is generally good, with one important caveat. The book never really questions under what circumstances you might not want to sell on eBay. It does not discuss alternatives like Amazon, if you are selling non-collectible items like books, CDs, DVDs and software. eBay charges a listing fee, even if no bids are placed. And currently, some 53% of its auctions end with no bids. So the listing fees can significantly add to your cost, especially since an auction is just for 10 days at most. By contrast, Amazon levies no listing fees. Though if something sells on Amazon, its commission percentage is higher than eBay's. So there are tradeoffs. Plus, in recent years, eBay has repeatedly raised many of its fees.  Leading to deep dissatisfaction from many of its largest sellers, who feel that the company is ripping them off.<br /><br />The book would be of more use to a reader if it broached such topics.	2005-01-29

Easy but fascinating robots. Perdue offers you third party support, in the form of advice that is independent of the company. This book is an amalgam of neat assembly instructions and diagrams of robots to build, with accompanying source code to control them.<br /><br />The Lego library is easy enough to understand. You code in C, and link to that library. So the outlook is procedural, not object oriented. But for the code examples shown, and for any code that you are likely to write, their sizes are small enough that a procedural approach is perfectly adequate. And with less overhead than an object oriented outlook.<br /><br />A nice aspect is that you can tinker with both the hardware and software, in tight feedback design loops of changing something and testing it. In other projects, often it might be purely software. Which may not appeal to you, if you're the sort who is attracted to robotics.	2005-01-29

He compiled a mass of published research on AlGaAs in the literature, and presented it here in a very useful form for you. He explains why AlGaAs is so interesting in heterostructure design. Because, in part, it can be used with layers of GaAs, with minimal dislocations, and compatible coefficients of thermal expansion. Vital considerations for practical chip design.<br /><br />Maybe though, he should consider updating his book. There has been significant ongoing work on AlGaAs in the interim, and he might want to expand some sections.	2005-01-28

It shows how the physics at the submicron is driving advances in this field. But it also shows how various approximations made in the modelling, often for computational tradeoffs, might lead to uncertainty in the final results. Overall, though, the tone of the book is certainly positive. The putting of an entire computational system on a single chip is continuing to make strides. In no small part by the efforts of the authors who have contributed to this text.<br /><br />Some of the writing is a little rough. Probably due to slight misphrasings when being translated into English.	2005-01-28

Directed at a user already proficient with Photoshop basics. The emphasis is on serious artwork. In this sense, it differs from standard Photoshop texts which tend to describe Photoshop usage in very mechanistic terms. Quite understandable, as it's the obvious way to explain a computer program's use.<br /><br />But what this book aspires to is to suggest that you can rise above merely using Photoshop as a craftsman. Instead, it elevates Photostop to the tool of an artist. As an example, there is a chapter, Voyage to Porto. The author describes making traditional pencil sketches of Porto. Complemented by digital photos of the town. Then the bulk of the chapter goes into how these two media are integrated with Photoshop into something that is far more than just a digital photo. Something that expresses the artist's creativity.	2005-01-27

The authors describe SOA in conjunction with XML, Web Services and a whole slew of Web Services subsets, like WS-Transactions, WS-Trust, WSDL and WS-BPEL. At some point, this jargon acts as a conceptual barrier to newcomers. The book strives to overcome this, and does a creditable job. But it still can be confusing.<br /><br />Perhaps the key note is how the book's subject differs from other topics, like Web Services or BPM. Much detail is given about this. There is one simplifying point. Do you come from a Java or C# background? If so, then you are familiar with interfaces. And how if you are coding a large project, good practice is to have major classes implement interfaces. So that one class does not call another directly, but instead uses an instantiation of an interface. This leads to a more modular and robust design. By analogy, this carries over well into SOA, in the context of Web Services. Of course, you should be aware of the limitations of pushing the analogy too far. As the book shows, SOA is for distributed systems. Which is more complicated that running one Java program on one computer. Still, you can migrate a design attitude.<br /><br />But once you realise the analogy, a lot of the book's complexity can be pushed to a lower level of detail.	2005-01-25

The author is from a totally different generation from most of us. He started learning to use the computer at the age of 82! Whereas some of you might scarcely recall when a browser was a person and not a computer program.<br /><br />Other introductory texts, like the Dummies and Idiots series, are far more lavishly illustrated, with colour screen captures, for example. This book is certainly not comprehensive, regarding what might appear on your machine. But then again, it doesn't claim to be. Hart focuses on what he regards as the salient points of usage, and his choices are correct.<br /><br />Perhaps the book can be best read as an alternative take. From his age and experience, there are occasional comments in the text that show a different viewpoint.<br /><br />And the cartoons are amusing.	2005-01-24

The author gives a guide to the huge overlayer of extensions and standards that have accrued atop XML, like barnacles on a ship. Unfortunately, threading this maze to understand what you might really need is not easy for many. So his viewpoint might help you.<br /><br />Also, at the implementation level, he offers practical advice about such key usages as XML data. He gives advantages and disadvantages. The latter is the best part of the book. Because other books that might explain the topic to someone new to it often just talk about the syntax and the great things that you can accomplish. Rarely will such texts discuss any limitations that have been found through painful experience.<br /><br />It's not just for XML data that he does this. For documents, networking, searching, performance and legacy information, he analyses the disadvantages.	2005-01-24

The authors lucidly describe what a Denial of Service attack is. More to the point, the book then goes into an explanation of its more dangerous variant - the Distributed Denial of Service [DDoS] attack. The book is really about the latter; not the simple DoS. We see how DDoS evolved rapidly from 1999 to 2005, with the number of computers hijacked to become agents for an attack expanding from hundreds to over a hundred thousand. And how it no longer seems to be done by joyriding hackers just seeking a thrill. Now, it may actually be a business; a major branch of malware.<br /><br />You should have a reasonable background in understanding TCP/IP, to appreciate the book's technical discussions. For example, if you see mention of the TTL field in a header, you should already know what it means.<br /><br />The book explains several postulated countermeasures to DDoS. Nifty ideas like traceback and pushback. Or perhaps doing an entropy count of good and bad packets, to help distinguish between them. The problem is that none of these are truly effective. DDoS is an unsolved problem. So if you are a cracker, this is good news. Not so for sysadmins.<br /><br />But there is something else. Perhaps DDoS is fundamentally insolvable, under the current IPv4 and current router capabilities. But maybe this field is still young. What is a problem for many could be a chance for you, as a researcher or inventor.	2005-01-23

Plus, you can find out how to use various listings offered by third parties. Notably AOL, which offers a neat Remote Scheduling of its TV listings. Talk about convenient.<br /><br />For those of you with DVD players, and especially recorders, sections of the book describe how you can hook these up to the TiVo and get everything working with each other. And remembering that a TiVo is a special type of personal computer, you get instructions on how to upgrade its disk. Very good for the heavy user.	2005-01-22

Avowedly pedagogic in intent. Rogers writes a novel describing Muslim terrorists in the US, who communicate with each other via covert channels in the Internet. Specifically using steganography to concoct diabolical plots.<br /><br />The pretentiousness appears immediately in the Foreword, where it is claimed that with the 2004 \\"Madrid attacks, we saw how terrorist organisations can be self-organising based on principles that look a lot like the scientific theories of emergence\\". Talk about over-reaching. Those terrorists appear to have used old fashioned cell techniques, which have been around for decades. No need to invoke any recent, trendy \\"emergence\\".<br /><br />Then the Prologue has a real howler. It sets the scene in Iraq of early 1991. Where a person goes to an Internet cafe?! Say what? Pull the other leg, mate. It's got bells. There is a small issue of causality here. The first browser to be publicly released was Mosaic, in 1992-3. The Web took off after this, with the general public in developed countries directly aware of and using the Internet for the first time. The first Internet cafe in the world was in London in 1994, after this mass audience emerged for the first time. And the first Iragi Internet cafe was in 2000, by the way. Granted, the book is fiction. But here it veers into fantasy.<br /><br />Going further into the plot is an unrewarding venture. Much of the narrative plods and plods over simple actions like this - \\"He pushed the found button... and moved the mouse on the mouse pad, waiting for the screen to show him the login prompt to the operating system\\". Leaden prose, lacking any spark of originality. On page after page. Why do we need to see this level of detail? Perhaps if you had never seen a computer before, it would be informative. But many of us now have enough passing acquaintance with computers to render that unnecessary. The author should have used more skill in deciding what level of detaiil to omit and what to focus on.<br /><br />The book reads like a computer manual pretending to be a novel.d what to focus on.<br /><br />The book reads like a computer manual pretending to be a novel.	2005-01-20

And Extreme Programming has garnered wide attention for several years, in writing C++ and Java code. So the book addresses a logical intersection of the two trends.<br /><br />Roodyn uses simple code examples to show how you might apply XP to C#/.NET development. The code is easy enough that his messages should be clear. He also talks about the general ideas of XP. Like a systematic use of unit testing for improved robustness. Of all the features of XP, this may be its strongest and least controversial point.<br /><br />You should be aware of widespread dissent in the programming community about XP. Many experienced programmers have deep reservations (to put it politely) about some features of XP and about how broadly XP can or should be applied. These qualms have nothing to do with .NET, per se. So if you are reading this book, it will certainly teach you XP. Just be wary of thinking that it is the best way to program.	2005-01-20

C++ can be regarded as an upgrade of C, in this respect. Or how Visual Basic now as VB.NET has quite impressive OO features. So Zandstra's book attests to this trend and to the popularity of PHP. It describes how the OO enhancements in PHP 4 were extended into version 5. You are shown how to use objects to the full extent allowed in PHP 5.<br /><br />The book is also aimed at a reader who might never have formally learnt to use objects or design patterns. In the last 15 years, these have been two very important ideas in programming, independent of the languages used. Which gives us another merit of the book. You are not just learning PHP 5, though that may be good in itself. By understanding and using the book's ideas, you should be able to apply these in other languages. A valuable increase of your skill set and hence marketability.<br /><br />You should also read carefully the section on bad practices. Sometimes, just being able to avoid these in your code may be enough to produce a successful program.	2005-01-20

In mostly non-technical language accessible to many readers, he tries to convey the tribulations these patients faced. Any why he empathised with them, as part of his practice. Instead of the latter being confined to a clinically detached diagnosis and treatment, as some of his peers might do.<br /><br />He urges that doctors spend more time \\"communicating\\" with patients. But in an era of managed care and the rise of HMOs, he recognises that this may be impractical for some doctors. Still, he believes the effort may ultimately lead to more patient satisfaction with doctors and even better patient recovery, under some circumstances.	2005-01-20

SQLPlus [I am not going to write that irritating asterix] is an acknowledgment of the reality that for many large computer programs and operating systems, a command line utility is vital. The book explains this for the specific instance of hooking to Oracle's database. It is meant as a definitive reference. Showing every command, often accompanied by example code.<br /><br />For an Oracle DBA, a good acquaintance with SQLPlus is probably mandatory. From the book, you can see how to quickly interrogate the database and get results in various useful paginated formats. Plus, and vitally, you can see how to build script files that can be run, where these files encode your experience in amassing customised sequences of commands specific to your needs. Exactly analogous to batch files in most operating systems, and just as useful.<br /><br />Along those lines, SQLPlus is conceptually not that hard. When using Oracle, it is often far more important, and harder, to design optimal tables for a given problem.	2005-01-18

The authors go through ways to do analysis on a computer, to see if it has been broken into. They focus on unix and linux machines, though most of their work also pertains to Microsoft computers.<br /><br />The discussion can also give you insight into how these operating systems run, and specifically how they handle file management. Because an understanding of the general picture is vital to seeing how an attack might be conducted.<br /><br />Naturally, a lot of space is devoted to studying what rootkits can do, and the traces they might leave. But the authors also take us down to the hardware. One very insightful chapter delves into how deleted files might persist on your computer, and for how long. We all know how Peter Norton in the 1980s was the first to introduce an undo for file deletion under MSDOS. But this book goes further. The authors studied several computers for how long a deleted file's contents might actually still exist on the disk, before being overwritten. While they only studied a few computers, they claim, probably reasonably, that these had typical usage. One was an ftp and web server, for example. They found half lives ranging from 12 days to 35 days. So be careful! If those files are your sensitive data, more stringent measures might be needed to fully erase them.	2005-01-17

That is one message from this book. It shows a French perspective on Photoshop usage. The books for which are dominated by American authors, whose examples are typically of photos of recent vintage. Taken from cameraphones, for example. Certainly nothing wrong with that.<br /><br />But in this book, many examples are of much older photos. So much older that they often cry out for retouching; maybe extensively. The authors guide you through painstakingly detailed methods of doing so. Some examples, however, are much newer. Like enhancing a commercial photo shot of perfume bottles. Students of product design should appreciate that chapter.<br /><br />All the chapters should be easily understandable if you are already facile in Photoshop. The book dives right into usage that assumes this experience.	2005-01-16

How to maintain a system of legacy code? Where often there has been no rigorous attempt to test it. Even in a manual fashion. He shows ways to build a test harness to automatically test the code. Even if this does not perform an exhaustive test, it may still be far in advance of what you already have (nothing?) to validate the code. He writes assuming that you might never have met a disciplined testing approach. So unit testing is carefully explained and he builds from there.<br /><br />Simple, useful patterns like Decorator are described. The book is not meant as a comprehensive exposition of patterns. But hopefully, you can see the general idea of patterns and its utility. Large portions of the book are essentially about refactoring legacy code into these patterns, if possible. And also about testing your changes in a systematic way. If you do the former, you should also do the latter.<br /><br />The examples are mostly in C++ and Java. But that's neither here nor there, if you program in other languages like C# or C. The ideas from the examples carry over well.	2005-01-16

Linux has been popular enough in recent years that the book would have been useful earlier. But given that it has just appeared, Schroder has a very up to date coverage of linux tips.<br /><br />Take for example the chapter on CD and DVD recording or copying. All sorts of guidance on using DVDs for data or audio. Linux has powerful but obscure commands for these tasks. But they are run at the command line. Often with many input arguments. Not the easiest of things for someone to remember. Linux lacks a nice UI to take some of this burden off you.<br /><br />Some of you should check out the chapter on Knoppix. There is an allure about making a bootable version of linux on a CD or DVD that you can then run on an arbitrary Intel or AMD machine.<br /><br />The chapter on managing spam has a very limited discussion on using a blacklist.

As such, it is a good summary of the state of the art at that time.<br /><br />However, the book does not help sysadmins by providing an understanding of the limitations of the methods mentioned. In this sense, the book is more of a simple description of how to use those methods, rather than an independent analysis of their efficacies.<br /><br />Consider the methods for finding and comparing checksums or hashes of messages. The basic idea is valid. But more detail about how the methods act against spammers who introduce random variations into their messages might have been useful. The book only says that such steps are taken in the methods. Examples please? Also, the book says that the methods generate one checksum or hash per message. Limited. Far better is to make several. And I'm not referring here to when a method might make two checksums per message, where each sum is taken over the entire message and the difference is that the methods to find each sum are different. Regardless of the specific checksum or hashing method, one should make several per message, for more robustness.<br /><br />Plus, the methods use what they call greylisting. Done at the system level. No suggestion that it might be better to also let each user make her own greylist.<br /><br />SpamAssassin gets the most coverage in the book. But not mentioned is that it can use a blacklist against domains in body links. A vital improvement against merely using it against the purported sender domain or against possibly fake relays in the header. Much time is spent in the book explaining Bayesians. But little about how they are very computationally intensive, compared to applying a blacklist against body links. And that Bayesians are inherently probabilistic. So one technique by spammers is simply to send more, so that enough of an absolute number of spam gets through a Bayesian. And, it is manually intensive on the part of a sysadmin and users to have to continually retrain a Bayesian, to ward off deliberate poisoning by spammers.<br /><br />This is compounded by the descriptions of how qmail and sendmail can use blacklists against where the message purportedly comes from. This is of limited use. For some reason, there is a persistent mindset, as evidenced by what you can read in the book, about this usage. Yes, it works, sometimes. But spammers often forge header information.<br /><br />In any event, the book's authors do not point out - why do you [the sysadmin] care where a spam comes from? Far better to ask is where it goes. That is, where its links go to. I have criticised other antispam books for not doing this. I was hoping when I read this book that it would be more perceptive.

A neat aspect of this book is how it starts with an extensive Review chapter. Going over concepts like elementary geometry and algebra. This addresses a problem faced by many textbook authors. The audience can have widely divergent backgrounds. So the Review aims to calibrate students to a known base.<br /><br />The regular chapters then each go into a profusion of examples. Often with colourfully drawn diagrams. It is granted that some students with intrinsic ability will only need a few such examples to grasp the ideas in them. But the authors clearly hope that by furnishing enough examples, most diligent readers will be able to latch onto and understand some.<br /><br />Perhaps the hardest sections may be on analytic trigonometry and its applications. The numerous questions on proving trig identities can be fun to some and opaque to others. I enjoyed this stuff in other, earlier texts. But some readers will need to spent a lot of time scrutinising these chapters.<br /><br />What is striking about the examples is that they use Imperial units, like feet and miles per hour, instead of metric units. By now, most science and engineering texts, even in the US, have gone over to mostly, if not entirely, metric. Seems discordant and slightly archaic to find a text that does not do so.	2005-01-12

Though the title says \\"College\\", all of this material is also eminently do-able at the high school level, for advanced students, aspiring to major in maths or science. While at the university level, it appears to be targeting those students not majoring in maths, physical science or engineering.<br /><br />Why? Because the dividing line is calculus. The book gives a good treatment of what you should know in maths, up to, but not including, calculus. It also has a chapter on probability. Which I don't think is usually considered part of algebra. But, pragmatically and correctly, Sullivan chose to include it.<br /><br />The text has numerous examples, with only a little emphasis on a strict derivation of theorems. Another indication that it does not target a maths major. Sullivan gives informal explanations that should suffice to satisfy most readers.<br /><br />Each chapter also has a prolific number of problems; around one hundred. Very suitable and convenient for a lecturer [you?] to assign as homework, since the book only supplies answers to half of these. Enough to keep your students happily [?] busy.	2005-01-08

Mostly directed at engineering students who have some computer programming background. Though extensive experience in this is not needed.<br /><br />Naturally, there is an emphasis on solving differential and integral equations. So old favourites like Runge-Kutta and trapezoidal means make their appearance for the latter, for example. There is also a more advanced treatment of how to tackle partial differential equations.<br /><br />The problem sets are a good feature of the book. Some may take considerable time to code and debug, but hopefully will help you gain insight into what the author is explaining.	2005-01-07

Covering single and multiple random variables. All the way up to describing the Central Limit Theorem and its uses, like Chi squared distributions. He builds on these to explain random time processes and ergodic distributions. Then in the frequency domain, we see spectral density functions and the concept of a stationary process.<br /><br />All this in the first half of the book is more general than just for analysing vibrations. It could easily apply to communications theory, for example.<br /><br />It is only in the second half that we get to studying random vibrations. In single and then multiple degree of freedom systems. Overall, you need a strong mathematical background before commencing this book, as well as several courses in mechanical engineering.	2005-01-07

That book concentrates on security issues, while Hassell talks more generally about the wide range of sysadmin tasks you can find yourself performing.<br /><br />In these days of Web dominance, one of the crucial tasks you have is to run a web server; Internet Information Services 6, in this case. Over the entire web, it ranks below Apache. But still central to your context, on your machine. Following the usual O'Reilly style, the IIS chapter is pretty succinct.<br /><br />One noteworthy item is that it has a section entitled \\"Managing Web Services\\". Hold your horses, mate. It may not do what you think it does. The section actually describes running several long standing web services [note the lower case]. These do not refer to Web Services [sic], which describe programs that use Web Services Description Language or the Business Process Execution Language to aggregate into new types of services. An unfortunate case of terminology overloading.<br /><br />Another item in the book may be attractive. Network Access Quarantine Control. Microsoft claims it is a much securer way for your mobile users to remotely connect to the machine. Currently, there is no version of it for non-Microsoft machines. Anyway, for some of you, it may be worth trying out.	2005-01-06

But Long points out that its sheer effectiveness has lead to an insidious activity. By crackers and phishers (\\"black hats\\"), who are trying to break into systems and get confidential data. Like being able to find a person's real name and US Tax Id or credit card numbers.<br /><br />Long shows how Google's many search options and comprehensive data can be used by a cracker. For example, searching for a text string written by a common web search, like Apache or IIS, that gives the server's name and version number. Typically, these are default strings that some sysadmins don't bother changing. So when the pages are made public, those strings appear, and Google lets the cracker find them. If she knows of a security bug in that server version, she can Google for who is running it and then drill down. Long goes into far more complicated attacks than that. But the example shows the gist of how Google can be (mis-)used.<br /><br />Long writes a disquieting text for sysadmins and Web administrators. In the rush by so many organisations to make information available, even if ostensibly only to your employees and customers, Google can expose you to vulnerability. A compelling read.	2005-01-06

Maybe so. But you had better have a solid background in classical analysis. On the level of Marsden's \\"Elementary Classical Analysis\\", for example.<br /><br />Neumaier describes the various numerical methods from a more rigorous standpoint than most other books on numerical analysis. So, for example, you should already be acquainted with such ideas as a closed convex hull or the infinity norm. It is not totally theoretical. He shows the use of Maple for generating results. Though perhaps examples in Mathematica would also be useful.<br /><br />The book is good for those of you who want a detailed treatment of the conceptual foundations of the field.	2005-01-03

He describes how the size of atoms, at 0.1 nanometers or so, sets a natural lower limit, and how the scale of nanometers lets us see and use quantum phenomena for designing new materials.<br /><br />A solid background in quantum mechanics would not be remiss, before trying this book. Wolf offers a bottoms-up approach to understanding the various branches of nanotech research, which is currently burgeoning.	2005-01-02

There are copious examples to help the reader's understanding, where these examples are drawn from everyday contexts.<br /><br />The teaching of an introductory algebra course can be tricky. It is a level of abstraction that goes beyond simple arithmetic. Some readers will of course quickly grasp the concepts. But Proga carefully steps through the concepts at a pace that should be understandable to most readers. To be effect, perhaps, that students with maths aptitude may be able to quickly skim over many portions of the text.	2005-01-02

This may appeal to some of you, who might have been put off by the level of mathematical background required by the other books. Or by the rate of exposition of ideas within those books.<br /><br />The presence of problems with each chapter helps your learning. And there certainly seems to be plenty of examples. To me, it seemed like they were belabouring the point, in places. But to you, it might feel like a comfortable dialog.<br /><br />The usage of Java pseudocode is neither here nor there. If you are sufficiently skilled in a programming language, and it need not be Java, then you should have no problem writing out actual code to test the algorithms. In other words, don't worry if you do not know Java. Just imagine it as generic pseudocode.	2005-01-02

Typically, for maths majors, a rigorous epsilon-delta approach has been favoured. So we get the classic texts by Spivak, Apostol and Marsden, for example. But a problem is that this approach often turns off many students who need a firm understanding of calculus and classical analysis. They may not be maths majors. Instead, they could be majoring in engineering or the physical sciences. So Bagby offers them a more informal approach.<br /><br />He does not deprecate rigour. But by presenting his narrative in a casual way, he gains the flexibility in recasting important concepts of proofs in a way understandable to more readers.<br /><br />Even maths majors may want to consider having his text, as a backup to their more formal books. Because sometimes the arguments given in the latter's proofs can be very difficult to understand and generalise.	2005-01-02

So I turned to this book with interest; wondering what has changed. Well, at the level of the book, most of the material has been known for decades. But one immediate difference is the profusion of diagrams and the increased use of colour. Due in part to improvements in printing technology. It means that current students also have more visual cues to learn from. When one is studying differential equations, this can be quite useful.<br /><br />Also, there is indeed new material here. Numerical methods are prominently discussed in many sections. Due to vastly more common availability of computers. So students are not restricted to handling only those problems that can be solved by hand, to give simple analytic results. The scope of learning has expanded. Now granted, most of the numerical methods in the book were already known in the 70s. But they were usually presented in texts devoted to numerical analysis, for people specialising in that field. Nowadays, it can be used in other branches of maths, like that covered by this book.<br /><br />Along these lines, the authors exhibit an ecumenical attitude towards what computer languages a reader might be familiar with. Example programs are given in Basic and for the TI-89. For symbolic algebra, code is furnished for Maple and Mathematica. They recognise that readers might have different preferences and they try to outreach to as many as practical.	2005-01-01

He has gone back to many of the original papers by Newton, Pascal and others, and gathered 125 of these into this book. You can search for insight into how those luminaries made their important discoveries. As an added utility, the papers have been translated into English.<br /><br />An amazing time saver. For he lets you access the papers without any intermediary. The alternative would be to spend months searching in some large research library. And also probably having to order copies made from other libraries. At non-trivial cost in time and money.	2005-01-01

In one book, they try to show you how to design and code a full e-commerce application. From laying out the user interface and connecting its interactions with a server running a relational database. For the latter, they spend some time with an extended example that involves constructing a set of interrelated tables, with primary and foreign keys.<br /><br />Those of you already familiar with RDB and the various normal forms will be very comfortable here. For the actual database, they illustrate with Microsoft SQL and the free MySQL. The code to connect is given in fair detail. Quite aside from anything else, the differences and similarities between these databases can be very useful. You can see the pros and cons of going with either. Heck, if you are searching for a book that compares these 2 common and important databases, this book is a good choice.<br /><br />The book is a little curious in one way. The authors are clearly skilled, but they don't seem to use the formal Model-View-Controller (MVC) approach. Though you might see that the various pieces and interconnections they give can amount to this. Nor do they explicitly use the idea of an n-tier architecture. Perhaps they chose to omit these ideas to simplify the narrative. Since if you successfully use their ideas to build your application, the MVC and n-tier ideas can then have far more substance to you, when you later encounter them.	2005-01-01

The first half of the book deals with set theory and then with Boolean algebra. The Boolean concepts should be easy to follow, and likewise with the problems presented to you here.<br /><br />What is more challenging is the second half, dealing with switching circuits. You can see techniques that map from a logic circuit to its Boolean representation. And then the vital idea of a Karnaugh map, in order to simplify that representation. Digital circuit designers live for this stuff! Many problems to chew on. See how well you really understand the material.<br /><br />You might look with askance on the publication date of 1970. 1970?! Moore had barely formulated his law a few years earlier. And Medium Scale Integration was the order of the day, perhaps, with the first microprocessor still under design. But the maths in this book still holds true now. In fact, it is even more relevant today. Because the circuits are orders of magnitude larger, so finding efficient means of circuit minimisation are more urgent. For that, you need a solid theoretical basis. And this book can test that understanding.	2004-12-31

Gilbert assumes a solid background in maths, especially linear algebra. He expounds on groups and rings.<br /><br />You can certainly treat this book as a pure maths text on algebra. But there is a twist to it, for some of you. He discusses applications in engineering. Notably Boolean algebra. Boolean logic forms the conceptual and practical basis of computer hardware and software. Gilbert shows how to represent a Boolean expression in a normal form and how to simplify it. Very practical and vital to circuit design.<br /><br />Later on in the book, he gives a good but all too brief discussion of finite state machines. These can be used in control systems and even in the construction of computer languages like Java. Where the Java bytecode can be validated precisely because Java is a finite state machine.<br /><br />Finally, error correcting codes take up an entire chapter. Important in communications theory, and even in such common items as storing information on computer media like DVDs.	2004-12-31

It can be considered a branch of applied physics. Highly mathematical, as can be seen in the problems given in this book by Hughes. He takes you through the field, giving the salient equations used to describe various fluid phenomena.<br /><br />Foremost amongst these is the Navier-Stokes equation. A nonlinear partial differential equation that describes the balancing or conservation of momentum and energy in a fluid. Most of fluid mechanics builds on Navier-Stokes. So you need to get your understanding of it down pat. The problems given for these should be tackled and hopefully solved by you, before going onto later sections in the book. You need a solid grasp of this. It can make  the rest much easier.<br /><br />Other chapters describe various important special cases. Like incompressible flow. Or one dimensional flow of a fluid that is compressible. Then expanding this discussion into 2 dimensions.<br /><br />Boundary layer problems are also heavily studied. Important in practice, because these relate to the designing of surfaces of planes or boats or missiles. Which leads naturally into problems of turbulence.<br /><br />Then what if the fluid is charged? Electromagnetic effects [currents] then come into consideration. So Hughes devotes a chapter to magnetohydrodynamics. Students of nuclear fusion or stellar evolution may find this chapter germane.<br /><br />Overall, Hughes gives a broad span of the field. Many problems to sharpen your understanding.	2004-12-31

The 846 problems can certainly keep you busy. Plus, the book is also useful as a concise summary of the most common and useful methods in the field. Students of maths, physical sciences and engineering should already be familiar with several of the methods. Like performing numerical integration or differentiation, because these mathematical steps are the fundamental calculus operations, and those fields all use these. So too is finding roots of equations, and for this, there is a chapter on Newton's method. Which tends to assume that you have an analytic form for the function and for its derivative, where you want the roots of the function.<br /><br />The book also supports statistics. Unsurprisingly, since statistics is inherently about numerical evaluations. So we have least squares methods of curve fitting, and Monte Carlo methods, where the latter can also be used for numerical integration.<br /><br />Ironically, while the Monte Carlo is described, the book is somewhat weak on methods for generating random numbers. And how to measure the \\"randomness\\" of such algorithms. For this, I suggest you turn to \\"The Art of Computer Programming\\" by Donald Knuth. He has an excellent length discussion on the subject.<br /><br />Curve fitting is also discussed in a chapter on splines. You may already be acquainted with these, in the context of graphics packages which can fit B splines to data points.	2004-12-31

Many people are already familiar with how lasers are used in eye surgery. But the book shows that for treating various skin ailments, lasers are also proving vital.<br /><br />The book is written for a medical professional. It covers the various types of lasers used in treatment, like dye lasers, or the continuous wave models.

Well, there are third party books devoted to each vendor's exam. You should probably get an appropriate one and study it carefully. But you can also improve your chances of passing any of those exams by tackling the problems in this book.<br /><br />Mata-Toledo offers some 400 problems. With the answers to half of these in the book. He tests virtually the entire syntax of SQL; an industry standard. Everything from arithmetic functions to group functions to making complex queries, and more. Of course, it will take you time to go through these problems.

The result of which has been termed density wave theory. It borrows some ideas from hydrodynamics, and pushes these to a cosmic scale.<br /><br />The theory is shown to describe fairly adequately how structure can arise out of billions of stars in a galaxy, spread over distances of a hundred thousand light years or more. Some readers will appreciate the elegance of the theory.	2004-12-31

I am unsure how much new this book really offers over Fortran texts of the last decade. It goes over the standard syntax in an adequate fashion. But no better or worse than most such other texts.<br /><br />The author has chosen to describe Fortran 77, which may be still the most widely used variant of Fortran. But perhaps more discussion about the newer versions that came out in the 1990s might make this book more relevant to some potential readers.<br /><br />The style of the examples is totally procedural, as befits that version of Fortran. To some extent, this may not matter, given the length of the examples. And it lets students concentrate on coding the numerical aspects of their solutions. But it can leave them unaware of the scaling difficulties when such programs grow. Which is an acknowledged problem with Fortran libraries, given the length of time [decades] that some of these libraries have been maintained and added to.	2004-12-30

It is the dominant client-side scripting language for browsers, VBScript and JScript competitors notwithstanding.<br /><br />The unix discussion could easily be modified to include linux.

It is not a general purpose language, like C or Java. Rather, it is tied directly to db2 and IBM's implementation of SQL. But within this context, the book explains the expressive power of PL. It shows at length how you can write stored procedures, triggers and functions in PL. The level of detail and the cited examples should reassure you of PL's capability.<br /><br />But why even write business logic code at the database layer? There have been other books on n-tier application design, which call for the locating of business logic in a middle tier and not at the database. The authors' rejoinder is that while that makes for an elegant design, practical experience shows that often, crucial logic needs to be at the database. This reduces networks traffic and can heavily improve perforance. Hence the need for PL, or something like it.<br /><br />Be wary of the book's claim that PL lets you write \\"portable application logic\\". It is portable only between instances of db2 running under linux, unix, Microsoft Windows or IBM's operating systems. When you write embedded logic in PL, you are also embedding yourself or your company into db2. Which may indeed be fine by you. But just so you know.	2004-12-26

Intensive numerical analysis. Which is why Matlab has been drafted by him to aid us. A nice aid to following the concepts and seeing examples that are non-trivial. The hardest sections of each chapter are on the reconstruction of the data. That is, in the finding of possible sources that gave rise to the observed signals.<br /><br />You would do well before reading this book to be fully conversant about [Fast] Fourier Transforms and scattering of radiation from objects. Put it this way, if Point Spread Function doesn't mean anything to you, then the book might be of limited use in your situation.<br /><br />He discusses important geometries, like stripmap and the circular SAR.

Systems of linear equations. Showing how these can arise in real world situations [science and engineering]. And how to solve them. Speaking of which, Blitzer devotes a lot of space to furnishing examples of varying levels of difficulty. Outreaching to as broad an audience as possible. He also provides extensive problem sets in each chapter. Because pragmatically, a portion of the value of a textbook is in saving the instructor from having to come up with such problems.<br /><br />For students majoring in maths or the physical sciences, this text may actually be unsuitable. If they already have a strong mathematical bent, and even if they do not already know the book's material, it may proceed at too leisurely a pace for them. Since Blitzer is aiming for a diverse crowd; typically not as inherently proficient in maths.	2004-12-24

An intriguing, unorthodox approach to teaching programming. Wright uses Maple, a well known symbolic math package that has been around for over 10 years. He takes a recent version and uses it in the book as a programming language in its own right. We see descriptions of all the standard commands in any such language - if-else, loops etc. Logically complete as a computational language.<br /><br />With the added bonus of teaching symbolic algebra.	2004-12-24

Barnett takes the student into a solid, first course on analytic geometry. We see the elementary concept of a Cartesian coordinate axes, to lay down the x and y coordinates of a plane. Then, there is a natural merging with trigonometric concepts.<br /><br />The reader can see the power of this synthesis. She learns how earlier geometric lessons take on far more expressive reach, once she can use a coordinate system, and the various trig functions.<br /><br />Barnett also furnishes many examples and problem sets to help her retain and assimilate the new knowledge.	2004-12-24

There are sections of the book about fairly simple UI controls and their usages. Like how to change fonts or colours. Mundane stuff.<br /><br />But the book goes much deeper. It shows how Access can teach you much about many relational database topics. Table relationships, referential integrity, multiple table queries, table joins and so on. En route, the author gently introduces examples of SQL queries. The full syntax of which is complex enough to deter many new users. But by seeing the queries used in many simple contexts should help your retention.<br /><br />So the book serves two purposes. The first is to learn Access. The second is to learn SQL and relational databases, using Access just as a means to an end.	2004-12-24

A deliberately compact handheld form factor that offers over 300 tips on usage.<br /><br />He's not a computer person, per se. But as an end user who happens to be an accountant. Very apropos, given that spreadsheets are that profession's stomping ground. In this regard, he is better qualified than some Microsoft developer, to offer you what might be practical and useful.<br /><br />Be deliberate design, he gives tips that can fit within one (small) page.

Like this book, for instance. It would also go well if you like green, for the pages are decorated in various shades of that colour.<br /><br />The lessons systematically walk you through the main aspects of making a presentation package. Perhaps more important is that the examples are good templates of effective layout. The bulk of the text is about how to use PowerPoint to get these results. Of course, you need this information. But you should also pay attention to the resultant images. These have a nice balance of text and images that might be worth emulating in your work.<br /><br />Plus, if you are at all inclined, the review questions and answers for each chapter are a good test of your understanding.	2004-12-23

It was crafted as a 3 level structure, as Hanson explains. The lowest being the instrumentation, populated with MBeans that map to resources of some kind, hardware or software. Above these is the agent level and then distributed services.<br /><br />The book goes into lots of detail about how to fill these levels. So that distributed systems might be made that control resources scattered across the Internet. All this has given rise to startups, often of a very specialised nature, like Intersperse, that make such applications.<br /><br />However, it's been over a year since this book came out. A countervailing trend seems to have emerged. As Web Services have been studied, the Web Services Description Language was made and its limitations discovered. So Business Process Execution Language has recently arisen to describe business logic, controlling loosely coupled distributed Web Services. So there is competition between JMX and BPEL/WSDL, with the latter nudging ahead. Yes, there are differences in scope. But they overlap enough in the crucial idea of distributed business logic.<br /><br />So consider whether you want to go ahead with this book or try BPEL/WSDL.	2004-12-23

For it pertains directly to my work environment of Java programming under linux. So I was curious to see what the authors have to say.<br /><br />The book explains simple linux level commands like grep, find, tar and zip. Because in practical terms, your Java project will have files scattered across various directories. Outside of your source files, you'll need these commands for maintenance. Also, vi is covered, including its improved variant vim. The latter is nice since it has colour coding of Java keywords. Makes editing much easier.<br /><br />Later on, the book covers the Sun and IBM SDKs. Free and easy to use. The data storage chapter is concise; perhaps too much so. For realistic applications using JDBC to hook to MySQL, Oracle or other databases, you may need more thorough coverage elsewhere. Likewise with the section on building a UI in Java. For completeness they have a brief discussion.<br /><br />The authors also strive to include discussion of higher layers built in Java. For enterprise level applications. So they go into JSP, servlets and EJBs. Enough detail is given to understand the gist, and to see how to fit these together.<br /><br />A commendable effort, given the vastness of current Java packages.	2004-12-22

Axelsson discusses iterative methods that he claims can converge rapidly. While this may not be generally true, the pragmatic researcher might keep Axelsson's ideas in mind, and consider applying them to her problems.<br /><br />The first section of the book is somewhat mundane. Totally standard descriptions that can be found in many texts on linear algebra. But the value of the book is in the second section. Where the author offers neat suggestions on how to pick the initial conditions for starting the iterations. As well as a type of steepest gradient descent to speed up the convergence.	2004-12-22

Most notably by O'Reilly. They have been well done. But usually crafted with an eye towards brevity. For a possibly impatient reader. But this book may be unsurpassed in its comprehensiveness. It shows that while the Mac has a lovely and very intuitive UI, there is a vast amount under the bonnet that you can also access<br /><br />Most readers may be attracted to Part 2 - Media Tools. They describe how to best use the Mac for audio and video, plus photography and image editing. Packages like iMovie, iPhoto, iDVD, iTunes and QuickTime. These form the basis for a digital lifestyle, that tracks the huge rise in digital cameras, camera phones, iPods and other consumer electronics. Apple has done an excellent job with these software packages and the book gives them full attention.<br /><br />Other parts of the book deal with important topics like the sysadmin details of what is a fully fledged unix box. (You knew that about the Mac, didn't you?) Yet these are specialised topics that only a few of you will really be concerned with.	2004-12-21

He writes chapters that are focused on key issues. The text is to the point. Concepts are clearly described. And where appropriate, the diagrams of screen captures show what you should be seeing, if you're attempting the tasks.<br /><br />But to many readers, the more valuable parts may be the exercises at the end of the chapters. Vital in helping you assimilate the chapters. If you concentrate on the exercises, the active steps you have to perform on the computer and the results you see on the screen help drive the understanding in a way that just reading is unlikely to do.<br /><br />This particular book covers a lot of ground. Backups, file compression, networking and more. The gamut of running an operating system. None of the topics seem to be covered deeply. Hopefully, this is an accurate reflection of the actual exams. It should also be added that there is another very helpful feature. A chapter might contain suggestions as to what the exam is likely to emphasize. No guarantees from the author. But it could still be useful in suggesting what you focus on.	2004-12-19

Fireworks is a nice graphics drawing package. This functionality lends itself easily to a QuickStart approach. The inherent visual nature of Fireworks means that every page can have graphics demonstrating some aspect. (Don't try this with an algorithms book.)<br /><br />The pages are also usually in a 2 column format, instead of the default single column for books. Presumably, it is meant to be easier to read. Shorter attention span needed and all that. The general tenor is of snappy task descriptions. Maybe for the harried reader who just wants an answer and not an essay on the theory of drawing.<br /><br />The book seems to be random access. Use the contents and index to find and apply a solution. The two together seem to trace out well the abilities of Fireworks.	2004-12-19

And you have to port your application to linux? There can be understandable trepidation about migration. Because the biggest issue may not be the free linux versus a proprietary operating system. For application development, the cost of an operating system isn't usually a big deal. More important are the compiler and types of native library support you get. Hence the authors fill in a lot of practical details about linux. The book's title doesn't say so, but the language covered is C. Not Java or C++. Though in fact much of the book's remarks will also apply to C++. And there is no fancy GUI. The book goes back to the basics of C development.<br /><br />Unix veterans will catch on quickly. The book's description of file handling, general I/O handling, sockets, directory operations and other issues is really no different than going to a given unix. Daresay that you'll be pleased to know that over 90% of your unix knowledge is eminently reusable. And the GNU C compiler used in the book should already be a close friend.<br /><br />Granted that if you're porting an application specific to a unix, there might be low level unpleasantries. But hopefully, good design and having this book will mitigate the migration.	2004-12-19

He explains how to do this in the context of writing Java and using J2EE. The bedrock of his exposition is unit testing. This being Java, he shows how JUnit can be used to configure and run such tests, in a highly automated fashion. Hopefully, you will agree with his contention that indeed integrating JUnit and unit testing into the overall fabric of your development process is easy.<br /><br />Building on this, he treats the important cases of testing a Java GUI and servlets and JSPs. The basic ideas are easy to grasp. There is a mass of example code that might obscure it, on first glance. But part of your skill set, which you need to develop, is that you should be able to hone down through the source code for the essential implementation of the ideas.<br /><br />A nice trait of the book is the problem sets. And the lengthy answers to them. Rather unusual in books of these type. Typically, there aren't even any problems furnished. Let alone answers. If you end up using this book, you should avail yourself of the problems, for better learning.	2004-12-18

It lacks a nice GUI, for it was written at a time when hardware considerations made that prohibitive.<br /><br />But for some 20 years, amongst many scientists and engineers, TeX was the gold standard.

He is aiding a brand new user. So the exposition is carefully done, with many screen captures of what you can change on the desktop. XP comes with all sorts of personalisation options of the desktop appearance. Since many people might set good store on being able to tweak this, a full third of the book is devoted to these issues. Personally, I think it is all somewhat cosmetic. But maybe it means more to you.<br /><br />The remainder of the book actually deals with more substantive issues. Here, you can learn to do real tasks. As in efficient browsing (using Internet Explorer). Or using email or Instant Messaging. These are probably the most popular communication modalities of the personal computer. So you should get facile in them.<br /><br />The book has no discussion about VOIP. The overall usage of which is increasingly strongly, but is still at a low base. In a few years time, the next version of this book might well include VOIP.	2004-12-18

Apparently, the book is devoted to the special needs of healthcare professionals who want to use Microsoft Office 2003. Fair enough. But when I look through the contents, there is very little that is inherent to healthcare. Typical is the chapter on PowerPoint usage. The healthcare component is soley in the screen captures of a PowerPoint document, with the string \\"Introduction to Medical Informatics\\". The other chapters are similar. The so-called healthcare customisation is very superficial. It could easily be swapped out and replaced with examples from engineering, say. And we would still have essentially the same book.<br /><br />Which does at least suggest that there really are no special needs for professionals in this field, if they want to use Office 2003, at the level of discussion given by the book. You should just get a general text on MS Office.	2004-12-18

The problems were from actual examinations given at Stanford in various computer science classes. About half the book is good descriptive text about the ideas that the problems probe. Certainly, well written, as befits Knuth's contribution.<br /><br />But I would suggest to you that the best use of the book is in tackling those problems. In the spirit of Knuth's classic Art of Computer Programming series, where he gives extensive questions and answers.<br /><br />I realise my suggestion may have appeal to only some of you.

And advice about common parts, like microphones. Ideally, there is enough advice in the book for you to construct an entire recording studio in your home. And to be able to record and make a CD of your local bands.<br /><br />The book concludes with a good summary of p2p issues in the music world. Something that you should be acutely aware of, if you intend to build not just a recording studio, but also to put out your own label.

Directed at not just the CEO of any company, as the cover might suggest. The audience of this book arguably includes not just executives involved in IT, but also the technical IT personnel themselves who may, or rather, will, confront such issues on a daily basis.<br /><br />Perhaps the most important section is Chapter 8, discussing future threats. It starts with an example of a phishing attack on a company. The chapter then goes onto describe possible trends in attacks over the next few years. Sadly, once past the phishing example, the chapter does not talk any more about phishing. Given the realities of book publishing, the chapter was probably written in the first half of 2004. Yet as 2004 draws to a close, it has seen a huge global rise in phishing. So the chapter is already somewhat dated, through no fault of the authors.<br /><br />Were the chapter to be rewritten now (December 2004), I imagine phishing would, or should, receive far more detailed scrutiny. While it might be objected that phishing is only one type of attack, its current direct monetary costs to banks and the month on month rise in the frequency of attacks make it a prime menace.	2004-12-17

There used to be lots of grungy details to deal with, and all the debugging would be done on a command line. No GUIs to guide you. But here the authors hope to improve matters.<br /><br />Naturally, the network described in most of the book is TCP/IP, better known as the Internet. There are also brief descriptions of ATM, Token Ring, FDDI, IPX and Net BIOS. It's probably fair to say that for most readers, you won't encounter these networks anytime soon. The Internet is where most of the network buildout is happening.<br /><br />For the Internet itself, they don't go down to the level of detail about the various fields in a packet header. Just to give you an idea of the degree of foreknowledge you need for this book.<br /><br />At the operating system level, they give a balanced coverage of unix/linux networking and its counterpart under Microsoft. For diagnosis and security, there is a general exposition of good practices. The authors refrain from delving into using tools like Snort or Ethereal as part of your Intrusion Detection Systems. In fact, they don't even use the latter term (or IDS). The book is worthy as a nice first book on networking. Gets you started.	2004-12-16

Plus the choice of topics is clearly contemporary. You are shown how to overclock, which helps gamers, amongst others. Or, you can see how to use your PC for digital photography or digital video. These are now burgeoning fields, as photography and film both make the transition to digital formats.

En route, he gives an informal synopsis and taxonomy of the games that have appeared since the 1970s. The seminal Space Invaders, Pac Man, Defender, Tempest and others from your mis-spend youth. (Well, mine anyway.)<br /><br />Ambitiously, he tries to put games into a broader context. Comparing them to other communications media, like music, books and movies. He craves intellectual respectability for games, on a par with those activities, for which academic analysis is now commonplace, Though it certainly was not so for movies, during their first decades. Koster suggests that with now over 20 years of gaming, it is likewise time for games to be regarded seriously.	2004-12-16

Commonly known as twitch or reflex games. The difficulty is in the loss of a performance edge, unless the bytecode has been transformed into native code.<br /><br />But Brackeen shows that writing java games also has its attractions. An elegant and easy to learn object oriented language. Arguably, more robust than C++. Java also has a relatively simply threading model. Threading is essential in most games, but can be very difficult to write robustly and to debug.<br /><br />He goes through the essentials of gaming, and shows what can be done with the standard java libraries, that come with the normal java distribution. Like a useful sound API that can play the common audio encoding formats of wav, au and aiff.<br /><br />For animation, well there is 2 dimensional material shown. For 3d, the issues are much harder. We see quick examples of coding 3d objects and putting a texture map on their surfaces and illuminating them with a light source.<br /><br />Overall, the author presents a solid introduction to his subject.

Sun, Oracle and other companies offer certification of skills in their products. Now, Zend Technologies seeks to do likewise with PHP programming. The twist being that here, they do not own PHP. But along with their exams, they offer this slim book.<br /><br />It expects you to already have been coding in PHP. If this applies to you, then you should find the book a breeze. Each chapter gives a synopsis of an aspect of PHP. Followed by 5 or 6 questions on it. The questions are of moderate difficulty. Mostly mutiple choice. Which probably reflects the format of most questions on the actual exams. There is an occasional question which might require you to design or write code.<br /><br />What I am unclear about is how well known Zend is. For Sun and Oracle, who certify in their proprietary products, there is a natural home base advantage to doing so, that many others can recognise. If you want to get some certification in PHP, you need to check around to see if you'd consider that Zend is sufficiently credible for you to invest in the exam [and this book].	2004-12-14

Most in a sombre, serious format. But we also has the vivid Personal Trainer series, which includes this book on XP. It's targeting a new user. New to both XP and computers in general.<br /><br />So there is a lot of attention paid to basic operations in any operating system with a GUI. Like opening, moving, resizing and closing a window. And how to graphically navigate through the filesystem, using the metaphor of folders.<br /><br />Experienced users will have internalised this a long time ago, as  automatic. But it's important to realise that it is not so obvious to new users. You have to start somewhere. The book is suitable as a guide to the XP newcomer. Oh, as for the cartoon aspect of the cover. It really isn't used inside to any great extent. (As contrasted to the Head First series.) In spite of the cover, the contents have a serious demeanour.	2004-12-12

Certainly grabs one's attention.<br /><br />Possibly the most complaints about Microsoft Windows XP come not from Mac or linux users, but from some long suffering Microsoft users themselves. Karp hopes to alleviate some of these complaints in this updated book.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest irony of the book is the space devoted to dealing with Service Pack 2 issues. Remember that SP2 is meant to fix many bugs. And indeed it does. But in the process, it changed various system settings so that, for example, some of your network applications might now seemingly break. Karp explains that it was because SP2 was doing its job and tightened up the Microsoft Windows Firewall. So he shows how to tweak the latter to re-enable your applications.<br /><br />Overall, the book is very detailed. But this can be a great help if you apply one of his fixes. Since the steps he gives are explicit enough to easily follow. Realistically, this second edition is unlikely to be the last. The next version of XP is bound to generate annoyances of its own.	2004-12-11

But what a niche. To some people, there is a compelling fascination with being able to carry around the essence of a computer in a CD. Much less riskier than losing or damaging an entire computer. Plus the fact that a Knoppix version is usually a sturdy, stable linux, can also be appealing.<br /><br />If this captures your interest, then many of the hacks will be germane. They show some of the possibilities in booting Knoppix up. Like having your Knoppix desktop environment always with you when you work on a computer.<br /><br />But the book also shows a second allure of Knoppix. Not to the wandering user, but to the sysadmin. Knoppix gives you a bootable linux that can be used to diagnose and [hopefully] repair linux partitions on a disk. These could be mission critical tasks, and it is really nice to be able to do the hacks in the Repair Linux chapter. Most notably recovering deleted files or retrieving files from damaged disks. There are companies that can do the latter. But usually at exorbitant rates. Knoppix is cheaper as a first pass on that problem.	2004-12-10

But it is only one of many auction sites. And then there are the b2b exchanges, usually confined to specific industries. Ramburg studies both types of entities, placing their legal frameworks in the context of existing traditional auctions and exchanges. The perspectives in the book are predominantly European, with an emphasis on Britain.<br /><br />She furnishes a useful taxonomy of auctions - English, Dutch, Japanese, sealed bid... You are undoubtedly familiar with the English type, but the others may be new to you.<br /><br />The book goes over the many details about what can go wrong online. Like different interpretations of sale conditions and membership terms. Or being able to cancel bids and what constitutes \\"unintentional\\" mistakes and how to undo these.<br /><br />If you are pondering operating a new online auction or exchange, you would do well to carefully look over the many details in this book. On a de facto basis, it can be a vital operator's manual.	2004-12-09

Darie and Bucica offer an explanation in the form of what is essentially a protracted and detailed build out of an e-commerce website. The ostensible reason is a shop selling T shirts. So we have a product catalog, which they subdivide into various departments, and in each of which, there is more detail.<br /><br />This drives the design of a database and the explanation of how to express this in MySQL. But all this in the back end. Users who visit the website could not care less about such details. Instead, they want to see pages of T shirts. So we learn how PHP can make dynamical pages, taking the data from the MySQL database. Finally, a shopping cart is implemented to let users buy items.<br /><br />The discussion is detailed enough to get functional code. And, of course, you can try your hand at modifying this for your needs. Not much theory in this book. Very hands on.	2004-12-09

Not the cartoon chick with big breasts. The book's printing date is 2005, so the 2003 in the title is deprecated, as being slightly awkward. Hence, let us not ask where is Excel 2005?<br /><br />Aside from this, the book gives a tightly focused test of your Excel knowledge. Each chapter is divided into lessons. Each lesson has a concise explanation of a topic. Then, the chapters end with quizzes and answers. Arguably, it is these quizzes that yield the key value of the book, as they let you actually test your grasp of the subjects. The questions seem to vary from easy to moderate in difficulty. Despite what the back cover says about the book being able to tone up skills of beginners and experienced users, if the latter includes you, then the book may simply be too easy.<br /><br />Instead, the book may be of the most benefit to new users, who want an objective metric of their knowledge.	2004-12-08

The authors have a rigorous methodology to estimate the many performance issues encountered when you try to build out an actual Web Service. They discuss important ideas like content delivery networks, which cache or mirror content at different physical locations, so that the response time to a user's query is minimised. And it also adds redundancy. Think Akamai, for instance.<br /><br />A crucial aspect they explain is how to develop a cost model for a data centre facing a certain expected rate of queries coming in from the net. Practical advice on what things to cost out and how to do so, as shown in various examples.<br /><br />Most books on Web Services published after this book often discuss the networking together of various services. Using WSDL or BPEL to describe these configurations. BPEL may not have even existed in 2001 when the book was published. But the book is certainly  not outdated. Nothing in it is tied to a specific version of a Web Services grammar. Those other books are more about explaining the syntax. Few delve into actual deployment scaling issues that cannot be avoided if you have to go live.	2004-12-07

But from the earliest versions, many optional classes were added to the core Java to form J2EE. Now this book gives you a lengthy description of the bulk of J2EE 1.4. You can see that J2EE revolves around the Web, not the Internet. For the latter, the low level network communications classes in the core Java suffice. But at the level of the Web, we have web servers, often making dynamic web pages using JSPs and Servlets. The importance of these is shown in how the authors devote 5 chapters to these two intertwined ideas. One cannot be adequately explained without describing the other.<br /><br />But the authors show that for practical, commercial websites, that is not enough. Often, the Web servers must hook up to a backend database, using EJBs - entity, session and message beans that act as an intermediate layer. Another 4 chapters here.<br /><br />And you get explanations of how to handle XML documents, which are now the standard for data interchange. Leading right into Web Services, which may be the Next Big Thing. Perhaps.<br /><br />Each of these topics is often discussed in more detail in other books specifically devoted to each. But under one cover, you can get a good understanding here.	2004-12-07

Ishaq seems to think so. He devotes his book to the Treo family of smart phones, which is now just over 2 years old. Impressive functionality, that greatly exceeds most cellphones. He points out that the very first Treo 270 in May 2002 was one of the first to be able to surf any site on the web, not just those with pages specialised for phones. All later versions were able to also do this, of course. Whereas the typical cellphone of later 2004, as I write this, still lacks the ability. And from what I can gather, external to the book, don't expect it anytime soon in such phones.<br /><br />The basic tenet of the book is that the Treo is a mobile computer, that can be wirelessly plugged into the phone net. Some users will revel in all the nifty little options. But if you're the sort who thinks a conventional cellphone is just fine, you may want to check out the different viewpoint espoused by the book.	2004-12-07

If these were school books, they probably gave no deeper explanation than to say that these were just tricks that the mind played on itself. Now, this book offers to take you into a deeper understanding of those and other related phenomena.<br /><br />The book is totally at variance with the other O'Reilly Hacks books. Those concern various hardware and software. Whereas Stafford and Webb discuss the wetware of your brain. Much of the text should be familiar to biology and psychology students. But not to programmers. The authors summarise what they consider salient concepts about the brain, in general language. Along with references to research papers in journals and websites. All this is shoehorned into the format of a Hacks book. Which is quite unlike a standard biology text layout. So the book is unconventional in several ways.<br /><br />One of the hacks is famous in maths. There are three doors. Behind one is a prize, while the other two have goats [i.e. no prize]. You pick a door. Then the umpire looks behind the other 2 doors and opens one that has a goat. So do you switch doors or not, in order to maximise your chances of getting the prize?<br /><br />You may well find the book unsatisfying. The authors make it plain that much remains unknown about the brain. A conceptual incompleteness that cannot be avoided in any text. Other Hacks books might have a solution to a hack that is code, say. Well, either it works or it does not. And if it works [the usual case], then that is that. Whereas in this book, an answer to a hack does give more information, but may often beg for deeper clarification that no one can furnish.	2004-12-07

But the size of a real life database and the complexity of a SQL query and of understanding the server's reply are daunting. Thus, Microsoft provides an easier Reporting Services layer, so that you do not need to have expert knowledge of SQL to make intelligent use of SQL Server.<br /><br />Hence, as an example, the text devotes considerable space to showing the usage of Report Designer Wizards. Quite pretty front end GUIs that hide a lot of complexity. Then there is the Report Manager, to help get summary output understandable to a nontechnical manager.<br /><br />But while the book shows how these software gadgets do indeed make usage easier, they do not make it easy. This is still a programming book. The heft of which bears testimony to the amount of effort you have to invest in mastering Reporting Services. The programming complexity here tends to be greater than in books on writing macros for Microsoft Word, to cite just one example. (Just in case you are familiar with the latter.)	2004-12-07

Some of you who remember that will have a frisson of retroness about this book.<br /><br />It concentrates on only 2 shells - bash and zsh, though it does mention briefly other shells, in passing. If you're new to all this, it's a good way to appreciate what you can do outside a GUI. The book's examples are short and simple. None are even remotely 100 lines in length. A quick style of programming that will appeal to some of you. Because you can pragmatically solve certain classes of problems with simple interactions with the operating system.<br /><br />The book also shows that scripting occupies a middle ground between what sysadmins and programmers do. In this way, you can use the book as an unorthodox career guide. If you are a sysadmin and you find writing scripts enjoyable, it could suggest you try programming in fully fledged languages like C. Conversely, if you are a programmer in one of the latter languages, but you find scripting more fun, perhaps you should be a sysadmin.	2004-12-04

McDonald is writing for a sysadmin who wants an effective method to halt spam. To be sure, he cautions that SA is not 100% effective. He gives concise explanations of how to install and run it.<br /><br />The most recent version surveyed here is 3.0. And there is one key innovation in it, and also in the earlier 2.63 version. Namely what it calls SURBL = Spam URI Real time Blacklist. A powerful idea. You block a message as spam, if its body has URIs in an SURBL. It should be said that it took the SA coders a long time to recognise and implement this idea.<br /><br />Another issue is how to generate an SURBL. Here, the author just says that you can get these from external sources, like Spamhaus, just like you would for an RBL. More discussion here might have been helpful.<br /><br />There is little recognition in the book that the SURBL method has significant advantages over a Bayesian, the latter of which gets extensive coverage. The SUBRL method is faster in extracting URIs from a message body and then comparing against the SURBL, than in comparing the message's words to the corpus of the Bayesian. All the more so if the latter word comparision is restricted to words that are not in HTML tags and are visible to the reader.<br /><br />Also, if the SUBRL has domains that are definitely considered to be spammer domains, then using it is deterministic. Unlike the stochastic general nature of SA's approach, which totes up a spam likelihood score. The deterministic aspect is far stronger.<br /><br />Plus, there is no need for regular manual training, as with the Bayesian - either at the user or sysadmin level. But a casual reader will miss all this. The SURBL is given minimal description.	2004-12-03

That is, why another language? Just a few years ago, XML reached a fairly stable state. Then WSDL came along, to describe Web Services. But it turned out that WSDL is really best suited for describing a single Web Service, or a simple interaction between 2 such services. As the authors relate, business logic is far more complex. Especially for the main envisioned scenario of interactions between services scattered across a panoply of companies.<br /><br />You might want an orchestration of services, built around a central co-ordinating service. Or in other cases, you might have  a flow of business messages, without a central service. This is termed choreography. These are 2 extremes. You might have some combination of the two. And more complex cases can be imagined.<br /><br />The book points out that WSDL basically ran out of steam. It lacks the expressive power to easily handle the above cases; if it can even do so. Hence, BPEL arose to describe such logic in a programmatic fashion. The authors then go on to flesh out BPEL as it currently exists. While some of the examples, written in XML, are fairly verbose, if you keep in mind the basic ideas, they should be understandable.<br /><br />You might also note that the book only touches on the possible complexity and nuances of business logic. It's fair to predict that in a few years, BPEL will be heavily expanded.	2004-12-03

An immense amount of code, all for free. Any experienced Java programmer knows this. But what if you could also get another set of free classes that extends the functionality even more? And has been well tested? O'Brien educates us about this - the Jakarta Commons. A nifty amount of heavy code. It can be highly worth your while to peruse this for useful classes.<br /><br />Here is a brief excerpt of what is offered. Consider the default maths classes that come with Java. Important. But still very primitive compared to the decades of effort put into various mathematical libraries in other languages like Fortran. Of course, many of those tend to be proprietary. Now, in Commons, we have Maths classes. These can solve a linear system of equations. In other words, matrix arithmetic is implemented. Opens up entire regions of electrical circuit modelling and control systems theory, for example.<br /><br />For statistics, simple regressions between two variables is now computed. And complex numbers can be explicitly handled with the ComplexMath class.<br /><br />It can be appreciated that the new Commons maths classes fill longstanding gaps in the default maths ability of Java,  which has been weak in numerical methods and high performance computing. It greatly strengthens the credibility of developing applications in those fields with Java.	2004-12-02

So much so that a comprehensive text on it can span a thousand pages. Which can be very forbidding to someone wanting to quickly learn enough to get started doing useful things. In response, Hoekman offers his book.<br /><br />The blurb claims that you can come up to speed with this book faster than with any other Flash tutorial book. Take that claim with a grain of salt. A bit of marketing hype. But it is not totally unreasonable. For one thing, he avoids explaining every feature of Flash. There is a lot you don't need to know as a beginner. He shows basic and common operations. Starting with drawing simple graphics. Then doing animations. And moving onto imbuing interactive behaviour and putting in sound and streaming video. There are other tasks he goes into. But this should convey the essence of what he teaches you.<br /><br />The book might be most useful as a companion to a Flash reference text.	2004-12-02

The emphasis here is on a clean, simple design. The book gives a top-down approach. It helps you with the design and deliberately eshews discussing the programming aspects of how to implement it. That is the remit of other books. Put it this way. There is only one explicit mention of HTML tags in the entire book. Leave most of that stuff to the programmers. Instead, Addison spends much attention on showing a good website focus that a reader will quickly understand.<br /><br />Also, that one instance of an HTML tag refers to the META tag. It does not affect the visible aspect of a page. But you need to craft this to help search engines classify your pages for maximum exposure to queries. Important for any website.<br /><br />So without knowing HTML, you can still get a practical understanding of what can be designed with it.

But recently, the open source movement has produced OpenCMS. However, though it is free, the complexity of usage can be high. And the documentation that comes with it is too daunting for many would-be users.<br /><br />Butcher offers you a more pleasant alternative with this book. He writes for a programmer familiar with XML and Java. Plus, you should also have some knowledge of JSP for making dynamic HTML pages for websites. While JSPs are powerful, they don't allow for multiple authors to edit and publish HTML pages, or for a versioning system to mediate access to these pages. This needs extra code interacting with the JSPs. In a nutshell, OpenCMS does this.<br /><br />The book walks through the usage. Many screen captures of the browser interface that is how the users access it. No fancy effects, like with Flash or Dreamweaver. But all the essentials are present and described by Butcher.<br /><br />He also discusses the back end database that the web server for OpenCMS uses. A fair amount of customising is possible here; with concomitant complexity. But if your website is not \\"too\\" large, you may be able to avoid dealing with many details of the database.

In his timely monograph, Boddy offers us a perceptive historical overview. He compares this time with several other periods, but most pertinently, to when radio and television were new. By citing the historial record, he shows that each instance of a new technology also caused existing business models and consumer habits to be plunged into controversy and change.<br /><br />Specifically, the changes in society in transitioning to wireless communication from 1900 to the 1920s were greater and more traumatic than those espoused due to today's digital media. Ironically, that early radio era gave rise to a gender perference for male hobbyists that echoes the current gender imbalance amongst early computer users. We also see concerns that radio fans might obsessively devote too much time to their hobby. Very might like today's video game users.<br /><br />There are contrasts. Radio was seen as offering a mass unifying effect on its audience, at a national level. As distinct to fears that digital media might lead to an increasing fragmentation of the contemporary public experience.<br /><br />Boddy also offers a perspective on Virtual Reality. He recaps the rise of this theme in the early 1990s, as personified by people like Jared Lanier. However, as I write this in 2004, VR is still over the horizon. Unaffordable as a mass consumer item. Over 10 years after VR burst on the mass consciousness. Several entire Moore cycles later. But if you look at his descriptions of how television struggled for some 20 years, before it became a success in the 1950s, you might appreciate where we stand with VR today.	2004-12-02

But sometimes you'll meet a book like this, which talks frankly about the many quirks and how to circumvent them. The subject is the Mac. Rizzo shows that even a keen Mac user can run into roadblocks.<br /><br />So he offers quick fixes to many problems. It should be said that the suggested fixes are all short. No doubt the problems were chosen with this in mind. Like when sending mail and you want to hide the recipients' addresses from each other. Then use BCC. This particular problem is true in any operating system, of course, and with any mailer.<br /><br />Actually, there are other problems like this in the book, that are not specific to the Mac. But presumably,  because they are so common, Rizzo included them. Slightly stretches the title description; just so you know. But most of the problems are indeed specific to the Mac. Like many concerning the use of Safari, the Mac browser. Given the importance of browsing to many of us, you should peruse this section carefully.	2004-12-02

This book is a sequel to \\"A Talent For War\\", which McDevitt wrote over 10 years ago. That book was a stirring elegy of a future star spanning mankind at war with an alien race. He imbued that book with a grand backdrop, and invoked timeless qualities of heroism and sacrifice. The book had a typical print run for a paperback and quickly sold out. Even in used bookstores, it was hard to find, and people hung onto their copies. It was reissued about a year ago.<br /><br />So when I saw this book, I read it eagerly. Hoping for a similarly engaging plot. As a twist, this book is told from the vantage point of the female character, Chase Kolpath, who is the secondary persona in the earlier novel. It expands on her personality, and gives another look at Alex Benedict, who was the main character in Talent.<br /><br />But, the plot is tepid. Sadly, nothing to match the grandeur of Talent. Also, the plot unfolding contains elements that have been seen in McDevitt's earlier works. Somewhat predictable.<br /><br />A portion of this book also deals with the topic of aging. His story is set millenia in the future. With faster than light travel and artificial intelligence software as a viable construct. Many futuristic details. But, the human lifespan is still only some 120 years. A marginal improvment over what we already have. This seems very implausible, given the other advances in the book over the postulated time period. It is as though our biology and medicine sputtered to a stop right about now.<br /><br />But there is one nice item in the book - the quote in my subject line.	2004-11-28

One of the seminal figures in the American physics community. So this book celebrates his 80th birthday with a compendium of research papers.<br /><br />Those of you interested in Teller's achievements may want to peruse these articles. While not written by Teller, they indicate how he provided inspiration to the many authors, and undoubtedly to others.<br /><br />Also, ironically, the occasion was almost at the end of the Cold War. In retrospect, very apropos for Teller. For his career spanned this War, and he was one of the keynote participants.	2004-11-27

Plus, in doing so, he invented many experimental techniques to investigate the nucleus. Most notably, perhaps, these often involved sending slow neutrons, that would be likely to be captured by a nucleus, which might thence possibly undergo fission, Or perhaps emit electrons, positrons or gamma rays.<br /><br />All this is covered in this historically important text. Written with the help of a co-author, Bohr explains his research in an elegant and understandable manner. Of course, the book also goes into the war years, when he was spirited away to the Manhattan Project, in which he made large contributions.<br /><br />Researchers and students of nuclear physics should enjoy reading of the early years in their field.	2004-11-27

But what you may not realise in the textbooks that describe these is that the examples given where an analytic answer is found are very rare.<br /><br />Which is the virtue of this book. In many situations, the maths of solving the path integral is difficult, when you have nontrivial problems. All the easy stuff has been done. So if you are tackling a problem, it behooves you to first consult this book. If indeed somone has already solved it, you need to know. So that you can use the answer given here.

He focuses on helping you use Elements 2 on digital images that you already have. Deliberately no discussion on what is involved in taking a photo, be it digital or analog. Instead, we get a grab bag of various techniques. Random access. Because you can read these in any order. They tend to address common problems.<br /><br />Though the complexity of what you or Elements have to do in a tip can vary. For example, there is a tip on straightening crooked photos. Where you can define a line in the photo that is meant to be level. Then Elements lets you read this angle from the horizontal, and rotate the image by that amount, in the opposite direction. Very easy to understand. This was in a chapter on cropping and resizing. Actually, you should find that all the tips in this chapter are similarly easy.<br /><br />But other chapters can get more involved. Like that on colour correction. You get into the depths of changing the HSL or tweaking a gradient map. The concepts here can be trickier. Luckily, the book shows how you can easily vary settings and see the effects of this on the image. Gives you a good intuitive feel of what the tips entail.	2004-11-26

That is, as rectangular grids of data. But in many ways, the common spreadsheet view is quite limited, though powerful within its context. Spreadsheet functions are often tied to specific cells as inputs. Then, interchanging two rows might cause the result to be different. A SQL view is more robust. Typically, you use data in a given column. The rows from which you take that data are selected based on criteria met by values in another column or columns. Hence, swapping 2 rows in a SQL table usually has no effect on an answer.<br /><br />In essence, this is what PivotTables offer. Cornell doesn't seem to describe it in such a fashion. He writes for a spreadsheet user who has no acquaintance with SQL. Certainly, this is a larger audience. But if you have a SQL background, then the idea behind PivotTables is easy to grasp.<br /><br />Most of the book deals with the mechanics of how to use PivotTables. Necessary, but secondary, once you realise what's going on.	2004-11-26

Her work offers insight into different world views. Different from most of ours today. But also, in Locke's time, there were two broadly divergent world views, amongst the European colonists in the Americas.<br /><br />One, shared by Locke and the English, was that in the 1600s, their rightful claim to the American land was valid not by force of arms, but by the subsequent peaceful farming of the land. Granted, this imputed few rights to nomads previously using that land. But the attitude was quite different from that of the Spaniards, which was based on the right of conquest.<br /><br />Thus, a value of the book is not just in an understanding of Locke, though it certainly gives such. It also provides a perspective on historical developments in the Americas, of which he was an active participant.	2004-11-26

He points out the basic ideas behind each. Along with the advantages and disadvantages.<br /><br />For example, in 2003, Challenge-Response garnered wide publicity, as a spam killer. Alas, this turned out not to be so. He reveals that the manual response needed turns off some people, who sent you the initiating messages. Or, some who do try to answer the puzzle might goof. This is bad if the senders are potential or actual customers of yours. Plus, the CR methods typically check the sender address against a whitelist that you might have. Well, spammers might forge this field to pretend to be from a common and important website, like eBay or Amazon.<br /><br />He gives the biggest praise for Bayesians, implemented at the user's machine. He quotes high success rates when he tried it. But, as he points out, he gets a lot of mail, which makes it easier to train the Bayesian. Plus, he has the technical ability and inclination to continually retrain the Bayesian. In part, as research for this book. But the average user lacks his technical background or the will to do the retraining. A huge practical draawback to Bayesians.	2004-11-26

No computers in sight. But Murray tells what massive cheap disks and RAM and scanners, and fast CPUs and high bandwidth have done to create a digital version of the hobby.<br /><br />You can regard the book as a long exposition of how to use Paint Shop Pro in a domestic context. The example images that she provides are often of family events. She writes in a reassuring, nontechnical manner for you. The key tips she supplies are not really about a sequence of steps in Paint Shop to achieve a desired effect. These are of secondary importance. Instead, she writes about what makes a great image. How you should capture what inspires you or your family. The advice is timeless and could have been given about a traditional scrapbook.<br /><br />The main qualitative difference now is in how you can publish your scrapbook on the Internet, so others can enjoy your work. One of the main drivers of the hobby's growth.	2004-11-24

It is complicated enough that the authors of this book present 200 tips, to perform common and useful tasks.<br /><br />The contents pages show a titular summary of the tips. Given that GoLive is from Adobe, it's no surprise to see an emphasis on the visual presentation of the pages. Typical is a tip about writing links in PDF documents, or another tip about converting an HTML file, and any associated referenced images, into a single PDF document. Of course, there are also several tips involving Adobe's flagship Photoshop.<br /><br />Overall, the tips seem straightforward to understand and do. This appears to have been a deliberate choice by the authors. The book is most useful if you already have the basics of GoLive. A good companion to a standard text on GoLive.	2004-11-24

If those computers are running Microsoft operating systems, then Exchange Server 2003 often handles the mail. Due to the crucial nature of email, the book shows how Microsoft has built up a lot of capabilities into it. The book assumes that you are the sysadmin delegated to setting up and running it.<br /><br />So there are lengthy but necessary explanations about the message formats. In the header and body. You can see the difference between bodies written in plain text, HTML or Rich Text Format. Though the latter is mostly supported only by Microsoft, and has gained relatively little traction elsewhere. Despite what the book says about RTF, you can often safely ignore it. Just concentrate on understanding the other two.<br /><br />You will probably have to maintain distribution lists of your local users. The book gives elaborate GUIs built to simplify this work. Much fancier than editing files like /etc/aliases under unix.<br /><br />The book also teaches a lot about how SMTP is handled by ES2003. Plus, it gives a good discussion about current antispam and antivirus filters. The level of detail about the antispam filters is concise and understandable, and is a fair summary of the main methods currently deployed.	2004-11-23

But the anonymous author gives a piercing inside look at many aspects of spamming. He explains how there is a specialisation of skills. Some have a product (like fake Viagra) to sell. Others clandestinely acquire lists of email addresses (of you and me). While some actually craft messages to evade the ever-smarter antispam filters used by ISPs and individuals. The author is in the latter group of spammers.<br /><br />He gives a fascinating technical description of his skills. While include finding open relays to inject spam into the Internet. We see how this is a dynamic process, as such relays are often then fingered as spam sources, necessitating their sysadmins to close the openness.<br /><br />There are unsettling insights as to the vulnerability of many web sites to being unwitting open relays. An excellent example is an HTML web page that lets the reader fill a form. If you press the submit button, your browser then sends the data you wrote to an address at that web site. So what? Well, sometimes that address is hardwired into the static web page, as [eg] report@website.com. This lets him write a simple script to mimic the page, but change the recipient to an arbitrary address!! In other words, he can shovel his spam to everyone on his mailing list, while hiding his trail. Complaints from recipients will go to that web site.<br /><br />His method is disquietingly easy to do, for someone of moderate skill. Worse, he shows how to search for such vulnerable pages by using Google to find pages that are likely to be forms. He then goes to the Google results, until he finds those he can use. He claims this often works. Probably so.<br /><br />If you are a sysadmin who is installing or maintaining antispam filters, you should probably get several recent books on those. And I have reviewed many of those. But also get this book. None of those explain the problem from his side of the fence, and explain it this well.em from his side of the fence, and explain it this well.	2004-11-23

How did the US obtain its enduring affection [some would say obsession] with citizens being able to possess firearms? Cress tackles this topical issue by looking back at the pre-Revolutionary colonies and the early US, up to the War of 1812.  He shows detailed arguments put forth at that time - essentially that a militia should always be available at short notice, to defend the public interest. A frontier mentality necessitated by sprawling territories, and a concomitent weak central British rule, before independence. When the settlers would have to face hostile natives and occasionally other European powers.<br /><br />After the Revolution, Cress explains the attitudes towards a permanent standing army. Specifically the fear that it might trample liberty. To counteract this, the army was kept small, and a citizens' militia was kept as a reserve.<br /><br />There is a little irony here. Part of the reason for the attitude was the behaviour of the British government before the Revolution, and the sometimes hamfisted way it used the British army to enforce its decrees. Actions which help trigger the Revolution. So this was seen as a possibility too, if the Americans kept a large army. It turns out that this attitude was also common amongst Britons. By continental European standards, the British army was usually kept quite small, for much the same reason.	2004-11-23

This is seen as a big improvement over the fragmentation of the unix market.<br /><br />Well, in linux, we are not quite at this wonderful destination. The intent of this book is to help move us along. It describes what constitutes the LSB. If you are a linux developer, you can see how to code to a layer that is portable. Plus, the LSB sets out certain good coding practices in C, C++ and Java. Undoubtedly, similar such will eventually be added for other languages. Also, you are shown how to standardise on using RPM to package your application.<br /><br />The LSB also offers a vital certification process that is vendor independent. With a series of test suites for more robust coding.<br /><br />A reassuring aspect of the book is that several authors hail from  3 companies - IBM, HP and Intel. The authors are striving to avoid a rerun of the unix balkanisation, and the book speaks well to that goal.	2004-11-23

An elementary case that you may have used is to sign up for a newsletter. But that is very primitive compared to what the book describes that SQL Server can do for you. That newsletter is basically a binary operation. Usually, you cannot specify more precisely what within that newsletter you're interested in.<br /><br />But Pather shows how you have far more expressive power in your NS subscription. and how NS takes in these requests, along with various data feeds, and applies the requests to that data, to craft responses.<br /><br />The book gives a heavy and natural use of XML for the user to encode her subscription preferences. It is for such things that XML is well suited. It also shows why Microsoft made a good decision to standardise on XML as its messaging language. On the server, we see considerable details about how to parse and apply the requests. The book is not a trivial read. Pather indicates that you may have serious coding on the server, using C# as the language of choice.	2004-11-22

This actually predates .NET. But with the rise of .NET and its main language, C#, MacDonald shows how ASP.NET 1.1 has gained in power and ease of use.<br /><br />He takes 1000 pages to show this. Because  Microsoft now offers a huge amount of functionality in ASP.NET and extensive integration into .NET. Like how Visual Studio can [should?] be used as your IDE to write C# code for your ASPs. By the way, despite what Microsoft has touted about how you have a choice of programming languages if you use .NET, it has become increasingly clear, via this book and others, that C# is the de facto choice.<br /><br />Chapters 7, 9, 10 and 11 are probably the key sections of the book. These actually focus on coding the ASP. And of these, chapter 10, on state management, may be the focal point, if you consider a set of ASPs as a finite state machine. So if you want to quickly learn ASPs, try concentrating on those chapters.<br /><br />And also follow the advice by a previous reviewer about the security flaws in the book, especially in SQL injection, using strings that have not been checked.	2004-11-21

A reaction to the rising tide of viruses and worms that target his company's desktop. He was primarily referring to what Microsoft itself sells as finished products, like the WinXP operating system. But if you are an independent programmer, developing on a .NET platform, you should heed his advice as also applying to your coding. Hence the importance of this book.<br /><br />It provides an easy to read technical description of various security issues. The book has 75 of what it calls items. Think of these as tips or hacks. Each addresses a security concept. The items are grouped into broad areas like Access Control Lists. What they are and how to maintain them.<br /><br />The discussions on Kerberos and other crypto related items are fluently explained, without recourse to maths. To actually implement, you may need texts that delve into more detail. But the overviews provided here are very understandable and hit the key concepts.	2004-11-21

You might well call him a futurist, along the lines of Alvin Toffler and Herman Kahn. Certainly, he writes gracefully, and does not drown you in technobabble.<br /><br />He describes the rise of a pervasive mobile networking environment around each of us. Encapsulated for the most part in the already ubiquitous cell phone. It is already been noticed by others that cell phone styling is of importance to some users. It bespeaks a fashion sense about themselves that they wish to proclaim to the world. Mitchell suggests that such attitudes will grow, as some manifestations of technology become ever smaller and more closely associated with their users.<br /><br />A humanising, and not a de-humanising trend.	2004-11-21

He points out that in all likelihood, you have hand crafted simple unit tests to validate your code. Even if you did not call them unit tests, you had the basic concept down. He takes this as a mutual starting point, to ease you into a more formal testing approach. Why you should do it and how. For the how, he instantiates with the popular open source JUnit. So at the very least, the book is a full-fledged user's manual for JUnit<br /><br />But he also covers other test frameworks, like CppUnit, XMLUnit, PyUnit and NUnit. For example, NUnit is used in the .NET environment, to test C# code. He gives several C# examples and how to combine these with NUnit. Likewise, PyUnit tests Python code and we see how from some examples. The book certainly lives up to its promise of being a language independent coverage of the concept of unit testing.	2004-11-20

And this book is a good reflection of the strategy. Bertucci directs it at IT managers, CTOs or CIOs  who are looking for a \\"high availability\\" solution. He defines this as an availability of 95-99.4%. Notice that the book shies away from \\"extreme availability\\", which is more than 99.4%. As he explains, there are nonlinearities in costs for the latter that make it prohibitive for most companies. Whereas high availability is affordable in far more circumstances.<br /><br />Implicitly, the book shows that Microsoft is staying away from the extreme case, for now. It cedes that ground to IBM and Oracle.<br /><br />Bertucci goes into a moderate level of technical detail about what SQL Server offers for high availability. Like hardware replication using RAID arrays and hot swappable components. Though he warns of the costs of the latter. There is considerable detail about data replication and clustering. These are separate issues that have been heavily built up here in functionality. Quite mature.<br /><br />As an aside, the capabilities described here also help preserve some operational distance between SQL Server and the low end open source rivals of MySQL and Postgres.	2004-11-20

While Cannon is from Microsoft, he writes for the general case. Nothing here is really specific to Microsoft's situation or products. Though it might be said that since Microsoft is the world's dominant software company, they might tend to be more sensitive to the issues raised in the text. Held to a higher standard and all that. So in this sense, having Cannon being a senior executive at Microsoft lends the book some gravitas. Even if you are a competitor of Microsoft, it might pay to study this book.<br /><br />One of the issues covered is spam. He gives a summary of the main antispam methods currently in vogue. The reader needs to be aware that the discussion is very limited. Extensions are ignored that improve the effectiveness of several methods. Consider for example the hashing method. He restricts this to making a single hash from a message. But making several hashes is far more robust to spammer countermeasures.<br /><br />Likewise, block lists are described. (More commonly known as black lists.) He says the drawback is that spammers usually use fake email addresses and domain names. Well, for one thing, not all spammers fake these. So the black list can still be applied against the purported sender, to detect the latter. But suppose that a spammer does forge her address in the header. The black list can also be applied against the message body. Typically with devastating effect.	2004-11-20

It describes in gory detail how to migrate your computer from a Microsoft operating system to linux. Thoughtfully, the authors also included a CD stuffed with sundry scripts to ease the pain of migration. The book presupposes that you are familiar with running a Microsoft box. But less so about linux. So to assuage your concerns, there is careful attention paid to describing what a Microsoft utility or task maps to, under linux.<br /><br />A strength of the book is its ticklists of what to do when migrating from a Microsoft utility to its linux analog. Like when moving from IIS to Apache server, one item in this list is to rename Default.htm to index.html. Each item is usually simple to do and the list focuses your attention on what is vital.<br /><br />The book also shows that in the linux world, you generally have a greater variety of open source Intrusion Detection Security tools. Some of these also exist for Microsoft platforms. But typically a more limited selection.	2004-11-20

Broadly, the book divides into two parts. One is the purview of earlier authoring packages, including previous versions of Dreamweaver. Namely, the building of HTML pages, of course. Plus the use of CSS to easily enforce a common style across a set of pages. The power of Dreamweaver can be seen in how it manages to hide almost all of the HTML tags from you. No grungy scrabbling around with these. Instead, it gives an extensive GUI that lets you easily construct complex pages.<br /><br />But the second part of the book is also interesting. It focuses on the setting up and running of a web server. And hooking it to various databases like MySQL. If you have a Microsoft machine, the book takes you on an extensive tour of combining ASPs and Dreamweaver to fashion dynamic pages. Including the enabling of simple e-commerce, using shopping carts. Plus there is even a section on using Web Services.<br /><br />You can see how Dreamweaver has moved into the space of competing with web containers like Tomcat, JBoss and WebSphere. Though it lacks the extensive abilities of those. Of course, by the same token, they don't have much (anything?) in the way of building visually appealing pages.	2004-11-18

But coincidential or not, the authors do provide many useful rules if you are a serious C++ programmer who is looking to make your code more robust and easier to debug.<br /><br />However, there is some padding done by the authors, to reach this fabled 101 total. They added some elementary rules that are often well-described in many C++ or C texts. Like rule 17 - \\"Avoid magic numbers\\". In other words, define constants to hold these values. Or rule 18, about declaring variables as locally as possible. You do know these already, I hope.<br /><br />Later in the book, they actually get to more worthwhile discussions. Like rule 52, about copying and destroying consistently. Or rule 72, about using exceptions instead of error codes to report errors.<br /><br />Overall, most of the book can be useful to you.

He gives an example where a task takes 10 minutes to compute 1Gb of data and then takes 1 second to transmit it. So that CPU only uses its network for 1 second out of 600 seconds. He sees this as undesirable.<br /><br />On the contrary. The example shows an excellent optimisation of computation versus bandwidth. You WANT this situation. Also, if you are coding that application, and you can change it so that out of every 10 minutes of computation, it takes only 0.5 seconds to transmit that data, then you should do so. That is an improvement.<br /><br />In the example cited, the network is only using 0.16% of its capacity. \\"Idleness of 99.84% is not effective resource utilisation\\". He is quite correct about that. But wrong to suggest that therefore there is something wrong with that application. Rather, this lets many other computers, running instances of this application or other applications, share the network. In fact, purely from the vantage point of this application, it is good, because it helps the application scale to many instances of it on the same network.<br /><br />Plus, there is also the issue of latency. Even if the application puts out data at 1Gb/s, that data takes time to reach its destination. Even at the speed of light, this gives rise to times that are often long compared to those times for onboard computation on modern CPUs. Notice also that in many realistic cases, the data has to pass through switches and routers. Adds to the latency. Furthermore, the application would typically expect a reply from where ever it is sending the data so. More delays.<br /><br />Watters gives his example in the context of quoting George Gilder's law about bandwidth tripling every year. Gilder is famous for saying this, and also saying that bandwidth is effectively free and infinite (or words to that effect). But this is often misunderstood by others, who ignore latency.<br /><br />All this goes to the core of the book. Web Services are fundamentally a distributed computation, often on machines at different companies, possibly separated by large distances. If you use this book to design a Web Service, it still behooves you to minimise the sizes of packets going on the net, between the different parties. And also to minimise the occasions (frequencies) on which these packets need to be sent. Both factors reduce the overall bandwidth usage and latency. Helps the scaling of your application.ten misunderstood by others, who ignore latency.<br /><br />All this goes to the core of the book.

But have you ever puzzled at the innards of it or any other network? The problem is that most explanatory texts are aimed at the computer professional. And indeed, often for someone planning to specialise in writing applications to run on that network.<br /><br />Derfler and Freed write for a different and far broader audience. They do not assume that you are a professional programmer, or plan to become one. So the jargon is not as impenetratable as in other texts. Plus, a distinguishing feature of this book is the skillful and generous use of diagrams, to illustrate ideas in the text. Takes a lot of the abstraction out of the problem of learning the material.<br /><br />Furthermore, this edition contains explanations of 2 very hot topics. Voice over IP, which gives the potential of cheap (free?) phone calls. And peer-to-peer networks. For the latter, two cases are covered - with a central server, and without. Refreshingly, the example usages are not of copying music or video. To show that, yes, there are good usages of p2p networks.	2004-11-16

Since then, his productivity on this idea has slowed. But he recently released this book.<br /><br />Sadly disappointing compared to his earlier work. Part of the reason may have been that his short stories intrinsically had to have tighter focus. Here, the plot meanders over a zany unearthly landscape. Perhaps Saberhagen was trying to show his ability in fashioning a truly bizarre arena. But it was hard to identify with any of the characters.<br /><br />Though the main character shows some potential. Akin to the Stainless Steel Rat, Slippy Jim diGriz, in Harry Harrison's novels.<br /><br />More to the point, people who read Berserker novels want to see descriptions of actions against the Berserkers. Not the tedious shilly shallying of this book.<br /><br />Saberhagen is capable of far better than this sloppy rendition.	2004-11-16

Historically, Oracle databases have tended to be installed on unix workstations (especially Solaris). And nowadays, on linux as well. But Williams points out that given the widespread presence of .NET, and that Oracle is the dominant database, then we should indeed have an important market intersection of the two.<br /><br />Other books have described using C#/.NET with Microsoft's SQL Server. Not surprising, because Microsoft supplies all these parts. But this book is perhaps overdue, in filling a gap in the documentation of .NET and Oracle.<br /><br />The exposition herre is logical, and not unlike some of those other books. (Cf. \\"SQL Server Query Performance Tuning Distilled\\" by Dam.) Except of course that you are shown how to optimise table design and complex queries for Oracle. Plus, Williams describes this for Oracle 10g Enterprise Edition - Oracle's latest flagship version.<br /><br />The book uses C# as the programming language, since it seems to be the best supported \\"native\\" language of .NET.<br /><br />In the development environment, he gives some simple GUIs to access the database. Done often in VB.NET or Microsoft Window Forms. Realistically, any GUIs for your work will be more intricate. But you get enough GUI framework code to get you started along these lines.	2004-11-16

Mitchell gives us a breezy, confident approach to making a website. He emphasises that, within reason, you can do it all by yourself. With the aid of this book, naturally.<br /><br />He walks us through the templates on the CD that comes with the book. The general thrust is to show how if you can read and write, well, then you can make a website. There is certainly more involved than in merely using a browser to peruse the web. But the book gives a total absence of HTML tags, until the last chapter. Instead, Mitchell lists 3 web authoring tools - Microsoft's FrontPage, Macromedia's Dreamweaver and Mozilla's Composer. These handle the grungy details.<br /><br />You can regard this book as an independent validation of the claims made for the above tools. Indeed, no programming appears to be necessary for a simple website.<br /><br />Along these lines, the chapter on making an online storefront is well done. The example storefront is actually quite limited. But even so, to have it running without programming is impressive.	2004-11-16

Roughly speaking, as explained in the book, they were found by many to be simply too cumbersome and overreaching. LDAP and its latest incarnation as OpenLDAP, has largely supplanted X.500 in terms of actual implementation. I recommend the book's Introduction as a succinct history of how LDAP arose in the 90s. It summarises the many RFCs that went out for it and X.500. Gradually, we see the convergence to today's state of affairs. Which the rest of the book explains in detail.<br /><br />Amusingly, we find that at one point, the X.500 proponents were expecting it to supplant TCP/IP!? Such amazing conceit. Well, LDAP blew it away.<br /><br />You get advice on installing OpenLDAP. Which is actually pretty straightforward. An experienced sysadmin will not have any problems here. Then there follow several chapters on running it and also writing code to program it. OpenLDAP comes with an API that does require some explanations. Luckily, the API can be accessed via calls in several languages like C and Java. Perl examples are also supplied. The author is commendably ecumenical about supplying example code in several languages. In keeping with the open source spirit of this project.	2004-11-16

Any of you who have taken digital photos soon realises that the camera is no panacea for cruddy photos. So what Miller does is give an extended excursion into the depths of Photoshop Elements 3. With the upsurge in digital cameras, now surpassing traditional film cameras, it has created a chance for Adobe to broaden the market for Photoshop. Just a few years ago, the typical Photoshop user was a professional running it in her workplace.<br /><br />Well, Miller disabuses you of that, at least as far as Elements 3 is concerned. The example photos are carefully chosen. Not just to show how to use Photoshop to clean them up. In addition, the subject matter is often what you might take photos of - family and friends, in casual surroundings. It underscores the narrative, which walks through the various Photoshop menus, showing how to do your fixes.<br /><br />Also, there is not much traditional photography jargon, about f-stops, apertures and the like. This also carries through into digital cameras, of course. But the book's purview is with what happens after those photos are taken.<br /><br />Needless to say, if you have traditional photos and want to clean them up, try scanning them into a computer. Then apply anything you can find germane in this book to them.	2004-11-16

He also wants you to inject some rigour into your efforts, by defining fundamental baseline metrics for your system usage. Then, when trying ideas described later in the book, you can get objective quantitative feedback on their efficacies.<br /><br />Of course, the bulk of the book is specific to SQL Server. But you should keep in mind that  Dam is not primarily offering a bunch of quick tips on performance improvement. To be sure, the chapters do indeed give specific suggestions that you can try. But a more sophisticated reader can get an understanding of the broad constraints of SQL Server and a rough but good idea of its internal workings. You don't need source code for this.<br /><br />It sbould also be said that you need a good knowledge of SQL and the theory of relational databases, before venturing into the book. Some chapters (like on blocking and deadlock analysis) will considerably test this background.<br /><br />But the last chapter may be welcomed by some of you. It summarises the book by offering a detailed list of best practices. If you want to quickly gauge what the book has to offer, read the last chapter first.	2004-11-16

The authors plow straight into giving good tips for better table design. For example, the first chapter covers MySQL basics. But it furnishes very understandable advice. Like never using spaces in identifier names. While MySQL permits this, it greatly increases chances of logic errors.<br /><br />Later in the book are far more complicated tips. Crucially, on how to optimise complex queries. While SQL notation is standard across vendors, each database has different ways to best phrase queries. So since you have committed to using MySQL, it helps to know what are best here.<br /><br />The authors also instruct in how to hook up to external languages like PHP, Perl and Python. (What is it about all these languages that start with P?) Each has its adherents and is quite popular. So they try to give coverage of the combinations with MySQL.	2004-11-14

Just before the Web burst on the scene. The books have C code that show how to perform network programming.<br /><br />Well, this .NET book reminds me very much of that series. To good approximation, the authors have covered the same functionality. But now using the .NET environment as a development platform. The language is fully object oriented, unlike C. Much of the book is taken up with showing how the default libraries/classes that deal with networking.<br /><br />If you have indeed used C and Comer and Stevens for networking, then you should appreciate what this book does. It gives a far richer vocabulary of prebuilt functionality, to handle those tedious and error prone low level manipulations. These libraries mimic what Java also offers for network programming. So if you are migrating from Java, there is much common ground here.<br /><br />The book takes you back to the basics of network understanding. No pretty but vapid GUI to obscure the concepts. The UI, so to speak, is stdout and stdin and the filesystem. Before the Web and the browser metaphor became prevalent, this is how most of us programmed.<br /><br />Another merit of the book is its coverage of IPv6. Still fairly new. But you can start familiarising yourself here. The authors also find space for brief explanations of cryptographic methods in .NET.	2004-11-14

And specifically on how to make a simple Web Service using the .NET platform. But the thrust of the book is in showing how to incorporate cryptographic methods into the WS communications. The authors claim that perhaps the most important reason that WS have not taken off is security. Without a secure authentication and authorisation of messages, companies are leery about exposing their data via WS.<br /><br />So the book devotes most of its space to the various cryptographic issues involved in .NET and WS. Some of this is not restricted to WS. For example, you may want to encrypt a channel, over which you will send sensitive data. That data might be a WS message, or something else. Hence, we get explanations of Active Directory, which handles a lot of these grubby details.<br /><br />Later, they discuss public key cryptography. Which they term asynchronous encryption; not a widely used term. They contrast this to synchronous encryption, which most others call symmetric encryption.<br /><br />But having said this, the book does offer a reasonable guide to using C# and .NET for WS. What is left for the reader is the much harder problem. That of designing a useful.	2004-11-13

So different from American comics. Well, Schodt gives you a very readable historical perspective on them, drawing all the way back to pre-industrial Japan. But he shows that the true flowering of manga arose in post-War Japan. Manga is seen in Japan as a serious literary form. While some manga are indeed trash, others are considered on a par with novels.<br /><br />The book has colour plates and black and white pictures of many manga, with English commentary. Glimpses of quite a different culture.<br /><br />Schodt wrote his study in 1983, when manga was still relatively unknown in the US. Few such comics were available in translated form. Hence the book was very useful in breaking through a formidable langugage barrier. But things have changed. Now US bookstores stock many English versions of manga. In fact, manga in the US possesses a unique trait. It is the only major printed form in English that often has the pages numbered from back to front, as we would term it. This of course follows the Japanese page numbering convention. The English manga retains this, to add to the ambience.<br /><br />The only drawback about the book is that it aches for a second edition. The intervening years have seen an even greater flowering on new manga in Japan. Plus, he could also study the influence of it on the Japanese computer games.	2004-11-13

The first 4 chapters concern the design process; independent of any implementation. These chapters are a good description of the various top-down phases that any programmer can use.<br /><br />The rest of the book deals with coding. But it leads off with a chapter on Web Services. Which talks about how its use can aid a distributed implementation of the solution. You get a brief exposure to the amazing verbosity of Web Services Description Language.<br /><br />Perhaps this chapter may have the most appeal to some readers. It really distinguishes the book from others that discuss using .NET as a development area. If you are wondering how to jump into Web Services, try here. The discussion is concise enough to have merit, if you are unsure about committing enough time to a full Web Services approach. Later chapters continue this study in more detail.	2004-11-13

She does not attempt to give a comprehensive discussion of all that is in Small Business Server 2003. For that, you can turn to Microsoft's official documentation. But a problem with the latter is that it is voluminous. Snedaker aims this book at someone who may not have the time or inclination to go through the latter.<br /><br />So she describes what to her are the key issues you are likely to face. For these, she speaks as plainly as possible about how to solve them. You get enough information to (hopefully) perform your tasks. There is no elegant description of the structure of SBS.

But if you are new to Perl, the book will be a concise guide. The examples are simple and short. Towards the end are subroutines of moderate complexity. All typically less than 100 lines.<br /><br />One thing to note is that the book doesn't expound on higher levels of structured programming. If you have a problem that might require a Perl solution of say 1000 lines or more, then how to tackle this, and decompose the problem into more amenable parts is not discussed here. This book caters to teaching the syntax and simple applications that rest directly atop this syntax.	2004-11-11

Anybody who has ever worked in a commercial project with 2 or more programmers should quickly understand the need.<br /><br />Well, recently, a new open source program, called Subversion, has arisen to handle version control. Rooney offers a detailed explanation of its usage. Assuming that you have used any other competing system, like CVS, RCS, Perforce or Visual Source Safe, then the text should be readily intelligible. He gives a comprehensive coverage of all that Subversion offers.<br /><br />But you know what? Aside from what the user has to deal with, you can probably safely disregard certain parts of the book. Because most readers are programmers, and they just want whatever versioning system they use to work. So while Subversion has a better API for third parties to build upon, unless you're one of those third parties, this advantage is moot.<br /><br />Turn to Appendix B. This is a concise comparative analysis of Subversion vis-a-vis the other versioning programs. If you are still undecided whether to adopt Subversion, the Appendix is the most useful part of the book. For example, Rooney compares Subversion to CVS, which is probably the most common versioning system in use. CVS does not version directories. A glaring defect. Especially because in large projects, the directory tree can encode crucial top level information about the project. Subversion handles directory versioning. But its workflow of \\"check out, change, update, commit\\" is basically the same as CVS. So your work patterns don't have to change much.<br /><br />The biggest other difference between Subversion and CVS is described by the Appendix as how Subversion sends diffs of file changes to its silo. Whereas CVS is more likely to send full files. So less bandwidth and storage. Subversion scales better for large projects.	2004-11-11

It is unlikely that you would have a job that lets you do these things full time, by selling what you make. On the other hand, if I'm wrong, that's terrific for you!<br /><br />The authors survey the main game consoles currently in the market. Plus a few classic systems that are still available out there. Each platform gets detailed attention. Step by step, showing how to dismantle the hardware and make your changes. Without trashing the system, or having it be an electrical hazard. Though, as the book forewarns, most of the hacks will void any current warranty. But you probably already knew that, eh?<br /><br />The book is also handy for a history of each platform.

The program has immense ability to record audio and video and to merge these in as intricate a fashion as you desire. There is a panoply of editing functions. For such things as adding subtitles to video tracks. Or supporting several languages using the audio tracks. Or to have a multistory project.<br /><br />Where ever possible, the book shows how Studio Pro has automated the steps in each of these tasks. There are many colour screen captures revealing the menus you invoke, and the results they generate.<br /><br />Plus, in today's Web oriented world, Studio Pro lets you insert hyperlinks using DVD@ccess. These links can go into menus, markers and slides. So that the user can reach out into the Web (or local files). In this way, you can use the DVD and Web to complement each other. Imagine producing a game DVD with links to your website. So that a gamer can easily engage in a multiplayer scenario, or download the latest 3 dimensional world.

For its first 10 years or so, there really was nothing in its price range that seriously rivalled its GUI. Though that edge has eroded significantly by now, this book attests to the presence of a still admiring throng. Unlike many computer books, this is focused on its distinctive user base. Yes, sections of the book talk about various present and bygone Mac products. But the book is clearly most about Mac fans.<br /><br />It has biographies of well known users. At least, they are well known within this community. And it is a world wide web of its own. We meet users in Iceland, Japan and all over. In fact, a sizeable portion of the book covers the Mac scene in Japan. Very creative and colourful blokes. Years before Unicode rose to handle languages like Japanese, the Mac had an approach to internationlisation that readily catered to Japanese. When Microsoft and others were still mostly ascii. So no surprise that the Japanese Mac community has a rich history.<br /><br />You don't have to use a Mac to appreciate this book. A fascinating peek at a thriving bunch.	2004-11-09

But one curious thing is that this book appears to be the first major novel in English to speculate about a successful Japanese capture of Hawaii during World War 2. Some 60 years after 7.12.1941. One might wonder why, given the number of American SF authors in the postwar years, and the creative talent of this group.<br /><br />Well, for whatever reason, we have it now, in this novel. Solidly researched, which is one of Turtledove's strengths. Certainly, this is a far more serious read than his juvenile Gunpowder Empire series.<br /><br />But speaking of speculations - S M Stirling, in \\"Marching Through Georgia\\", posited a history where the Japanese captured Hawaii. But in his novel, it was just a few remarks in a historical outline. Those of you who might have enjoyed his book, but wished for more details can turn here. A metalevel look, across different authors.<br /><br />There is an ironic point about this book. Turtledove first shot to fame with an alternate history of the US Civil War, \\"The Guns of the South\\". And he then wrote several series of books around the two World Wars. Likewise, this book might also be the start of a new series. But this book shares something else with many of those books. While set in wartime, its depictions of battles is not that good. Compared to Stirling's General series, Pournelle's Janissaries, or Weber's Harrington. Turtledove concentrates on the multiplayer view; often of low ranking characters.

No shortage of it in this book. One can readily imagine this book as contraband in some regimes. Wang describes the major file sharing networks of our time. Gnutella, FastTrack, BitTorrent and others. He gives you the gist of each and how to get started using them to download files. All the major networks are designed to be easy to use for the layperson. Indeed, we see that this is a necessary condition for their popularity.<br /><br />IRC usage is also explained. This is also an important electronic modality for downloading files. Ditto with Instant Messaging offerings from MSN, Yahoo and ICQ.<br /><br />Naturally, a large portion of the book discusses what types of files get downloaded. Most music. Some video. But still limited because of the sheer amount of data in a typical film. Wang covers the continuing controversies in a fairly neutral tone. Overall, he supports the usage of the networks. Though he decries the copyright infringement. One might wonder, though, if it is because for practical reasons, he cannot take any other stance, given that he is espousing his view in the permanent form of this book. And that he is doing so with a reputable publisher, No Starch. So this is no samizdat.	2004-11-09

When I got into gaming in 1979, there were basically two types. The new video arcade games like Space Invaders. And text-based games like trek, that ran on mainframes.<br /><br />Well, the arcade games are certainly still with us. Carless devotes an entire chapter to what are now considered classic arcade games of the 80s. But now, there exist emulators for these, runnable on PCs.<br /><br />But recently, massive multiplayer role playing games have arisen, like EverCrack. Um, I mean EverQuest. Carless talks about the various communities built around these games. A curious and addictive subculture. With some members who play, to accrue loot  that they then sell to other, newer players. Sometimes using eBay to do so. Think about how abstract and unreal this is. A scenario  out of pure science fiction. Until it started happening. This chapter may be the most interesting of the book, for the glimpses it shows of these devotees.<br /><br />Carless also provides suggestions if you want to code your own game. Like using the popular game engine, Machinima, to do so. Easy to learn and to build up a 3d world.	2004-11-09

And specifically of the Broadway literary and drama scene. Her life is intertwined with the personages and attitudes of that crowd. Kreizenbeck shows her travails in trying to establish her career, as an independent poet and playwright. For Akins to try to send her works to a publisher marked her as unusual and \\"ambitious\\". The latter not being praiseworthy for a woman. For it suggested that she was competing with male writers, who were supposedly better and had to support families.<br /><br />Throughout the book, we often see such remarks. For the author not only analyses her writings, but also the social context and constraints she operated under.<br /><br />It is with some satisfaction that we see Akins prevail, and ultimately win a Pulitzer, after decades of tribulations. Far from inevitable. Lesser women, both in talent and fortitude, would have quit far earlier. Kreizenbeck has produced an impressively researched discourse.	2004-11-08

Meyer discusses how this is increasingly an affordable reality. The common factor between many of his hacks is the X10 standard for communicating with a device that is plugged into the electric grid, via that grid. Low bandwidth. But pervasive connectivity. On a related note, recently a government decision enabled electric utilities to offer Internet access via their power  lines.<br /><br />Unlike many other O'Reilly books on hacks, this one covers a wide range of hardware. Because the possible home automation topics are very diverse. From security (via motion detectors for example) to motorising window blinds to mowing the lawn to forwarding phone calls. The appliances for these come from many vendors. And some of the hacks are really low tech, though they are not bad because of that, mind you.<br /><br />Meyer restricts himself to hacks that are achievable now. For maximum utility to you. He could also have added some speculation about future trends. Like IPv6, the next generation of the Internet. This will enable appliances, all the way down to light bulbs, to have their own internet addresses, and be remotely controlled. If you look carefully at many of the hacks that use X10, you can see the potential. The biggest impediment may be cost. Thus, many appliances don't implement X10. Imagine though that the cost became negligible. And X10 merged into IPv6, at perhaps the physical/data link levels. The scope of the hacks would be greatly enhanced. Ah well, we'll just have to wait for the future.	2004-11-07

So to gin up sales and usage, they want to offer many handy ideas that add value to it. Thus one of their employees, Matthews, came up with this slender guide. Unsurprisingly, the information is laid out very clearly for the reader, given that Photoshop is about visual presentation of images and text.<br /><br />The design tips are given in a nontechnical prose, for a general audience. There are two levels at which you can use this book. Firstly, and obviously, for the tips themselves. But at a metalevel, look carefully at how she arranges her graphics and text. A clean and minimalist design, that does not attempt to overwhelm the reader on any given page. Uncluttered. Quite unlike, say, Wired magazine. So you can try using this book as an implicit design document for your own work. Most readers will never try this, even though it's right in front of them.	2004-11-07

And here, for those of you on Macs, is Apple's latest front end to email usage. Kissell goes into how to use the client side GUI. As you might expect, Apple offers a clear and attractive design. Made as intuitive as possible.<br /><br />Of course, there is a little bit more to email than just the client side. You have to get your messages from a message server. An unavoidable complication. So Kissell delves into POP and IMAP servers, without drowning you in technical details. He gives very straightforward explanations, directed at a lay audience.<br /><br />As a sign of our times, he offers an extensive discussion of spam filters for the Mac. By now, there are several available. None of these are very effective. Filtering messages on keywords that are bad words may detect some porn messages, but the nonporn spam is much harder to tackle by this method. Plus, there are many ways for a spammer to insert deliberate misspellings, to avoid these tests.<br /><br />The Bayesian methods are probabilistic and require training on known sets of spam and nonspam. Plus, such Bayesians can be poisoned by spammers sending messages with all sorts of irrelevant words. You will need to periodically retrain it.<br /><br />You will just have to tolerate the spam any of these methods let through, until better techniques come along.	2004-11-07

Well, Eismann shows how to perform this using Photoshop. While texts on Photoshop as a whole discuss masking and compositing as one of their topics, her book delves solely into it.<br /><br />She describes how Adobe has developed sophisticated tools that aid you in plucking out subsets of an image. But the book is more than just a recital of tool documentation. She offers you a creative process (a programmer might term this a development cycle) for designing a desired image. A top down approach that, correctly, I think, relegates the Photoshop techniques to a means and not an ends in themselves.<br /><br />But certainly it should also be said that the description of the techniques is comprehensive and lucid. Some, like the chapter on selecting hair and other fine details, should elicit admiration that such tasks are even possible. If you hail from programming, you can appreciate the amount of coding that must have gone into enabling such tasks.	2004-11-07

Despite the attention lavished on more recent languages, like Java and C#, knowledge of C is a de facto requirement in many programming jobs. Whether you are in a unix or Microsoft environment. Now C has scarcely changed in 20 years. But the difference between this book and C texts then is the visual programming environment. The authors talk up this aspect, to aid your programming. The book discusses using a text editor or IDE to write the code. But this book is written for the beginner. All the code examples are short. None over 100 lines, as far as I can tell. So the power of an IDE is really not needed. What would be useful is a text editor that can colour highlight keywords. Like vim, which is an enhanced version of vi.<br /><br />In other words, if you want to use this book, you don't need to run out and get some fancy IDE. The real power of those arises when you want to develop large code bases.<br /><br />The authors write clearly, and do supply good examples. But sadly, the book lacks problem sets. I do realise that this is true of most computer books. But for many of those, they discuss subjects that may be hard to design useful problems, because of the sheer complexity of the systems under consideration. But for a beginning book in C, it is possible and preferable to supply many problems. And also easy to do so. Essentially, simple parsing and numerical analysis problems.<br /><br />The best way for the reader to learn the language is to have problems to tackle. Learn by doing. All the discussion in the book about analysing the examples is fine. But not enough. I also went to the companion URL given in the book. No problem sets there, either. Perhaps this can be rectified?	2004-11-06

He depicted a time so advanced that the simplest arithmetic was done by computers, and forgotten by humans. And so it goes here, in Chang's book. He has done us a service by revisiting solved problems that have been solved for so long that their basic importance is no longer appreciated by practising scientists.<br /><br />Consider your typical undergraduate textbooks that discuss heat and temperature. Very little mention is given about the bootstrapping problem. Without modern instrumentation, how do you define a temperature scale that is consistently reproducible? One might wonder why it took scientists of an earlier age so long to strive over such a simple problem. Were they stupid back then?<br /><br />Not so. Chang shows that the problem is divided into two closely related parts. One experimental and one conceptual. The former relates to the search for fixed points, like the freezing and boiling points of water. Not as straightforward as it might first seem. And no, it was not the dependence of these on the atmospheric pressure. That was quickly discovered and accomodated. But other phenomenon like the supercooling of liquid water, which can push it below the normal freezing point, were harder to understand.<br /><br />It turned out that the key conceptual problem is just as serious, if not more so. One runs into a circular pattern of logic. One way out is to follow Euclid's approach by starting with a small set of axioms that everyone accepts, and build from them. Anyway, the core of Chang's book is how this problem was tackled and solved. It took some of the most prominent scientists of the 18th and 19th centuries to tie this down. And that is the merit of this book. Chang helps us appreciate one of the foundations of our science.	2004-11-04

Books	3	16	18	N	N	weak description of relational databases	The combination of PHP and MySQL open source applications for developing a website has garnered wide attention. Yank explains why in this concise book. The scenario is that you want to build a website that has a back end database. From that database and also with input from the user, the web server has to get data and generate (ie. publish) dynamic HTML webpages.<br /><br />The book quickly covers the panoply of topics needed to implement this goal. Yank starts by explaining how to use separately MySQL and PHP.<br /><br />Then a chapter on relational databases. The weakest part of the book. No mention of the intricacies of normalisation or how to seriously design multiple tables with related keys. He gives a simple example that is correct insofar as it goes, and which lets him finesse not providing a fuller theoretical framework. If you have had no prior exposure to relational databases, then this chapter may be of limited usefulness in the context of your situation. Perhaps the best that can be said of the chapter is that it can motivate you to investigate designing a relational database, using a more extensive text devoted to that subject.<br /><br />Later chapters then show how to combine the MySQL and PHP into an entire system. These chapters are better done.	2004-11-02

There is an emphasis on diffusion limited growth processes, as on solid surfaces, for example.<br /><br />Fluid phenomena are also studied. Like the formation of viscous fingers between two fluids. Also of interest is how Meakin shows that long range persistence can arise out of localised interactions. Considerable space is devoted to studying diffusion limited aggregation, because of the importance of this model in many systems.<br /><br />Overall, quite a worthy book for a materials researcher. The math and computer simulations is well developed but clearly understandable.	2004-11-02

In the general press, there have been occasional interviews with a few public spammers. Like an article in the New York Times in 2003 that described two such spammers in Los Angeles. But for the most part, spammers wisely avoid the limelight. McWilliams delves into the background of several. The book shows good old fashioned investigative journalism. The machinations of the wretched filth are amazing.<br /><br />He also gives us insight into various antispammers that have arisen to combat this miserable scourge. Most notably, of Steve Linford, who runs Spamhaus, which is a global blacklist of the more egregrious spammers.<br /><br />There is no happy ending to this book, unlike a work of fiction. The methods described to fight spam have limited efficacy. Spam is clearly shown to be a chronic problem. An open sore on the rear end of the Internet.	2004-11-02

While it trails Oracle in market share, the capabilities as shown here by Mullins are probably at least the equal of Oracle's 10g.<br /><br />This book is designed for a full time DB2 administrator or developer, who needs an extensive reference on it. It's fair to say that you would not want to learn the theory of relational databases from this book. Sadly, there is only one, passing reference to E F Codd, in the context of normalisation of data. Minimal acknowledgment of the founder of relational modelling. Seek a learning of theory elsewhere.<br /><br />Instead, the book focuses on all the options built into DB2. By now, possibly person-centuries of IBM's programmer sweat have gone int this latest version 8. You can take advantage of this accrued expertise.

Meloni suggests here in her book why it has proved so useful. If you read her book and have some familiarity with Microsoft's Office suite, then you can see what Plone offers. The various Microsoft applications, like MSWord, have very rich toolkits. But each application essentially handles single documents. Meloni shows that Plone's remit is at a higher level of organisation. More to do with workflow between several users.<br /><br />Plus, these users need not be in one physical location. Plone lets a group distributed over the Internet work together. Plone can help enable new types of dispersed \\"multinationals\\" of just a few people.<br /><br />The book also has merit in showing how to use Plone to construct wikis and blogs. Two topical subjects. And very closely related. So both are described in the same chapter. Daresay that some of you will find this the most useful section of the book.	2004-11-02

There seems to be only 1 diagram in the entire book. No GUIs to pretty up the scene. In this sense, the book is a throwback to those texts of the 80s. Strictly command line and file I/O.<br /><br />Bash under linux is shown by the book to be not that different from an earlier Bourne shell. Or even the more rudimentary C shell. The various chapters discuss such items as defining variables and thence using these to build up expressions in a script. Burtch methodically shows how to increase the complexity of your scripting.<br /><br />If some of you come from an earlier unix background, and have scripted there, then the book is reassuring. It should validate that most of your expertise carries over into bash and linux. Sure, there might be some new material. But the book shows that a typical script is not that different from a unix script of 20 years ago.	2004-10-31

Often, someone might learn programming without ever having to know about the architecture of a von Neumann machine. Yet most computers since World War 2 have this design at their very core.<br /><br />Hyde fills in this gap in the education. At one level, you should read it for \\"culture\\". It explains the basis of programming. Granted, for most of us, there is often no direct need for understanding how binary arithmetic is implemented. Or why registers can speed up performance. And what is cache memory, really? We finesse our ignorance by invoking libraries that subsume these details.<br /><br />The material that Hyde explains may occasionally be of use. What if you need to write some of these low level procedures in assembler, to reduce a bottleneck? After using a profiler on your runtime code to find the key routines, do you have any idea how to improve matters?<br /><br />Even out of pure intellectual curiosity, you should know what happens at the silicon.

These are near real time news feeds from news organisations all over the world. Its greatest merit may be to expose you to alternative viewpoints; instead of just your regular newspapers.<br /><br />But potentially the most useful portion of the book concerns the advanced search options.

The authors have striven to write a definitive Handbook (in the German sense of the word). It spans every major implementation, circa 2003 - Cisco, Nokia, Solairs, linux,... Which explains a substantial part of the heft. The firewall market has these major platforms, and there is enough detail on each for you to be able to install and run it.<br /><br />But the book is more than a set of disparate sections on each vendor. More broadly, it goes into the theory of Intrusion Detection Systems and the common ideas behind most firewalls. You should note that the IDS topic alone is considered sufficiently important by others to have books devoted to it. The level of detail in this book about IDS is not the most comprehensive. But you'll get the gist.<br /><br />So within the covers of this book, you are getting a broad scope of product information and theory. Even if the book's title is somewhat strident.	2004-10-28

Of course, this abstraction is important, in order to generalise from specific instances. The whole point of patterns, after all. But Holub points out that often these descriptions are a little too abstract. Many of us learn from well chosen examples. So he follows this precept by elaborating on 2 nontrivial case studies. One is John Conway's classic Game of Life. From this you can see various common patterns emerge from the gestalt, like Visitor and Composite.<br /><br />The other case study is an embedded SQL interpreter. Neither example is complicated. But each consists of several interlocking parts that contributes to an overall complexity that can be challenging if you don't use patterns.<br /><br />Granted, if by one means or another, you're already familiar with patterns, perhaps from the GoF book, then Holub's text will do little for you. But if you're new to patterns, he can offer an accessible insight.	2004-10-27

But the Mac tends to do it so elegantly.<br /><br />Much else is covered by the book. There are several examples of internationalisation. She shows how an application bundle is a directory with subdirectories of local specific data like text, audio and video, arranged in a very logical fashion. You can get an appreciation for what it means to have a program be used in a global way.<br /><br />Plus, you can ease into unix.

Well suited for someone who is not a physicist or communications engineer. The text glides smoothly over the basics of electromagnetic propagation and antenna design. Each of these is the stuff of entire [large] texts, for specialists. But the book gives you enough detail for your needs. One key point is that the truly hard work has already been encapsulated in the commercially available hardware, which is now very easy for the layman (you?) to use. There is deliberately very little to tweak on those boxes. Which makes a book like this feasible.<br /><br />Naturally, there is more detail on the 802.11 standards and on the possible layout topologies of your network. Reinforced by several case studies.

However, David shows the many advances in recent years, driven principally by ever more powerful computers.<br /><br />He describes that going from powder data to a crystal structure is often an underdetermined problem, compared to dealing with single crystal samples. Thus many methods have arisen, that basically take intelligent steps or assumptions, to reduce down the manifold possibilities.<br /><br />He makes a cogent point that all is not yet automated. There is often still a need for you to make an inspired guess, based on your own expert knowledge, while applying the computational tools  that have been developed.<br /><br />The book is well suited for crystallographers, as a good summary of the start of the art.	2004-10-26

But this book shows the long forgotten tribulations and controversies that got us to today's known state.<br /><br />This text is rather specialised. You need to be thoroughly conversant with electromagnetism. On a par with Jackson's text, &#34;Classical Electrodynamics&#34;. But presumably you also have an interest in the history of your field. Darrigol shows that the path was often obscure. Only in full hindsight, after Maxwell and also Einstein made their contributions, did it all come clear.<br /><br />The scarcity of vector notation in the 19th century accounts can make reading some of the equations a little awkward. You have to perform some slight mental contortions to reinterpret what they're saying, in modern notation.	2004-10-26

Set in our timeline of around 2190, and with us having discovered how to cross to other universes, with Earths of quite different alternate history. A venerable theme in science fiction, and since Turtledove has made his name as an acknowledged master of alternate history, one might expect much here. Following in the footsteps of H. Beam Piper's stories. Unfortunately, the book falls short on several aspects.<br /><br />Firstly, what glimpses we catch of our timeline in 2190 make it seem little different technologically from currently, aside from the ability to move between universes.<br /><br />Secondly, the premise that we need to trade with other human inhabited worlds for food grown there is ridiculous. In this book, the example given is garlic. Our world is depicted as being short of food growing capability. But the book also refers to us having discovered uninhabited worlds. Well, in this case, as far as growing food is concerned, the best way is to let some of us emigrate there and farm on a massive scale. Even with today's farming technology, industrialised farmers would leap at the chance to cultivate the best virgin soil of entire worlds. Plus, in today's developed countries, less than 3% of the population can grow enough to feed the rest, and usually also generate surpluses. Imagine what farmers 90 years hence could do, with even better crops and machines. Plus being able to choose at will the best land on other Earths. Along these lines, S M Stirling described a similar scenario in his Conquistador book. He depicted in detail how using mid 20th century farming methods, people could comfortably grow enough food in a parallel world.<br /><br />For the sake of argument, we might imagine some foodstuffs that cannot be grown in a large scale, and are high value enough that we might trade with other worlds for. Super-truffles perhaps. But not garlic! The last time I checked, garlic can indeed be grown on large farms. So too for any common, cheap food. That is what makes those common and cheap.<br /><br />Now Piper and others like Keith Laumer who depicted parallel worlds postulated that we might trade for valuable human made artifacts. Especially if we were a more advanced society, where most things were mass produced. Turtledove should have also used this premise here. Because his other key idea in this book, that we need to surveil some alternate worlds, for our own safety, does make sense.<br /><br />But in the instance of the book, it is implausible that if we are surveilling that world, that we would also pay our way when there, by selling slightly advanced items. Very dangerous. While he uses this to introduce plot complications, the basic premise is flawed. The last thing we would do on such a world. In his first volume, this selling strategy is fine, because that world is so far behind us. Not here.<br /><br />But suppose we can put all this aside about the book's verisimilitude. What about the plot line? Sadly lacking in the arena of gripping writing. All the villains are cardboard. The final action scene was trivial. And the boy hero telling his girl friend about a better America and then taking her to it? Well, 30 years ago, Jack Finney did it much better in \\"Time And Again\\".<br /><br />You see, if Turtledove was a hardcore military SF writer, which he primarily is not, then he could have done something with the basic plot of this story. Built it up quite well as a military confrontation. And perhaps as somewhat of a mirror image to Stirling's Drakon, where the Draka of a more advanced parallel universe were trying to get at us. Now we, circa 2190, might put forces into the book's Earth, against a repressive hegemony. Then again, he has successfully written long series about mainly military events. So in a future book of this series, perhaps he can try the above. And drop the juvenile protagonists. Not really his forte. And it does limits the scope of what he can depict.	2004-10-24

Does this make you pause? There has been roughly one edition per year. Over 7 years of Java, already?! Seems like yesterday when Java burst on the scence.<br /><br />The current edition is fully caught up with J2SE 5.0 (aka Java 1.5). The cover warns, quite accurately, that this volume is best suited for experienced programmers. Now if you're already comfortable with programming in Java 1.4 or 1.3, then the delta between those versions and this is not so great. Presumably and hopefully, you're already facile in object oriented programming with Java, and with graphics programming using AWT and Swing. If so, the new items in 1.5 should interest you. There has been no fundamental reworking of OO in 1.5. Which is the key thing. So for most of the chapters, you will have easy going. You can skim those, looking for what interests you.<br /><br />As for the new items in 1.5, varargs should be an old friend to C programmers. While autoboxing is a simple idea that can reduce clutter in some of your source code. While improved Unicode support helps if your application is to deploy globally.	2004-10-24

A quiet revolution is happening with Microsoft's flagship .NET. By putting the ownership of key parts into ECMA and ISO, Microsoft has enabled the rise of an open source movement that can build projects within C# or even Java, and have these compiled or cross compiled to Intermediate Language bytecode, which can then be run on Microsoft or linux boxes.<br /><br />What the book shows is that enthusiasts in open source have seized this chance. They have built tools like NUnit and NAnt, which correspond to their Java precursors, JUnit and Ant. Functionally, NUnit and NAnt do just what you'd expect. Which eases the transition form Java programming, if that is where you are coming from.<br /><br />The book covers far more than these packages. It describes an entire development and coding process, living entirely in a .NET environment. Complete with detailed examples to make it real for you. It also describes ongoing open source efforts like Mono and Portable.NET.<br /><br />The book does not goes into the depth of detail about IL that a similar book, \\"Cross Platform .NET Development\\", does. But it is broader in its scope of coverage of the overall development process.	2004-10-24

And yes, I do my best work in the garage.<br /><br />But leaving that aside, the book offers a quick tour of Java 1.5. Which has been rebranded by Sun as J2SE 5.0. It shows how far applets have fallen. Remember in 1996 when Java came out and applets took centre stage for client side applications? Since then, they have been steadily deprecated. Now, out of 35 chapters, only one talks about them.<br /><br />A fair amount of the book talks about Java features predating 5.0. Like the chapter on Strings, which could mostly apply to Java 1.3 or even 1.2.<br /><br />Hewitt gives a quick walkthrough the major ideas of Java. The book deliberately makes no claim to be comprehensive. Instead, it might be seen as a reaction against, and an alternative to, the 1000 page tomes that try to cover all aspects of Java. Instead, you get here a text that can be easily assimilated.	2004-10-23

The series begins with his classic Refactoring text. Now Kerievsky takes us into a sequel. Because you can imagine this as a suitable extension of the previous book. Where now the author has us look for patterns during the refactoring process. The style of the book closely follows Fowler's book. And, like that book, the code examples are in Java.<br /><br />But what if you program in C++ or C#? If you are experienced enough, you should be able to apply many of these ideas in your language. The examples are meant to give flesh to general patterns. And the patterns should be able to be implemented in any object oriented language.<br /><br />Actually, if you have already been looking for patterns, or designing to them, then much of this book may be no surprise. Because one virtue of the book is that it binds together a set of commonly encountered refactorings. But even in this case, a few hours reading may be profitable for you, if it just exposes you to a few hitherto unfamiliar patterns.	2004-10-21

Sounds like an oxymoron. Yet the book shows how .NET has given rise to this. The key step was Microsoft transferring the specifications of C# and .NET's CLI to ECMA and ISO. This lets third parties write compilers that produce IL bytecode and thence to assembly in a given hardware.<br /><br />So you could write C# code on some platform, like linux. Then with Mono or Portable.NET, produce x86 binaries.<br /><br />The authors describe the open source Mono and Portable, and compare these with Microsoft's own .NET offerings. They show that Mono and Portable are quite functional. For example, using Portable, you can write in Java, C#, C or VB.NET and compile.<br /><br />The book goes into some moderate level of detail about CLI. But if you are a programmer in C# or C, say, and you just want to get native binaries, without wanting to know about CLI, the book is still useful. You can safely skip the CLI sections, without losing the gist of what you need to know. For many of us, whatever language we use, we don't need or want knowledge of a specific assembly language.	2004-10-21

Each program has several texts devoted solely to it. But it is in the interaction between the two that often developers need assistance on.<br /><br />The book does start with chapters exclusively on explaining PHP, and other chapters on MySQL. In themselves, you might find these to be concise and useful explanations.<br /><br />But the meat of the book is given in several chapters, where each chapter is devoted to making one common application. Like constructing a shopping cart. Or a Web-based email service. These are things that you have surely experienced as a user. Now you get to see how to code them in PHP and MySQL. Which explains some of the book's size. There are 10 chapters in this section. Enough to give you plenty of examples to draw ideas from.	2004-10-20

But often due to lack of space and audience expertise, they often do not give any detailed theory of cryptosystems. There is relatively little maths in such books. In turn, cryptography books fall into roughly two piles. One is highly mathematical and abstract; deliberately independent of any operating system or implementation. The other uses those theorems from the previous type of book, and is more tied to some software package that implements them.<br /><br />Bishop's book stands differently. The level of the maths and the notation and the rigour with which he describes the cryptosystems would not be out of place in an algorithms book. But it is not all maths. There are chapters on Identity and on Access Control Mechanisms that are traditional sysadmin-type discussions. Veterans of running DEC's VMS machines will see much familiar material. But these discussions are also characterised by a level of analysis uncommonly seen in most sysadmin books. Bishop tries to show how behind such things like Access Control Lists, there is a systematic logic. Other books that might be tied to a given operating system or package might bury you in details, and obscure a general model.<br /><br />If you have wanted to dig deeper into the subject and have good background in discrete maths, Bishop is worth reading.	2004-10-20

But the bulk is due in no small part to the authors choosing to describe 3 case studies. The implementation of code for each case illustrates various ways to use Dreamweaver.<br /><br />One interesting point of the book, compared to others on Dreamweaver, is that it seems to give equal emphasis to both the visuals that you can make, and to hooking pages all the way back to a database. Most Dreamweaver books concentrate on the former. But here is exhaustive detail on using ASPs or JSPs on the web server. It also looks at integrating Dreamweaver with PHP and MySQL, a popular combination. Graphics designers may not be so enthralled by some of this back end stuff, but on large websites, it is essential.	2004-10-20

If you are a mechanical or civil engineer or architect, or a student in those fields, it behooves you to have some passing familiarity with AutoCAD. Now this book gives you the latest version, 2005.<br /><br />By now, the differences with recent previous editions, like 2004, are incremental. Autodesk is continually refining and adding new features, like improved annotations. The first chapter describes these newbies in 2005. But guess what? If you read through the rest of the book, which essentially describes 2004, then you can see that 2005 is just an incremental upgrade. So if you are currently using the 2004 version, and have no plans to migrate, you may well consider skipping 2005 and waiting for a future edition. The book explicitly acknowledges this strategy. Though the example it gives is the user skipping recent editions like 2004 and now deciding to take up 2005.<br /><br />What you can expect from the 2005 package is a very stable and well tested edition. A mature development platform. If you are a full time AutoCAD user, you may want to peruse the latest 2005 changes to see if indeed it is time to upgrade.	2004-10-19

On unix machines, there may be sysadmins to combat this. But on XP PCs, especially in homes, the only sysadmin is you. And you are probably not a computer professional.<br /><br />The topics here are sysadmin tasks that a user should periodically do. Not all of these necessarily pertain to speeding up your machine. For example, when Simmons talks about deleting adware/spyware and cleaning up cookies, any speed increase is surely slight. But those particular tasks are such good practice that you should not hold it against him for including them in this book.<br /><br />Ah, but things like adjusting virtual memory can have dramatic effect on some machines that have tool little for their tasks. Though you may pay attention to most pertinent thing he says here. Which is that in some cases, adding virtual memory will not improve matters if you actually have too little RAM. Beef up the latter, perhaps?<br /><br />And turn error logging off. The book correctly says that few of you need it. Will free up some clock cycles.	2004-10-19

Personally I think the new acronym is forbidding to newcomers. Just like the HP snake workstations which it called [eg] HP9000/720.<br /><br />If you are migrating to 1.5, then it is at least worth your time to see the new threading and what you can do with it. Like the thread pooling and task scheduling. The intent is to free you from having to hand craft what Sun regards as often needed threading utility functions. And so each developer does not need to waste her time independently recoding. Sun has performed a little refactoring, at the language level.<br /><br />But if you are happy sitting on 1.4, and already have the 2nd edition of this book, then I can't say you really need this edition. Unless you want to see possible advantages in threading if you move.<br /><br />By the way, the book may say threading in Java is easier than in other languages. But that does not mean that threading is easy. The book can give you some appreciation of the nuances involved. In many ways, the issues in the book are far harder than [say] some book on building a UI with Java.	2004-10-18

Bolante shows here why AE has a far more challenging task.<br /><br />Even leaving aside competing tools, AE must handle video editing and audio editing. Here, it needs to synchronise two such tracks, in such ways as the ending of one triggering the start of another.<br /><br />The audio editing is somewhat rudimentary. Other programs that specialise in this have more sophisticated options. But, unsurprisingly,the video editing forms the major part of AE. Several chapters are devoted to it. Many video special effects come right out of the box. Like texturing surfaces, or applying a gradient wipe.<br /><br />Of course, many films will need text to be shown in the video. As expected, you get a panoply of font families to choose from. Along with effects like showing text along a contour that you define. Quite familiar to Photoshop users. But now redone in a broader context.<br /><br />To be sure, this is not a simple book. The complexity of film editing necessitates this. But you should find that most tasks described here are straightforward to do. Though realistically, if you're trying a technique for the first time, many iterations may be needed before you're satisfied.	2004-10-17

Each year or so, Microsoft Office comes out with an upgrade. Usually, powerful new features are introduced. But haven't you wondered how many of these, or indeed of existing features, do you actually use?<br /><br />Herein, the book shows you a viable and free alternative. Perry does say forthrightly that Microsoft Office has more features than OpenOffice, and for certain operations, is easier to use. (Fewer steps.)<br /><br />But he then goes onto explain the very many existing capabilities of OpenOffice. You should see right up that the Writer, Calc, Impress and Draw are very polished. A lot of thought has gone into making the usability as easy as possible. Hopefully, the book might indicate that OpenOffice's choices of menus and actions is very intuitive. Its designers do not want to cede any ground to Microsoft on the usability issues.<br /><br />One thing to note is that you can experiment, by just trying out one of the OpenOffice packages, in lieu of its Microsoft counterpart. While still using the rest of the Microsoft suite. A low risk approach, backed up by the book's advice on the program you're testing.	2004-10-16

This constitutes the backbone of the book. The application touches upon many real life development issues. Like building in security, or hooking the application to a back end database. (Microsoft's SQL Server is used in the book, unsurprisingly.) Enough code is shown for you to use as a jumping off template for your actual needs. Realistically, if you do this with any of the sample code, your code may/will end up far longer and more intricate. For pedagogic clarity, Hoffman introduces just enough complexity in his code to show nontrivial capabilities. But not too much that it obscures the essence. However, you must expect that, for example, your SQL queries will be more involved, and so too your parsing of the returned ResultSets. But, as a programmer, you should know that often with a new, unfamiliar language, all you need is a few functional examples. Like what Hoffman provides.<br /><br />Plus, if you come from a Java or C++ background, the book should be easy sailing. C# is not that different from Java in syntax. And the use of interfaces, like Java but unlike C++, should be appreciated from the examples.	2004-10-16

The first tends to have far more resources (memory, screen size...) than the others. But all 3 have the common feature of fairly open operating systems (even Microsoft Windows!), and you don't need specialised tools or licenses to build games. Essentially, given a good C++ compiler and a good game programming text (like this one), you can start designing and coding your own game.<br /><br />He quickly points out that the most important task in game design is playability. All the many technical items that necessarily take up the book's bulk are subordinated to this.<br /><br />If you follow his suggestions, one side effect of this book is that you can get a good grounding in object oriented programming (OOP). For newcomers to C++, OOP can seem a little abstract. But the coding of game elements as objects can make OOP come alive. Because of the very direct mapping of code to object; and enhanced by the strong visual feedback that is a natural part of the development process.<br /><br />By the way, all the games in the book use graphics in a two dimensional world. You don't get to reimplement a Doom-like three dimensional scenario because this is an introductory book. Going into even a simple three dimensional environment raises rendering issues and a level of maths beyond the scope of a first course.	2004-10-15

An easy look at computers, aimed at the complete tyro. Slightly cartoony in some of the figures. But it is not aimed at kids, though they could certainly gain from it. A typical user is suggested by the cover. Like perhaps a middle-aged person who thus far has sat out learning this stuff.<br /><br />Like I said, it is not a kid's book. The narrative is sober. Miller is careful to minimise the use of computer jargon. And when he does introduce such jargon, you get s clear explanation. Look, you're not going to feel like you're reading your child's textbook. Whether by accident or design, Miller seems to have positioned this book as somewhat of a contrast to a Dummy's or Idiot's book, even though all 3 might be aimed at the same audience.<br /><br />By the way, he concentrates on Microsoft computers. Apple and linux users may gnash their teeth at this, but he is just following the market realities.	2004-10-14

Prominent amongst these is Nessus, which, given its origin in 1998, is somewhat of a veteran in this field.<br /><br />The book's first chapter is a very articulate and concise overview of vulnerability assessment, and independent of specific tools like Nessus. But moving onto Nessus, you get a detailed user's manual. From running it to interpreting the results. The latter can be tricky. The book tries to give you some appreciation of the limitations of Nessus and of the assumptions that it might implicitly make about your network and machines. It turns out that to use it well, you need good familiarity with your network. Like its topology and any perculiarities of the machines. For example, do you have a program running on one machine that regularly probes the others, for whatever reason? And are you aware of the patch status of the machines? Nessus can help you with detecting such things. But it won't hurt to know as much, a priori.<br /><br />Don't ignore the chapter on the world wide user community. It can be a vital resource if you end up using Nessus.	2004-10-14

Some of you will certainly enjoy just thumbing through these pages, and trusting to serendipity to be your guide. All the pages are in full colour, and the product photos and textual descriptions are very attractively laid out.<br /><br />In some ways, the book reminds me of a Sharper Image catalog. But the authors are independent of the vendors. So the product descriptions should be more reliable than in  a typical vendor's catalog.<br /><br />There may be biases in the choices of products. But as Laporte says in the Introduction, the biases are strictly what caught his fancy, and not some vendor's promptings.	2004-10-14

At least, you had better believe this, if you want to benefit from this book. Smith is talking to hands on hobbyists, which want truly unique machines. Often heavily souped up. The pages of the book are in colour, which helps show even motherboards and videocards as pretty. Candidly, those of you who think this is impossible should pass on this book.<br /><br />The text goes through the basics of each type of component, for virtually all the types that can go into a computer. As already mentioned, motherboards and videocards. But also power supplies, memory, monitors etc.<br /><br />It is important to note that the photos are not just of isolated items. Several series of photos show clearly how to install a component. The colour photo sequences are well done. More useful than traditional black and white sketches that vendors might supply. These are common because vendors have slim margins, and more elaborate colour diagrams are costly. So the book tries to address this gap, amongst the issues it addresses.	2004-10-14

To someone like you, maybe, who has never bought online, it can seem like a forbidding new world. So what Miller does is step through the fundamentals. Starting with a chapter giving a general guide to what you can expect at many online websites. One key thing you should realise is that the payment by credit card is really no different from traditional real world usage. Nor, despite everything you might read about online fraud, is it any riskier. But he does also go into describing those frauds.<br /><br />He also gives brief but effective coverage of major online sites. Like Amazon and eBay. On the subject of using eBay, you can find entire books devoted to this. Miller's is more succinct, and is more than adequate to get you started on eBay, if you so desire.<br /><br />The second half of the book is an appendix of useful websites, grouped by their main interests. A little mundane to experienced surfers. But perhaps not to you.	2004-10-14

They contrast it with the now passe Version 4. The changes are manifold enough that even if you have run a V4 system, much of this book will be new and useful to you.<br /><br />Amusingly, the Foreword talks of V4 as \\"unstable, unextensible, inconsistent across editions\\". Whew! Kudos for the belated candour. I doubt if any extant V4 literature described it in such terms.<br /><br />If you're totally new to WebSphere sysadmining, then the book clearly requires that you be familiar with XML, EJBs, SOAP and JMX, at a minimum. It goes quickly into using these, with little preamble setup. Quite understandable from the authors' vantage, but you need to be prepared.<br /><br />A big change from V4 is the extensive use of JMX. Reassuring for JMX. It's been around some 3 years. Good to see an important package like WebSphere using it. Seems that the V4 combination of EJBs and a relational database to hold parameters may have been too slow. Too heavyweight perhaps for the task? EJBs can have a big computational or network cost. Anyway, V5 replaced these with XML files and JMX. Much faster perhaps.<br /><br />Scripting is also heavily used in the book. Extensive examples that you might find useful. To me, all scripting languages tend to blur into one. This particular language does not seem any tougher than the Korn or C shells.	2004-10-12

Yourdon is best known (notorious?) for the loud and repeated claims about the Y2K crisis, prior to 2000. He was hilariously wrong, though he certainly did well out of consulting and convening conferences over it. So I anticipated more of the same puffery here.<br /><br />But gradually and grudgingly, I raised my opinion of this book. There are no shrill polemics. No hysterical call to arms. Instead, you get a sober (and sombre) study of offshoring. Yourdon goes calmly through the driving forces. He points out that the ongoing improvements in computer hardware (Moore's Law) and communications show no signs of abating. It is these which have made offshoring economic to date. And if those trends continue, offshoring can become even more persuasive.<br /><br />Yourdon suggests that for you as an individual, try to quantify your productivity if you are an American information worker. He pointedly does not restrict his audience to IT. Then see if your productivity justifies your higher cost, relative to an offshore worker. If not, you should upgrade or even change professions. He makes a very cynical but cogent observation that if you do not quantify your own productivity, someone else might do it for you, like an offshore vendor, who will not have your interests at heart.<br /><br />For an American company, Yourdon recommends a focus on Business Process Engineering. The book is thankfully short on acronyms and buzzwords. But it does advocate trying a radical improvement in your workflow, in order to stave off offshoring.	2004-10-12

Robinson aims to take you beyond the elementary books on .NET and its affiliated languages of C# and VB. Those often focus on simple syntax level explanations.<br /><br />Here, he goes far deeper. Like drilling into the Intermediate Language. The basis for .NET compilers, that convert source code in various languages like those above into this form. Like Java bytecode. (Alas, though, no cute CAFEBABE here!) So you can program at this virtual assembler level if you have to. Maybe you need to optimise some bottleneck in your code?<br /><br />Garbage collection is also studied. Related to this is how to improve memory performance, including showing how to use a profiler effectively. Nontrivial subjects. Some of which, like the chapter on cryptography, really only hint at far greater complexity.<br /><br />Most .NET programmers may not need to go to the levels of this book. But for those who do, it is good that it exists.	2004-10-12

That book of necessity had to devote time to going over basic syntactical material of VB.NET. By contrast, this book is squarely aimed at object oriented material.<br /><br />It shows how to design a problem so as to have natural object classes. From these, the book moves into implementing these under VB. This of course leads immediately into topics like inheritance and interfaces. And how to make a hierarchy of classes. You get to imagine levels of abstraction, like virtual methods in a class, which act as placeholders for actual methods in derived classes. There is a good discussion of the various ways that polymorphism can arise.<br /><br />Other chapters go into the GUI aspects of the language. Secondary emphasis really. These chapters are straightforward. Nothing conceptually hard here.<br /><br />What is striking about the book is that in the OO chapters, if you remove the code examples, much of the text could apply to C++, Java and C#. What Microsoft has done is promote VB to the level of these languages.	2004-10-11

Given Microsoft's dominance of the desktop, this book should be of interest to sysadmins or their supervisors.<br /><br />A little ironically, the material in the book tends towards a unix-type style of administration. As you may know, historically, unix machines predated any UI, and they still emphasise scripting languages for sysadmins to use and modify. These led to unix sysadmins having very powerful scripts that might be scheduled for regular, automated runs. Well, if you are a Microsoft syadmin, you probably started from and tend to stay within a UI. Which is great for manual tasks. But here, Borge shows how you can hone your skills at the command line, and why this is vital for automating common tasks.<br /><br />Of course, the book is not entirely about scripting. But I'm giving you the gist. The promise of the book is that it can round out and enhance your skills in this important direction.<br /><br />Plus the book also opens up another opportunity. If you get comfortable enough at the command line with writing scripts and using them, then a sideways shift into running unix/linux machines is not that difficult. At a fundamental level, the ideas discussed in the book tend to have similar implementations under unix. So the book can expand your career prospects, and not just in the obvious way indicated by the book.	2004-10-10

One lady thrust a copy at me, so out of politeness, I took it. Later, I wasted an hour trying to get through it. The book is sloppily written, in a cheezy, fantastical way. Very confusing to a reader. It is hard to sympathise with the main character, who just seems crazy.<br /><br />Other reviewers have noted that copies of this book were also given away in other cities. Not necessarily a good sign for its prospects. Sounds closer to vanity printing, when you have this going on. Ideally, a book should spread by word of mouth about its value. Not by mass giveaways.	2004-10-10

One of the authors, Weller, recently co-authored a sister book on .NET game programming using C#. Here, Weller and others direct their attention to using VB as a game language. Both books follow a broadly similar approach. Each shows how to access DirectX graphics calls via their chosen languages.<br /><br />For example, this book starts with a basic program in many games. How to recognise collisions between your objects? It shows how VB can be used to write object oriented code in simple fashion. And how .NET enables the code to use the underlying DirectX. The VB OO code is syntactically simpler than the corresponding C++, Java or C# code, though perhaps more verbose. Those of us who use these other languages now have to face the fact that yes, indeed, you can write decent OO code in VB.<br /><br />Another chapter shows what it calls Artifical Intelligence usage. I would just say these are more complex coding than earlier chapters. Game programming books often indulge in such puffery, independent of what languages they use.<br /><br />The book goes on to recapitulate common graphics ideas like textures and meshes, but all in VB. This is not really an algorithms book, so the treatment is more to show how to do it in VB, than a detailed exposition of the methods.	2004-10-09

MySQL has been garnering prominent wins recently, whereas Firebird has been steadily chugging along with relatively little publicity. But the book shows that if you are considering a free database, you should seriously look at Firebird. The book describes a very highly fleshed out database, that supports much standard SQL querying. Plus Firebird has had stored procedures and foreign keys for some time. The book goes into detail on these. Whereas MySQL has only its latest version incorporating them. Not as mature as Firebird's.<br /><br />The core of the book is its Part 5, with several chapters talking about Firebird's SQL variant. The good news is that you should recognise much of it already. Much of your previous SQL experience should carry over to Firebird. Preserves your productivity if you migrate.	2004-10-09

Wessler certainly wastes no time in delineating how you can use 10g to develope J2EE applications. There are some mundane chapters on installing and configuring it. Important, granted. But the crux of the book is the chapters on making and deploying web applications, EJBs and Web Services within 10g. If you look here, 10g seems to allow for any standard J2EE application to run within it.<br /><br />Crucially, suppose you commit to designing and developing one of these applications, to use 10g to hook to an Oracle database. Then your code can be largely independent of that database and 10g. In principle, you can migrate it to another J2EE compliant container, over a different database, and have only minimal changes. Realistically, your code under 10g will have all sorts of little Oracle dependencies. But this book suggests that with careful design, you can safely use 10g and still preserve a migration option. No Oracle lock in.	2004-10-08

Will the penguin now carry a briefcase? Gagne's book is a strong outreach towards existing Microsoft users. In a confident tone, he suggests why you should migrate to linux and its coterie of open source applications.<br /><br />Gagne assumes you are familiar with the Microsoft operating systems, but are clueless in linux. So he starts from scratch with the latter. Explaining the ease of installation and use. As much as possible, he gives an explanation of a linux application, like the Konqueror browser and file manager, as simply as possible. And there are constant comparisons to various Microsoft applications, to help you relate to your background.<br /><br />Even with all this, the book is clearly aimed at a fairly technically adept Microsoft user, or a Microsoft sysadmin. For a more typical Microsoft user, this book is far too complicated. Most users don't want to get into some of the details he describes, irrespective of any operating system preferences. So keep your background in mind, if you are looking at this book.	2004-10-08

Dixon goes through and shows in copious detailed text and diagrams how you can author your own DVDs. Photoshop users will see some familiar features here, like layer sets to build compound images. Still, Photoshop knowledge is not a prerequisite.<br /><br />Quite aside from authoring, you should peruse Chapter 2. A nice explanation of the various DVD formats and their history. Good overview of what a DVD really is.<br /><br />Now as far as authoring goes, the book does show a tight integration with Photoshop. Perhaps the greatest benefit is that Encore can deal with layer sets, as mentioned above. So Photoshop images do not have to be flattened. Which means that Encore is not faced with a flat bit image. Giving you easier control.<br /><br />Those of you into game programming should consult the last chapter. It talks about special features like secret item menus (Easter eggs) and invisible or inaccessible buttons. Very cool stuff.<br /><br />The power of this book can be enhanced by hardware developments still unfolding. Like Blu-Ray. This promises to make DVDs of even  greater capacity than the current maximum of 18Gb. If so, the methods of this book may give you more creative freedom.	2004-10-08

Me, I read and write XML daily in my programs. But without having to support legacy data, I've found that I can use a very minimal subject to good effect. No mixed content, no attributes in tags, etc. So I can use SAX very easily. And I only need a small subset of this book.<br /><br />But chances are that you may not be in such an easy situation. You might have to transform XML data using XSLT. While conceptually simple, the details are complex. So the book's section on XSLT can be vital. Another usage context is when you have to do some kind of search within XML data. The purview of XPath, XPointer and XLink. More good stuff to lookup here for explanations.<br /><br />Harold writes fluently about XML. He has several other well received books on XML. So technically, you can rely on this book to get the details right. But few of you should need to know all of this book. XML has grown vastly, to serve increasingly different and specialised needs. The book tries to address the totality of these needs. So don't be intimidated if you see chapters that you are totally unaware of. I'm in the same boat as you, and so are many others.	2004-10-07

This book offers to backup your knowledge of OS X and Apple's official documentation, the latter of which Griffiths clearly believes is inadequate. So he puts in tons of hacks that may come in handy.<br /><br />You should pay attention to the section on browsing. IE and Apple's own Safari are discussed, along with remarks for any other browser that you might install. For most of us, browsing the net is now automatic. So Griffiths gives hints on how to use your browser. Capabilities that you might not have been aware of. Given the large amount of surfing that you do, a careful study of his tips might produce real productivity gains.<br /><br />The only omission is a substantive discussion of using OS X with wireless networking. No mention at all of WiFi, and only a glancing comment on AirPort. I realise that these need external devices, and so might be considered somewhat outside the scope of a single Mac running OS X. But still wireless is so important nowadays, and Apple helped pioneer this for the mass market. Maybe another book in this series addresses the issue?	2004-10-07

Given IE's 90%+ dominance of this market, and that it supports only VBScript and JScript, you can well see the need for a book like this one.<br /><br />The authors point out that VBScript has broadly equivalent functionality to JavaScript and JScript. It makes sense to choose VBScript or JScript over JavaScript if you are coding to browsers. But why VBScript over JScript? The book suggests that if you are hailing from a VB background, then the transition to VBScript can be relatively painless. Helped of course by these authors.<br /><br />Hopefully, you should not have too much trouble with VBScript, whatever your background. It is a simpler language than C++, Java or C#. Plus, the style of the typical problem tackled in the book is such that a program of 100 lines or less usually suffices. You may not notice it, but such choices of problems are strategic. If solutions were thousands of lines long, then stronger procedural or object oriented techniques would be useful, leading to other languages.	2004-10-07

But after reading the book, I'm quite willing to grant that the authors have indeed done a thorough job. The book calls to mind the now classic series on Internetworking, by Comer and Stevens in the early 90s. If you've been in this game long enough, you know exactly what I mean. Of course, Comer and Stevens were looking at unix boxes hooked to the Internet.<br /><br />But, as you can see in this book, linux network programming carries over very closely to those unix versions. And both use what is basically the same IPv4, despite the massive physical buildout of the Internet.<br /><br />The book's code is unabashedly C. No cute user interface to trip over. It can test your knowledge of C quite well. Partly because the coding and handling of network calls is deliberately low level. Using the book's approach, you can get a fine grained appreciation of how to talk across the Internet. Higher level languages like Java and C# come with network libraries that deliberately hide a lot of this detail. Which is good for many applications. But sometimes you might need the performance and control that this book offers.	2004-10-07

Here, Evans offer some 250 hacks that answer common Dreamweaver problems. All characterised by a 2 page solution of some 10 steps.  If you are new to Dreamweaver, and have perhaps just read a quick overview of it, but are still shaky on the details, then the very specific nature of the book may be a good complement to your background. There is no overarching, complex theme in this book. No grand explanation of the Dreamweaver framework.<br /><br />Evans does assume some simple familiarity. But the task oriented nature of the hacks does not seem to require much more.<br /><br />In some ways, I suspect this book is a reaction against the necessary but voluminous texts that give a definitive rendition of Dreamweaver's capabilities. While those are indeed necessary, there seems to be a market demand for simpler and easier texts like this.	2004-10-07

It intends to lure in game programmers who want to build up their own games, and not just rack high scores in a game written by others. The authors cleverly start with an example of personalisation that can immediately grip you. They show how to easily wrap a facial image of someone onto a character's face. Just the sort of piquant appeal to some people.<br /><br />Various chapters describe the features of Blender that you can quickly use. Some of you well versed in computer graphics will notice that the book goes lightly over the maths. Or the game physics, for that matter. The complexity of the rendering algorithms is not shown here. So you need only a minimal background in maths and physics, since tools have been developed within Blender that apply these and hide the details from you. The discussion in this book is at the level of using those tools, not developing them.<br /><br />Still tempted? There is a lot more behind Blender. And if you find this book appealing, there are other more advanced texts behind this. Plus an entire online community of developers and gamers. The book only hints at the extent of the community.	2004-10-07

It can broaden the context of slavery for American readers, who often know of it through the lens of their own history. Yet there have been other variants, practised throughout the world.<br /><br />One compelling note about the book is how relatively recent its events are. From the 19th century to the 20th. Quite a varied group of societies are covered. The Ottoman Empire in its last years. This is contrasted with the mixture of slavery and low caste in colonial India, where there was often a continuum of condition between these two states. Also considered is Indonesia, at that time under Dutch rule.<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting observation is that the rise of a strong national rule and identity tended to reduce the incidence of slavery within a country. In Indonesia and indeed across all south east Asia. The book should perhaps have discussed this in more detail.	2004-10-04

It provides a very well debugged container for your applications. Here, Moczar walks you through version 5, the very latest.<br /><br />He takes a lot of the mystery about what J2EE is, if you decide to use Tomcat to hold J2EE applications. He illustrates with a very common 3 tier architecture - client, middle and back tiers. Most crucially, with the middle tier being subdivided into a presentation layer, controller, business logic and a lowest layer that talks to the back tier. A lot of the book essentially fleshes out how Tomcat acts as a container to hold that middle tier. Plus, within that tier, how JSPs and servlets can be used to make each layer. Of course, there are many details. But if you keep the overall framework clear in your mind, then you should have no problem following his narrative.<br /><br />The last part of the book is more suited for Tomcat sysadmins. Programmers usually will not need much material from this section.	2004-10-04

Then there are the Green's functions approach to solving various acoustic equations.<br /><br />What is more recent is the coverage of computational techniques.

Can they actually teach you Access in 15 hours? They motivate this with a scenario of a weekend in which you have to learn, starting on Friday night, and going to Sunday afternoon. The time is divided into 6 parts, one on Friday, 3 on Saturday, 2 on Sunday. Each part has several sessions (=lessons) of half an hour each. A novel approach, at least to me. Somewhat of a role-playing setup.<br /><br />Each session goes over some straightforward coding. There is a back and forth between the widget forms, which often show tabular data, and the procedures that make these forms, or analyse input from them.<br /><br />The pace is rather hurried. And you don't really get into the SQL itself. But, by and large, you may be able to get a basic operational familiarity with Access if you stay the course. The problem is that some lessons may well take more than half an hour. If you find yourself doing this, don't worry. You're not a retard! Just take as much time as you need to understand the material. I think the authors are overly optimistic about the alloted time for some sessions. Yes, you can force yourself to commit only 30 minutes to each. But at what cost in comprehension? More to the point, you presumably want to build on what you learn here. A shaky foundation may not help. So take your time.<br /><br />The book could be improved if the authors dispense with the artifice of the 15 hours total. Cute gimmick. But it wears thin, and can actually interfere with the book's efficacy.	2004-10-03

The reason is simple. Computer science deals mostly with discrete items. Whereas most of physics uses continuum methods. But Hartmann points out in his book that there are indeed several classes of algorithms from computing that might be of utility to some physicists.<br /><br />Percolation problems for example, are covered in a chapter. He shows how well known ideas from graph theory, like shortest path algorithms, can carry over usefully to attack thresholding in percolation clusters.<br /><br />One chapter, on Monte Carlo methods, should already be familiar to some physicists. Ideas like simulated annealing came from physics. Plus, the Metropolis-Monte Carlo method was thought up by the well known Los Alamos physicist Nick Metropolis.<br /><br />Hartmann does a commendable job in educating physicists about such ideas.	2004-10-03

Well, right under our noses, there is a surprising amount of structure in carbon's graphite form. This book goes into some detail about the different possible forms of carbon, and the band structure.<br /><br />Various chapters study mechanical and surface properties. Plus, you can learn about the amorphous and non-crystalline properties.<br /><br />What is not covered here are Buckyballs. C60. Discovered in soot several years ago. Some of you are possibly interested in that, more than graphite. You might have to turn to later books in this series.	2004-10-03

So don't be deterred by its bulk. Presumably, you have already programmed in Excel, as opposed to just being a user of it. But the first half of the book can be used as a refresher text. It exhaustively covers the span of Excel programming.<br /><br />As might be expected from a reference, the level of discussion can get somewhat involved. For example, consider the chapter on object oriented theory, as applied to VBA. It starts by explaining the differences between a class and an interface, and how both support polymorphism. And how \\"interface polymorphism is orthogonal to class polymorphism\\". Whew! The authors don't waste any time. You really need some prior exposure to object oriented ideas to fully appreciate the chapter.<br /><br />If you are an experienced Excel developer, the book may be an ideal reference. Otherwise, you may also need other explanatory texts to accompany this book.	2004-10-02

It has rapidly become perhaps the most popular IDE for Java programmers. Of course, being free didn't hurt the uptake.<br /><br />He assumes you have already programmed in Java itself. The book has three parts and an Appendix. The first part covers the basics. Essentially, it shows how to write and debug a standalone Java application in Eclipse. Competently done. But frankly, little to distinguish from other Eclipse texts. At this level, we are basically in an IDE equivalent to IBM's earlier Visual Age for Java, circa 2000. From which Eclipse is derived, by the way.<br /><br />The second and third parts of the book are far more interesting. Part two is all about using plug-ins to build up an application. Here is where Eclipse really shows its power. Also, the author describes how to make a Web Service using Eclipse. Web Services are a hot topic, and for those of you wanting to get into it, without giving up your familiar Eclipse environment, that chapter may justify the entire book.<br /><br />Finally, part 3 is about the basics of writing a plug-in. You can really dig deep into the Eclipse framework for this. It may be the most advanced part of the book.	2004-10-02

Its latest incarnation is described here. The authors show you how Microsoft has tweaked it into the .NET framework. The teaching pace is deliberately measured. For example, in a chapter on making menus, the steps are set up in considerable detail, with many screen captures. The authors take little for granted in your programming background.<br /><br />The size of the book partially reflects the many diagrams offered. Since these can be very useful and reassuring to a new programmer, it is a good thing that the authors are so liberal in furnishing them. But the size is also a measure of how far VB has come from its Basic roots. VB now has strong object oriented capabilities, and several chapters use this. More for you to learn, of course. But in the long run, it might help your coding habits.	2004-10-01

Lotus offers a cooperative environment, while WebSphere is excellent for running J2EE applications that are scalable and use transactions. The book goes into myriad details about this convergence.<br /><br />But there is one salient message. Lotus (and Domino) is moving towards WebSphere. The reason is that WebSphere is based upon the open standards of J2EE, and IBM strongly supports this. Whereas Lotus predates the Web, and is comprised mainly of proprietary standards. The book stresses that IBM is scarcely abandoning Lotus. The installed user base and third party applications built on top of it is too great for IBM to contemplate the revenue loss if it did so.<br /><br />Still, if you are a Lotus developer, this book is a harbinger. Collectively, Lotus developers are safe in the near term. But do you as an individual programmer want to get trapped in a stable or shrinking ghetto? Think this is unlikely? Then consider those people maintaining DEC's VMS machines. Now supported by HP. But VMS is an ever diminishing field.<br /><br />So the book can be valuable to Lotus developers. Somewhat of a tangent from the authors' intent, perhaps. Consider burnishing your skill set, and giving yourself some insurance, by learning Java and J2EE. Or even C# and .NET.	2004-10-01

He offers Velocity as a significant improvement over using JSPs to make dynamic web pages. By now, at least in the Java world, JSPs in combination with servlets, is the most common way to do this. Not the least because it gives a clear implementation of the MVC design pattern.<br /><br />But Harrop points out that JSPs always had an awkward syntax. Which for complex pages leads to miserable, error-prone coding. Plus, the pages might be slow to build. Velocity seems to offer a coding approach that is more natural than JSPs. And you certainly don't have to abandon MVC. Harrops shows how to reimplement MVC, while using Velocity and hooking to a database, and coupled to Struts and Spring.<br /><br />The code examples in the book are not complicated. That too is part of his message.<br /><br />You may want to look closer at the book.	2004-10-01

He cites the massive cost that companies already pay, in maintaining software. From annual licensing fees to the cost of sysadmins to manually install patches and upgrades. Chou points out, as have others, that the Total Cost of Ownership can be several multiples of an initial outlay.<br /><br />Therefore, his branch of Oracle advocates a utility-like approach. You buy capacity on an as-needed basis. There are possible trends, like an increased automation of patches and upgrades, that aid his case.<br /><br />Left unsaid in all this is how Oracle is playing catchup. For example, IBM has devoted massive resources in this field, under such names as Globus, utility, grid, autonomous and on-demand computing. This book is rather skimpy. Apart from general statements, I kept searching in it for more details. A far more substantial book is \\"On Demand Computing\\" by Fellenstein (IBM Press). You may want to check that book instead.	2004-09-30

Of course, the cost-free nature is its best selling point. With its rise, so too is the necessity for books like this.<br /><br />Its bulk should be reassuring. The MySQL company has put a lot of sweat into making the manual as extensive as possible. Not light reading. But the individual sections should be within your grasp, if you have some sysadmin experience. For example, the introductory sections that deal with installations are on a par of complexity comparable to installing GCC or Tomcat. Not a one click installation. Because MySQL offers a lot of configuration options, if you go with a source distribution.<br /><br />The toughest part may be later, when you have a populated database and you want to optimise it. Unsurprisingly, you will need good prior background in SQL. Take note that this book does not teach you SQL, per se. That is properly the remit of another text.<br /><br />By the way, the book mentions that (finally) stored procedures are implemented. In version 5. Other database vendors, like IBM and Oracle, have had this ability for years, and have hammered on MySQL for its lack. Here, the book could do with an expanded discussion of how to use these procedures. It just has a cursory note. Hopefully, the next edition will improve on this. Because stored procedures are an important performance optimiser in many large databases.	2004-09-30

Digital photography usage has increased amazingly, and traditional film is fading fast. Why? Well, this book offers some (actually many) reasons. It goes through what you should know about this new way.<br /><br />Of necessity, there are sections of the book common to both methods. A chapter on the principles of taking good photos, that could have been written a century ago. Some ideas in photography are timeless.<br /><br />But the bulk of the book deals with the unique aspects of digital  photography. Like different file formats. At least it is easy to convert between these. Plus, with digital, you now have a tradeoff between higher resolution and being able to store fewer photos as a consequence.<br /><br />A key chapter is devoted to camera phones. Ubiquitous cameras, that can easily transmit their messages wirelessly to anywhere in the world. Ultimately, this may be the most radical upheaval in the entire arena of photography. It means that in cities, from now on, there may often be someone watching and recording you. Even if this is not so, you should assume it. The changes in our expectations of privacy have only begun.	2004-09-30

Its massive and reliable coverage of what it takes to repair a PC, or upgrade various parts, continues in the tradition of its predecessors. The rate of change in this field is so great that new editions have to be continuously produced.<br /><br />To be sure, the average PC user does not want or need such a tome. But there is a sizeable minority of hobbyists to whom this book is directed. It was from such people that were the PC's first audience, in the late 70s. The book harks back to the PC's roots.<br /><br />Some chapters may see greater use than others. Like that on hard disks. Here is where your data lives, or dies! The chapter has a good explanation of the basic principles of disks. Newer parts, like memory sticks, get good coverage too. Also worth noting is that certain crucial external devices, like hubs and switches, are explained. This reflects the reality that these days, an isolated PC has much less utility than one hooked to the Internet.<br /><br />By comparison, the chapter on floppy disks is looking increasingly anachronistic. Its presence in future editions may be dubious.	2004-09-30

He offers 75 \\"items\\". (O'Reilly publisher would probably call these \\"hacks\\".) Unusually for a computer book these days, there does not appear to be a single diagram. Just pages of text, interspersed with an occasional code snippet. But not dry. He leavens it with a low key wit.<br /><br />A lot of items relate to having EJBs in your system, and the scalability and redundancy issues that arise when you want to improve one or both. Another topic given careful study is security. He shows the danger of blithely accepting client side input from an HTML form, without filtering it on the server side. This has to be done, even if you have written the equivalent filters for your client code. Because on the physical client machine, you must assume that all your client side tests can be circumvented. A simple example is given of how a cracker can try to break into your server's SQL database, by injecting SQL code into input text fields. In general, and not just for input from HTML forms, he suggests making a Java class, \\"TaintedString\\", that has filters which can validate a suspect input string. You might give this idea some consideration.<br /><br />In general, the book is at a level of complexity that may hit the right chords, if you are struggling with J2EE design issues.	2004-09-30

You need never have read about design patterns to appreciate this book. But chances are, you're already coding JSPs and Servlets. If so, you need a book like this. At the very least, a rough Model-View-Controller design will aid your coding.<br /><br />But Patzer also goes into more detailed patterns. Like a decorator filler and a front controller. But perhaps as important as any specific pattern is that you get some idea of what to look for as a pattern that might arise out of your work. The patterns in the book show you code reuse, at a higher level than literal reuse of a given body of source code. A very powerful idea for you to grasp.<br /><br />I reiterate. Understanding, using and looking for new patterns moves you into the realm of design. Increases your experience and your value. Design is higher margin work. Makes your skill sets more valuable.<br /><br />He also introduces you to the discipline of testing. Especially having a unit testing framework. And since this is java, you have JUnit to help you.	2004-09-29

Most likely, on a periodic basis. Plus, the report might be for a nontechnical audience. (Your boss?) So the book offers an efficient investment of your time. It shows straightforward ways to get at the data and how to present it.<br /><br />While the authors try to minimise it, there is still a modicum of coding. They provide example snippets in C# and VB.NET. If you're already familiar with either language, then there will be nothing complicated in the code for you.<br /><br />The book also demonstrates how Microsoft is migrating .NET into a seamless integration with its flagship database.<br /><br />The book is suitable for an intermediate level programmer in C# or VB.NET. It also helps to have some experience in the visuals of laying out a report. For example, an HTML UI or PowerPoint background would not be amiss.	2004-09-29

In his preface, he offers that shortly into Chapter 1, you will be writing your first program. Granted, it just prints something on the screen. But you get to do a full loop of writing, compiling and running. An approach I heartily concur with. It helps build up your confidence in yourself. By sticking to this method throughout the book, Overland keeps you motivated. No small thing, especially if you want to use this book outside a ickly get to showing you how to write complete programs, without having to know most of the C++ syntax. Indeed, classroom, where no one is telling you to keep going.<br /><br />Think of the book as offering a continual stream of deliverables to you.<br /><br />He steers away from advanced topics like templates and the Standard Template Library. These are vital. But later. Nor does he discuss \\"union\\". Not an advanced topic. But it tends to be so little used that he found he can reduce conceptual clutter by omitting it.	2004-09-28

The size of this book can be offputting. But the authors stress that the material is given at an easy enough pace for you to assimilate.<br /><br />The early chapters present a general discussion of the various web technologies and the directory structure of a Flash project. Basic but important stuff. Hopefully, you'll find the arrangement of directories and their files to be intuitive. Because when you get into heavy Flash usage, you'll inevitably need to access some of these files directly, outside the Flash development environment.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest emphasis in the book is on ActionScript 2. Conceptually, it's about the same level of programming complexity as JavaScript. This version is now a full object oriented language. Which should please those of you coming from C++, Java or C# backgrounds.<br /><br />One allure of the book is the material on video editing. In recent years, disks and memory have become cheap enough, and cpus  fast enough, to cause a flowering of such editing. Which has driven the development of the many editing capabilities in Flash.	2004-09-27

This book is basically a sequel to another recent text, \\"IBM WebSphere System Administration\\". Here, Barcia et al focus on the problems involved in deploying a WebSphere application. It may be heavily used, within a large company, say, or exposed to many queries from users coming from anywhere on the Internet. They point out that numerous books exist to aid developers of J2EE applications, but relatively few on how you would then deploy and continually administer those applications. Partly, this imbalance is due to the container-specific nature of the latter texts. As shown here. The book has a comprehensive discussion of how to manage a WebSphere. But relatively little carries over to running JBoss or Oracle's 10g server, for example.<br /><br />A useful feature of the book is how it can help a regular sysadmin make the transition to being a WebSphere sysadmin. A possible upward career move. The knowledge here is more specialised than that for running a generic AIX or linux cluster.  But there is enough overlap in some topics to make it a logical move. For example, the book talks about the WAS network deployment architecture. Essentially, it is for load balancing and redundancy. The natural purview of your sysadmin.<br /><br />Also, if you're not a sysadmin, but an IT manager facing WebSphere deployment issues, you may want to consider redeploying a sysadmin here. Show her this book and see if she's interested.	2004-09-27

Aimed at a mass audience, it is probably more crash resistant and easier to use than its predecessors.<br /><br />Its uses are probably innumerable, due to such a large user base. But the book tries to group the uses into various broad areas. Like printing documents or editing a document. You get a quick introduction to WordPad, for the latter usage. Simpson walks you through easy stuff like changing the font family, size and style. Deliberately, the editing program is WordPad, not Microsoft Word. Simpson shows enough to get you started, without overloading you with too many options. In fact, even in WordPad itself, I don't think he shows all its capabilities.<br /><br />These days, of course, a big reason for having a PC is to hook it to the Internet. Some would claim, and Microsoft fears precisely this, that the main value of a PC is for just this purpose. Anyway, Simpson devotes several chapters to your Internet interaction via XP. Like using the browser (IE of course) and sending and getting email.<br /><br />Lots more stuff is also discussed. Well explained, with a minimum of jargon.	2004-09-26

But to you, it is a programming environment in its own right, with a specialised UI. Viewed from this perspective, the book shows various new directions Excel has taken to increase its programmability.<br /><br />Perhaps the most intriguing is using it to access Web Services. There has been a huge buildup of Web Services Description Language, and a lot of speculation about what a successful Web Service would look like. Well, nothing yet has emerged as a killer app.<br /><br />But Webb shows how you can use Excel to dip your toes into this field. Specifically, he indicates how to hook it into the Web Services of Amazon and Google. And along the way, you get to pick up some XML. If you don't know XML, this in itself is a good way to motivate learning it.<br /><br />The utility of the example Web Services is that they can take some of the mystique and abstractness out of the subject, provided you spend the time to understand them. Simply as pedagogy, you can then assess future discussions on Web Services in a more experienced light. Separate from, and independent of, whether you'd ever want to use Excel to interact with future Web Services.<br /><br />Of course, the book describes other topics. And you may well have no interest in Web Services. But to me, this forward looking aspect is the best part of the book.	2004-09-26

O'Reilly has a series of Hacks books, with 100 tips in each. Is that why we have this book, with 501 web \\"secrets\\"? One upsmanship?<br /><br />Firstly, the secrets in the title is hype. None of the tips can really be called a secret. While Miller does admit this in his Introduction, it is irritating to see each tip labelled as a secret, throughout the book.<br /><br />But let's leave this aside and look at the tips. Many are really obvious. Like tip 224 - \\"Fine tune your search with AltaVista's advanced Web Search page\\". People, the Altavista home page has an 'advanced' link right there. Or look at tip 27 - \\"Use Yahoo to get the latest news, weather and sports\\". Again, these links are right there on the Yahoo home page. Plus, the headlines of recent new articles are also shown on the page, as an inducement for readers to clickthrough.<br /><br />These 501 tips are quantity stressed over quality. Many are stunningly obvious, like those above. And if we say \\"secrets\\", then they become inane. A far better approach would have been to reduce the number of tips, and give more detail on some truly innovative and nonobvious usages of the major websites. It would have required far more work and originality than evidenced here.	2004-09-25

But lately, they've produced a series of Head First books that take a deliberately light hearted look at programming. The most recent is this text, on Java Servlets and JSPs.<br /><br />There is certainly no shortage of texts on this subject, including from O'Reilly itself. But this book makes generous use of cartoons and other diagrams. The authors go carefully and at a slow pace. Experienced programmers should NOT use this book. Let me say it plainly. But the book wasn't written for them, anyway. Heck, the authors present it at a level suitable for a curious high schooler. Which is no bad thing. Computing should have no age limits. It democratises access to the concepts of servlets and JSPs.<br /><br />The extensive lists of questions throughout the book are also an attraction. If you're studying for the Sun Exam and need a refresher on this material, consider getting the book just for its questions. Use it for a trial run at the main Exam.	2004-09-24

Then, in just the last year, cell phones have started to be commonly equipped with cameras, giving rise to the phenomenon of camera phones.<br /><br />Aitken gives us many ideas about their usage. Still a feeling of novelty. Just as cell phones did in the mid 90s. The book has the expected tips for actual optimal photo taking. Experienced photographers may well wince at the current limitations, like no zoom lens, or low resolution.<br /><br />All of these are valid critiques of camera phones. Yet, as the book shows, the sheer utility of a camera phone outweighs all these. Like the fact that the device is primarily for communication, so the camera is in some sense a bonus, without you have to lug around an extra device. Then, the all-digital aspect of the images is far more convenient than traditional wet film. Instant feedback. So you can make your own blog or website with photos you took. The book goes into extensive detail on these ideas.<br /><br />A nice, cutting edge aura.	2004-09-24

Which may add to the need for this book.<br /><br />A quick pocket reference that is competently done. Lets you easily thumb through and get what you need.

The key changes in 8.13 revolve around this topic. A tribute to the scourge that spam has become.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest change has been the enhancements to Milter, which allows filter plugins that are written by third parties (you?), often in C.

That is, if you plan on adding more pages or perhaps you want to maintain the website hosting these pages? The book talks about how to handle this next level of complexity. The author does not bog you down in the fine details of HTML syntax. Instead, she gives many suggestions [\\"secrets\\"] on making a logical arrangement of content. Like giving simple, intuitive names to the directory hierarchy and files. So that users can traverse your website easily.<br /><br />Typically, most of the suggestions are of this style. The payoff is often easier long term maintenance. Like her ideas on effectively using CSS and XHTML. Again, like with HTML itself, you need some minimal prior acquaintance with these packages, to take advantage of this book.	2004-09-23

Necessarily, they use technical jargon. But the level of discussion does not assume any previous technical background on your part.<br /><br />Also, several chapters are devoted to the vital subject of how to hook your PC into a network, via wired or wireless means. In either case, hubs and switches are explained. While these are not part of a PC, nowadays, a lot of the value of a PC is when it is connected to the Internet.<br /><br />Note that \\"Repair\\" in the title is really a misnomer. An important point made by the authors. If a part of a PC breaks, it is rarely repaired. The complexity is often beyond most customer's ability to do so, or that of a local computer shop, for that matter. Plus, the low price of the part often does not make it economic anyway.	2004-09-23

As much as he can, he strives to cover societies across the globe; avoiding a Eurocentric or Judeo-Christian bias.<br /><br />There is a nice comparison of gender roles in the beliefs of many religions in the Middle East, Europe, India and China. He also discusses the roles available to women in some of those societies. Like the upper class women in Classical Greece, and how they are presumed to have ignored their husbands taking male lovers or hataerai courtesans.<br /><br />The problem with so many of these societies is the paucity of surviving views written by women themselves, concerning their circumstances. Going through this book can be frustrating because of this dearth, which persists till modern times.<br /><br />Scholars of gender studies will see little radical or controversial here. But Stikker's book is useful to a new student in this field.	2004-09-23

One huge area of this usage has been the home, and Plumley devotes her book to aiding you. Unlike an office environment, you have no IT staff to delegate the gruntwork to. Just you. And her.<br /><br />So she carefully goes over enough technical detail to be intelligible and useful to you. Covering the latest Microsoft operating systems, with accompanying details on the Macintosh and linux. As an aside, the fact that she chose to include linux in a book like this speaks eloquently to its rise in a mass consumer market; no longer confined to server side applications.<br /><br />On your network, she gives extensive information about having a wired or wireless setup. The pros and cons of both. Like a wired net being more secure against evesdropping, and usually having higher bandwidth. But being much more labour intensive to install, and often greater capital costs, compared to having just some WiFi hub. Certainly though, WiFi has been and is one of the bright spots in hi-tech right now, and Plumley walks you through its acronym-filled thicket.<br /><br />She also does not ignore various other devices that can live on your net. Like a PDA or Xbox. Here is a chance for you to test for yourself some of the fabled convergence of computing and entertainment, about which so much has been postulated and invested by others.	2004-09-23

Strictly, UML is independent of any environment or operating system or language. Those are implementation level details. But here, Shoemaker brings .NET into his UML discourse to show how UML can be well integrated with a .NET development process. And indeed, that is part of the book's value.<br /><br />Having said this, most of the book can be read, ignoring .NET. So those of you into C++ or Java can still gain from the book. He gives lengthy, detailed explanations of defining and refining requirements. And then mapping these to components and interfaces and using these results to design architecture and components. Not a book for the impatient. Shoemaker takes time to carefully expound on the basic ideas. If you're new to UML, a deliberate slow reading might be best, to gain the most from what he is saying.<br /><br />Another virtue of the book is that apart from the .NET details, it can be used years from now. (Barring any major advances in our understanding of the design process.) It is not one of those computer books that you have to replace in 2 or 3 years time.	2004-09-23

It would not go nicely for you to drop this 1633 page tome on your feet!<br /><br />The book is aimed squarely at a traditional electrical engineering hardware person. Who hopefully already has extensive experience in designing a chipset or motherboard around a microprocessor. Where, needless to say, it would be even more advantageous if that cpu was an earlier Pentium or x86.<br /><br />A lot of familiar type material here. The details are specific to this latest cpu, of course. But you should been well conversant with state transition diagrams for various pins on a chip, as functions of input signals on other pins. The book also has many details like setup and hold time requirements for how long a signal must be stable at a pin, relative to some other parameter, like the edge of a clock cycle. These ideas have been around for decades. So it is nice that what you might have learnt in the 70s and 80s are still applicable here, albeit at much higher clock speeds.<br /><br />The book is a reference manual, in case you haven't figured that out already. I cannot imagine someone reading this cover to cover. It also shows that the company, Mindshare, that authored the book (and similar others), has chosen to reside in a very specialised niche. Where the sheer complexity may deter competition.	2004-09-23

Male scientists from that century are often forgotten today, unless they really were the giants in their fields. So it is that much harder for any females to be remembered now.<br /><br />The book restricts itself to Britain and the US. Because despite the well described discrimination against the women in the book, those countries were the most receptive to female researchers. A telling commentary of the social mores of that time, even amongst the most educated and supposedly least prejudiced males - the faculty of the universities.<br /><br />Creese must have spent years delving into musty boxes of records.

Professional chemists should seriously consider updating to this edition, if they found the previous one useful. Many sections have substantial additions, as you'd expect in any science over such a time.<br /><br />But the authors have also added entire new sections. On lab safety. Perhaps they'd earlier assumed that this was outside the book's scope? Other new material covers electrophoresis and electroanalysis. These fields have seen significant work in the past decade.

This dictionary claims to be the first to cover both maths and computer science. You might think that for the latter, it is surely outdated. Come on, written in 1995, with the 1999 edition just being a reprint. Haven't the authors heard of Moore's Law?<br /><br />Well, they have. And this book is still fresh and mostly relevant. The computing section of the book concentrates on the  basic principles and algorithms of computing. The von Neumann architecture. Turing test. Sorting methods like heap sort and quicksort. And so on. The book does not really deal with the latest operating systems or commercial software packages or freeware.<br /><br />It's really aimed at the researcher who is studying the basic unpinnings of computing. The major ideas that span operating systems and applications. Now in this regard, it could do with some updating. Namely in the field of cryptography. The Advanced Encryption Standard and other crypto methods did not exist at the book's writing. There has indeed been progress in this field.	2004-09-21

His contributions are probably equally well remembered by physicists and chemists, especially in the field of spectroscopy, where he published a seminal text on using the theory of discrete groups to analyse data.<br /><br />But this book of his recollections is not about his scientific papers, per se. Rather, the most interesting sections to many readers will be the times that he lived through, and the other major figures that he knew, like Dirac and Einstein. The book goes through the turbulent and terrible years of the 1930s and 40s. Thus, you can see the development of quantum mechanics and his involvement in it during the 30s. At a time when the key ideas in this subject were rapidly discovered. Then see the development of nuclear fission and the Manhattan Project through his eyes, at the University of Chicago campus during World War 2.<br /><br />An excellent book for a general audience.	2004-09-21

Certainly, overall they describe the onward march of science, enabled greatly by the instruments that are the true heroes of the chapters. And they are quite well researched and written.

Because calculus is a dividing line. Once you have this as a tool, the physical sciences and engineering become quantitative subjects. Calculus leads to a fundamental change in a worldview. Thus, the subjects of this book, who predate calculus, were by our standards, working virtually blind. Yet, Applebaum shows that they were able to gain insights into nature, and move on.

Here, we are looking at ASP.NET. Probably still relatively new to a lot of you, which may explain why you are considering this book. Undoubtedly, you've heard of, and maybe tried using, the official texts put out by Microsoft Press. By definition, those are authoritative. But the sheer verbosity, while probably necessary in order to teach you the subject, can be offputting.<br /><br />Suppose, though, you know the rudiments. Maybe via those books. You are now working on a problem and face well defined smaller problems within it. The remit of this book. It does not try to teach you ASP.NET as a pedagogic whole. Rather, each chapter is offered largely independent of its predecessors. And within a chapter, the various hacks are logically related but can often be understood by themselves.<br /><br />Care has gone into the descriptions of hacks in the Contents pages. So, for example, we have \\"Creating a Web Service\\" and \\"Caching Pages\\". Concise but detailed enough to direct you to the  material.<br /><br />The bulk of the book is also in its favour. Due in large part to extensive code listings that often accompany the hacks. Remember, you can easily get to and read only what you need. The code may turn out to be a huge timesaver.	2004-09-20

Not unlike compilers. Actually Nolan shows us that the 2 are very similar in their lexical methods.<br /><br />In the specific case of Java, this book may well cause unease in the reader, if you program in Java and are worried about protecting your source code. After all, it probably has proprietary methods that are not covered by any patents you might have. While you can copyright the source, Nolan points out that this may not stop someone from decompiling and reimplementing your \\"secret\\" methods.<br /><br />The book shows that the big problem with Java bytecode is that decompilers for it have a far easier time than decompilers for actual assembly code, whatever the specific hardware for the latter. The basic reason is that the bytecode retains extra information that a decompiler can use, whereas assembly does not have this. Like the fact that the bytecode separates data from instructions. A vital simplification to a decompiler.<br /><br />Nolan shows countermeasures. At the source code level, there are several good obfuscation techniques, described well enough for you to try. And these may be better than buying a commercial decompiler.<br /><br />Also, Nolan suggests fully compiling your Java into specific assembly binaries. One for each combination of microprocessor and operating system that you need to support. More work. But it makes a decompilation far harder. Besides, these days, you may only have to support a few combinations. The hardware may be a Pentium or a Sparc or an IBM cpu. If a Pentium, then you might only support a recent linux or Microsoft OS on top of it. If a Sparc, then you need only support a recent Solaris. While for an IBM cpu, the only choice is AIX or Apple's OS.	2004-09-18

The topic of iptables is intimately related to guarding a network against intruders. A sysadmin task. Plus, the compact, pocketbook size lends itself to a common scenario.<br /><br />You're a harried sysadmin in the machine room of your company, surrounded by racks of computers and cabling. Equipment everywhere and little room for you to prop up a regular sized text on intrusion detection. Quite possibly, the master console is some cheezy old monitor that you got stuck with. Or even worse, it is just a terminal. If the latter, it's really awkward to do a man on iptables and also run it, especially if you're in real time mode against an active intruder.

The speed of a multigigahertz cpu, plus vast memory and disk space gives you a huge drawing board. Also, since games are a mass market, then you want to code for Microsoft PCs.<br /><br />In response, the authors show how Microsoft's .NET environment and C# programming within it can be used to make viable games. They start by conceding that the fastest twitch games, like Half Life 2 or Doom 3, can't really be effectively coded using the book's Direct X methods. But they point out that C# is certainly adequate for other types of games.<br /><br />The book walks you through very basic game algorithms. If you've programmed games before, many of these ideas will be familiar. Like the fundamentals of detection of collisions between 2 objects on the screen.<br /><br />Naturally, since visuals are crucial, space is devoted to constructing 3D objects and rendering them with various textures. Frankly, for the pure graphics, the book only touches on the algorithms. You will need another text devoted to the latter. But within the space constraints of this book, there is an admirable job of conveying how to write games in C#.	2004-09-17

But it is in a context where they are now laymen.<br /><br />The author gives a careful exposition of the many legal niceties surrounding open source licensing. He tries to convey nuances that are implied by the generous amounts of boilerplate quoted from common licensing schemes like GPL. Frankly, you may have to force yourself to concentrate and plow through the text. Unless your expertise is patent and copyright law, the book is not the easiest reading. No fault of the author.

It adds heavily to the printing cost. And most computer ideas, sans graphics, can be perfectly well accompanied by greyscale images, of screen captures, say.<br /><br />So imagine my surprise when I found that this book has gorgeous colour photos. Of the innards of computers, often showing, and this is important, a person's hands adjusting or otherwise manipulating some portion of the hardware. Makes for a compelling and easy to follow user's manual. Directed at the tinkerer. Perhaps you want to save money by constructing your own PC. Or perhaps you just like to soup up a generic PC?<br /><br />You have probably suffered through trying to decipher assembly instructions on some hobbyist kits, where the text is often on small pamphlets, with black and white schematics that are maddeningly obtuse.

That is a basic counterpoint to this book. Offshoring is happening because those companies practising it can often charge lower prices for their goods or services. To the benefit of their customers. If you are in IT, which is a reasonable guess, because you are considering this book, then you certainly have heard of Moore's Law. Plus there has been an accompanying vast fall in the cost of bandwidth, during the last 20 years. You have probably benefited from both trends. If you've bought any computer equipment, then you have certainly done so. Yes, it has been rough on some hardware vendors, who have gone out of business. But overall, it has greatly expanded the market for both computer hardware and software, and thusly the market for your services.<br /><br />If you have no complaints about benefiting from cheaper hardware, why should you complain if your software position is under threat from cheaper programmers offshore? Blunden supplies many tables and numbers in his book, to buttress his viewpoints. He talks about the greed of corporations who do offshoring. But he never posits why offshoring is happening now? Why not 10 or 20 years ago? It's certainly not because CEOs then were less greedy. But it's because the underlying hardware and bandwidth improvements have reached a tipping point, whereby it is now economically advantageous for offshoring of services.<br /><br />He does point out that some manufacturing has moved overseas. But in IT, this offshoring has been happening since the early 90s. When fabrication of commodity chips and motherboards started migrating. Yes, some US hardware engineers then lost their jobs. Do you lament for them? That migration helped Dell and others offer ever-cheaper computers.<br /><br />Blunden is a smart bloke, and he is surely well aware of all this. But even if you agree with his book, you should note that it ends weakly, with very tepid suggestions on how to reverse offshoring. The fundamental reason is that Moore's Law and the falling of bandwidth costs are still proceeding unabated. Technological innovations are still happening. In other words, services offshoring has barely begun.<br /><br />Don't fall into the trap of thinking that offshoring is going away. That would be like an accountant circa 1980, when the first spreadsheets appeared on PCs, dismissing it as a fad. Whereas he would compute his spreadsheets manually, using only a calculator. In such a situation, it was the marginal cost of his labour, against the marginal cost of running a software spreadsheet, which even then was close to zero. (Once you bought the PC and software.)<br /><br />This book is instructive. Ten or 20 years from now, it will capture perfectly a common if misguided attitude of our time. It will be worth studying then, in a course on history or economics. You don't think so? Then try searching for books on the awesome Japanese juggernaut, and how their economic model was going to overtake the inferior American economy. There were a spate of such books in the late 80s. You can't find these in bookstores now. Out of print and discredited. So too will be the fate of this book.fshoring.

Ranking with Amazon, eBay and Yahoo. So much so that eBay bought Paypal in its entirety a few years ago.<br /><br />Since then, as the authors show in several hacks, Paypal is now deeply embedded into eBay as a very convenient payment scheme. A few hacks show how to use Paypal from the standpoint of a single user.<br /><br />But a broader lesson of this book is that the integration of Paypal into eBay is by no means exclusive. If you maintain your own website and want to sell items on it, that have absolutely nothing to do with auctions, then many hacks discuss how to use Paypal to facilitate this. Including integrating third party shopping carts with it. Indeed, there is an entire chapter devoted to these tasks.<br /><br />Also, the authors describe how even if you are competing in the online auction space with eBay, you can still use Paypal. It appears that eBay is going to careful lengths to have Paypal treat its merchants equally. Certainly, the authors point out that Paypal is used with eBay's main competitors' auctions, like uBid, Yahoo and Amazon.

If you're in IT and have chortled knowingly at Dilbert, then Blunden might take you to the next level of cynicism. He describes his travails in his first real programming job.<br /><br />During the ascent of the dot coms, he ended up at Lawson, a mid ranking purveyor of business tools and technology consulting. He found himself in the tool making part of the company. A very disillusioning foray into coporate computing. Months of intense effort on his part, but no deliverable at the end. Apparently, this was scarcely unique in the firm. He describes others having spent years there, just performing office politics and backstabbing, as opposed to producing a tangible product, to actually benefit the company and its shareholders and customers.<br /><br />Perhaps the funniest passage is his Y2K experience. He wonders aloud if Mr Y2K, Ed Yourdon, was peddling moonshine and hysteria. Many of us might agree.<br /><br />Be warned that Blunden is a Reverend in the notorious subversive organisation called the Church of the SubGenius.

At least, that is the ideal!<br /><br />You will be greatly eased in understanding what is offered if you have already written Java Servlets and JSPs. The Portal API and its recommended usage were deliberately written to mimic those, as much as possible. There is really nothing difficult here.<br /><br />Plus, put simply, if you can understand Servlets and JSPs, it strongly behooves you to upgrade your skill set and learn about portals. You have to keep moving forward. If only because there are programmers in India (and elsewhere) actively commoditising your current skill set. Just a few steps behind you. So perhaps try this book and keep going.	2004-09-15

Indeed, you are probably reading this using such a program. The language of the pages is HTML. But for people who maintain a large set of pages, or an entire website, Cascading Style Sheets has proved to be a very handy way to maintain a uniform style across the pages. And JavaScript is the most common scripting language across different browsers.<br /><br />This triad of (HTML,CSS,JavaScript) essentially covers the entirety of client side browsing. That is the appeal of this book. The authors reasonably guessed that you might find it useful to have one text encompassing all three. They offer a short first part with the rudiments of how these languages work. But over 90% of the book is pure reference. With the added bonus that the material for a given language cross references relevant items in another language. With 3 different books, you don't get this synergy.<br /><br />What surprised me was the sheer length of the book. Remember when HTML was a slim little standard? Since their inceptions, each language became very popular and was heavily added to. Lots of little options. Often obscure even to regular programmers in those languages. But it is all here.	2004-09-13

Considered purely as a novel, possibly in the thriller genre, it is poorly done. The characterisation is pathetic. Just cardboard. The dialog is utterly repetitive. The two secondary heroes are just sounding boards to the main character. Sherlock Holmes' Watson was hollow, but still light years ahead of these secondary characters.<br /><br />Then there is the plot itself. All too reminiscent of the Y2K scare. Remember that? Planes falling out of the sky. Pacemakers freezing up. Utility companies' generators stopping. Just like Ed Yourdon and others peddled Y2K in the late 90s, this book has the same feel. Hysteria combined with an opportunistic grab at the topical problem of terrorism.<br /><br />Purely as a $8 paperback novel, it is lacking. But as a $35 book?? Strewth.	2004-09-11

The first is to learn computer graphics [of course]. To this ends, the authors give an excellent hands on discourse. They go through all the major ideas in this introductory course. Like the basic two dimensional drawing algorithms - Bresenham's, filling methods etc. Then they take you into a three dimensional world that you can create. Ultimately, this is where most of you will end up. Today's computers and graphical techniques are so powerful that you can make intricate objects in 3d. Then learn various non-trivial methods to take a plane projection, which is your image.<br /><br />The authors also cover groovy ideas like using fractals and self-similarity to make random landscapes. This will attract some of you.<br /><br />All the above is done with the aid of the OpenGL library. So you don't need to hardcode low level routines. OpenGL lets you concentrate on applying the book's algorithms for higher level purposes.<br /><br />But there is another use of the book. If you're already up to speed on graphics algorithms and want to learn OpenGL, then here is a nice user's manual.<br /><br />For either purpose, you may baulk at the text's length. But it can't be helped. The subject warrants the level of detail given here. No shortcuts to a good understanding.	2004-09-10

Lee shows how you can quickly and easily grasp the basic syntax and begin programming usefully in it. He stresses in his presentation that no prior knowledge of Perl is needed. Strictly, not even of another programming language. If this describes you, his book should be quite understandable, given just a modicum of maths background.<br /><br />But having said that, if you've written in any other programming language, then you'll breeze through a lot of the texr. It's just a question of picking up Perl's syntax.<br /><br />Where things might get slightly hairy are when references are discussed. Like in C or C++, some beginners find this awkward. It's been mentioned by others that in general, in computing, one of the dividing lines in understanding is the topic of references (and pointers). It doesn't seem to be a strong function of how well an author explains it, but more of the student's intrinsic aptitude for the field.<br /><br />Hopefully, you will find Lee's explanations lucid.	2004-09-09

It builds upon earlier discussions on grid and autonomic computing. Fellenstein shows how those ideas can be extended into a more complex realm, that IBM calls On Demand Computing. While the term is simple, he goes to some lengths to show that this is not something as mundane as the common idea of utility services. Unfortunately, that may be the typical reaction to the term, so he has to do this.<br /><br />If you go thru this book and see the meat of the discussion, you'll realise that it includes complicated technologies that are  barely built. Like the autonomic approach, which borrows metaphors from biological systems, like monitoring and prevention.<br /><br />But even beyond these are what the author calls ecosystem dynamics. A system of disparate hardware and software interacting across a network, wired or wireless or, probably most commonly, using both modes. Somehow, this system has intelligence at its nodes, to ask for or supply computing resources.<br /><br />Even IBM can't do it all. This approach also has the merit to IBM of shifting it from supplying hardware or operating systems, both of which may be moving to commodity status.<br /><br />Having said this, the book could have well been trimmed in its earlier chapters. A fair amount of repetitive material.	2004-09-09

At first, IRC was mostly for bulletin board users. But as the Web took off, it also greatly expanded the pool of users and the extent of the Internet's physical reach. Now Mutton shows how today's IRC has so much more than that 1988 version. Being able to format messages, or colour them. Hey, you can even send and get sounds, in various common sound formats like wav files.<br /><br />Numerous of his hacks revolve around managing an IRC channel. Problems of success, really. As IRC usage soared, what were once small communities of shared interests and values now often have to contend with others with different values. Channel operators may want to check out what Mutton offers.<br /><br />Perhaps the most intriguing hack concerns finding social networks from many channels. Neat possibilities. Social networks are quite hot these days, though no one has yet found a viable business model centred on them.	2004-09-08

The latest version of Blender. Free source code that has this voluminous guide. The book offers a laundry list of major capabilities - modelling, animation, rendering, post production and even an interactive real time ability. The latter being best suited for game developers. And Blender runs on most Microsoft and unix/linux platforms.<br /><br />Blender incorporates what were once cutting edge research ideas, like radiosity. I remember a Siggraph in the late 80s, where papers and images were first shown using it. Damn exciting then! Now, you get it trivially here. Right out of the box.<br /><br />The book has chapters contributed from all over the world. Some sections were written with English that's a little clumsy. But allow for this. The authors' first languages were not English. The book does show how a Blender community has thrived, with a global scope. Not a trivial consideration, if you're considering adopting Blender. It means there is support for your questions, so your investment in time won't get stranded.<br /><br />Take a look at the full colour glossies in the book. Lovely images from Blender experts. Something to inspire you. Realistically, if you are new, your efforts won't yield such beauties. But it is great motivation.	2004-09-03

He realises that some people need to start from the very basics of shooting video. The intricacies of iMovie4 are moot if you can't get enough interesting raw material. So if you're new to this, or need some refreshere of the rudiments, then pay careful attention to these early chapters.<br /><br />Of course, most of the book deals with iMovie4, with a section on iDVD. What is impressive is how Apple has produced an integrated portfolio of products. The book shows how iMovie4 and iDVD can work with each other. But also with iTunes and IPhoto. (BTW, Pogue also wrote a related book on iTunes.) The effect is akin to Microsoft's Office suite.<br /><br />But focusing on just iMovie4, an overall impression is that Apple has really had time to refine it. Pogue gives lots of little nifty techniques, each of which must have been nontrivial to program.<br /><br />A question is raised by what the book says Apple calls the Ken Burns effect. That of steady panning across a still photo. While Burns is justly famous for his Civil War series [and others] that used this technique, it was done recently, in the 1980s. Surely there must have been some earlier director associated with this? Did Apple unfairly overlook that person?	2004-09-02

Acting as an adjunct to an impressive and intensive education system.<br /><br />To non-Japanese who do not speak the language, it can be difficult to understand and appreciate the extensive and indeed pervasive nature of libraries throughout their society. Welch does us the favour of illuminating this. He gives a comprehensive description of the different types of libraries, at various educational levels and regions. He also puts this in the context of the traditions of pre-Meiji Japan.<br /><br />A very coherent presentation.	2004-09-02

Its premise is that you already have a basic understanding of CSS and of the rudiments of JavaScript. But given that, Schmitt offers a handy grab bag of time saving hacks, that others have found useful when struggling with CSS.<br /><br />Some of the problems and solutions do seem really basic. Like the very first one, about setting the typeface of some text in a page. You'd expect any book teaching CSS to cover this, or, if not, that a user who read that book could quickly find this solution. A few other problems are like this.<br /><br />But the majority of problems presented here are not so trivial. That, combined with a succinct set of one liners that describe each problem in the contents, should give the book some appeal to you.	2004-09-02

Mainly, to print files in this format. But Steward shows an entire neat little world of functionality hidden in PDF. While it may not have the obvious simplicity of HTML, the book shows many ways to make and edit such files.<br /><br />For example, Steward shows how to have URLs link to specific points inside a PDF document. So if you are maintaining a website that has PDFs, you can do far better than most, by having links not just to the entire documents, but to pertinant locations within. A competitive advantage. The great majority of PDFs accessible on the web require you to view the entire document, for find what you're looking for. You should do better.<br /><br />Steward also shows a logical inverse. How to embed standard URLs inside a PDF. Knowing both capabilities means a fuller integration of PDFs inside your website.<br /><br />It also turns out that much of what the book discusses can be done with free editing tools, at least on linux/unix machines.<br /><br />Good book for demystifying PDF.	2004-08-31

More broadly, this book works well as a practical explanation of the general field of Intrusion Detection Systems. Key affiliated tools are covered, like tcpdump and Ethereal. Which are also free and open source, just like Snort. There is a general and I think understandable bias in this book towards such tools. The authors claim, and you must have heard this before, that such tools are often more likely to be bug free and mature than proprietary tools.<br /><br />If you work your way through the chapters, then you can get a good education in the main ideas like setting up prevention strategies and how to look for evidence of attacks. Instantiated via using Snort. But if you're smart, you can generalise this. Plus, keep an eye out for any useful techniques that Snort currently lacks. If you find these, perhaps you can build a high value tool off them? Don't take Snort as the last word in these matters.	2004-08-31

He died in 1771 and his writings have languished consistently since then. Though when he lived, he was fairly well known amongst educated Britons.<br /><br />Rosseau gives us a series of essays on Smollett that compare him favourably to his contemporaries like Defoe, Stevenson and Fielding.

In an earlier era, steel making was a key strategic industry for the US. Marcus takes us back to 1952 and the tensions of that era. With World War 2 still recently over and the Korean conflict starting up, the international situation looked grave. She walks us through the events that led Truman to take over the steel mills. She marshalls the arguments pro and con for this, that echoed through the nation.<br /><br />A very readable study in the limitations of presidential power. Plus a current reader might be struck by the parallels between Truman's actions and Bush's recent decisions. Both presidents asserted prerogatives that were strenuously opposed by others. Though in retrospect, the Cold War and the then developing Korean War were far deadlier for the US than the current situation, where the US has a unipolar hyperpower advantage.	2004-08-30

It grew partly due to dissension about the Vietnam War. It had a political and economic yearning for a system different from what existed in the US at that time. And yet they had few illusions about Soviet communism. The book has many noted authors, like Tobin and Samuelson, analysing the movement.<br /><br />They critique the economic views. Interestingly, they explore how the New Left differed from doctrinaire Marxists. The New Left had preludes of the Third Way that was briefly proposed after 1990 and the fall of European communism.<br /><br />Relatively little economics jargon here. If you have no formal background in economics, you should still be able to follow the discussion.	2004-08-29

Driven by the prime example of the widespread adoption of linux by companies like IBM and HP, who merged their unix variants into it.<br /><br />What Golden tries to do is show how an IT project can harness the power of open source for a commercial project. He directs the book at a sceptical IT manager who has hitherto dealt only with traditional projects. Golden explains various distinguishing traits of open source - most notably that you can build a developer community of volunteers, that is not restricted to your employee base. He suggests that properly used, open source can lead to more robust code, with quicker bug fixing cycles and perhaps, eventually, to a competitive edge.<br /><br />There is a nice case study of JBoss, which makes an eponymous web container for J2EE applications. If you are using or contemplating using it, check out the chapter on it. He gives you an independent assessment of that organisation and its software.	2004-08-29

O'Reilly has put out a series of these, each detailing 100 hacks. Now from Wiley, Sinchak talks about Microsoft Windows XP and provides us with over 200 hacks.<br /><br />A lot of hacks centre around customising various aspects of the UI. Not surprising. Appeals to those who like to fully explore what XP can do for you, going beyond the standard setup seen by the masses. Of necessity, Microsoft has to make the default setup somewhat of a least common denominator. That is the default UI was probably chosen after a lot of usability studies of what the typical user demands might be.<br /><br />But maybe you have special needs?<br /><br />Other parts of the book let you soup up system performance and beef up its security. (For the latter, especially defending against viruses and spyware.) I don't gainsay this utility. But a nagging feeling says that most of you will end up concentrating on tweaking the UI. Hours of fun.	2004-08-28

Many programmers have learnt the intricacies of coding, but while Java is great for quick manual building, there is still a lot of boilerplate. Many widgets have a lot of properties. And you need to write out a bunch of callbacks and keep track somehow of the overall structure.<br /><br />Creator lets you do a lot of design easily. Its DND pushes a lot of details into the background. But the UI gives you quick visual access to reading and changing these details.<br /><br />More importantly, the authors show how Creator is far more than a GUI builder. Many server side applications involve JSPs, Java Beans and hooking up the UI to this back end logic. From the book's starting walkthrough of Creator, it describes a full integration. It has visual tools that show the logic layout as clearly as the UI layout. For example, if you use JSPs, you typically have these interacting with each other in some logic flow that is triggered by user actions. Creator has a Navigation editor that shows visually how these JSPs interconnect. Nothing you could not previously do with pen and paper. But that is the point. Relieves you of that burden. Plus now this Navigation information can be summoned from your application at any time, and always remains consistent with it. Hitherto, you would have to maintain a set of hardcopy diagrams, which are physically separate from the source code.<br /><br />Pity Sun didn't produce Creator several years ago.	2004-08-28

Instead of just considering Google, she shows you what other data resources for searching exist on the Web. Because there is a problem. The current dominant position of Google in search may lead too many people to unnecessarily confine their searching to it. Even if they know of other search engines, like Yahoo or Altavista.<br /><br />While Google may like this, you could benefit from knowing and using other resources. Plus, many newcomers to the Web who only use Google may not even be aware of language translating via Altavista's Babelfish, for example. Or that Corbis and Getty Images have a vast collection of searchable images. While Google does let you search images across the entire Web, this breadth comes at a price. Limited information about each image. Whereas Corbis and Getty have catalogued collections, permitting more detailed searching.<br /><br />Anyway, the entire book is like this. Think of it as a necessary antidote to Google.	2004-08-28

But to the chagrin of many users, it is certainly not bug free. In response, Randall offers you many ways to improve the security and user experience.<br /><br />Of course, he assumes that you are already fairly familiar with your machine. This book is not meant for the total novice. But going through it can turn you into a power user. He starts by showing how to better control the user interface. There are things you can do with the control panel that are neat and often ignored in simpler texts.<br /><br />Actually, most if not all of the book can also be used by a system administrator. Very useful in answering those tricky questions from inquisitive users that want to push the envelope of the machine. The book helps you stay ahead of them.	2004-08-27

The preface and last chapter are by far the best parts. Noted technology commentator Richard Thieme (\\"Islands in the Clickstream\\") gives the preface. A mere 4 pages. But very eloquent and lucid. A joy to read. The last chapter is a semi-ficticious narrative of how a hacker breaks into various computers. Unix and network experts will like the depth and ingenuity described. It can be very educational, even for experienced sysadmins.<br /><br />But other chapters are poorly done. For example, Chapter 2 is on Theoretical Characterisation Metrics. It repeatedly uses various conditional probabilities, but with a wrong notation. For a probability of B given A, it uses p(B)/A. The standard notation is P(B|A). Used for decades in statistics course. First year undergraduate level.<br /><br />Other chapters, presumably written by different people, do use the correct notation. But Chapter 3, on the Cyber Food Chain, has an even more disturbing flaw. It has tables of what it calls mean inhibitor values. Derived from sets of values with only 1 significant figure. But the means are given to 4 significant figures! At best, the means only have 2. What this author is doing is imputing a false accuracy of 2 extra significant figures, or 100 times greater than actuality. More strictly, it is probably close to 1000 times greater, because the mean is really no better than one significant figure.<br /><br />So what? Well, given that the authors goof on such elementary steps, it should give you serious reservations about their more \\"sophisticated\\" operations, where they discuss various metrics.<br /><br />Another thing. One chapter's title is mis-spelled on the top of every page in the chapter. Irritating. Makes one wonder about the proof reading.	2004-08-27

And the scripts might differ for each target operating system. So you might think of InstallAnywhere as a meta-installer. The authors wrote the program to make installers under a gamut of operating systems - linux, AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows Server 2003, XP etc. The hope is to free you from a lot of grungy operating system specific nuances that are probably not even  the core expertise of you or anyone on your project.<br /><br />In practice, even in this book, there are often unavoidable details specific to some operating systems. Like where to put files and resources. You will still have to contend with items like these. Still, the authors offer an intriguing and quite useful investment of your time. To the extent that it can relieve you of even some, if not most, of the installation details, it has merit.<br /><br />As an added bonus, there is full internationalisation. You can run this program using text resources in many languages. As well as changing any localised text.	2004-08-27

Certainly, the free and open source nature of SA will appeal to some.<br /><br />But the problem with the book is that it never seriously analyses the many flaws of SA. The most glaring is how it used blacklists. It only applies these against various header fields. Yet it is well known that spammers forge arbitrary sender addresses. Which greatly reduces the efficacy of the blacklist.<br /><br />Also, the book devotes attention to how SA uses Bayesians. It says how you need a corpus of spam and one of non-spam, to train the Bayesian. Yet this has proved to be a severe constraint on actual usage. The book never says how these corpuses are to be found. In practice, this is done manually. Even worse, the book does not point out that spammers can and are poisoning Bayesians, with innocuous non-sequitur words in their messages. This means that a Bayesian must be continually retrained on new corpuses, that have been manually gathered. Very labour intensive. Few users are willing and able to do so.	2004-08-25

Plus, all these came out initially as hardcovers, which is an extra note of distinction, since these have greater risks of losses for publishers.<br /><br />But this book and its predecessors are also an indication of Turtledove's skill in choosing a topic that strikes an enduring chord amongst many presumably American readers: The American Civil War and its legacies. He was scarcely the first writer to plumb this field of alternate history. But other works in this field have never extrapolated it to the depth of detail and plausibility that he has.<br /><br />Granted, if you read this latest novel, you can see him cranking a handle. The sheer repetitiveness of some of the character discourse is striking. Exacerbated by the number of characters. Some of this is unavoidable, and the price to be paid when you have characters spanning several novels.<br /><br />But where else are you going to find accounts of Union and Confederate troops going at each other with machine guns, tanks and planes?<br /><br />I would compare Turtledove with James Michener. Both used clearly formulaic methods to build lengthy novels. [I don't think Michener's characters ever spanned across his novels.] It does not lead to the very greatest of writings. In reflection of this, Michener never won the Nobel, though he aspired for it. Likewise, none of Turtledove's novel series, including this book, would be in the highest ranks of science fiction. But both authors still had millions of fans.	2004-08-25

Naturally, many fans quickly reached the limitations of a normal TiVo and have chafed at these. Now comes Keegan with this book on how to lift many constraints.<br /><br />He explains several neat tricks. But perhaps the most useful is simply to increase the storage capacity. A default TiVo holds 14 hours at a basic quality of resolution. But a TiVo is really a special purpose computer. So just like you can add more disk space to a generic PC, so too can this be done to a TiVo. But there are many fine details that are specific to TiVo, and indeed to specific models. He gives you all the necessary help to build out your TiVo.<br /><br />Why? In his experience, when you expand from 14 hours to 110 hour by adding an 80 Gb disk, there is a qualitative improvement in your usage. And this is for an 80 Gb disk. Keep in mind that as 200 Gb+ disks come on the market, you could potentially use his guidelines here to try installing those!<br /><br />Some of you should appreciate this book.	2004-08-25

Barry and Marcia Press offer some suggestions. These involve integrating your PC in some ingenious fashion to your surroundings. Quite distinct from running games or surfing the web.<br /><br />Actually, while they deal with the latest PCs, there is a definite retro flavour to this book. You see, before the web arose, most PCs were standalone, or perhaps connected to a LAN if the PCs were in a workplace. But home PCs were usually on their own lonesome selves. Plus, the games of that era lacked the intensive graphics and complexity of logic of today's offerings. So quite often, PCs were used by hobbyists who were hardware buffs. This goes all the way back to the Homebrew Computer Club of San Francisco in the 1970s.<br /><br />So if you try some of the book's projects, like monitoring your fish tank or your fridge or freezer, or making a control centre for model trains, you are actually indulging in an \\"old school\\" ethos.	2004-08-25

This book was garnering a fair amount of interest. Now that I've had a chance to read it, I can see why.<br /><br />It is a lucid explanation of how to design three dimensional user interfaces. The authors summarise a vast body of work done in past decades. Plus, unlike perhaps some books that might focus on only US research, they show the global scope of the effort.<br /><br />Being a text on 3D graphics, you might expect considerable maths. There is indeed some, including a brief description of quarternions. But the amount of maths is deliberately downplayed. Enough is used to impart a basic flavour in certain sections. However, the general tenor of the book is at a higher level of design.<br /><br />Many serious issues remain unresolved. The book shows you what these are. Very helpful if you are in this field. Especially for newcomers.	2004-08-25

In the interests of conciseness, the authors effectively assume that you are already facile in both. They don't want to waste your time rehashing elementary syntactical issues in either.<br /><br />It is hard not to be impressed by how far a group of linux volunteers has come with this project. Operating purely on donated time and minimal budget [as far as I can tell], they have replicated a lot of functionality that Microsoft must have spent millions to develop in the first place. Without offending the Mono developers, do keep in mind that it is always easier to play catch up than it is to innovate.<br /><br />The authors show that it is possible to merge the various linux and unix platforms and develop under .NET. Though .NET supports various languages, for serious developement under Microsoft operating systems, C# is preferred. Likewise here, the volunteer effort focuses on using C#, rather than VB.NET, say. Also, if you are from the linux/unix world, it is likely that you already know some Java. So C# is not really all that big a shift for you.<br /><br />What will be interesting is if developers using this book can come up with some nice popular application that others on a native Microsoft .NET platform have not done. That would really boost support for Mono.	2004-08-23

While you could try to learn XML from this book, I wouldn't suggest it. Whereas, if you already have some familiarity with DTDs, schemas and other topics like SOAP and Open Office, then the book is potentially far more useful.<br /><br />Perhaps the most intricate parts of the book deal with using XSLT to process XML documents. Trouble is, the XSLT usage can be very convoluted and non-obvious, unless you know it thoroughly. The hacks Fitzgerald describe that involve XSLT are neat. But, perhaps by necessity, they only hint at the depths beneath.<br /><br />Overall, the book shows the ever-growing scope of XML. From interacting with SQL databases to the Microsoft Office suite, to news feeds like RSS. The book is excellent motivation for gaining fluency in XML.	2004-08-22

But suppose you've done that successfully. Beautiful, fast rendered, high resolution images. How then do you KEEP the player's attention? Especially vis-a-vis other games.<br /><br />So there is intense pressure on you, the developer, to make your characters more sophisticated. Bourg and Seemann offer help. The title says AI, but this can be intimidating to some. You can instead consider this as an algorithms book, that eases you gently into what can be topics of astonishing depth. Many important ideas are covered, like cellular automata and artificial life flocking. (Surprisingly, Conway's Game of Life isn't cited.) From physics, we see the use of potential functions to control character movement. We get simple explanations of finite state machines, fuzzy logic, neural networks and genetic algorithms.<br /><br />The virtue of this book is that the topics are understandable to developers. Hitherto, using those ideas would have required you to be a specialist in the fields. Crucially, there are code snippets that illustrate the core concepts of each major idea. Sounds like a trite statment perhaps. But if you have ever cracked open a monograph on fuzzy logic, say, and then tried to go from it to writing code, you'll understand the usefulness of what this O'Reilly book offers.	2004-08-22

Riordan tackles this in the context of Microsoft's .NET platform. Notice the two topics. There are books on pure UI design, for various operating systems. Nothing wrong with that. But they tend to concentrate on the strict visuals and how the user interacts with various widgets. Usually, any data to be displayed or modified is general and lacks much structure.<br /><br />There are certainly elements of this approach here. Like where Riordan discusses the various properties of fonts and faces, or colours or different image types.<br /><br />But she goes further. She shows how to make UIs customised for SQL data. To make your SQL Server easily accessible. A full workout. From using the widget families that come with .NET and hooking these all the way back to a SQL Server. In, for example, a four tier architecture. Unusual to see all this in one book. PLus, she makes VB seem very easy to design and program in.	2004-08-22

Ostensibly, for each day in 2004, they offer 2 things. The first is a brief retrospective of a significant event in computing history on that day. Some of these recollections may leave you queasy. Was it really THAT long ago that this [event] happened? Strewth, it feels like yesterday!<br /><br />But the bulk of the discussion for each day is some recent article from the magazine. There is really little correlation, if any, between it and the nominal day entry under which it appears in this book.<br /><br />It is really best to treat this book as a stapling of recent articles spanning many computing topics. The quality of the essays is consistently high. There will be an element of serendipity here. Some essays might be spot on to your needs.	2004-08-22

Freed does not assume you are proficient with either hardware or software related to building out a home network. He gives careful exposition of a wired ethernet LAN and of the increasingly popular wireless LAN.<br /><br />For the wired LAN, he really does start from the basics. There is a closeup photo of an RJ-45 connector, as a good example. This is one of those things that computer professionals have known for years. And once you know something like this, you've subsumed the knowledge so thoroughly that it is axiomatic. So it's easy to forget that for many people, RJ-45 is forbidding gibberish. That is just one case. He follows it up with a photo of common cable tools. In other words, you can take this book to an electrical supplies store and find the items. Some of you may laugh at this. But there are people out there who really need this basic advice. (Perhaps you?)<br /><br />Most of the book is this way. Broad appeal.	2004-08-22

Important things like choosing an internal analog capture card. Who are the main vendors? What are the salient features to compare? Ozer gives you these data.<br /><br />In software, you have to pick some video editor. These run the gamut from the entry level Microsoft Movie Maker 2 to more powerful and expensive alternatives like Pinnacle Edition, Sonic Foundry Vegas or Adobe Premiere Pro.<br /><br />Many other issues are shown in the book. Along with simple editing techniques. Enough to get you started. Ozer's writing style should be clear enough to many. And he gives you a lot of material to digest.

But within the developed countries, it has spawned a subculture of twitch computer gaming. It has elements of the video arcades, post-1979 Space Invaders. But those were usually single player games, or turn-based two player games.<br /><br />Now Steinmetz writes for so-called LAN Parties. The book has a lot of gritty hardware and software details. Especially, of course, how to network a bunch of computers together. Assigning IP numbers, using routers and switches etc. All the way up to configuring a large room for 63 players.<br /><br />Note how wireless barely gets a mention in this book. Correctly so. While WiFi is hugely popular to a general audience, here its bandwidth is too small. You need wired connections.<br /><br />Future historians and sociologists might also find this book useful. Aside from the technical details, Steinmetz helpfully documents this subculture on a contemporaneous basis. Even now, many people have no idea that such groups exist.	2004-08-20

Wingo directs his book at experienced eBay sellers who are looking to scale up to the next level of sales. Frankly, if you have a marketing or economics degree, none of the general principles he espouses here is new. But for many sellers, they may well be. Like the price-velocity curve. Essentially the supply and demand curves of classical economics, but presented in a simpler form. A utility here is how you can empirically map out this curve for your items, if you have many instances of them.<br /><br />Perhaps the sagest advice is that for a typical item, in its life cycle, eBay is best suited for the introduction and liquidation stages.<br /><br />What is also good is that he is not bedazzled by eBay. He says you should also explore other sales channels, like Amazon and Yahoo Stores, especially if the items are still in season. I found this to be the best part of the book. Shows that he's kept his objectivity during analysis. He puts eBay in a broader context of assessment. By contrast, if you look at other books on eBay, quite often they focus solely on it, and never present cases when you should not sell through it.	2004-08-20

When Space Invaders conquered Japan and then stormed overseas to crush everything in its path? Then, in the space of 3 short years, it was rapidly obsoleted by Missile Command, Defender, PacMan and others. Yes, the world was young then, and so were you. Now you are grown up and respectable. But you want to go back?<br /><br />It is no coincidence that St Clair and his publisher painted the cover in a hazy sepia glow of nostalgia. What is it, a photo from the Civil War? Shameless tugging at your fading youth.<br /><br />St Clair shows us an amazing cottage industry that has sprung up in the shadows, to supply items like arcade spinners, trackballs and keyboard encoders. Unsurprisingly, the book is heavily hardware oriented. For the most part, it is about new versions of old hardware. Emulations or simulations on current PCs aren't really the attraction here. Instead, it is the entire retro ambiance. Like the full arcade size versions of the games.<br /><br />Now it is possible, if you plonk down enough cash, to buy these items, in toto. But he writes for several different audiences. One is the person who likes to build such games for herself. Another is the person who can't afford to buy a finished game. A third is someone who wants to make and sell such games. Naturally, these audiences may overlap.	2004-08-20

In the jargon of O'Reilly, a major competitor to this publisher, the book is the equivalent of one of their \\"100 Hacks\\" books on some computing topic. But here offering over 3 times more tips.<br /><br />The book is designed for random access. Each FAQ is titled with a question that the FAQ then answers. So the directory pages should suffice in guiding you to an answer, if it exists, of course. Each FAQ's explanation can be read in isolation of the others. Though one very nice feature is how they cross reference each other where appropriate. The old fashioned equivalent of hyperlinks, remember?<br /><br />The technical level is moderate.

One immediate and useful simplification is that the 4 CDs of linux that were in that edition have been replaced by one DVD, that covers both the avowedly open source Fedora Core and the Red Hat Enterprise linux.<br /><br />Much of the text is still broadly the same between these 2 editions, from the user's perspective. The commands needed by the average user are mostly unchanged. Linux is (thankfully) pretty stable at this level, and has been so for several years. Likewise for the UI that the user might run.<br /><br />And some chapters, like on networking and the Internet, are also pretty much unchanged. That particular chapter has good background information on the Internet and the Web.<br /><br />Some sections are VERY topical. On the chapter about downloading and installing software, there is a concise explanation of how to use BitTorrent. A famous or notorious package that came up with the novel means of sharing files across the net. Wildly popular with the masses.

Sutter assumes you are already conversant with the basic syntax, and that by now, you can easily write and compile a straightforward computational task.<br /><br />But what lies beyond? Of necessity, what Sutter does is somewhat subjective. (Unlike, say, a book on syntax.) Not so much in the opinions he offers in the solutions to the problems he poses. Most C++ programmers will probably regard his assessments as valid and cogent. If you tackle the problems, without peeking at the answers till you have given it a hard try, then you should derive some benefit from most problems. Like when he asks when try and catch should be used, and when not? Basically, it is possible to overuse try and catch. Something that an introductory book would be unlikely to discuss.<br /><br />The real subjectivity in the book is of course his choice of problems. But Sutter readily explains that he makes no claim to comprehensiveness. and he does indeed cover many aspects of the language. Quite possibly to your benefit.	2004-08-17

There really is a surprising amount of reliable, free packages out there, for you to bolt down your network. He shows this at the book's start, with a simple but very convenient table of tools, like Ethereal, finger, OpenSSH, PGP, Snort and traceroute. Many others are also listed. Several are available on both operating systems. Here, I consider all the unix/linux OSs as one, and likewise with Microsoft.<br /><br />The book can be regarded as a buildout of the table. Explaining each tool's best usage, with examples and screen captures. But Howlett offers more than just an encyclopaediac reference approach to the tools. That's more of a bottoms-up outlook. The book has a top-down view that starts with high level topics like firewalls and network sniffers and suggests how to understand the salient points. And thence use some tools optimised for these.<br /><br />In passing, when he talks about why a cracker might want to break into your system, even if you have nothing in it worthwhile to her, he understates the danger. If you have a machine with a broadband connection, then a cracker has an economic incentive to take it over. She can use it to transmit spam (especially the phishing variety) to other, larger networks. Because open relays are getting closed up, to prevent spam, then some spammers are resorting to creating their own open relays, in this fashion. Howlett describes her using your system for DDOS attacks. But spam injection is actually a better reason, inasmuch as she can make money from this. Of course, this scarcely invalidates his text. If anything, it increases the need for it.	2004-08-15

Pitched squarely to the non-economist. Greenfield strives to make the Depression explicable, primarily on the basis of decisions made by governments (mostly the US) concerning monetary policy.

Yet outside south Asia, he is relatively unknown. Part of this reflects a traditional tendency in developed countries to emphasise people from their common cultural background, which tends to be European.<br /><br />But here Patel shows us that the complexity of Miraji's life and the milieu in which he lived is easily as interesting as that of any European figure. In this biography, we see the burning issues of an independent India movement striving to eject the British occupiers. With an accompanying subtext of how might a Muslim minority find their own identity in a resultant free India. Eloquently and somewhat ironically underpinned by Miraji being a Muslim male who wrote under a female Hindu name. The multiple facets of his experience and personality echo the free flowing tumult of his society.<br /><br />Fans of his poetry may look with askance on this, but I found the most interesting parts of the book not to be the study of the poetry. Rather, it was the look at pre-Independence India, as seen from Indian perspectives. Because outside India, the histories of that time tend to be British-written. Good to have a local viewpoint.	2004-08-14

It is a pleasure to see that this FreeBSD book continues that tradition.<br /><br />The book goes into a detailed explanation of FreeBSD's kernel and associated matters. Strictly for the experienced unix programmer or systems developer. At the core of the kernel are many algorithms. It is these and their data structures that are the essence of this book. Also worthy of mention is the inclusion of exercises at the end of each chapter. Given that we have an algorithms book, the subject lends itself readily to probing questions, and it is nice that the authors chose to do so.<br /><br />We also have a discussion of FreeBSD versus linux. In recent years, linux has grown hugely, and has overtaken FreeBSD. The authors face this issue squarely. That is, if you are choosing a unix to develop on, why pick FreeBSD? The main point is that for anything you make under it, you do not have to fold back into the main FreeBSD thread, by revealing or relinquishing the source code or any other intellectual property.	2004-08-14

A collection of hidebound, sham democracies and feudal aristocracies. Prussia, Austria-Hungary or Tsarist Russia? Or Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia?

Like the repeated devaluations when the pound was floated several times. He explains the oft-thought mysterious innards of how the Treasury collects taxes and then disburses these revenues to keep the government running.<br /><br />Most of the narrative is concerned with the 1960s. Relatively little space is devoted to the immediate post war period, when rationing was still enforced and the British began decolonising their empire, and demobilising their wartime forces.

Foggon and Maharry show how if you are in the Microsoft .NET world, you can do likewise. They give a quick summary of earlier Microsoft efforts, like COM, Data Access Objects and Remote Data Objects. And how ADO 2.0 replaced the latter 2, and in turn is superceded by ADO.NET. The entire book is a not too subtle encouragement to migrate to ASP.NET and C#.<br /><br />There are solid technical explanations of why it is advantageous to do so. Like the relative ease of hooking to a back end SQL Server database, using high level classes like DataSet to pull stuff from the database, with a minimal knowledge of SQL needed. Then they show how the latest ASP can use this data to make dynamic HTML pages. Much like JSP and Java servlets.<br /><br />There is even a section on designing a database. Raising issues like normalisation and first and second normal forms. Though if this is new to you, then consider consulting a dedicated book on the subject.	2004-08-14

These are still relatively new and potentially confusing to many. Here, Rosen offers a major clarification of the key ideas. He discusses the basic motivation underpinning the most common licenses, like GPL, CPL, OSL and MPL. These are compared with each other and with what might be considered the closest previous type of license - that used in academia. While the final choice is yours, he gives you a solid basis for determining that choice.<br /><br />For many readers, there will be an interesting analysis of the SCO versus Open Source fracas. In essence, he suggests that after all the dust has settled, it will break no new ground in contract law. Nor will it stymie or halt the open source movement. A relief to many, if his assessment proves true.	2004-08-14

But the episode studied is very recent. The 1997 Grand Forks flood in North Dakota.<br /><br />Fothergill found a neat way to look at the tribulations of those townspeople. She shows how the experiences were very inhomogeneous. Normally, one might facilely think that in a natural disaster, suffering might be, if not uniformly distributed, then at least randomly so. But here we see that the gender, social class, race and even sexual orientation, can play marked effects on what difficulties a person experiences, and for how long these are endured.<br /><br />She focuses on women. Since many families suffered, and often, these families had the mothers as the core, holding them together.	2004-08-12

By the late 1970s, inflation in Britain seemed like an incurable affliction. This book was written in 1978 and its chapters tend to reflect this.<br /><br />Here are technical papers in economics that try to model in a quantifiable way the inflation. The classic Phillips curve appears, as a suggestion that one can trade off between inflation and unemployment. There is discussion about why this may have been inadequate in an open economy.<br /><br />Other chapters delve into the price expectations of consumers and producers and how this can contribute to a ratcheting up of inflation.	2004-08-12

The authors show how tariff barriers can be a negative sum game. They strongly advocate free trade agreements. You can find extensive mention of NAFTA. Which seems like an ananchronism. Since NAFTA was only approved in 1994, 23 years after this book. But that deley is eloquent testimony to the persistent power of protectionism.	2004-08-12

She compares the situation in academia and large organisations with that of small biotech companies. The latter is now a frequent alternative career path for women [and men].<br /><br />She uses the provocative term \\"sexual apartheid\\" to describe the severe gender imbalance in academia and large companies. An imbalance that is more pronounced when weighted by seniority or rank. But she also investigated several small biotechs, and gives examples of the internal dynamics of some.<br /><br />Tentatively, it appears that in flatter organisations, ie. with fewer levels of hierarchy, women have better chances of recognition. The book is also interesting in how it applies a scientific method to studying scientists themselves.	2004-08-08

Inasmuch as satisfying an unmet need goes. Carvey writes this book as a counterpart to those about defending a linux/unix system or network against attacks.<br /><br />He points out that Microsoft Windows sysadmins often suffer from several disadvantages compared to the other counterparts. There are fewer open source tools for network diagnostics. In part because the Microsoft operating systems are closed, it is harder, though not impossible, to write such tools. Plus, a sysadmin tends to be more dependent on the UI tools that come with the operating system. That is, if the UI tools show nothing anomalous, then the sysadmin thinks everything is hunky dory. But those tools can be fooled by smart attacks. Mind you, similar could also be said of some unix sysadmins, who restrict themselves to a UI.<br /><br />Carvey wrote this book to remedy these deficiencies. He goes into clear explanations of malware and how, for example, an attacker has various ways to hide a foreign file.<br /><br />A distinctive part of the book is the chapter on developing a methodology. He walks through several case studies of a sysadmin and his network, and how anomalies arise and can be tracked down. Written in an informal, novelistic style. Very readable and educational. Any sysadmin can easily relate to the flow of events and the logic and decisions the \\"hero\\" makes. The chapter is the equivalent of the problem sets at the ends of chapters in other books. You do these to assimilate the chapters. But when discussing network security, it is hard to have that format of questions. Instead, Carvey presents each case study as a logical puzzle. To actually apply what he's covered in the preceding chapters.<br /><br />Here's a suggestion. The author does not recommend this, but I will. Turn to the above chapter first. Read as much of it as you can. Some details may not be known to you, because they were covered in the earlier chapters, which you skipped. But do at least some of the scenarios make sense or sound familiar? If so, then the book may be well suited for you, and you should read it thoroughly.r sound familiar?

However, this book brings together many chapters that collectively study the coed movement, if one may call it that.<br /><br />Enough time has elapsed for a detached retrospective. But perhaps the shocking thing about this book is that it wasnt really all that long ago that prestigious universities could blithely deny education to half the race. And have this accepted as the norm. If nothing else, the book is a salutary reminder of how fresh some women's victories are.	2004-08-08

Clark assumes you're clued into the utility of having a version control system and of writing unit tests. Those were the subjects of his two earlier books in this series.<br /><br />Now he shows plausible next steps in automating certain development steps. A lot of attention is focused on the build. Naturally. You can see how to use Ant and a lesser known open source program, CruiseControl, for automated building and running of unit tests. This is the most important part of the book and you should focus your attention here.<br /><br />Clark also discusses other topics, like deploying over the web.

It is good to see acknowledgment of the first Negro students in the 1960s. The book doesn't explicitly state it, but there was racial segregation for over a hundred years prior to this.<br /><br />On another subject, the university's record on female students is reasonably progressive.

The key theme is a faster and more robust coding of web servers using Java. From about 8 years ago, Java Server Pages and Java servlets were the recommended approach. But while doable, it proved quite grungy, with lots of low level code needed. Plus, Microsoft cranked up the competitive pressure with their .NET approach, that had a nice IDE. The collective response by Sun is given here, with JSF 1.2.<br /><br />The book's code examples demonstrate a tight integration with XML configuration files. These files can encode things like navigation rules and action attributes. A file can be considered to define a server's state. Some files are lengthy. But the good thing is that you rarely have to edit these by hand. In the first edition of this book, much remained to be done, to improve the IDE. This second edition reveals impressive improvement.<br /><br />The standard JSF tags are shown to lead to the building of sophisticated dynamic HTML pages. Much simpler than explicit coding of JSPs. Another bonus for the programmer is the existence of a comprehensive set of standard validators. These let you check user inputs and filter out invalid choices, before they get into your backend database.<br /><br />Important recent topics like using Ajax or implementing a Web Service are also treated. Ajax and JSF are entirely compatible. This combination of improved client side abilities and server side functionality is easy to understand, from the text's examples. Some readers might wish for a lengthier discussion. Only 1 chapter is devoted to this. The treatment of Ajax itself is necessarily brief, as this is primarily a book on JSF, not Ajax. But there's enough to get you started.	2004-08-05

You need to have a good background in quantum mechanics and at least one course in solid state physics prior to using the book.<br /><br />Much of the text talks about various potentials one can use or find to represent multibody interactions. Because the general QM problem cannot be solved exactly, many approaches to finding suitable potentials have arisen. Like Hartree-Fock, LDA, tight binding and pseudopotentials.<br /><br />Several papers relate to the study of solid surfaces. There are various molecular dynamics simulations presented. The motivation is often to study reactions on these surfaces.<br /><br />The level of presentation is at the research journal level. Should be understandable to grad students in this field. The CD's code should be of great help to students wanting a quick ramp up into extending the simulations.	2004-08-05

In the latter, readers must have seethed with frustration at how limited the Americans were in their capabilities. Limited by their small numbers and the sheer complexity of 20th century society, they had to slip back to level of the early Industrial Revolution. But the trilogy shows them clambering back up the ladder of industrial progress. How some readers must have wondered - what if the Nantuckers had several thousand more Americans with them, or many more supplies and equipment. The road back would surely have been easier.<br /><br /> Here this book starts off a new trilogy, in the world left behind. Some 6 billion people on it. He puts a twist here. The modern chemistry is permanently squelched. People have to fall back centuries. So while there is this resemblence to the other trilogy, here the fall seems irredeemable. All the panoply of people and hardware, with most of the latter now junk. Very ironic.<br /><br /> The book is a darker vision than the Nantucket scenario. While the ending might be positive, the overall ambience seems negative. It invokes comparison to the dystopic Draka series, that made Stirling famous amongst science fiction fans.	2004-08-05

For chemists wanting a good current expository text, that does not assume any prior knowledge of it, try this work by Rouvray.<br /><br />There is much overlap between studying complexity and information theory. Indeed, this book has a chapter devoted to Shannon's theories. But, as befits a book for chemists, that chapter is toward the end. Instead, Rouvray talks about complexity in the context of thermodynamics. [You do remember most of your thermo books, don't you?] Then we are shown how complexity can be quantified in so-called complexity indices, for various molecules.<br /><br />Then there is a discussion of how molecular complexity might be correlated to the difficulty of synthesis of such molecules. Hopefully, your chemical intuition can come into play, making complexity far more understandable.	2004-08-04

It gives them a means of becoming digital composers as well as actual musicians. While Apple proudly released GarageBand with little hardcopy documentation, Pogue shows us here a convenient supplement.

Most operating systems for desktops now let you write a CD or DVD. But typically this is for any type of data. You certainly want this ability.<br /><br />But there are special types of data, described by Wang, that are very important to many users. When the data consists of audio or video, in various standard encodings. Nero 6 is devoted to the easy handling of these types. For example, it has a simple Wave Editor, to edit sound files. With specialised abilities like a 6 band equaliser and being able to speed up or slow down an audio recording. Wisely, Wang skips the underlying theory, which is heavy on fast Fourier transforms and extended manipulations in frequency space. He shows how you can straightforwardly use techniques described at a musician's level of decision making.<br /><br />Wang also talks about how Nero can play DVD movies on your computer. Granted this is an impressive ability. But personally, I'd pass on this. If I watch a DVD, I'd prefer it on a real TV screen, and so should you.

Where VRML companies extolled its virtues and described how it was the future. Well, VRML was ahead of its hardware. Its successor appears to be Machinima.<br /><br />Marino gives a nice explanation of its merits. The convergence of 3 approaches. Traditional filmmaking. Animation. And the 3D game techniques spawned by Quake. The text has enough examples to let you get started as your own film director, given a typical PC made in 2004 as your hardware platform.<br /><br />It may indeed be as Marino suggests. That we are lucky to be present at the start of an entirely new era of artistic creativity. One that is very democratic. For a minimal outlay of capital, you can script and play out your own film. Essentially limited only by your own ability. The equivalent of music synthesisers that let anyone be a composer.<br /><br />The illustrations in this book also suggest that these are early years. The relatively low resolution of the images points to room for further advances in resolution and rendering. Also, while the book shows a panoply of things you can do in Machinima, undoubtedly more powerful editing capabilities will emerge later. Which may be all to the good for you. Plenty of room for you to help bring about these advances.	2004-08-03

Increasingly cheaper communications costs, especially of course email and browsers, makes a global campaign affordable, even for mid range companies.<br /><br />With the huge US corporate scandals of 2002 and ongoing (Adelphia, Enron, WorldCom...), Kotler provides topical advice on social responsibility of a corporation, and of the importance of marketing ethics.	2004-08-03

But like a squalling child, it beckons for attention. This book is an authoritative guide to WS, if you plan on using J2EE 1.4 as the underlying platform.<br /><br />The authors offer an end-to-end description of what WS entails. Of necessity, you have to plunge through a thicket of standards: XML, SOAP, WSDL, JAX-RPC, WS-I etc. While doing this, remember what is pointed out early in the book. Web Services goes far beyond publishing dynamic web pages. Those are meant for manual viewing by humans [wetware]. So, in essence, programmers only have to write part of the code. Web Services is fundamentally about applications talking to each other across a net, in a very loosely coupled way. So collectively, programmers have to write all the code for both sides of the interaction.<br /><br />Since this is an official Sun book, it gives a good treatment of EJBs and their containers. I guess it would have been too much to expect even a passing reference to a well regarded competing container, jBoss. [Sigh.]<br /><br />There is one little burr in the book. It seems like most places where \\"Java\\" appears, so does a trademark superscript. Visually annoying. Sun has to protect its trademark. But there is a long standing convention about these things. You write the trademark only in the first occurrence in the text.	2004-08-02

Yet many of the conclusions are still fresh today. Zeitlin gives an erudite and deliberately understated analysis of basic economic issues in the US. Like &quot;Who owns America?&quot;, where he studies the most comprehensive official data available from the US Federal government. In 1983, the top 1% owned 20% of the real estate, 60% of the stocks and 80% of the trust fund assets. Numbers that are probably still roughly true today. The overall share of the nation's wealth by the top end has remained remarkably constant over decades. He also looks at the US working class and compares it to those in other countries. He also found that US fatalities in Vietnam were heavily skewed, not by race but by class. Casualties were concentrated in the working class soldiers.<br /><br /> Zeitlin is scarcely a Marxist. What he does offer here is to disabuse you of any rose tinted views. It's good to be wealthy, is an unspoken conclusion!	2004-08-02

This book surveys the literature of the roughly preceding century, to 1965, for books and articles on African music. The results are arranged in several convenient ways. Musical instruments have a geographic arrangement, and then by instrument types. Likewise, African music in general has a geographic arrangement. Similarly for dance.<br /><br />The citations also reflect the continent's colonial history. Many geographic groupings are under now disused names of colonies. Even more so, if you look at the names of the authors of the citations, very few are African. The vast majority were from the colonial powers. But these authors were probably amongst the tolerant and progressive of their times. After all, if they were otherwise, why would they write books on AFrican music?<br /><br />The book could do with a massive update to reflect the almost 40 years since its first publication. Nigeria and Kenya now have thriving music scenes, which often reflect influences from US rock and rap music. Basically, the book as currently extent, reflects a survey of traditional music.	2004-08-01

But it suffered from many drawbacks. The second is Swing. Much nicer. But still slower than native applications. And when native GUI libraries change, you have to wait for someone to explicitly code in these changes into the Swing library.<br /><br />The authors show here the alternative of SWT. It grew out of Eclipse. But SWT was so well received that it now ranks as an independent effort. The length of the book is a reflection of how SWT is a full graphics library. Anyone who has dealt with any other graphics library will be unsurprised by this. The nitty gritty of going through and explaining all the widgets. I am not going to attempt to cover these. Except to say that if you are already programming in AWT or Swing, then, roughly, once you understand SWT, you should be able to quickly convert to the new classes.<br /><br />Another reason for the book's length is that there are many code listings. Good for learning. But a lot of these are entire programs in their own right, complete with \\"static void main\\" entry points and numerous import statements. Nice for users needing runnable examples. But you can well imagine what all the necessary boilerplate does to the text's heft!<br /><br />The book also offers JFace. An elegant abstraction that can be used on top of SWT. If you are learning SWT, then it might be easier to skip JFace on a first reading. After gaining fluency in SWT, consider adopting JFace to ease future development. A purist might say you should try it all together from the start. I demur. SWT has enough raw material to keep you busy. Pragmatically, attend to it first.	2004-08-01

It is a comparative study of the political elites in major 20th century dictatorships. Concentrating on the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. It analyses the demographic makeup of the elites. Looking at, for instance, the occupations of the fathers of Politburo members, to get a sense of the social background that these members grew up in. Likewise with Nazi leaders.<br /><br />The authors try to find common patterns between these elites. In an attempt to understand how such movements successfully seize power. Plus also, no doubt, how the US might have to deal with them. Remember, too, when this book was written. An spoken undercurrent might have been how the US could prevent such revolutionary movements from taking power in the first place.	2004-07-31

But surprisingly to many, the largest agricultural state is California. This guidebook explains the sheer diversity and volume of California farming. Above all, the Central Valley dominates the state's agriculture. We get a comprehensive exposition of the state's crops and livestock, with an emphasis on the Central Valley.<br /><br />All this is not done in a  dry, tabular format. The authors have taken care to also provide an interesting narrative, if you are willing to delve into this subject. The text is judiciously interleaved with maps and photos for added context.<br /><br />Space is also given to explaining various private and public organisations involved in farming. From farm cooperatives to trade associations and retailers. Plus, of course, the vital role of educational institutions in performing research into ever improving techniques and disease prevention. Not surprising, considering the book was put together by the University of California.	2004-07-31

It has a candid analysis of the political scene and the dominence by President Arap Moi's party. Corruption is discussed with Arnold pointing out that multinationals often pay such tribute to government officials to maintain the status quo to their advantage. Certainly, with the book being printed in London and Arnold not residing in Kenya, we get a more forthright viewpoint than one from a Nairobi newspaper or book.<br /><br />The economic analysis show Kenya to be fairly well off for a developed country, with good export-driven markets, especially for horticulture sold to Europe.<br /><br />Needless to say, the foreign policy was dominated by the Cold War, and with the Soviet Union angling for advantage with respect to Kenya and other non-aligned nations. This section of the book totally reads like the past era it was.	2004-07-31

Johnson does not follow the now standard view that the novel represents a timeless view of humanity, or at least of the specimens it depicts. Rather, Johnson places the novel squarely in the history of the Europe and the Mediterranean in which Cervantes was a part.<br /><br /> There are lengthy discussions of the ongoing Christian-Muslim struggles and commercial and social interactions. And how these relate to passages in the novel. Johnson shows how the manifold contrasts between the Spanish and Ottoman empires are expressed in various Cervantes' novels. Perhaps the surprising thing to some modern readers is that the Ottoman empire seems in part closer to our ideals than the Spanish. Johnson points out that many commentators uniformly describe the Ottomans as pluralistic, multiethnic, multilingual and multireligious. Whereas the Spanish empire is avowedly &quot;pure&quot; in each of these aspects.	2004-07-31

It also talks about the IBM WebSphere Studio Workbench. This is IBM's commercial version of Eclipse.<br /><br />For both Eclipse and Workbench, the authors give detailed explanations of how to construct realistic, commercial quality plugins. Within the framework of the latest major version of Eclipse, 3.0. From the text, you should be able to see why Eclipse is now considered to rank with .NET as a fully integrated development environment.<br /><br />As vital parts of Eclipse, you are shown how to use SWT and JFace. These can provide nice UI widgets; better than the default Swing that comes with Java. While the Swing functionality is excellent, its look and feel often leaves much to be desired. SWT makes up for this deficit.<br /><br />The book can be used by someone totally new to Eclipse. Though you would need to be already facile in Java. The book starts from the ground up with bringing up Eclipse. But there is little preamble. The authors dive straight into serious code discussions. Which may actually appeal to experienced Java developers.	2004-07-31

But Microsoft has built a parallel world around its C#/.NET platform. This book, then, can be seen as part of its response.<br /><br />Hasan rolls out the now plentiful Web Services standards; like WS-Security, WS-Policy and WS-Addressing. He shows how these are implemented in .NET. But his book is more than a simple exposition of these standards. He puts all these within the context of a Service Oriented Architecture, where the programming language is (unsurprisingly) C#.<br /><br />He tries a little re-education here. Many programmers meeting Web Services for the first time often have prior acquaintance with SOAP. What often ends up happening is that they then conceive of implementing a Web Service as a set of remote procedure calls, using SOAP to access the RPCs. Hasan shows that this is seriously non-optimal. Far better is a looser coupled message passing and processing design. It is within this context that most of the book is presented.<br /><br />Along the way, he introduces WS Enhancements 2.0. This is used to define and deliver vital features for real world business applications. Features like secure messaging.<br /><br />All that remains is for you to write an application.	2004-07-31

For these offer a chance to at least share the cost and risk of the research, if not necessarily the other downstream costs.<br /><br />The book was written in 1992, but it is at least as relevant now. It has a collection of papers discussing how and when consortia should be formed, and the constraints under which they should operate. Semiconductor and electronics industries are well represented here. One paper is by Robert Noyce, who co-invented the integrated circuit; a seminal event. He studies Sematech, the semiconductor alliance that was formed partly in response to fears of Japanese electronics firms in the 1980s.<br /><br />Technology transfer is the key theme threading the papers. Even if a consortium has found research results, it is not successful until these have been handed off and then used by its members.<br /><br />The papers are substantive. Very little high level fluff or marketing hype.	2004-07-30

Suppose you would be transported to another planet and you had to attempt to rebuild our civilisation. But you could only take 6 books with you.<br /><br />What would you take?<br /><br />Well, that author gave a list of his suggestions. One of which was this; well an earlier edition anyway. He pointed out something about the Rubber Handbook, which is what anyone who regularly uses this book calls it. So easy to take for granted, because in any lab, you can usually rummage around and find some edition of it. But it represents millions of hours of engineering and research to measure and collate its results.<br /><br />If there is one book that summarises the engineering of our civilisation, it is this.<br /><br />Always nice to see CRC continually updating it. But having said the above, whether you need this latest edition is another matter. The changes are incremental. If you have an older edition, and there is no specific reason to upgrade, then you probably shouldn't. Note that I did not say never. Just tell yourself you can defer it till next year.

The layout of the material is very logical, at least to its audience of inoganic chemists. It has been refined for a century. I suspect that other chemists may also find it just as logical and useful.<br /><br />Perhaps the only quibble is why this English version is translated from the 1995 German edition, and not from a more recent edition? But in practical terms, the point may be moot, if there are only slight differences between editions.	2004-07-30

The people may have few material goods, but they are reasonably well fed and clothed. Famine does not stalk here.<br /><br />Iwanska also shows how they have accomodated their traditional beliefs with the Christianity of the missionaries of previous centuries, in an interesting amalgam that clearly preserves a local flavour.

Given that it was published in 1997, that seems rather late, since fuzzy logic was well established in computing and electric engineering in the 1980s.<br /><br />Ah, but better late than never. Since most chemists have never dealt with fuzzy logic, the editor chose the wise step of having several research chemists write the chapters. Hopefully, this will ease acceptance of the method amongst chemists.<br /><br />The subjects of the chapters tend to be hard, unsurprisingly. No softball simple textbook examples. Instead, we deal with issues like determining the shape of a large molecule, or the design of a drug.	2004-07-30

We see how Labor and Likud adjusted their policies to attract the newcomers' support; with Likud prevailing.<br /><br />Plus, the book also discusses the Palestinian intifada and its effect on the immigrants and vice versa.

The style of his discourse is not dry; his wit often shows through. He claims that most Greek literature can be understood from the point of view of the novel.<br /><br />To readers who, like me, never majored in ancient Greek history, let alone be able to read Greek, Hagg can make 2000 year old narratives come to life.	2004-07-29

A gorgeously illustrated, eye-catching text that spans the prehistory and history of the region that we now call the United States. When I was growing up in the 1970s, we had several well regarded books on American history. Yet none had the profusion of colour illustrations on almost every page. Students using this as their first text will not notice it, but the book speaks to substantial advances in the lowering cost of colour printing in 30 years. Of course, we have much more than just eye candy here. The illustrations are well integrated into the textual narrative. The text flows with a well polished grace that should draw in the interest of many students.<br /><br />The book does not gloss over various bloody aspects of history. Above all, of slavery. There is extensive description of the human cost of the Middle Passage and the subsequent suffering of plantation life. Relations of the settlers with native tribes are frankly discussed. Several massacres of tribes are mentioned. Yet the book is not an anti-American screed. The common theme is that, however imperfect, the US continued to move in an ever upward and progressive manner.<br /><br />Perhaps the authors could have deigned to include the full text of the Gettysburg Address.

On a separate front, for reasons like scalability and fault tolerance, a project might be implemented across different machines, in a distributed computing layout.<br /><br />As Lhotka explains, there are often times when it would be desirable to combine the two approaches. He lays out a multitier logical structure for a web application. Data is passed back and forth across the layers. A common problem is to validate the data according to some business logic. Traditionally, this might have been done at several layers, leading to code duplication and maintenance problems. Or, if it was implemented in only one layer, feedback about invalid data might be slow. An OO person would say, obviously, that you should wrap the data in an object that implements the business rules.<br /><br />But passing this object between layers on different machines is not simple, to put it mildly. Lhotka offers us a framework that sits atop .NET to make this possible. He had an earlier version running under COM. But he shows how .NET is a far more powerful environment in which to redo the framework.<br /><br />He gives us an elegant approach to mixing object oriented and distributed computing under .NET. So much so that you might wonder why Microsoft did not already build this out.	2004-07-29

Specifically, she analysed the role that masks played in their society. The book has many photos of intricately designed masks. Pretty!<br /><br />But the book is more than just nice pictures. Strother has conducted a serious anthropological study of what the masks represent and their history. Essentially, she shows that the construction and symbology are not some age old ritual. Rather, a virtue of her study is that she places the Pende masquerade as an active, modern art form. As legitimate as any contemporary art movement in a developed country.

Very little of your time is wasted by wading through elementary material.<br /><br />When I first used gcc years ago, it was just that: strictly for compiling C programs. But Stallman and other developers have dramatically expanded the scope. Now, the book describes how gcc can handle a key set of languages - the original (ANSI) C, C++, Fortran and Java. The set of C, C++ and Fortran probably spans most engineering and scientific legacy applications. Terrific value!	2004-07-28

The context is Chile's ending of Pinochet's dictatorship in 1990 and the subsequent gradual emergence of a pluralistic democracy. In this society, it has now become possible for many groups to overtly assert their influence. Richards studies how various female social groups have fared.<br /><br />The problem is that there is no simple pure gender issue that most Chilean women might agree on. Richards shows the complexity of their society. Many divisions overlay. The concerts of educated, middle class women might not fully intersect those of struggling urban working class women.<br /><br />Ethnicity and race also intrude. Rural women might be indigenous, rather than of European descent. Richards especially devotes attention to the Mapuche and their dealings with the government. The Mapuche were the only South American tribe in the Spanish Empire that the Spanish never defeated. Richards interviewed many Mapuche female leaders to find their concerns, which she summarises and analyses for us.	2004-07-28

As you may know, Stallman wrote the original gcc. Gough pitches his book at a new user of gcc, or, for that matter, for a programmer new to C itself. Whereas the aforementioned book by Stallman is for experienced users.<br /><br />Gough writes concisely. You should be able to quickly absorb the entire contents of the book. During which, learning about how to use gcc with various libraries and header files might also prove instructive in laying out a program, to be scattered across various *.c and *.h files.  For those of you who strongly support the concept of open source code, there is the extra incentive that royalties from this book will go to those ends.	2004-07-28

Located in a valley stuck between two mountain ranges in the Highlands, the Chimbu were first detected by Europeans in the 1930s. Technologically, they were at a Neolithic level.<br /><br />Brown summarises decades of study of the Chimbu, by her and others. She showed them to be quite adaptable and willing to incorporate technological changes. But, presciently though unwittingly, Brown also mentions that intergroup conflict is endemic to the New Guinea highlands. Exacerbated by weak central government in Port Moresby. Sadly, in the years since this book was written, these observations have not diminished in accuracy. If anything, the geographically and socially fractured nature of New Guinea has led to serious talk of a failed state. In this sense, her critiques of the Chimbu could have been applied to the entire region.	2004-07-28

Here, we have a European take on it. The authors look at the limitations Europe places on agreements between firms. A nontrivial consideration, especially because in the years since the book came out, EU authorities have discovered and broken various price fixing cartels. Some were in vitamins [!] an in basic chemicals. Firms involved have included huge multinationals; several European-based in fact. Naughty, naughty!<br /><br />Thus, the book is not about academic debating points.

Here, the authors study it, limited to small groups of women that have rarely been studied on a comparative basis. The groups are very varied, in time and space. From a 13th century European nunnery to groups in Britain and Australasia in the 19th and 20th centuries.<br /><br />Antipodean readers may turn with interest to the latter examples. These were colonial societies, sparsely settled. But also, on a global basis, quite favourable to women's rights. Possibly because the newness of frontier settlements and the shortage of labour meant that women had to fulfill necessary economic roles, quite aside from the traditional homemaking.	2004-07-26

He published a standard text, &quot;Statistical Methods&quot;, that became widely used. And the Snedecor F-distribution is named after him.  This book is a collection of papers in his honour. The contributors were former students and colleagues. Published in 1972, the papers give you a good survey of interesting problems in statistics at that time.  Topics include speculations on the history and future of statistics by Kendall. From our vantage point over 30 years later, and with the benefit of hindsight, we can see that his suggestions for the future were well done. The computer simulations, linear programming and multivariate analysis by computer are now an indispensible part of statistics. In fact, these days, it is hard to imagine doing statistics without the aid of a computer.	2004-07-26

One recent up-and-comer is Python. Why? Mark Pilgrim gives a forceful presentation of its virtues.<br /><br />Veterans of other languages will see here a reimplementation of many nice features of several languages. For example, C++ has its Standard Template Library. And the default Java installation comes replete with an extensive library. So too does Python. Pilgrim covers examples of key libraries in various chapters. Like one that knows HTML and another than can parse XML. So you don't have to go back to writing grungy low level code. And writing an XML parser is very tricky to get right. Java and C# programmers have also found introspection to be vital for writing more flexible and modular programs. So that one class can dynamically find another class's methods at runtime. Guess what? Python lets you do this too.<br /><br />Python is also fully object oriented. Not bad for a 'mere' scripting language. Unlike some others, that are just weakly OO.<br /><br />The style of the book is example-driven, with carefully chosen examples that introduce key sections of Python. In some way, like a bottoms-up approach. Pilgrim is forthright about the presentation; deliberately eshewing a more elegant, theoretical layout. Very nuts and bolts.	2004-07-26

So if you are familiar with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), you can use it to programmatically perform tasks within each Office product, like Excel, Word or Powerpoint. Or, within one of these products, you can write an application that can invoke an instance of another program.<br /><br />Within one book, Stephens shows an efficient and unified way to learn how to do all this, and more. The trick is to be able to use VBA as a macro programming language. This is the key to understanding and using MS Office as a coherent entity. Ultimately, Stephens suggests that it is quicker than learning how to program each product on a case-by-case basis.<br /><br />Stephens cheerfully dumps on other texts that call you an idiot or dummy. (If you know what I mean.) He unabashedly expects you to be conversant in VB or VBA. To be specific, he doesn't waste time going over the elementary syntactical points of VBA. So you don't have to thumb through these pages in idle frustration. He drags you rapidly into non-trivial coding explanations of how to use VBA to get at MS Office.	2004-07-25

Gertzog describes the roles of its most prominent members, starting with Bella Abzog, who rose to prominence in the 70s on a variety of controversial issues, not all of them gender related.<br /><br />We see how while theoretically bipartisan, it inevitably garnered a Democratic hue. A result being that when the Republicans gained control of the House in 1994, they cut off its funding. Most of the book details the aftermath and how CCWI almost expired. But somehow, as Gertzog shows, it precariously stumbled along.<br /><br />The book chronicles events up to 2000 and may prove of interest to those studying politics and gender.	2004-07-25

Very popular. In late 2003, the latest major revision was released, Samba 3. Now this text gives an independent and indepth evaluation of all its features.<br /><br />My impression from this book is that if you're already using Samba 2 and just upgrade to 3, you can essentially do all your existing procedures unchanged. Apart from bug fixes, of course, Samba 3 is, to good approximation, a superset of Samba 2. Makes the transition easier. This does mean that if you are using Samba 2, and have a text for it, and you upgrade, you may not really need this book.<br /><br />Ah, but when it comes to specifically new features, then the book shines. Smith goes into sometimes excrutiating details about items like improved Unicode handling and Active Directory integration. He points out the useful features; the details of which can be nontrivial, and which form the key sections of the narrative.<br /><br />All this is pitched to someone [you] that he assumes to be a unix sysadmin who has at least several months experience. Don't be intimidated by the length of the text. Sections are usable on an as-needed basis. In other words, you don't have to plough through all or even most of it, before you can start doing useful activities with Samba 3.	2004-07-24

In some cases, this has been true for decades. Accordingly, as these students graduate and some of them ascend academia, so too is the female composition of the faculty expanding.<br /><br />Can or does this lead to any qualitative changes in a university? Quinn explores the various facets of this. She concentrates on British universities, because she is there. The book discusses the interplay of several factors - gender being only one. In Britain, within any group of people, issues of class often surface. Sometimes, too, ethnic origin. Quinn also finds that within the female university population, generational differences can come to the fore.<br /><br />She offers an analysis of this amalgam, with conclusions that are overall optimistic.	2004-07-24

Though the title &quot;Middle East&quot; is a little misleading. Here, it also encompasses the countries of North Africa. The common theme is a predominent Muslim/Arabic tint.  Each country gets a brief synopsis of what is usually millenia of history. Enough, hopefully, to entice you to pursue further reading.  Special attention is given to Iraq. The sections on it were written in May 2004 and are probably as recent as you will find in book form, given the delays inherent in publishing. The analysis of the US invasion is sanguine. Some positive points, like the overthrow of a brutal dictatorship. Offset by what the author calls an &quot;unremitting&quot; struggle against guerrillas.	2004-07-23

She describes the worst such in recent times, Rwanda, where genocide truly was a literal label. But also studied are Yugoslavia, Somalia and Congo, though the latter is referred to by Mobutu's name, Zaire. Perhaps it is a measure of the depth of bloodshed that Northern Ireland does not even make the cut. Correctly, for it was a walk in the park compared to the other regions. Even Israel/Palestine rates only cursory mention.<br /><br />She talks about how external aid and sometimes peacekeepers are used to delicately stitch back areas into functioning communities. Not a very upbeat book, by its very nature.	2004-07-23

Say &quot;peer-to-peer&quot; to the average person and you might get a snide remark about downloading music and the RIAA. But MacDonald makes it very clear that p2p is far more than copyright infringement. He points out, for one thing, that the early design of the Internet itself posits a p2p network.<br /><br /> This book is well suited for those of you who might be interested in designing novel p2p applications on the dominant desktop environment. MacDonald gives a good summary of previous p2p applications, like Napster, Freenet and Gnutella. Important because if you are going to innovate, you need to know the prior art. He develops several simple p2p examples, like a file sharer and a messaging system. He shows how to use various VB.NET utilities to handle the networking, freeing you from coding low level details. More efficient use of your time. Of course, the hardest part of the problem is still left to you. Finding and designing a novel and compelling application. This book gives you the tools in VB to do that.<br /><br /> One important lesson from the book is that there are degrees of purity in p2p systems. Sometimes, it makes sense to do a pragmatic compromise and have some superpeers that function mostly as servers to the other peers. A p2p hardline developer might decry this, but if it works for you, go ahead. Hopefully, one effect of this book might be to help alter the perception that p2p = illicit.<br /><br /> [Sidenote: For a bloke who studied theoretical physics, his maths slips. He says IPv6 will support 1 trillion machines = 10^12. Actually, much, much more. 2^128 ~ 10^36.]	2004-07-23

Its greatest difference compared to the first edition is simply that it deals with 10g, whereas the latter talks about 9g. Mishra and Beaulieu explain, with extensive detail and examples, the new features. Like support for unix-like regular expressions within SQL statements. Given that many Oracle users probably hail from a unix/C background, they will welcome this.<br /><br />Also, for mapping between XML and SQL data types, 10g now integrates XML. This will reduce the impedance mismatch between the object oriented and relational outlooks that bedevil many programmers who have to deal with both.<br /><br />The only problem I found with this book is its lack of mention of competing databases. Because the authors explicitly assume that you have already committed to using Oracle as your database. Fair enough. But perhaps occasional comments in the text, about how a given command or feature is not possible in another database would be useful and appreciated by Oracle users. Heck, to be fair, on this point, the book is at no relative disadvantage. For example, I have texts on dB2 and MySQL that likewise say zilch about their competitors.	2004-07-22

For example, McCulloh studies identity in lyrical folk songs. She applies textual analysis and musical analysis to various American songs in far deeper ways than a typical listener might appreciate. We also see elements of this in the American Negro songs, she points out.<br /><br />Another paper, by Archie Green, traces the history of the folk music, as expressed in the American artwork that was often drawn to advertise the concerts. The figures in this paper, showing several of the posters and flyers, are quite charming.<br /><br />The book gives you an appreciation of both sides of the Anglo-American folk tradition.	2004-07-22

Those became the definitive guides to X11, and probably were crucial in putting O'Reilly on the map as a prominent technical publisher.<br /><br />Well, this book on Mac OS X Panther captures some of that early O'Reilly spirit. In its comprehensiveness and heft. But also in its terseness. Turn to a random chapter and start reading. The authors try to get to the point, without wasting time. They write at a technical level that assumes you don't know the specifics of that chapter, but that you are no novice to computing.<br /><br />It should be noted that the second half of the book is essentially a standard unix reference. As you may be aware, OS X is now a unix variant. Which is neat. But also accounts for much of the book's size. Unix has built up a massive set of utilities in 20 years, and the length of the unix sections here reflects this.<br /><br />Don't let this put you off either the book or OS X. On the contrary! The building of the Mac operating system on top of unix gives you more power and stability (against crashes) on the Mac.	2004-07-21

The ubiquity of email and browsing, and the storage of much corporate information on a network, has led to a vital need to defend it.<br /><br />The good news, in part, as pointed out by Bejtlich, is that you, the sysadmin, have available a very powerful set of free, open source tools, to scrutinise the network for anomalies. Tcpdump, Tethereal, Ethereal, Snort, Editcap, Mergecop, Tcpslice, etc. All free and supported by communities of developers. But these are not trivial to use. For example, Ethereal and Snort each have entire books devoted to them. Not surprisingly then, a large portion of this book discusses using the many tools. You do not necessarily need to use all of them. But as a sysadmin, you need to be generally aware of the different capabilities of the major tools, and how to best use them. Some explanations also include screen captures from their UIs, to give you a better idea of their operation.<br /><br />But the book is more than just a collection of tool explanations. Bejtlich also promotes an overarching coherent approach to network security monitoring, that rises above the operational details of any tool. Much more qualitative than the specific details of using a given tool. But ultimately, this approach may be the most enduring value of the book.	2004-07-21

Here, Gilmore tries to explain both within the covers of one book. If you just need to learn one, you can certainly use this book for it. The book cleaves neatly into three parts. One on PHP. One on MySQL. And the last part on combining the two packages.<br /><br />Gilmore chose this mixture to, in essence, use one as a foil for the other. The key chapters are at the end, where he demonstrates how to integrate the two packages. In doing so, you can see in a non-trivial fashion, how to more fully use the expressive power of both. If you like, consider the MySql as an important use case for PHP, and vice versa.<br /><br />Granted, this makes for longer reading and assimilation of the details. But the tradeoff is that potentially, Gilmore offers you a positive sum game over learning each package in isolation.	2004-07-20

And like Photoshop, Flash has a devoted coterie who swear by it. But even such fans may find new, nifty things in this book. One might even suggest that such a group is the audience that might benefit the most.<br /><br />So I started thumbing through the book, to see what caught my eye. [Obviously, your needs will differ.] One method was the construction of a speech synthesiser. Bhangel gives a simple, ingenious way to make a poor man's synthesiser. The sound quality does not match that of commercial synthesisers, like IBM's or Dragon's. But there is a homebrew ambience to this hack that some will find attractive.<br /><br />A related hack uses a recent improvement to Flash. Finally, there is a way for the end of the playing of a sound to invoke a callback. In other words, you can now synchronise another operation to start after the sound ends. The lack of this has greatly hampered the interactive use of sound in Flash. The author then gives a hack of a lip synching animation. Cute!	2004-07-20

Daniel Sweeney has come up with one of the first authoritative guides to WiMax. With the huge success of WiFi in many countries, some people have chafed at its short range of 100 meters or so, and its relatively low bandwidth. In response, the IEEE has come up with a standard, 802.16, better known as WiMax. It can offer some 70 Mbps, compared to 2Mbps for WiFi, and at a range of several kilometers. Very nice.<br /><br />But WiMax introduces new complications, compared to a much simpler WiFi network. No one in the world has yet built an operational WiMax network that is available for public use. Though of course there has been small scale prototyping, which has undoubtedly helped the IEEE define the current WiMax standard.<br /><br />Sweeney describes here what the features of a WiMax network would be. This book is not restricted to a hard core audience of hardware engineers or software developers. Instead, he has written it as a level accessible to technical managers, who might be considering such a network. There is roughly equal emphasis on both the technical issues of signal propagation and on the business issues of building and running the network.<br /><br />Still early days yet for WiMax. Which is in fact one of the attractions of this book. Sweeney has given us enough information to seriously contemplate the top level design and economics of a network. Ahead of the curve.	2004-07-19

But a cadre of key developers has been steadily tooling up a major upgrade, Perl 6. This book gives you a detailed preview that claims to be an accurate description of what it will be, when it is officially released. In part, of course, so that existing Perl users can plan for the future. But the book is also a call to arms. If  you are enticed and intrigued by Perl 6, and would like to contribute to its development, then please do so! The authors show how to join the development team. An all-volunteer effort, mind you. They can't pay you anything.<br />Speaking of which, that brings up the second part of the book. As part of the Perl 6 effort, there is a related project, Parrot. It will be a language independent virtual machine that can convert Perl 6 source to a byte code binary. And also do likewise for Tcl, Python, Java and other languages.<br />Does this ring any bells? Sounds in the spirit of Microsoft's .NET. That was and is a massive task in design and implementation. No one outside Microsoft, and precious few inside, knows how much it is costing. What is impressive is that here in Parrot, we have a bunch of volunteers trying a similar effort, with no $budget to speak of. Can they do it? The authors strongly argue, &quot;yes&quot;.	2004-07-19

Out of this bloodshed stumbled a non-communist society. Deeply impoverished, and hung over from decades of dictatorship.<br />Corey presents a broad survey of Romania in the intervening years. The papers discuss many sweeping changes. Many involve politics, unsurprisingly. The struggle to establish a pluralistic multiparty democracy, against a backdrop of endemic corruption and cynical public apathy.<br />Other papers describe how the fall of communism has led to a resurgence of nationalism by the ethnic majority and various minorities. A pre World War 2 tension rising like swamp gas. The most notable case concerns the Transylvanian Hungarians. Another is the persistent discrimination of Gypsies. Cautious optimism is expressed by the authors. Largely because any entrance into the European Union will force Romania to address these inequities.<br />The book has merit as a comprehensive single volume synopsis of Romania that is up to date and does not gloss over the country's warts.	2004-07-18

And what there was cost money to access. Here, Biafore gives a good current survey of how there has been a vast systemic change.<br />The bulk of her book consists of methods (&quot;hacks&quot;) of getting financial data from the Internet. Mostly free access, note. But the book is far more than just a list of good financial websites. For that, you can go to magazines like Forbes, Fortune, Business Week and Kiplinger's, which regularly publish such lists. Remember that this is an O'Reilly book, and the publisher's readers are often programmers.<br />Thus, many methods involve downloading data into an Excel spreadsheet that has logic to analyse it using meaningful financial formulas or metrics. Of course, given such a spreadsheet, you can add further logic of your own, to winnow down a list of stocks. If you are already a programmer, then from that standpoint, there is nothing hard in the book. You may not perhaps be as conversant with some of the financial jargon. But part of the book's job is to educate you on that.<br />The thrust of the book is to let you, the investor, take a maximal and active advantage of the best financial resources on the Internet.	2004-07-18

But indeed that is so, as graphically described by Murphy-Lawless. She explains how Dublin has working class inner city districts burdened with high unemployment. Into this came a ready supply of heroin. The resultant plague of addicts was not unlike what occurred in suburbs like Parramatta in Sydney, for example. She shows how women in those Dublin districts coped. The women might have been addicts themselves. Or an immediate family member might be. Difficult times. Not in the least because the methadone cure is not always successful, and can be very addictive in its own right.<br />The author shows cases of positive outcomes. But not in every instance. Fatal overdoses are a recurrent phenomenon. No end in sight to this Dublin problem.	2004-07-17

Most of us just sigh and delete away the infalling detritus. But Land has found a neat way to make money out of spam, distinct from what antispam companies do.<br />He has compiled a choice selection of spam, and written humourous replies, and stapled these together into this book. Mostly, of course, there were no replies by the spammers to his replies. So the book mostly consists of short conversations.<br />Though in the case of the Nigerian 419 scams, the contact addresses yielded responses to Land's poker-faced queries. The chapter on this makes for wonderful reading. It also contrasts with the rest of the book. Here, he actually causes some scammers to waste their time in futilely trying to string him in.	2004-07-17

But after several seaons, he left. In part, as he explains here, because he wanted to branch out into other acting roles.<br />Probably unlike most of you, I'd only seen a few episodes of TNG. I was familiar with his role and had assumed that he'd made a packet and was now quite well off financially. But this book disabused me. Wheaton gives a searing autobiographical narrative that expands upon his earlier work, &quot;Dancing Barefoot&quot;, and is far better written. In &quot;Geek&quot;, he fleshes out a lot of the backdrop to the first book, which in many ways is a set of disjointed essays.<br />This book describes his travails in trying to find acting roles, especially back in TNG. Very revealing of how, even for someone with an accomplished record, rejections are so common. I've known people in Los Angeles who've dreamed of becoming professional actors, and also a few SAG members. None has even remotely equalled Wheaton. Yet even at his level, it can be heartbreaking. He chronicles a series of failed auditions. All the while struggling to help support his family. If the narrative is occasionally awkward, it is because it reflects real life, not a polished fiction.<br />Also poignantly, he regrets many times not staying with TNG for its full run. At the very least, it would have let him build a nest egg and so enabled less hardship later. In retrospect, his decision to leave was one of those fateful junctions in life. (The moving hand having written, cannot now unwrite, and all that.)<br />Many readers will find much to identify with here. Even if you have nil interest in acting, his experiences speak to broader issues in life that so many have encountered and endured. Wheaton writes for Everyman.	2004-07-17

Not so much of what science has thus far solved, but the big puzzles beyond the perimeter. He covers cosmology and particle physics and a possible Grand Unified Theory. Good descriptions of ideas like an inflationary universe and universe of universes.<br />On a more practical bent, high temperature superconductors are given a chapter of their own. And in biology, of course, we have problems in understanding protein synthesis, which is shown to help fuel the rise of bioinformatics. Vacca shows ideas on how human longevity might be greatly extended within the current lifetimes of many readers.<br />But perhaps of all that is discussed, the most relevant and immediate to any of us is the puzzle of consciousness. A chapter describes what we currently know about what it means to be self-aware.<br />Overall, the depth of writing is quite understandable, whatever your field of science, or indeed if you aren't in the sciences, but have a good general education.<br />The only gripe I have is with part of the chapter on high temperature superconductors. Vacca describes how Irvine Sensors (IRSN) got a contract for $2 million to develop a superconducting router, using the company's chip stacking technology. But IRSN has a miserable track record in the last 10 years, of trying to commercialise their technology. They produced expensive custom prototypes with typically only NASA as the customer. They have made grandiose claims to the Los Angeles Times. Like when they bought part of a fab from IBM. Only to close it several years and several million dollars later, due to lack of orders. Unable to make products for a mass market. (Their stock was once at $330. Today it is $2.30.)<br />Don't get me wrong. I also think high temperature superconductors have a potentially vast future. But I am very dubious about IRSN playing any part in bringing this about. Vacca should have checked more carefully the background of this company.f this company.	2004-07-15

A very sophisticated package. Naturally, as .NET was fleshed out, VS has been upgraded to help you program in that framework. The authors accordingly go into reams of detail, with numerous screen captures, showing what VS.NET can do for you.<br />They also cover how VS can be integrated with UML. So that, as a very nifty feature, VS can autogenerate code given as input a set of UML diagrams. To some of you, it will be a big timesaver, and it lets you concentrate on writing the key parts of your code, not boilerplate.  Of course, different developers will have different needs, but clearly some of you will appreciate this UML ability.<br />The authors also talk about using Microsoft Solutions Framework as a project design framework. Much here is not instrinsically tied to .NET or even Microsoft. This part of the book has a lot of high level jargon. The ideas seem clear enough. But so does a lot of other ideas about project design and management. There is a big impedance mismatch between this chapter and the rest of the book. Perhaps the chapter could have been expanded into a book of its own?	2004-07-15

Those of you also familiar with the Java world will recognise MSMQ as the analog of Java Message Service. (Though this book's index contains no entries for Java or JMS.)<br />The description of MSMQ 3 is comprehensive. The authors show how it has significant improvements over version 2. They point out that the main difference is now you have Internet Messaging. You can send and get messages via http, and refer to q queue by its URL. Very nice. An indication of how the rise of the Internet shapes our programming expectations.<br />The book is replete with example code. In C#, naturally. But even if you don't know this language, it has good semantic keywords, so that following the logic is easy. The book is also a testament to how Microsoft is promoting C# as their core language for development. Quite reasonable, as the language has been well designed. In fact, you might regard this entire book as an important use case for C#!	2004-07-13

Its easy factorisation of GUI coding and back end business logic, in a fashion that built upon existing Model-View-Controller approaches, proved compelling. So too, of course, was its free, open source nature.<br />As experience was gained, Struts was upgraded to version 1.1, which this book fully discusses, in the typical competent O'Reilly tradition that readers will be familiar with. If you are still using Struts 1.0, and have no inclination to migrate, then you probably don't need this book. But Cavaness suggests that you should give 1.1 a consideration, and this book is persuasive argument.<br />Some chapters are useful, but mundane, like those on internationalisation, exception handling and logging. Definitely important capabilities. So much so that you can reasonably expect any major application to have these. The only question is, how exactly does it enable them? Struts handles these quite capably.<br />I have not read the first edition of this book. But this edition indeed seems very comprehensive and useful.	2004-07-11

Almost overnight, a grassroots movement has engendered widespread adoption. But almost as quickly has come the realisation that the very wireless nature of your network can expose you to far easier evesdropping than a traditional wired network, where an intruder might have to first gain physical access.<br /><br />This book goes into the details of how to detect and possibly enter a wireless net, and also how to prevent this. The text makes clear that these are two sides of the same coin. To do either well, you must also learn the complementary ability.<br /><br />All the key buzzwords are explained. Like warwalking, warcycling and wardriving. The authors even suggest their own variant - warclimbing. This is where you ascend a tall building, and use the altitude to help search widely for nets. Though if WiMax ever becomes popular, a lot of these war* ideas may be moot.<br /><br />Various open source tools are suggested for your work. Especially sniffers!<br /><br />To offer more protection, the book takes you into the latest encryption standards, like AES (aka. Rijndael), and how to deploy it. They don't discuss the underlying maths, so don't worry if your discrete maths background is a little rusty!	2004-07-11

My sense of this book is that it is well suited for a new system administrator, or one who has had only a few years experience. The book also has merit for a manager of IT staff, who may not necessarily hail from a technical background.  Or for a computer user thinking of setting up or extending her personal network.<br />Why do I say this? Because Worden's level of technical detail is well written enough to convey the concepts easily to the reader. For example, when he explains the different RAID levels. The figures for each RAID level are simple and well drawn. In 10 years of encountering RAID documentation, often written by vendors of such equipment, I haven't come across a visual and written explanation as clearly given as here.<br />The deepest level of detail is when he talks about SCSI. If you don't need this resolution of detail, you can easily bypass it.<br />The chapter on vendor offerings is, by its very nature, ephemeral. By 2006, it will be outmoded. But the other chapters will still be germane.<br />One minor correction. Moore's Law is named after Gordon Moore, not George Moore.	2004-07-10

For the restless kid inside you, that really digged hands on experience, and who perhaps is left neglected by all this software/web browsing.<br />There are sections of the book that could have been written in the 1970s and 1980s. Like chapters 9 and 10, Driving Miss Motor and Driving Mister Motor. The descriptions of the discrete components and putting them together on a breadboard in something like an npn or pnp motor driver circuit seem so much from that period. Nothing wrong about this, I might add. Much of the progress in electronics has been at ever decreasing dimensions of logic circuitry. But at the macroscopic level, where you might have to supply enough power to move a robot, for instance, much of the lessons of then are still state of the art.<br />Cook provides here a grand tour of many tasks you might need to perform to make a nifty robot. Quite aside from whic, it also gives you a good exposure to analog electronics and electromechanical design.	2004-07-10

The book reprints essays penned over the last ten years. The core theme seems to be the continuing rise of the Internet and how this can reshape even our perceptions of ourselves and of a new communal 'virtual' reality.<br />I would compare his essays to those of George Gilder. But whereas Gilder's writings tend to sound breathless and stuffed with a thicket of arcane and complex technology, Thieme's musings stroll along at a more leisurely pace. A pleasant countryside walk, instead of a dash on a freeway. Thieme talks to a general audience.<br />But for programmers, there is one specific point that I found spot on. He suggests that programmers who use only one language are not fully programming. It is very hard for them to see the limitations inherent in that language. 'When we learn a second language, we see other ways of framing reality. Then we can make choices.' So for example, if you know only C++, then you think multiple inheritance is logical and natural. But then you know not of Java, which is also Object Oriented, but forbids multiple inheritance, and yet has been very successful. Likewise, knowing only Java might not let you appreciate the templates of C++.	2004-07-10

But here Ackers focuses on female migrants.<br />She interviewed many such migrants and studies their reasons for moving and their experiences. She points out that, amongst other things, the women's expectations and needs from their host nations were somewhat unanticipated. And that awareness of those needs, both by the host governments and societies, has led to an increased awareness of gender roles and female specific needs, especially in the area of childcare.	2004-07-10

It is a detailed discussion of many aspects of the regions. Most important is the analysis of the Israeli and Arab settlements and the validity of establishing new Israeli settlements, under international law.<br />But perhaps just as important is another chapter on the water resources of the regions, which are semi-arid. The effect of continuing current usage on the future water table is investigated, and does not yield optimistic projections.<br />Overall, now in 2004, looking back, we see that the book's issues are as relevant and difficult to resolve nowadays. Population densities have increased and several intifadas have heavily damaged the economy and led to high poverty rates.	2004-07-10

The other main technique of note is Realtime Blacklists (RBLs).<br />But note that the above, and indeed other methods mentioned, suffer from the drawback of heavy manual intervention. For example, to periodically retrain a Bayesian on new sample sets of spam or nonspam. Or, when considering RBLs, having to manually judge whether a given domain is that of a spammer or not.<br />At the corporate or ISP level, this manual effort is expensive and ongoing. At the individual level, some, like Paul Graham, who suggested using Bayesians, are willing and able to take the time to retrain their Bayesians. But most users are not willing to continuously do this.<br />One portion of the book is already crucially outdated. In 2004, AOL, and possibly other ISPs, started applying an RBL against domains found inside the bodies of messages, and not just against domains from the headers. As far as I can tell on a reading of this book, whilst it describes various means of finding and applying RBLs, it does not mention the important idea of using them against body domains.	2004-07-08

On these dinky little screens, with a keypad instead of a keyboard, and with tinny audio. But even having all these constraints, such games have their attraction.<br /><br />This should be the draw to you, to program one of these mobile devices. If the hardware runs Java, then, as Hamer explains, J2ME is used. She describes how Sun stripped out a lot of Java classes, to arrive at a minimal subset that is aware of the severe constraints you face. Limited power. Small screen. Small memory. Intermittant and low bandwidth. No mouse. No keyboard. Get the picture?<br /><br />Yet even under all these limitations, Hamer shows how you can use J2ME and version 2 of MIDP to construct cool games. In many ways, it is harder than writing for a desktop or laptop or game console. But the best attitude is to regard this as a challenge of your ingenuity. Perhaps using this book, you will be the author of the next Tetris.<br /><br />I'm only half joking when I say this. Because there is something about this field that I don't think Hamer explicitly points out. If you go through the book, you should come to the conclusion that you can code an entire game by yourself. Realistically, this is no longer true for games on the other platforms. These are now storyboarded and written by a team of programmers, with often a million dollar budget. With J2ME and this book, you can still do it all.	2004-07-07

In straightforward, nontechnical prose, it explains the basic ideas behind spam and viruses and worms. Plus ostensibly benign spyware. And outright scams, that are a particularly pernicious subset of spam. Space is given to explaining about the Nigerian 419 and of phishers.<br />Then there is the explanation of downloading of copyrighted material (usually music). This differs from the others in that here millions actively participate. Whereas the others are pushed out to millions, most of whom decline.<br />The book is ideal for a person still new to the Internet, and worried about snares. It eshews a sensationalistic or preachy tone.<br />The only unfortunate thing is that it is pessimistic about defeating spam. The reasons give reflect the current consensus in the antispam field. But a few others, like myself, believe, based on our own works, that spam can indeed be crushed.	2004-07-07

Montes and Goldman have unearthed and reanalysed her writings, showing her as an astute commentator on the expansion (conquest) of the US into its south west. When Amparo was writing, the Mexican-American War was recent vintage, and the annexation of California, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona was still an open wound to those Mexicans who were forcibly turned into Americans.<br />The authors also show how Amparo critiqued the post Civil War US society and its Gilded Age, from the distinct vantage of a Mexican American. It should be of interest to those of you who have studied that time, perhaps via more &quot;conventional&quot; mainstream American historians. Some of her novels criticise Anglo racism, but instead replace them with a Spanish racism that allows mixing, but retains &quot;whiteness as the highest identity marker&quot;.	2004-07-06

As with his earlier books, a lot of its value is in the focus on what you need to know to pass an exam, in this case, the 703 exam. You will find an extensive question set at the end of each chapter, with answers later in the book. These question sets are indispensible for testing your knowledge understanding.<br />But there is a second potential use of this book. It lets you concisely see various technical abilities of dB2. Useful if you are considering using dB2 or one of its competitors, like Oracle or Postgres or MySQL. For example, MySQL's most persuasive argument is that it is free. But it has limitations. No stored procedures [yet]. By contrast, Sanders describes these in dB2 in various chapters, and how they can reduce bandwidth in a client-server application, to cite only one instance.<br />Another example of using this book to compare dB2 and MySQL might be the book's discussion of using foreign key constraints in dB2. Whereas currently in MySQL, foreign keys are not permitted. (Except in a very limited sense.)<br />So with a little imagination, you can use this book as part of a competitive analysis of dB2. Perhaps not what Sanders or IBM fully intended. But the flexibility is useful.	2004-07-06

But no! The book predates the Web by 12 years. Its Web is a metaphor of the textile makers who use cotton. It studies the makeup of companies throughout the world who dominate the purchasing of cotton, for clothing production.<br />A serious tome that requires some economic background. Heavily documented with footnotes, to emphasise the depth of their research. Their basic message is that bargaining power rests in these makers, instead of in the often poor third world farmers.<br />Current readers will see analogies with how WalMart now dominates its suppliers, or how coffee chains like Starbucks often have the upper hand over growers.<br />But while the book decries the fate of the cotton farmers, it pays to attention to the worldwide benefit of cheap cotton. It has enabled many people, even in the third world, to have affordable clothing. A global social good.	2004-07-03

Here, the Confucian traditions often appear in the form of arranged marriages.

It can also potentially be used to span different companies. Some of you may groan. Haven't we heard this already, several times? Remember the toutings of CORBA, Java's RMI, JMX, JMS, and the nascent Web Services?<br />Well, ESB draws upon often bitter lessons learnt with these earlier endeavours. CORBA was widely found to be too complex. RMI works only for tightly coupled systems, which do not scale well. So that became one reason for JMS, because it enabled loose coupling. But JMS is too low level. Web Services may indeed be promising, but face a danger of overspecifying a standard before enough practical experience is garnered.<br />ESB tries to subsume the best ideas from the above, and from other efforts. It promises loose coupling and an incremental rollout, amongst other things. The incremental ability may be key to getting a small scale project approved and implemented, due to its minimal investment.<br />You could think of ESB as taking the ideas of the JMX management console a step further. Plus, ESB can use JMX as a subsidiary technology.<br />Chappell also offers nice visual component schematics that could be used to represent and perhaps even assemble an ESB network. If this indeed is possible, it would be tremendous. Akin to the 1980s, when MicroSim offered a graphical version of Spice, with electronic parts availabled from a menu.	2004-07-03

A contemporary of Shakespeare and Marlowe. Reasonably well known in her time. Which was quite an achievement in the 1600s.<br />Stapleton tries to bring Behn's works back from the shades, to greater appreciation by us. He presents detailed critical analysis of the works, and compares them favourably to others by her male contemporaries. He assumes that you are already mostly familiar with her poems, and that you have access to them. The book is an analysis, not an anthology.	2004-07-03

Unsurprisingly, the descriptions of events and people prior to the Civil War is very sparse. While free Negroes existed then, little documentation survives, and few of the people managed to achieve mention and prominence in the broader society. The very lack of detail bears silent witness to the suffering.<br />The chronology only starts picking up detail in the 1950s, as the civil rights movement rises. What is striking are the empty decades before this. Some of you may well say empty centuries.	2004-07-02

Erlmann surveys the field from 1890 to 1990.<br />In going through his descriptions of the people, one has to wonder. In a different and better period, some of the musicians and actors might have become world famous. The comparison to African-American singers is inevitable. Yet for most of the performers that Erlmann mentions, only fragments of memory and aging photos and LPs remain.	2004-07-02

In one instance, she studies gender relations in employment from 1800 to 1914. In other words, virtually from the start of the Industrial Revolution.<br />While women were always employed by factories, she points out that it is very difficult to find surviving written views of those women from the 1800s. At that time, universal literacy (including for girls) was still being introduced. So many of those women would have had limited literacy. And even then, writings were seen as the purview of the white collar classes. Walby describes well this paucity of female worker viewpoints. A reader might compare this to finding written testimonies by ex-slaves in the US from that same period.	2004-07-02

The Soviet Union last only one year past the end of the period surveyed. The book's current value is in its thoughtful survey of the many twists in the  Soviet Union and China's relationship prior to 1990. A reader will catch a whiff of a bygone era. Contrasted to the book's period, the Soviet Union's breakup was a huge strategic gain for China, by immensely reducing the size of the Soviet/Russian economy relative to China's.<br />Plus, China's economy has grown significantly since 1990, and is now heavily business oriented. The book describes a different, poorer China.<br />An updated version of this book might be appreciated by some readers, to document the new developments.	2004-07-01

Of course, you need to be familiar with email, because you're getting spam, aren't you? But other than that, the technical background needed to understand the authors' points is minimal.<br />They explain clearly and in simple terms why spam exists, and the common ways in which spammers can get your email address and the typical characteristics of the spam that they send.<br />Various simple antispam techniques are shown. These are mostly aimed at the end user. For example, they suggest that you do not post your email address widely on the net. Or, if you post it on your web page, you choose something like drawing it in an image, so that a spam bot cannot harvest it. Or having an obscure address, like j0e3892@someisp.com, instead of a simple joe@someisp.com. So that your address cannot be found by a dictionary attack.<br />The problem with the authors' suggestions is that they undermine a lot of the usefulness of email. For example, having a short and simple address helps others remember it and type it correctly. And being able to just disseminate addresses widely was and still remains a core utility of email.	2004-07-01

The need is unquestioned, because of the impedance difference between Java's objects and the relational nature of the database.<br />Elliott shows how Hibernate is pitched at java programmers, who may not be as fluent in writing JDBC to SQL. Plus, java code that uses JDBC is usually pretty grotty. Lots of string manipulations to prepare those query statements.<br />The code Elliott gives certainly seems more concise and elegant. The importance of the latter should be appreciated, for more than just aesthetic reaons. It makes code easier to understand and debug. Learning and using Hibernate's classes (and there aren't that many of them, which helps) feels more natural that the string constructions of queries.<br />Another point in the book's favour is that you can quickly read it and starting trying it out. So even if it and Hibernate turn out not be right for you, it is a modest investment of your time.	2004-07-01

Plus the impact of this on the wages and career paths of those in the professions.<br />The authors focus on the effect of technological change on several professions. It should be said that \\"professions\\" in this book does not mean upscale white collar jobs. Instead, here, they tend to be in blue collar manufacturing and retail. Given this, the authors also look at trade unions within these professions and how they have outreached to women since World War 2.<br />As a side note, the descriptions of computing seem so outdated. They wrote the book in 1983, before the rise of personal computers. The computers and tasks associated with them that the book discusses are archiac, yet even then, their effects were shown to ripple through the professions.	2004-07-01

Systems administrators wishing for guidance on stopping spam will find little here that they don't already know.<br />Some of the advice, like blocking messages from an undesirable sender, is of limited use. Only works against a spammer who has not forged the sender line. This has been an enduring problem with spam. Likewise, the book offers advice on analysing the header trail. But again, the spammer can control [forge] much of the header data.<br />There is good advice on the opt-in and opt-out mechanisms purportedly offered by several sender companies. Mainstream companies will indeed honour your requests. Good. But, as the book explains, a spammer can turn your request against you, since she now knows that your email address is valid and actively read, which increases the value of it to her.	2004-07-01

In its centre is Plateau, which is a mini-Nigeria in its diverse ethnic groups, with several languages and religions. Yet the history of the various groups and their experiences, prior, during and after colonial rule, was rarely systematically studied.<br />Isichei tries to redress this by gathering essays from many scholars of Nigerian history. Appropriately, most are from Nigeria. Reading the essays left me struck with how the intricate and rich history of the peoples was on a par with, say, a history of Europe in the Middle Ages. But Plateau has a complicated tapestry that is little known or appreciated outside the country.<br />The essays also hint at various tensions has have be-devilled Nigeria since independence. Relations between the Hausa and other groups has sometimes been troubled. A statement that has remained true to this day.	2004-06-30

This stereotype is evidenced in countless movies and novels set in that era. The authors of such plots probably automatically assumed this, from reading earlier tales.<br />What Gedge offers is a close scrutiny of contemporary primary sources. These include letters and diaries of women. She found repeated, separate and independent accounts of male clergy abusing their pastoral duties and also sexually abusing some of their female parishioners, in stark constrast to some of the sanitised fiction of the time.<br />But perhaps the modern reader would not be too surprised by her findings. Recent revelations (a ironic word in view of its religious connotations) of modern clergy doing likewise have become all too common. It is no difficult stretch to imagine their earlier counterparts to be equally mortal. All men are fallen, as the Christian catechism says.	2004-06-30

Because that is the standard digital image editing tool. But in actuality, only 13 of the hacks involve it. Because digital photography is more than just editing an image.<br />First and foremost, it involves capturing an image, and all that this entails.

The techniques for this probably predate Ansel Adams.<br />Story makes a good overall point in his book. Digital photography is more than bit editing of an image. Many ideas learnt over decades of photography are still applicable. Ideally, you would use Photoshop only as a last resort.<br />But there are some hacks about the latest hot thing. Camera phones. What these lack in resolution, they make up for in other dimensions of ubiquity and ease of use. Because of their increasing importance, Story devotes an entire chapter to them.

Traits that would arguably endure well into the twentieth century. Heere, Anzilotti concerns herself with that early era. She describes how women were able to carve out power in the planter elite. In part due to the higher death rate amongst the male planters. Their lifestyles, involving hunting, drinking and duelling, no doubt contributed to this shortened longevity.<br />Invariably, some women would by default assume the senior role in a plantation. The irony was that many chauvinistic men had to accept this reality. That if their wives outlived them, the wives would need authority to run the estates. If only to ultimately pass these onto the sons.<br />Anzilotti recaps this wretched society in detail. All the while being played out against the racial backdrop of slavery. This combination would form an inescapable part of Carolina's history.	2004-06-29

The period of 1868 to the Great War was an awkward one for any woman aspiring to a university education in the United States or Germany. This difficulty was heightened if she had the temerity to consider entering a doctoral program. Amidst all this discrimination, Singer explains that a peculiar situation arose. For various reasons, women were more likely to be admitted as undergraduates in America than in Germany during the 19th century. Why this was is explained at length in the text. But, as is also explained, women had an easier time getting into graduate programs in Germany. Not that the latter process was easy for a woman. She would still face far more hurdles than a man.<br />But an effect of the national differences was a trickle of American women pursuing graduate studies in Germany. In part because Germany at the time had the world's best research programs, the women could, and did, use the fact of their enrollments and subsequent successful graduations to argue that the US universities should likewise admit women.<br />Singer throws light on an obscure but important struggle for women's rights.

Just being a successful female poet at a time when women had few public roles would have been an achievement in itself. But, just as importantly, she was half Native American, on her father's side. (Her mother was English.)<br />The book contains most of her poems. Many of these deal with her Native heritage. Written in perfect English. Historically important, because they form an articulate expression of a direct experience of being dispossessed of land and society. She was of a generation of Natives to which these events happened. The anguish tumbles out of the verses. The British-Canadian conquest of the land may not have been as bloody as the US experience, but it was scarcely done with the consent of the weaker.<br />Also included in the book are several of her short stories. Again, these often have a Native theme and bring out a Native viewpoint.

Wainright's first edition was well received and Apache was improved after the edition was published. So he produced a second edition. Guess what? The open source Apache has continued to accrue infalling upgrades. As Wainright explains, there are now two main versions, 1.3 and 2. Apache 1.3 is essentially the direct descendent of earlier versions. Very stable on unix/linux, on which it was originally developed.<br /><br />But the key thing about this new book is its descriptions of Apache 2. Apache 1.3 had inferior performance on Microsoft computers, when it was ported. Some people got fed up with this state of affairs and recast crucial portions, to produce Apache 2, which now directly uses native MS threads. It has much better performance than 1.3, on MS computers.<br /><br />The book goes into this in fuller detail. Plus it has the usual voluminous descriptions of what you can tweak for most web server needs. Luckily, if you want to deploy or use a vanilla configuration, the early chapters should suffice. Then consult the later text for more specialised needs.<br /><br />If you are already running Apache 1.3 on a unix/linux computer, it seems from this book that there is little incentive to migrate to 2.

By contrast, for over a century, it has been recognised that the wealthy have access to better health care than the poor. In developed countries, universal health care lessens this inequity. But developing countries still have this burden, plus a newly recognised inequity due to gender.<br />This book explains the latter. Both in developed and developing countries. The authors found that there are measurable differences in healthcare. The starkest differences are in poor countries, or the poor sections of developed countries. They also raise concern that structural macroeconomic reforms in a poor country, perhaps (often?) to better service its foreign debt, might have the unforeseen impact of worsening healthcare amongst its women. If so, it would be grimly ironic, because these reforms are often aimed at ultimately helping that nation.	2004-06-26

Notice this dichotomy between the two approaches. By contrast, Darie and Watson provide an intermediate approach.<br />They assume that you are a developer on a strict and modest budget. They choose .NET as the development platform and Microsoft SQL Server as the database. But this book is quite independent of Microsoft. Upfront, they emphasise the minimal cost of the base software configuration. Since if your development fails, this will reduce the lost outlay to your company.<br />The extended example in the book is built out over many chapters. It aspires to be a fully fledged e-commerce setup. You might be able to use most of the code in your context. Because they were careful to restrict dependencies of the code on what is actually being offered for sale. For many merchants, this should still hold true. Also, the code is not really that intricate to understand. Modifications (i.e. your business logic) should be straightforward, without having to rework the entire framework.<br />Plus, in a first cut at handling the payments problem, they use PayPal, which greatly simplifies this issue. At the cost of incurring its fees. So they give a second iteration of the code which bypasses PayPal, at the cost of more work.	2004-06-26

One way to test the practicality of research is to look for applications of it, outside the field.<br />Which is this book's subject. Protons and muons can be used as probes into various macroscopic materials. This is distinguished from physics research where those particles are used as probes at the microscopic level, of unstable particles. Here, you can see descriptions of Rutherford Back Scattering. Techniques from the dawn of modern physics. Now very useful as probes of materials. Likewise, muons can also be used as probes.<br />Aside from probes, they can also be used actively in processing steps. For example, to anneal a heterostructure at a precise depth, where you can adjust this depth by varying the kinetic energy of the incident protons.	2004-06-26

Singh describes its history as a by-now well established caucus. While formally non-partisan, it has been strongly Democratic, with only an occasionaly Republican member.<br />Singh goes into the group's strategies and their effectiveness. In the context of the overall Federal legislature, the CBC has had limited effect. Singh argues that in large part, their policies were far to the left of most members, even Democrats. This has led to them being marginalised on many issues.<br />He maintains a dispassionate tone over these events. He does not advocate or oppose any particular action by the CBC. Rather, he focuses on how that action came to being, and its effects.	2004-06-26

A little spooky. The asymmetry in the title refers to the fact that the US possesses an overwhelming superiority in conventional and nuclear weaponry. So a potential adversary might be expected to resort to very unconventional techniques and weapons.<br />Reading this after September 2001 put it into a new light. Very prescient. The author did not of course foresee those particular events or methods. But there was clear discussion of expecting unorthodox attacks. Guerilla-style.	2004-06-24

Set 5 years after the collapse of the unlamented Soviet Union, when Russia and the US had begun a massive build-down of their nuclear arsenals.<br />But the participants at these Proceedings are unsatisfied. Several articles discuss the fear of nuclear proliferation. India and Pakistan are mentioned prominently and presciently. Only a few years later, both would detonate fission bombs.<br />Not all the papers concern nuclear weapons. Conventional weapons also figure. Like perhaps outlawing land mines? Or more effective peacekeeping in Africa? There are even articles on global warming and its possible geopolitical impact.<br />The papers can be read by a general audience. No specialised background is needed. But an index to the book would have been nice, given its size.	2004-06-24

How should the public education system accomodate pregnant teenagers? Many politicians lament the high rates of teen pregnancy. But what to do once she is pregnant and does not want an abortion?<br />Pillow offers a thoughtful discourse on various aspects. Non American readers will note the constant reference to US Federal policies, like Title 9, which requires schools not to discriminate against these women. Pillow discusses the interplay of racial and ethnic factors. Especially the persistently high rate of unwed black pregnancy. What sort of counselling should be offered is also reviewed. Like, what to say regarding possible career paths, or the related topic about the availability of affordable childcare.<br />She provides no simple answers. Possibly there are none.	2004-06-24

This book talks frankly and it explicitly contradicts scads of other books on Java. The authors' basic message is that Java and other constructs and standards like XML, J2EE, EJB and Web Services, have grown too bulky. That often, these, or affiliated design patterns, can lead you into a cul-de-sac of complicated and slow code.<br />I don't agree with everything they said, but much of their book may touch a chord in you. Most of their ire is devoted to EJB; especially entity beans, which they consider totally useless. For MDB and stateless session beans, they suggest these are best used when you typically  have transactions across a distribute database. In general, the EJB code is too verbose. Conceptual clutter. And to avoid this, you may end up dependent on a developer framework that autogenerates some source code. Plus, most executables using EJBs end up being too slow. This complaint echoes what many others have noted for  years.<br />On a related theme, the authors suggest Web Services are too heavy. Designed by committee and very complex. Before anyone has had extensive experience with a successful version. Not unlike how EJB and CORBA came about.<br />In general, they recommend that you choose the simplest tools and frameworks you can find. Stay with these as long as you can. And take with caution the siren songs of vendors claiming better tools.	2004-06-23

The authors have pitched their overall presentation towards a concerned manager, who may not necessarily have a technical background. Some sections do indeed require a bit of the latter. For example, the usages of network programs like nmap and tcpdump given in the first chapter may not mean too much to you. But most of the book shies away from instances of actual code. Generally, it suffices for you to know that certain programs and certain types of programs can be used against your network.<br />The authors assume reasonably that for specific countermeasures being implemented, there are technical people in your organisation (perhaps reporting to you) that can implement these.<br />Essentially, the book has a good level of abstraction. It could, however, do with more discussion of email and browsers. Like mentioning them in the index, for starters. These are still the first and second killer applications of the Internet. It is how most of your users will interact with the net. Granted, the book cites examples involving these. But perhaps a more prominent discussion, of how these usages might permit attacks or unwanted entries into your network, would be handy.	2004-06-23

Largely, of course, this was done by academics who were not themselves of that ethnicity. A roundabout way of saying that most were white, and male, for that matter.<br />But there has also been an increasing number of Natives ascending the academic ladder. First as students, and then as faculty. A decades-long process. It has produced enough people, thus far, to enable the editors to put together this book. Here, the emphasis is not so much on changing a typical view of Natives in history, but instead on the academic environment itself, and how it impacts Natives trying to fit in. Which can be very difficult, as some articles in the book attest. A typical Native student might not have a family tradition of reaching college as a student, let alone as an academic.<br />The editors have amassed very articulate concerns. Quite readable.	2004-06-23

Accordingly, it is of no small interest as to how women were admitted as students and faculty in that period, and the obstacles they faced.<br />Mazon shows this clearly in her analysis of why women were initially barred from German universities in the late 19th century. There were many reasons. The rough-housing, hard drinking that was considered an obligatory (male) student experience. The feeling that women were intellectually incapable of rigourous thought. Etc. None of these attitudes were exclusively German. Indeed, in most countries, women faced such obstacles. For example, even today, in many Australian universities, engineering students are the rowdiest and bawdiest. This correlates with a very minimal female enrollment in that field.<br />Mazon concentrates on the Kaiserreich era, up to the Great War. Mostly because the hardest travails faced by women were in that period. She gives short biographies of several trailblazers, to bring life to her narrative.<br />Useful to see our past in such scrutiny.	2004-06-23

There are two roles described here. One is that of the Database Administrator. You'd be the person to act as sysadmin of a dB2 database. Doing the install and later creating users with various privileges, and in general keeping an eye on things. Corresponds exactly to being sysadmin of a computer.<br />The second role is that of a dB2 user. Here, a user is really a programmer. She can be expected to design a database, and to then implement it in dB2.<br />One thing about the book is that it does not really emphasise a separation between the two roles in the overall narrative. Sure, some sections are exclusively for one role. But the overlap in knowledge is extensive. The book correctly requires you to know both roles, to be more effective in either. This is a key difference between dB2 and the general usage of a computer. For the latter, a sysadmin does not need to know the programming languages that a user-programmer has expertise in.<br />The discussion about SQL itself is pretty rudimentary. You get enough of the basics to be able to use these quickly in dB2, for simple applications. A pragmatic approach to SQL. Which is what the typical SAMS reader probably needs.	2004-06-22

One of those, Wentworth Gardens, has a history spanning 4 decades. It is the subject of this book. The authors treat it as few housing projects anywhere have been treated. As a community worthy of serious study, with a history of continual struggle by mostly single mothers, trying to cope with a dearth of many things. Most obviously, jobs, for themselves and their adult children. Plus, the housing has a chronic lack of repairs. And there is a lack of nearby supermarkets and public transportation. The former leads to higher prices for goods that are available at smaller shops that do exist in the area. Which means that tenants of limited incomes pay higher prices that suburbanites.<br />The book delves into these and many other facets. Which often unwittingly add up in a pernicious synergy to make a grim life even harder.<br />In places, the book shines through with optimism. The human spirit, as exemplified by several of the women interviewed. The authors strive to be upbeat. Commendable, yes. Realistic? Well, you may have a different opinion after reading.	2004-06-22

She found that picking the topic of whether a government (federal or state) should offer child care to women in the workforce was a good focal point. It let her study the women's efforts to get this maintained after the war years, when it was introduced as an emergency measure. Plus, the reactions of the lobbied politicians and bureaucrats were typical of the prevailing social attitudes towards working women.<br />It really has not been that many years ago. Yet the echoes from these pages makes it seem like another era. Probably it was. When any employer could fire a female employee soley because she got married, or pregnant, with any risk of opprobrium.<br />The book also goes into the intertwining of the child care issue with that of race. How, in this pre-civil rights time, many women who had to work were Negro. Which naturally made harder the lobbying of white legislators.	2004-06-22

This book is a testament to that. Sciama took on the task of analysing not even just the city of Venice, but one of its many islands, Burano.  She chose it because of the varying threads that make up its inhabitants. Many parts of the book reveal it as very village-like. Possessing a distinct sense of identity, rooted in no small wise by many families having lived there for generations. To an American reader, unless you grew up in someplace like New Mexico, in one of the old families there, that can trace ancestry back 10 generations, this may be the most distinct and different aspect of the book. But unlike a real village, Burano has no large separation from its neighbours. It is part of a city and its hinterland.<br />Sciama takes us through this tension, to see what might be considered an urban tribe. Readers may well see similarities between Burano and groups with cities they live in. In the US, there are aspects like those of an undergraduate experience, in a campus with fraternaties and sororities.	2004-06-22

For a different take, try this book. Lee discusses not the US, but Taiwan. And over the period from the 1980s to the 1990s. Unlike current American ruminations about outsourcing Information Technology and call centres to India, this book mostly discusses manufacturing jobs that vanished in Taiwan. Over the period in the book, software and cheap communications were not a factor in the changes.<br />The book focuses also on female workers and their travails when laid off. The Taiwan manufacturing base of the 1970s and 1980s provided many with their first cash incomes and a means of entering a modern and relatively cosmopolitan lifestyle. At least, compared to a typical earlier alternative of subsistence farming.<br />Lee discusses whether the meaning of work changed, and if there was actually a diminishing of the work ethic, as remarked by some commentators of the time. The book gives a good view of Taiwanese society, and how it coped with massive change.	2004-06-22

A couple of Nobels have been awarded to Cowan and Reines for in fact detecting these.<br />But Franklin has chosen neutrinos as a pedagogic vessel. He shows how in the early years, when neutrinos were first postulated, in order to &quot;save&quot; the law of conservation of energy, that the evidence for them was indeed flimsy. Not totally lacking, but sketchy. A touch of faith was required.<br />He traces the history of neutrino research, and shows how, painfully slowly, evidence was accumulated. Along the way, you can see scientific logic in action, not just in one scientist's work, but in an entire community.	2004-06-20

One of their biggest objectives is to maximise the beam luminosity, so that when the beam is incident on another beam, or a target, the maximal number of reactions can happen. But the problem is that if the beam consists of charged particles, then these are usually of the same charge. Hence space charge effects can act to force the beam apart, either longitudinally or transversely. Neither is desirable.<br /><br />Reiser describes many beam focusing techniques that have been developed over the decades to circumvent this problem. Quite impressive ingenuity. Some of the best experimental physicists have gone into this field, and their efforts are well summarised here.<br /><br />Other non-accelerator applications are described. Though perhaps the most interesting to some of you have to be omitted by necessity. These are military applications, where particle beams might be used as antimissile defenses. (Star Wars.)	2004-06-20

You want to offer it up on the web and your web server happens to be the most common one, Apache. Perhaps, as Hampton points out, you want to make the data available in various transformed ways - HTML, PDF or RTF, say, as these are very common formats. Each format needs a different operator to generate its output from your XML. Well, you may be in luck. Hampton suggests adopted AxKit as a way to do all this, fully compatible with Apache.<br />Along the way, he offers concise ways to use XSLT, XSP, RSS and stylesheets. In other words, he gives a motivating context in which to quickly learn the rudiments of these packages. Certainly not comprehensive in each. But this can be a blessing in disguise. For example, the full expressive power of XSLT grammar can be rather daunting to master. So his book also practises an informal but useful subtheme. He gives you a pragmatic minimum acquaintance with various subsidiary packages that are not AxKit itself. A useful extra benefit of the book.	2004-06-19

Microsoft has said for several years that it strongly supports XML. Well MS Office 2003 is one of the first major products that conforms to this. As you probably know, earlier versions read and wrote to Microsoft's own doc format. A binary format. Third party developers then had to write code to read and write files in this format. Doable, but certainly an aggravation to some, given the complexity of the format.<br />Which is why MS Office 2003 was eagerly awaited. Now, XML is a fully supported data format. It also lets you see in an easy and direct way the complexity of deciphering the doc format, if you had never tried to do that firsthand.<br />Here, the book walks you through the various XML outputs and their associated schemas. There is the usual XML verbosity. (No surprises here.) But you can now read, in plaintext, how the suite structures its code in an OO fashion. So much nicer!<br />Not that the book is trivial. Many  examples show how a lot of XML's capabilities are used. Like namespaces, XSLT, XSL and XPath. A reassuring point is that your needs might not have to extend to all these usages. The book also has many very simple XML examples that could be germane.	2004-06-19

Partly because the easy, elegant, back of the envelope calculations have mostly been done. Low hanging fruit. What remains in terms of finding quantitative predictions of properties requires intensive computation.<br />As Nemoshkalenko points out, this is made more difficult by the very fact that we are dealing to huge multiparticle systems. Unlike, say, a treatment of a system with a few particles. So over the decades, many levels of approximate treatment have arisen, and the author describes them here. For example, modelling the potential seen at a lattice location due to its environment has given rise to such things as the muffin tin potential. Or the pseudopotential. Which is now quite respectable and well established. Unlike when it was first introduced, and some said \\"pseudopotential...pseudophysics\\".<br />Anyway, the book will be very useful for new graduate students embarking in theoretical solid state physics. Gives you a good handle on the tools you need to use or build.	2004-06-18

While MySQL and Postgres are increasingly try to break up this cosy duopoly, they are still small players. So as a professional DBA, or an aspiring one, dB2 is a good choice. Given this, IBM provides several levels of certification. Sanders here supplies the official study guide for the 701 and 706 exams.<br />Thumbing through this book, you see lots of SQL commands. But a lot of the SQL appears to be syntax specific to managing dB2. A dB2 programmer/user can largely deal with generic SQL. But for you, that's not enough. The value of this book is heavily in the specifics of dB2 and how to optimise its performance.<br />The questions and answers in each chapter are at least as important as the text. If you are at all serious, you MUST tackle these. Otherwise, you've just discarded half the value of the book. Of course, the actual questions in the exams will differ. But by being able to do the book's problems, it forces you to clarify your understanding.<br />My own SQL background is mostly with MySQL. So most of this book is new to me. I tried a couple of chapters and their problem sets. Not bad. The problems are not trivial. But the volume of material in each chapter is succinct enough to be doable in a few hours.	2004-06-18

The possibility of introducing DLLs that are incompatible with existing DLLs, for example. Plus lots more things that could fail. Wilson starts off his book with a listing of what could traditionally go wrong in an installation.<br />Not to put too fine a point on it, but this was a wretched state of affairs. You typically had programming expertise in your particular field. But there should have been no a priori reason why this expertise should have to stretch to the installation process. Right?<br />Wilson gives an alternative. He details how you can use Windows Installer to install and uninstall your application. The process is still nontrivial, mind you. Which is why we have a book of this length. But it shows how, if you fit your application within  WI's strictures, then the entire install is now much easier and safer.<br />Perhaps the single best advantage is that WI makes your install a transaction. Either it all works, or the install will fail and your system will be unaffected. Atomic. We have rollback ability.<br />Those of you familiar with SQL and transaction processing will recognise this. Wilson shows that WI is in fact based on SQL tables and relational processing. Some people at Microsoft made a nice design! By undergirding the installation with SQL tables. It lets WI have an inner coherent structure, into which third party applications can fit, in a disciplined way. Plus, it allows the panoply of SQL queries. At the right level, it is an elegant approach.	2004-06-18

In how it works, and in the modelling of the potential energy at a surface under study. This can be a problem for those who want to use an AFM, and who might perhaps be new to the field. At the modelling level, the book shows the multitude of possible models, and their associated parameters, that can be used. This presents an obstacle. Because typically, you have to start by building those computational model code bodies from scratch, based on guidelines in books or papers.<br />This is especially a problem if you are an experimentalist, where your interests are not necessarily in modelling.<br />Sarid does the reader a huge favour. By offering not just equations, but functional code, implemented in a Mathematica framework, that you can tweak to your delight. Basically, the book and its website give you a computational lab, fully equipped.<br />The book also shows how Mathematica has become indispensible in research, by providing the necessary computational framework.	2004-06-18

While many textbooks on condensed matter have good theoretical treatments of solids, that is due in part to assuming that the solids are of infinite extent, and avoiding any &quot;messy&quot; boundary conditions, like surfaces. But surfaces are where chemical reactions and physical processes mostly happen.<br />The authors seek to redress this imbalance by giving us a huge sweep of what can happen at surfaces. Spanning chemistry, physics and engineering. For the latter, issues arise, like tribology (friction), and how the presence of microscopic things like dangling bonds at a surface can affect the frictional coefficients on a macroscopic scale.<br />There is a good treatment of spectroscopy; invaluable for analysing exactly what we have on a surface. Plus of course the use of an Atomic Force Microscope.<br />Some of you may be attracted to the hot subject of nanostructures, and how these might be fabricated on surfaces.	2004-06-18

Einstein, Born, Bohr...<br /><br />Enz also tries to give some insight into Pauli's personality and his dealings with his family.<br /><br />An enjoyable read.	2004-06-18

It shows 3 females, grandmother, mother and daughter. If you are a North American reader, they might initially appear to be black, or even Latino or Native American. But they are Australian Aborigines. (It's a painting by noted Australian artist Julie Dowling.)<br />I point this out because the book concerns issues of gender in a predominantly British-descended society, not unlike those of the US and Canada. The twist here is that you can compare the issues raised in this book, and the Australian society from which they were derived, with those of your country.<br />Not all the essays concern Aboriginal women. For example, one topic is about medical care in Australia between the World Wars; especially the availability of medical assistance to pregnant women. Another essay compares gender attitudes and rules in Australia, between the 1950s and 1990s.<br />A good, updated look at Australian society.	2004-06-13

Books	4	1	1	N	N	Very nuanced reasoning	Aks addresses what happens to women's rights when two identities collide. One is that of sex. The other is of ethnicity. Specifically, when the person is a Native American. She describes pivotal cases in the US and Canada where a tribe would restrict a female member's rights in some context that was specific to her sex. That is, a male member would not face such a constraint. Usually, this revolved around a most basic issue. The tribe might say that if she married an outsider, her children would not be members of the tribe. Whereas a man of the tribe who married an outsider would have his children be members.<br />Reading through the summaries of the legal arguments on both sides leaves one with the uncomfortable feeling that an attempt is being made to square a circle.<br />She compares similar situations in the two countries, in part due to the analogous arguments made and the opposite outcomes. In both countries, the tribes are considered largely sovereign. Hence the tribes argued that they should be autonomous in defining their memhership; the latter being a fundamental trait of a tribe. Even if this led to a dimunition of women's rights. In the US, the courts generally accepted this argument. But in Canada, the decisions went the other way.<br />Aks also explains her view. That it is ultimately possible to protect tribal women's rights without unduly impinging on tribal rights. A very nuanced position.	2004-06-12

That is really two questions.<br />The first refers to applying a well trodden theory of SQL design to your application. What tables should you conceptually extract? How should these be interrelated by judicious choice of primary and foreign keys? What are the germane attributes in each table? All these issues are explained by Davidson in the first part of the book. He goes well into discussing how to normalise data, and the numerous normal forms. He does this at a level independent of SQL Server. So even if your database is dB2 or Oracle or whatever, you should be able to profitably gain something from his teachings.<br />But having designed your database, now comes having to implement it. The second part of the book. Here is the SQL Server specific material. The details specific to its implementation do matter. But you know what? A fair amount of the examples use mostly standard SQL commands. In your application, you should probably strive to do likewise, to the maximum extent possible. It minimises the amount of inevitable lockin to SQL Server.<br />There are also sections in the second part that apply to any relational database. Like his description of best practices, in chapter 13.<br />Davidson presents a useful balance between design and implementation. A favourable contrast to texts that predominently deal with only one aspect.	2004-06-12

Barker and Palmer cover all the concepts of OO. But for this to be meaningful to a reader, you have to pick a language in which to express these concepts. They chose C#. In no small way because there are two OO languages in common use: C++ and Java. For each of these, you can easily find several well written books on how to implement OO in them.<br />Whereas C# is scarcely three years old. Certainly, there are books about it. But the authors have focussed on object modelling and use this, in a top-down fashion, to drive the description of C#'s properties.<br />If you are already fluent in OO from elsewhere, then you will breeze through the OO ideas here. I daresay that the authors would be the first to state that they invent nothing new in OO concepts here. But if you are new to OO, this book will certainly educate you.

Sexually, it put women on a par with men. But in Rhodesia, before majority rule in 1980, contraception triggered quite a different response amonst some of the Africans. Contraception, and indeed the entire rubric of family planning \\"was mass murder and genocide, a demographic attack on the African population\\", in one common view.<br />Talk about cognitive dissonance! How could something generally looked upon favourably elsewhere take on this meaning? In much of her book, Kaler explains. The minority white government employed family planning workers, to separately serve whites and blacks. The workers themselves sincerely tried to help their clientele. But in the government, there was a vocal element urging family planning to be applied to blacks, to reduce their fertility vis-a-vis the whites. Needless to say, such urgings leaked out to the blacks, and were in turn used by revolutionaries as agitprop against Ian Smith's regime.	2004-06-12

Parts of the book also touch on aspects of the war often ignored in books of fiction or non-fiction written for a US audience. General MacArthur is shown in his Brisbane headquarters, and a brief narrative sidenote is made of his good relations with the Australian Prime Minister Curtin. Plus there are other scenes in Australia. Outside Australia nowadays, it is usually forgotten that several hundred thousand US soldiers and sailors were stationed in Australia during the war. The war was after all a global conflict, so standard histories of it barely have room to touch on this. Being Australian, I found it refreshing to see a story with credible Australian scenes and dialog. For the latter, an example is where a person from 2021 says she went to \\"uni\\", whereas an American would say \\"college\\". The author is an Aussie, so that is how we see these nuances.<br /><br />The book is heralded as one of a trilogy. Good, because a later book may correct one thing that seems to have been omitted here. The technology from 2021 is too advanced from 1942 for the latter to easily make the weapons and tools used by the newcomers. But the computers can be used as computational engines, immensely exceeding the electromechanical dinosaurs of 1942. In fact, a German character points this out. But thus far in the plot, none of the Allied characters seems to have done this.<br /><br />There is a very specific and obvious application. The Manhattan Project. By 1942, it had the world's greatest concentration of scientists. A big problem for them, and the engineers, was getting numerical results from equations. Richard Feynman, for example, organised a group of women as cellular automata, passing computed numbers back and forth. Each woman had a slide rule or a calculator.<br /><br />To the Project, simply having a few computers, possibly with personnel from 2021 to operate them, would be a huge step forward. Also, the scientists of 1942 would certainly have been able to learn a programming language of the computers. Forget any fancy graphics. Just being able to code in a pure number crunching language like Fortran would have led them speed up the design of the weapons.<br /><br />Of course, there are all sorts of other factors. Just knowing that a fission bomb is possible would have helped morale. (In our timeline, we had to have Trinity to be sure.) Plus, the 2021 fleet seems to have had nukes. So there are possibilities like using a few of these, disarmed, to guide the Project's design. Assuming that the nukes are not too advanced to make this infeasible.<br /><br />Plus, simply from a storytelling vantage, if the author brings in the Project, it lets him have luminaries like Oppenheimer, Teller, Bethe and Feynman walk across the stage.cientists of 1942 would certainly have been able to learn a programming language of the computers.

Like the means of having circular or archival logging. So if you are just starting out as a dB2 administrator, you have quite a bit more to learn, just in this field.<br />On a tangential note: Suppose you have your own non-database application, with its own native data file format, and you want to regularly save its activities. Try looking at the ideas in this book for how dB2 does its duties. You might be able to abstract out the ideas and reinstantiate them in your context. The book presents the right level of discussion for this. One caveat is that IBM has a portfolio of patents around dB2, and I do not know the extent that you might be able to implement some of the book's ideas without infringing on the patents.<br />Of course, there is far more to dB2 than backups. The book goes into other topics. Like how to define and run a standby database, by sending log files to it in a systematic fashion. Or, how to make a &quot;split mirror&quot; warm standby.<br />My overall impression is that IBM has engineered a vast amount of backup and availability into dB2, to handle almost any level of transaction load. There is a lot more to dB2 than just being able to handle standard SQL.	2004-06-10

There are all sorts of small details to attend to, but this seems to be the gist.<br /><br />Well, Nilges has taken this one logical step further. He uses an example of writing a compiler in VB.NET. This is striking for two reasons. Firstly, quite aside from .NET, most people who might write a compiler would surely not choose VB, but instead a higher level language like C.<br /><br />But the second example is more important. As he makes clear, you can generalise the book's example into writing a compiler for a new language that you have invented. Of course, the amount of effort needed for your compiler may be far greater than his example.<br /><br />Step back a moment and consider what Nilges has given you. He shows that .NET can be used as a test bed for experimenting with languages. A level beyond most programmers, who write in languages, not write them. Also, by making your compiler in .NET, you get a chance to integrate your language's programs with those of the existing mainstream languages supported by .NET.<br /><br />The promise is there. Though a harder question is how big the potential audience is for this book. He wrote his example in VB instead of C# to maximise this. But ultimately, it may only be researchers in computer science. A select but small bunch.	2004-06-10

Topics discussed include how germs can attack humans, and the current precautions we can take. However, germs can evolve resistance, so we do not face a static picture.<br />Perhaps the scariest topics describe how a biolab can deliberately modify an existing bacteria or virus, to amplify its danger to us. Unlike nuclear proliferation, the technology required here is much less capital intensive and the knowledge base is far more widely dispersed.	2004-06-09

In one book, they try to show you how to design and code a full e-commerce application. From laying out the user interface and connecting its interactions with a server running a relational database. For the latter, they spend some time with an extended example that involves constructing a set of interrelated tables, with primary and foreign keys. Those of you already familiar with RDB and the various normal forms will be very comfortable here.<br />For the actual database, they illustrate with Microsoft SQL and the free MySQL. The code to connect is given in fair detail. Quite aside from anything else, the differences and similarities between these databases can be very useful. You can see the pros and cons of going with either. Heck, if you are searching for a book that compares these 2 common and important databases, this book is a good choice. <br />The book is a little curious in one way. The authors are clearly skilled, but they don't seem to use the formal Model-View-Controller (MVC) approach. Though you might see that the various pieces and interconnections they give can amount to this. Nor do they explicitly use the idea of an n-tier architecture. Perhaps they chose to omit these ideas to simplify the narrative. Since if you successfully use their ideas to build your application, the MVC and n-tier ideas can then have far more substance to you, when you later encounter them.	2004-06-09

Though computing is still chugging along at Moore's Law's rate, these articles are still quite germane.

Or, how to make novel arrangements of computers into a supercomputer. Plus, of course, the steady progress of vector supercomputers, which has been the traditional route since Cray pioneered these in the 1970s.<br />The articles are not just about how to make better supercomputers.

There is acute interest in being able to fabricate devices using silicon-germanium compounds or alloys, in the context of conventional silicon production techniques. The authors examine the various materials processing and fundamental properties here.<br />As they suggest, being able to economically make a direct band gap SiGe alloy layer inside a Si heterostructure sandwich could enable a Si-based device that is sensitive in the visible spectrum. And that hopefully has fair efficiency in converting incoming photons into current. The promise is that a SiGe alloy can be made with similar lattice constants to Si, and similar thermal expansion coefficients. So a device might be easier to make than trying to integrate Si and GaAs/GaAlAs, with their quite disparate properties.<br />Also, if the above becomes possible, then it might also be economic to build an LED or laser, emitting in this wavelength range, and fully integrated with current Si VLSI.<br />The book holds out promise for this goal. Though not yet achieved.	2004-06-09

He takes 10 trends in technology and suggests how these might proceed, and interact with each other in unexpected ways. To us, perhaps the best known trends are the wireless computing (cellphones), robotics and Web Services. With the latter, he includes what Tim Berners-Lee termed the Semantic Web. Another trend is grid computing, which IBM is pushing hard.<br />An important enabling technology for this future is JXTA, for mobile p2p networks. He suggests that it may have greater impact than Jini. In fact, he does a point-by-point comparison of the two, to Jini's disadvantage.<br />While the book is put out under Sun's rubric, and Sun has the copyright on the book, the above comparison suggests a commendable objectivity. JXTA is derived from Sun's Java, but it is now independent, whereas Jini is wholly owned by Sun. Now it should be said that other sections of the book describe quite favourably Sun's products; most notably Java. But since Sun's founding, it has indeed pushed the industry envelope on networking.<br />A very interesting side note he made was in comparing Java with C#/.NET. As you may know, a strongly claimed advantage for the latter is that you can write in other languages like Pascal or Visual Basic, that have been suitably extended to handle .NET, and then combine the resultant binaries made from different languages, into one functional form. But, independently of Sun, others have written &quot;translators&quot; that take source code in various non-Java languages, and produce Java bytecode. It turns out that there is relatively little demand for this. Goff suggests that it is because the bytecode is optimised for Java, and Java is expressive enough that you might as well  write in it. Similarly, he says that the multilanguage capability of .NET may find little demand. If this indeed turns out to be so, it negates the main advantage of .NET.<br />Some parts of the text has Goff waxing lyrical on complex adaptive systems in a fashion reminiscent of George Gilder's fevered silicon dreams, and of the longings of Extropians.

Of these, perhaps the simplest to understand are linacs - linear accelerators. In a fairly concise book, Wangler offers a clear elucidation of the main principles underlying most linacs, which use radio frequency techniques to accelerate the charged particles.<br />He discusses how the pulses of particles can drift, either transversely (that is, orthogonal to the beam direction), or longitudinally (in the beam direction). Both effects are bad, as they lead to a spreading out and dimunition of the luminosity, in area or time. He devotes separate chapters to these effects, as the countermeasures are somewhat different.<br />When two beams collide, or when a beam collides with a fixed target, the space charge effect can also be significant. He covers the various dynamics of this effect.<br />Overall, a good graduate text, aimed squarely at experimentalists.	2004-06-08

As this book explains, there are many problems. For example, the various magnetohydrodynamic equations can exhibit marked nonlinearities, which makes difficult the understanding of them, and the numerical simulations of the plasmas.<br />Actually, nonlinear effects can appear everywhere in the analysis. Like in considering the trajectories of the plasma across the phase space. Or in trying to simplify the reaction-diffusion equations, which is the core of the book.<br />Of course, these effects are not restricted to plasmas being studied in fusion research. The book points out that they can also arise wherever physicists deal with charged plasmas.<br />Perhaps the take-home conclusion to be drawn is that more research is needed to refine our knowledge and control of these plasmas.	2004-06-08

It surveys the then new field of making thin films by using pulses of high intensity laser light. The papers are written by experts in these methods.<br />Nucleation dynamics and how a film can grow under deposition pulses are explained in one chapter.<br />Several chapters also discuss the related subject of laser-induced ablation of surfaces. Studies are summarised of the characteristics of the ablated material. In some ways, ablation can be considered the inverse process to deposition.<br />One attraction of the deposition methods is to apply these in the construction of high temperature superconducting films. Typically, these are complex oxides, of 4 or more elements. The commercial viability of these materials depends in no small part on being able to manufacture them cheaply. The book has a chapter expanding on the praticality of this application.	2004-06-08

Singleton attempts to remedy that with a text aimed squarely at honours-level students (in the UK), which is equivalent to senior level undergrads in the US.<br />He starts with the simple Drude and Sommerfeld models. These are historically important, and also don't need much in the way of computation. They could not have, actually, since they were devised at a time (pre-1940s), when electronic computers were unavailable. Singleton then quickly moves to the tight-binding model, which leads directly into modern band structure.<br />From this, he shows how we get semiconductors and insulators. Then, how nowadays we can do better than nature. Instead of restricting ourselves to band structures of bulk compounds, we can synthesise heterostructures, and thus manipulate the resultant band structures in a quantitative fashion, giving novel and useful properties on a bulk scale.<br />This might also motivate some readers to do research into such new materials.	2004-06-08

It does not say &quot;Russian Women&quot;, for that can be taken to connote ethnic (Christian) Russian. Whereas she includes in her study  Muslim women, Jewish women, the women of the Volga Germans, and Finnish women. Probably out of praticality, she omits discussion of the Russian Far East (Siberia), which has enclaves of Korean, Mongolian, Japanese and Chinese.<br />The later chapters that deal with Communist rule may owe much of their detail to the fall of Communism, and the subsequent accessibility of many documents. This may have been further eased by these documents undoubtedly being seen as having no military value. Unlike say a history of Soviet rocketry or microbiology.<br />I found the most interesting sections to be on the Communist period. They did put the first female astronaut (V.

Like the friction of a billiard ball on a pool table. I grew up on Pong, and the rich texturing here is so amazingly removed from that! The discussions on how to collide two balls may not be fully correct to someone who had to deal with impact parameters in classical and quantum mechanics. But it suffices well in the book's simulations.<br /><br />Another chapter deals with using gravity, and will be useful to some of you. Takes the mystery out of incorporating at least a simple gravity in your games. Maybe it is nothing profound, but the results are very slick. And achieved with relatively little source code, which is thoroughly explained in the narrative.<br /><br />The level of detail of the physical simulations here does not approach that of some games by Activision and Electronic Arts, of course. But those are games developed with multimillion dollar budgets and teams of programmers. This book is suitable for you to develop a game by yourself.	2004-06-06

A problem that then arises is how to educate health professionals and students in this area about the basic physical principles behind these advances. Kane does a nice job of tackling the problem.<br />You don't need a degree in physics, or a heavy mathematical background to benefit from this text.<br />The idea behind lasers, and how they are used in surgery - from dermatology to retinal corrections to internal surgery - are clearly explained.<br />Of course, MRI and PET principles are covered, with the reader getting some appreciation of the immense computing power needed to obtain even the simplest images.<br />Even the century-old Xrays are explained. Though here one might imagine that there must be many existing texts with excellent discussions of this. But Xrays are included in this text for completeness.	2004-06-06

Written mostly for engineers involved in designing accelerators, and graduate students in physics who might have experiments at an accelerator.<br />No abstruse theory here. A book for experimentalists. Wilson describes clearly the differences between cyclotrons and linear accelerators and synchrotrons. The advantages and disadvantages of each. With real life examples, like those at CERN (of course), and at SLAC and Fermilab.<br />It does seem that the baton is passing from the US in this field. The European scientists have somehow managed to keep their funding together, which Wilson praises. He undoubtedly help bring this about. Certainly, an impression from this book is that if you are starting out in experimental particle physics, you might do best to direct your efforts at CERN.	2004-06-06

Here, he demonstrates his intellect and eloquence in 756 pages of compelling prose.<br />You can't fail to be impressed by how well he covers both the biological and the physical sciences. It is really tough to do both well. Perhaps Calder is a good successor to the late Isaac Asimov.<br />Very suitable (and recommended) for a high school or undergraduate reading. I would claim that this book is best directed at the high school level. For it is there that students may decide to pursue further studies in science, or not. And even for those who do not, the book gives an excellent and authoritative broad spectrum education in science, that they can carry with them in good stead.	2004-06-06

These unixes tended to be the most open for you to contribute applications to. So over time, a lot of hackers grew familiar with BSD.<br />This book offers you the fruits of some of that roughly two decades of tinkering. The author has grouped the hacks into a rough order. But, frankly, you may be better served by scanning the contents pages and then following your whims.<br />Perhaps the most useful advice is on the first page, preceding any of the hacks. Namely that you can try many hacks on any other open source operating system. In practice, the only such one you are realistically likely to encounter is a unix/linux variant. But I would go further than what the author says, and make a stronger suggestion to you. Even in a closed, proprietary unix, there is a good likelihood that a hack from this book might work. Maybe not as literally presented. You might have to modify some of the steps. But the upside is that it is a good test of your facility in that operating system and of how well you can follow the text of this book.<br />Thus, the title &quot;BSD Hacks&quot; is true, but overly conservative to  an experienced hacker. So how good are you?	2004-06-06

The authors have given us several of the crucial nexus points in the development of modern physics. Now, most students know that you should try to peruse the original papers. But there are practical difficulties. Like if these are written in a language that you cannot read. Or if the language is now totally archaic.<br /><br />So one vital service the authors have performed is to intermediate between us and the source documents. We judiciously get enough of the (translated) source text to hopefully get a feel for the tenor of the debates and the shifting worldviews implicit within these. Supplemented by judicious commentary from the authors.	2004-06-06

First, in arguing persuasively that you should use Apache as your web server. They cite the massive installed base; the largest of any web server. The only major competitor is Microsoft's Internet Information Server. But IIS has been continuously riddled with bugs. Whereas for Apache, these are rare. Plus, the Apache open source community can respond within a few days to a discovered bug. With IIS, you are dependent on Microsoft's schedule for a patch.<br />The second reason offered by him takes up the bulk of the book. Namely, how to install and maintain it. But this is not a bulky book. As he shows, the Apache community has expended serious effort in making this as painless as possible. Even for the tyro sysadmin, if that happens to be you.<br />Harkness gives details on how to use Secure Sockets Layer, and making log files, for example. In the latter case, he doesn't seem to say explicitly, but the log files still are not the easiest thing to analyse, even with what Apache offers you. There are independent programs that do a neat job of analysing and summarising those files. But these are not part of Apache, and so outside the book's purview. The good news is that if you get to this point in your usage, you will be very familiar with Apache.	2004-06-05

Much of this data has a natural hierarchical grouping. But traditional statistical methods proved inadequate at coping. The biggest drawback was the failure of the assumption of independence. If at the lowest level, Items I1,...,In are grouped into sets J1,...,Jm, where m&lt;n, then all the items in Jk have that value k. They are not independent in this dimension.<br /><br />To handle this, Hierarchical Linear Models were developed. The book gives a detailed treatment. A very comprehensive discussion. Including the handling of meta-analysis, where we wish to combine results across different studies. Which then involves using empirical Bayesian estimates. This method has also seen important usage in evaluating medical studies, conducted by different researchers on the same topic.<br /><br />The book also illustrates the essential development of non-trivial computer programs to perform the gruntwork.<br /><br />You will need a solid background in statistics to find this book useful. At a minimum, a year of statistics at the undergraduate level.	2004-06-05

It cleaves well into two portions. One deals with the timeless nature of writing clear, non-fiction text; totally independent of any computers. For example, it includes Part 2 of the book, entitled \\"Easy to understand\\", which spans 3 chapters, \\"Clarity\\", \\"Concreteness\\" and \\"Style\\". Even from the single word titles, you could guess that they are of this ilk.<br /><br />In contrast, the other portion of the book relates more to a computer and browser oriented presentation.<br /><br />Both portions are well put. But the authors and the publisher may have sold themselves short. The first portion, with minor tweaks, could be useful enough as a standalone text. But to a far broader audience than technical writers. It could be directed at the high school or undergraduate level, for a class on non-fiction writing. In my high school, we never had guidelines as cogently argued as this. I could have used it then. So perhaps could you.<br /><br />Thus, the pity may be that most who might benefit from the book will never chance to encounter it.	2004-06-05

The &quot;Man the the Ice&quot;. He had laid there since the last Ice Age. It was a precious opportunity for scientists to investigate human remains from that period, with clothing and tissue present and amenable to analysis.<br />This book is a partial summary of those efforts. (The third volume.) It actually spans analyses done on corpses found all over the world. These might have been deliberately or accidentally preserved, by various means. Discussions are made about the relative efficacies of those methods, from our standpoint, centuries or millenia hence; in terms of how much has been left for us to study.<br />The motivating event was that Ice Age man. As the book makes clear, from him, we have found much about human life and capabilities in that era.	2004-06-02

But in science fiction in 1975, he published a short, elegent and much acclaimed story, &quot;Child of All Ages&quot; in Analog magazine. It was nominated for the Hugo and Nebula awards for that year. Unfortunately, it did not win. But it is still remembered by many. Quite different from the standard story in Analog, which usually deals with cold, hard science and an ever upward spiralling technology.<br />I have not heard the cassette tape which is this item. But the story on which it is based is one of my favourites. It deals with a young girl, who looks less than 10. But she is immortal, and has been around since the Roman Empire. Science fiction has had many stories about immortals. But rarely have they been depicted as ever-children. Invariably, they are adults, and have a wide range of options and careers, at least within the constraints of the societies that they are currently in. But across most societies, children have rarely had this freedom. Which may well have deterred other writers. But Plauger succeeded uniquely in a scant 20 odd pages.<br />So if you are interested, check out this audio reading.	2004-06-02

Classical Mechanics has a storied past, dating back to Lagrange and Newton. Mathematically, the book gives you the important historical papers. But, just as importantly, the editors have furnished recent papers that give you an idea of the cutting edge, circa 1987, when this book was assembled.<br />There are discussions about chaotic behaviour in various dynamical ensembles, and about the onset to chaos. Very much a new thing in the 1980s. And, indeed, with still much to be explored.<br />The papers also hail from a variety of fields. Particle accelerators, plasma, solid state, chemistry and fluid mechanics. Gives you a good feel for the current diversity of ways to apply your research.	2004-06-01

By necessity, if you work in physics, you often have to specialise. Yet for intellectual reasons, if nothing else, it is good to keep up with what is in your occupation.<br /><br />For decades, the American Institute of Physics has tried to help, with earlier versions of this book. This is the latest update, from 2003. Compared to, say, the 1981 edition, there have been large changes. Perhaps foremost is the current prominence of computational ideas. Reflecting the decades-long surge of Moore's Law and the now ubiquitous computing power available to most physicists. So much so that simulations are now a de facto equal partner of theory and observation.<br /><br />The book also describes the current boundaries of particle physics, with updates on recent accelerator capabilities and results. If progress seems naggingly slow here, remember the sheer cost of those accelerators and the long lead time between design and first light.	2004-06-01

In part, this is dictated by what type of audience you are targeting.<br />The editors seem to have pitched this offering towards a high school crowd, or perhaps also towards primary schools. A nice, colourful reference, with text that is carefully written to a general audience. Understandably, there is an emphasis on topics with visual appeal. Nothing wrong with this, if it gets readers into the book.<br />The book is also economically priced. Affordable to school libraries on tight budgets.	2004-06-01

Certainly younger than Java or C++, which are the 2 most common OO languages. So chances are, some people coming to this book are still clumsy in C#. But I think it is also reasonable to say that if you are contemplating ANY book on design patterns, that you are fluent in at least one language.<br />Strictly, a purist might say that design patterns do not need to refer to a specific language. They are a level above code. But pragmatically, to understand them, it helps to instantiate examples in a language.<br />All this means that the book is good for an experienced developer who is still new to C#. You understand why design patterns are important. You can use the book to bootstrap your fluency in C# by studying the examples and tackling the supplied problems.<br />If you are indeed an experienced developer in another language, you might find the narrative more appealing than that in a Dummies-type book. The level of discussion that Metsker supplies is more advanced and challenging. More interesting.<br />Hey! He also gives answers to the problems.	2004-05-31

The theoretical underpinning of this book is essentially the Navier-Stokes Equation. A non-linear integro-differential equation. You can spend hours with the book, enjoying the intricacies of the various special cases, that together form fluid mechanics.<br />The advent of ever-faster computers, with massive memories, has also increased the practicality of a subfield - computational fluid mechanics. We can now realistically simulate many problems in three dimensions, with boundaries that are not just simple geometries, like a sphere or a half plane. Appropriately, the book gives CFD careful exposition.<br />Of course, the book also has an experimental side. Various instruments and experimental setups are discussed.<br />Very suitable for a graduate level class, or as a good reference for a lab.	2004-05-31

Typically, you face requirements, the combination of which is quite unlike anything on Earth. The instrument must usually be able to withstand low temperatures, on the Kelvin scale, as well as survive direct unfiltered sunlight. If parts of the instrument cannot tolerate this, then you might design suitable shielding.<br /><br />Also, will the instrument be orbiting Earth or will it go further out into space? If the former, then will it be inside the van Allen belts, or above? This dictates the amount of radiation shielding needed to prevent latchup in the electronics. Whereas, if the instrument is part of a spacecraft that will go into space, but not around a planet with a magnetosphere, then less shielding might be needed.<br /><br />Oh, the instrument needs to survive the launch, of course. Depending on whether it is launched from a rocket or from the bays of a space shuttle, the mechanical requirements for this can vary.<br /><br />The book goes into the above issues in detail; and many more. The overriding consideration is that repairs are usually impossible or prohibitively expensive and rare. Vital reading for anyone in the field.	2004-05-31

Likewise, most of the researchers are themselves of European descent. This book attempts to redress some of that imbalance. the authors study groups of poor women in South Asia and West Africa. Nor are the authors of European descent. This helps add diversity in the analysis of how marginalised groups of women can cope. While the regions surveyed are developing countries, the groups described here are typically regarded as poor, even by the prevailing standards of their countries.<br />A key finding is that the women are often marginalised in multiple ways. That is, they may have little access to health care, banking or other financial services, formal education or even political rights. The informal networks in which the women are part of, thus can be seen as a survival mechanism and perhaps one of the few ways in which the women can achieve some modest means of empowerment.<br />Overall, the book seems cautiously positive in describing how these women are coping, and perhaps improving their circumstances.	2004-05-30

Pettigrew of South Dakota	Books	4	3	3	N	N	relive the gilded age	In the history of South Dakota, Pettigrew was one of its greatest sons. He came of age in the aftermath of the Civil War. In his lifetime, the US filled the frontier and became the world's greatest industrial power. He played his part in this rise. Here Fanebust shows us a richly detailed and well researched biography of Pettigrew's trajectory.<br /><br />The Gilded Age comes alive in these pages, as Fanebust describes how Pettigrew rose to be the boss of the South Dakota Republicans, and the internecine jockeying for power within that group and at the national party level. The Free Silver movement and its intermeshing with the Populists throughout the Prairie states is given full exposition. Then, later, we see Pettigrew's passionate and astute support of the Spanish-American War.<br /><br />Strange though it may now seem to some of us, Pettigrew is shown as a prominent Republican with a strong strain of socialism; often railing against banks and plutocracy. It reflects the resentment often felt by farmers against the banks and the railroads. Pettigrew was also a promiment religious sceptic; certainly not a Christian. Another contrast with nowadays, where often the Republican party has become riddled with evangilical Christians.	2004-05-30

I read this with interest, because I used to be a male GTA in the 1980s, in physics. We always had a few female GTAs. But I do not remember any of them complaining that they felt undervalued or slighted by their students or faculty, due to their gender. Though perhaps, with me being male, they would not have discussed this within my earshot.<br /><br />The author conducted her studies in 1997, for sociology classes, taken by undergraduates, with male and female GTAs. She surveyed over 230 students, male and female. She found statistically significant devaluation of women's research relative to men's research, in agreement with studies done elsewhere. Consistent with a still prevalent dominance of men in the hierarchy of most universities.<br /><br />Perhaps a future direction for research might be to survey students in majors like engineering. It may well have been that sociology students might be more aware of, and less demonstrative of, such bias, compared to students in other fields.<br /><br />One unintentionally hilarious footnote was that she surveyed the mean times that students slept in class. Wow! This correlated not with the gender of the instructor, but the time of the classes. Anyone who has been to an 8 am class can empathise.	2004-05-29

With the plethora of print spilled about it, can anything useful be added? Well, Milstein and Dornfest have. They show many options that most users are simply unaware of.<br />Nifty capabilities that deserve wider knowledge. Perhaps the best is that you can search for an essentially arbitrary alphanumeric string. How is this useful? The string may be an ISBN. The results will often show the book listed under major booksellers like BookFinder, Booksmatter, eCampus and Amazon. Or the string might be a tracking number issued by USPS, DHL, Fedex or UPS. Or course, you could go to those websites and type it there. But if you are a heavy Google user, it may be quicker to start in it. Other useful cases are where that string is a US Patent Number or a Universal Product Code or a Vehicle Id.<br />But this book is independent of, and not endorsed by, Google. The authors demonstrate this by describing contexts where Google might not be suitable, and other search engines might be more fruitful. Like, if you want to see clustering of results, Google leaves you out of luck. Try Vivisimo instead. In this case, I don't know why Google doesn't offer this capability. Altavista had it in 1998. It surely can't be a technical limitation of Google.<br />Such examples of when to look elsewhere are reassuring. The authors DO recommend Google. After all, that is what this book is all about. But they are not bedazzled, and readily share with you its boundaries.<br />A crucial minority of you (Web administrators) may be intensely attracted to the discussion at the end of the book. AnSense and Adwords. These are ways to put ads on your website and (hopefully) derive revenue, and how to advertise on Google, respectively. For some merchants, the latter has lead to heavy sales to a global audience.	2004-05-29

From his own background, he extols the virtues of breaking out on your own and forming a startup. If you are very capable as a programmer and you can find a few others (&lt;10) of similar ability, and you then tackle a hard problem that afflicts many, great success might be yours. He cautions that of course, most startups fail.<br /><br />Some of his suggestions are intriguing and have been said by others. Like when he suggests doing hard problems, because these act as a barrier to entry to your competitors.<br /><br />He also suggest using Lisp as a development language, claiming that it gives you a productivity edge over someone coding in a different, less capable language. But he also says that large support libraries are also important. Well, in many applications, this latter factor may outweight using Lisp. For example, a Java programmer would not relish giving up her Swing graphics or the Collection classes, or have to recode these in Lisp if she can't find the equivalent functionality in an existing Lisp library. Likewise, a C++ programmer doesn't want to abandon the Standard Template Library.<br /><br />His chapter on using Bayesians against spam is outdated from the moment this book was published. Since Bayesians started getting deployed by mail servers, spammers have responded by poisoning the Bayesians. They put words or entire sentences that have innocuous content. In fact, content that is likely to occur in non-spam messages. This has been happening since late 2003. (Just yesterday, 28 May 2004, the Wall St Journal carried an article describing the phenomenon.) The broadening causes two things. Firstly, it increases the chances that a spam passes through the Bayesian and into your inbox. Secondly, and worse, it increases the chances that a non-spam gets misdiagnosed by the Bayesian as spam. If it then gets put into your spam mail directory, you may never see it.<br /><br />Overall, this book has some good ideas. But be cautious and don't accept everything in it.has some good ideas.

Existing countermeasures, like firewalls, and frequent patches of discovered firmware bugs, were fundamentally defensive. And did not actively try to understand the capabilities and intentions of the crackers/intruders/blackhats.<br /><br />This second edition describes what they term Gen 2 Honeynets. These are more sophisticated than Gen 1 networks of honeypots, where a honeypot is a computer expressly deployed for blackhats to intrude upon. The book delves in some length on how to construct a honeypot and a honeynet. Various configurations are possible. A honeypot could mimic a Microsoft computer or a Solaris or linux machine. There is more emphasis on the actual machine being linux, because of the open source nature, which has led to tools like Snort, Ethereal and Sebeb being available. Indeed, Snort-Inline and Sebek were developed by this project.<br /><br />Lots of craft keyboard sniffing (Sebek) and network sniffing (Ethereal). Plus, variant arrangements like having one computer pretend to be several honeypots are described. Or another, where a honeynet might be physically distant from the production net, but linked to it via a VPN.<br /><br />All this is scarcely the last word.

Rachel van Dyke was a young American woman who wrote a diary from 1810 to 1811. Unpublished in her lifetime. Indeed, almost certainly never meant to be published. In her diary, she poured out the circumstances of her life and surroundings, and her hopes and dreams.<br />She was clearly an educated, middle to upper class woman, at a time when any such education for a woman in her social class was somewhat unusual, though not unknown. The diary is quite literate. Its value to us is as a mirror into the lifestyle of women of the early 19th century. Because the literature from that time that was published by women is very scarce. Social mores were against it. So that some writers, like George Sand, felt compelled to adopt male pseudonyms. Those women that somehow did get published had to conform to the expectations of men.<br />This diary, however, was presumably not subject to that censorship. A rare find. There are suggestions of a demure romantic interest with one of her male acquaintances.<br />The book ends on an uncertain note. Unlike a novel, there is no clear ending. Historians have been unable to trace her life afterwards. She disappeared into the fabric of American society. One can only hope that she lived it well.	2004-05-29

As you know, Asimov had a prodigious output, and this book only covers up to 1974. This includes his classic Foundation series and the Robot series.<br />Patrouch deliberately aimed his analysis at a level intelligible by a mass readership. Unlike some analyses of Asimov in literary journals, which were done at more abstruse level.<br />He pans several of the Lucky Starr stories. These were Asimov's equivalent of Heinlein's juvenile stories. Except that some were rather badly done. Unsurprisingly, few of the Lucky Starr books are available these days.<br />More interesting is Patrouch's analysis of Asimov's better known works. Like his take on the Foundation series. Patrouch points out that Asimov often ignored classic writing tips in this series. Often, he builds up to a climax. Then, in the next chapter, we see a retrospective discussion after the event was resolved. Very much a cerebral approach, as distinct from how someone like Pournelle might have scripted it.<br />Patrouch considers \\"The End of Eternity\\" to be one of Asimov's best laid out and conceptually coherent novels. Very tightly integrated plot.<br />Perhaps the only pity about Patrouch's book is the lack of a newer edition. Asimov would later write extensions to the Foundation series, and other works, for which Patrouch's views would be interesting.	2004-05-26

These were then state of the art, and involved modelling the transport of various elements like potassium across the cell boundaries.<br />But computer hardware has improved enormously since then. Along with the understanding at the cellular level of many processes. So now, &quot;in silico&quot; simulations have become feasible for a wide range of biological systems. This book explores that range. From single cells to clusters/networks of cells, all the way up to entire organs.<br />At all these levels, different assumptions have to be made to render practical computational results. You can judge for yourself whether the assumptions are justified, and perhaps how future advances in hardware will let us relax these.	2004-05-26

Such is the dominance of US literature and culture over Canada that it can be difficult for non-Canadians to appreciate its history. Reinforced when considering British Columbia. Traditionally, Canadian culture has been centred on Ontario and Quebec. A third handicap is when a subject or backdrop is the native tribes of BC, who often rate cursory mention.<br />Vreeland tries to remedy this by giving us a work of historical fiction, set in the first 2 decades of the twentieth century, amongst these tribes. Her book is also a searing social commentary on the deprivation and misery endured by the tribes. Afflicted by disease and a demoralisation brought on by British conquest. In the book are depictions of a crusading Christian church and a local government bent on a coerced assimilation of the natives. To such extent that in this period, potlatches were banned?! As symbols of heathen superstition and backwardness.<br />Students of history will see echoes in similar policies carried out against the Australian Aborigines and the tribes of the US. Yes, this book is fiction. But perhaps it belongs in the same ranks as &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, which Dickens wrote as a contemporary denunciation of nineteenth century British poverty.	2004-05-25

Convenient, for you now have something that spans the most common algorithms encountered during computer programming. Logically, the combination of the two volumes is very coherent.<br />(Below is my review of the Part 1-4 book.)<br />In my work, I have a bunch of interlinked objects. I can use tables to display these, but showing linkages is awkward. It is far more natural to graph them. This lets me use evolution, for the human eye and brain are excellent at processing images and discerning patterns in them. But I also want to algorithmically find groupings and invariant properties of the graphs. There is a danger here. In graph theory, it is very easy to inadvertantly pose a simple question that is computationally hard to solve (NP-hard). Conversely, I don't want to reinvent the wheel. From graph theory, there may well be properties of my graph that I can easily extract. Certainly, the amount of research on graphs is voluminous.<br />But how does one take advantage of that? Consulting research journals in maths for papers on graph theory is really feasible only for the career mathematician. But for me, graphs are just a tool; not an ends per se. So I need a book that has the right amount of complexity. It needs to get enough into the subject, beyond the trivial exposition of definitions. Yet it should not bury me in lemmas and theorems.<br />I found such a book! This one. A well deserved third iteration. The explanations are extremely clear. Before I encountered this text, I used Donald Knuth's &quot;Art of Computer Programming&quot; (which is also put out by Addison-Wesley) and his treatment of graphs. But Sedgewick's discourse is far more extensive and, to me, just as well written.<br />A bonus is the extensive problem sets at the ends of each chapter. Even if I have no inclination to do them, the results they give are a valuable extension of the text, by providing an extra summary of the research. I only wish that Sedgewick would provide answers, like Knuth. But this is a just a quibble.<br />This edition has example code in Java. Certainly nothing wrong with that.

The authors term these Concern Slush, Tier Leakage, Hardwired, Validation Confusion, Tight Skins and Data Madness. Quite colourful and succinct. Apart from anything else, they should be commended for the terminology.<br />They suggest that the knowledgeable use of Struts can prevent these antipatterns. For example, they devote an entire chapter to showing with a detailed case study how you can validate an HTML form using Struts framework. As another example, a different chapter deals with the Data Madness antipattern. They demonstrate how to access your SQL database with a tier that isolates the specific properties of that database from the rest of your code. Far easier to switch or upgrade the database, if you desire.<br />Throughout the text are many instances of how the Struts XML configuration files gives you a simple declarative means of assembling your application. You still have to write actual code, of course. But the XML gives you a modular, extensible way to then plug the parts together.<br />Oh yes, they also emphasise another attraction of Struts. It is free and open source.	2004-05-24

He covers linux/unix systems and also Microsoft machines. An entire chapter, containing 10 hacks, is devoted to the latter. Most of the other 90 hacks can be applied to both systems, though the example implementations are usually given under linux/unix.<br />Perusing the list of hacks may cause different readers to be attracted to different hacks. Here, I briefly summarise a few that caught my eye. Consider &quot;Block OS fingerprinting&quot;. In an earlier, more innocent age, someone connecting to a telnet, sendmail or ftp daemon would cause it to reply with the machine's operating system label and the version of that daemon. Yes, really! In fact, this is still largely true, by default, on most unixes. Well, nowadays, a sysadmin can stop those daemons doing this. But a cracker can then do other probes. If you are running OpenBSD, you can use pf to block those.<br />Logically continuing this train of thought, what if you wanted to actively mislead the cracker by mimicking another operating system? This is the honeypot hack. The honeyd daemon lets you masquerade as several types of systems. Pretty crafty, eh? The next hack would then be to record all the cracker's activity on your honeypot via the open source Sebek, which is freely available for linux and Solaris.<br />Granted, you might be interested in other hacks. But hopefully the above gives you some idea of the book's utility. And a lot of hacks refer to other closely related hacks, in the manner shown above.	2004-05-23

Grew to depend on it as an authoritative discourse on serious unix interprocess programming. Now (finally!) he has issued an updated edition. (Has it really been 19 years?)<br />What is different? Much. Indeed, most of the book. In the first chapter, he summarises myriad developments in the unix world and, of course, the rise of linux. He writes for all the current unix variations and linux.<br />Since 1985, there has been a plethora of different interprocess communications methods. So the chapters on these form a prominent part of the book. Then, naturally, in the networking chapter, who can ignore the web? So Rochkind gives a concise detour into http, with example code for a simple browser and web server.<br />One thing unchanged from the first edition is the well deserved use of &quot;Advanced&quot; in the title. The treatment is sophisticated and, frankly, not an easy read for someone new to the subject. Rochkind writes well, but you do have to concentrate. He goes at a pace that at a very minimum assumes you are already facile in C and with using unix at the user level. The source code examples are simple, once you grasp the concepts.<br />The problems he furnishes in each chapter can be extremely useful if you want to deepen your understanding. The questions are nontrivial and usually expand on salient points discussed in the chapters. If you are indeed new to all this, you should make a serious attempt at the problems.	2004-05-23

It is attractive for an incisive, cutting analysis of 1960s science fiction. Blish does not go for easy kills by skewering minor authors. Rather, he concentrates on the biggest names of the time, like Robert Heinlein, who was at the height of his fame, having recently written &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; and &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;. Even if you adore Heinlein, it is worth reading Blish's critiques for a deeper view.<br />Blish also analyses another author who was also a noted critic, Algis Budrys. Here, Budrys comes off better than Heinlein, though his books sold fewer.<br />Most science fiction fans who have read Blish have mainly done so with his Star Trek novelisations, which weren't even his original works! Here, you can see his skill at analytic deconstruction.	2004-05-20

These were his first works of fiction. Some stories may seem quite roughly done compared to his later works, as he was still new to the art.<br />Most of the stories are set in the distant future of the 21st century. (Wee, here we are!) The scientific underpinnings are quite rigourous, befitting his background as a professional astronomer.<br />Those of you with backgrounds in physics or astronomy will understand some of the technical allusions. Perhaps the best example is in the story &quot;Killing Vector&quot;. Here, &quot;Killing&quot; refers to an actual physicist by that name, who did work in General Relativity. The story includes an extended pun on that name.<br />Alas, there will be no more from Sheffield. He died a few years ago. Though he did live to see this century!	2004-05-20

Now, it is 10 years after publication. Twenty percent there. Yet how far have we really come to the authors' suggestions?<br />Well, several predictions looked out and up to the solar system. Here, progress seems glacial. In conventional launch capability, there has been no significant reduction in launch costs. Though a positive point is the recent upsurge in innovative and cheap launch strategies. Without any breakthroughs here, the book's space visions will mostly come to naught.<br />Back on earth, technological changes have surged forward in computing. The authors wrote on the dawn of the Web. But they were farsighted enough to foresee an increasingly wired world. In the biological sciences, we are still at the start of a hard slog into such fields as a significant defeat of cancer or of a significant extension of longevity.<br />Science fiction fans may also be attracted to this book by its contributions from noted SF authors like Sheffield and Pournelle.<br />Overall, the book is quite commendable.	2004-05-19

But anyway... Both books are a rebundling of 3 short stories that were from the Man-Kzin series pioneered by Larry Niven. The stories originally came out around 1990-92.<br />Of these, perhaps my favourite is the Children's novella, by Pournelle and Stirling. From the entire 10 volume Man-Kzin series, this seems the most ingenious and intricate of the plots. Has a nice combination of battle scenes and social jostling and computer hacking. Given that 2 authors wrote this, it is amusing to speculate as to who wrote which passages. The battle scenes could equally well have been done by either; they are both known as military-SF authors. The hacking may have been done by Pournelle; as per his real life experience writing computer columns.	2004-05-19

He has not written many novels. But those that he did often garnered huge acclaim from a mass audience, as well as positive critiques from literary analysts.<br /><br />But if you are a fan, you might ask, \\"How did he do this?\\" (And if you aren't, why are you reading this?) To answer this, Warburton has given us an exhaustively researched biography, spanning his childhood in 1930s Britain to now. She had access to Fowles and his family, and also his original notes. This is reflected in the book's copious footnotes.<br /><br />The book itself can make for uncomfortable reading in the first half, before Fowles' \\"Collector\\" was published. Uncomfortable because it describes the daily struggles of Fowles to express himself. Nothing was inevitable. The many tortuous turns and the often financially straitened circumstances he was forced into. Warburton also gives us views into British society as it existed in those years, when class was such a distinguishing characteristic.<br /><br />Readers might contrast Fowles' experiences, and his wait till his mid 30s before success with that of, say, the polymath Isaac Asimov, who published as a teenager and then went on to produce over 300 books.<br /><br />Warburton strives to show the depth of Fowles' thoughts during those early years. And how these became reinterpreted in his novels. Indeed, after reading her efforts, you might be well served by re-reading Collector or his other works, for a deeper look at how Fowles worked his life experiences into his novels.	2004-05-18

Perhaps by the necessity of a limited budget. Or maybe you consider Open Source to be ultimately more reliable than closed proprietary code. For either reason, or better, for both, this book might interest you.<br />The authors shamelessly plug the combination of writing in Java and using Open Source applications that have arisen to support it. Starting with using Ant as a &quot;super-make&quot;. Then testing modularity and programmatically with JUnit. If you need to build business rules, why not try Marc Fleury's JBoss? Plus front end UIs can be enhanced with SWT, if you want a native look and feel, instead of the default Swing/AWT. Also discussed are JMX, JDBC, JNDI and more.<br />All these packages are free and by now are very well tested. Sam-Bodden and Judd try to motivate you with concrete code samples. Because the packages can be forbidding in their totality. The authors show how you can integrate them into your needs in a systematic and doable fashion. The complexity can be minimised.<br />As an extra fillip, they devote a chapter to the very hot topic of having Web Services support mobile clients, via something like J2ME.	2004-05-18

The last time was for \\"Man Kzin Wars X\\" by Larry Niven and Hal Colepatch, with Colepatch being from WA.<br /><br />So what is there to say about this book? Well, Mobily has brought under one cover various methods to strengthen Apache against incursions. There are several excellent books on computer security, but as a rule, they tend to survey the entire field. So if they mention Apache, space considerations if nothing else preclude extensive coverage. Here Mobily has made that a non issue.<br /><br />Why Apache? It is probably the most common web server in use, edging out all proprietary rivals. Linux boxes run it by default. But it has also been ported to every other major operating system. So certainly Mobily has chosen a vital application to support.<br /><br />How useful is this book? If you are a systems administrator and have been managing Apache for several years, you probably already know, or should know, the bulk of this book. But a lot of your Apache security experience may have been garnered in bits and pieces over this period, using information from disparate sources. Suppose instead you are installing it for the first time. The actual installation should be trivial. It is the multiple security issues that you have to get right.<br /><br />Which is this book's virtue. It centralises the issues into an easily accessible form. PLus it is not dependent on the latest version of Apache. Barring a fundamental rewrite, which is unlikely because it is stable and well tested, Mobily's suggestions should stay fresh for several years.	2004-05-16

He supposes that it is just you, and possibly your family, with your own machines. These days, for your context, he focuses on computers with a Microsoft or linux operating systems. Sadly, he gives little mention to Apple, though this has a devoted but small following.<br />He does not just discuss strict technical issues about, say, choosing the right secure settings for OpenSSH. If you don't know what that means, don't worry. In fact, it might mean that you could use this book.<br />Greene also goes into extended discussions of issues with some security aspects, but are not solely that. Like the merits of linux versus Microsoft. An entire chapter is devoted to this crucial topic. In this sense, the book's title is overly narrow. What he offers is a good discussion of topics you need to be aware of with your machine.<br />And he can certainly write fluently. This is not a hardcore technical book, with arcane commands and intricate procedures. Most of the book is straight prose that flows. There is a relative dearth of figures. Correctly so. The topics are often not tied to specific applications, where you might need diagrams to show how to go from one screen to another.<br />Which means there is actually another source of readers for this book. If you are well educated, but just not in computing. For whatever reason, you want a lucid, nontechnical explanation of important computer issues faced by many people.

Needless to say, the book goes into explaining SMIT at some length.

For several years, Solaris and HPUX required a reboot.<br />Of course, this book was written before IBM officially decided to throw its weight behind linux.

This is the essence of the question the book poses and then tries, fairly well, to answer.<br />One thing to note is that when the authors refer to the Internet, often it is the Web that is actually being cited. Namely, where information is made publicly available in a browser-viewable format. Nowadays, a company may often post large portions of its personnel directory and internal structure on the Web. Plus information about who its suppliers and main clients might be. In earlier days, such information might have been very closely held.<br />But now, for example, a company may feel the need to publicly state that it has certain clients, to give it credibility to potential new customers. These then become various ways for you to track your rivals and assess their capabilities.<br />The book expounds on this in far more detail, of course. But the gist of it is that by resourcefully using the Web, a company might gain a competitive edge.	2004-05-13

But how many of us know that originally, in India and Persia, she was represented by a male figure (a general)?<br /><br />Somehow, when chess reached Europe in the Middle Ages, this piece became the only female piece on the board. Yalom gives a fascinating account of the evolution of the game and the queen in Europe. She relates this to the growth of formidable Queens of various European countries. Given that chess and the changes in its rules and pieces' names were adopted voluntarily by its players, it bespeaks something that the queen as we know it was accepted across Europe. One could also say, using the same argument, that the fact that the most powerful piece became a queen in Europe, but not in the Middle East, illustrates something about the latter's cultural attitudes towards women.<br /><br />Yalom has highlighted an unappreciated view of how changes in chess reflected the European societies in which it was played.	2004-05-13

Seems like yesterday when Jobs and Wozniak kicked off Apple Computer in 1977. Or, just two years earlier, when Gates and Allen started Microsoft in New Mexico, before moving it to Seattle. The field has come so far. Now larger than mainframes. And Microsoft and Intel having larger market caps than IBM, who gave them the crucial original contracts for the IBM PC in the early 80s.<br />All these are discussed in this timely book. Though actually, it also mentions efforts in personal computing that predate Microsoft and Apple. Often ignored in other accounts. Which shows the good level of research done by the author. Of course, other companies, like Compaq and Dell, get a mention. Plus, influential magazines like the late Byte and the ongoing Wired.<br />You might find this book useful for its sweep and the ability to explain the gist of computing concepts clearly to a layman. It's not really a technical computing book. The emphasis is more on describing the significance of the main events, as would be seen by a historian.	2004-05-13

Its description forms the bulk of this book. The book factors neatly into two parts, which are interspersed as different chapters. One part is the above. The other deals with XML.<br />Consider the XML part first, because that is simpler, and Web Services build upon it. Even if you have no intention of using Web Services, this book has excellent advice on XML development. It assumes that you know about the syntax and parsing. So it doesn't waste any time going over that. Rather, it focuses on suggesting how to best implement/deploy it. Chapter 5 includes a nice analysis of the limitations of XML Schema and DTDs. Plus, there is something which lower level XML books often don't discuss. In those, XML examples are given using lengthy labels in tags, that have human-readable utility. Which is a strength of XML. But this comes at a cost of greater storage and processing time and bandwidth (when you transmit the XML). Given that XML is meant to be processed by software, and that humans should often only view it directly as a manual exception handling process, then having shorter tags might sometimes be acceptable, if you want to improve performance.<br />This is something I've encountered in my own coding, when I write/read 100Mb XML files. The sheer size of these leads me to define tags with labels of just one or two characters. Which does make them harder to manually read. But my reading routines run faster.<br />Erl also suggests that if you have personnel who want to learn XML, books may be far cheaper than training courses offered by third parties. Granted, this is a little self-serving, because he is saying this in his book. But no more so than asking some consulting company if you should hire them to teach XML.<br />Now consider the Web Services part of the book. There has been a veritable laundry list of second generation technologies developed. Like Transaction, Coordination, Security, Policy, BPEL4WS, Attachment and Addressing. Erl tries to pull these together into a coherent usage framework. The book does not go into the details to each technology. That is the purview of other books. Rather, Erl discusses integrating these into your development. Helpfully, he points out that any specific application usually only needs a subset of the above. Which is vital in learning and using them in a modular fashion. Analogous to how in java, you don't have to know all the class libraries that come with the latest java, in order to usefully program.<br />He offers another tip which alone may justify the entire book to you. If you asking a vendor for a full enterprise WS conversion of your legacy applications, she often gives a hub and spoke model. In this, the spokes are modifications of your applications, and the hub is written by the vendor. Typically, this gives a vendor lockin.

As Americans increasingly get wired up, the major parties are increasingly using the Internet to build up and expand their base. Plus, it enables challengers like Howard Dean to aggressively solicit supporters.<br />All these give an affirmative to the broad thrust of the book's speculations. It does indeed appear that the Internet/Web is an enabling of far broader grassroots participation in democracy.<br />When the book discusses the live broadcasting of the British Parliament on TV, it turns out such events have had lesser impact on people. Partly because, like the radio broadcasts which British and Australian Parliaments have had for years, these attract only a small audience of diehards.<br />In part, this might be due to those being broadcast media. Whereas, with the interactive nature of the Internet, with things like email, to some people this may be far more attractive.	2004-05-12

And certainly, there have never been any shortage of SA books for major operating systems. A trend that has continued to this day.<br /><br />This book offers a different take. It presents SA issues common to many operating systems, from mainframes to PCs. Plus, it puts them in a historical context. Many of these ideas were first discussed at various LISA conferences over the last 20 years, when research ideas start to move into implementations.<br /><br />A virtue of the book is that it helps to put SA on a good founding as a coherent engineering discipline. Alas, most SAs have little appreciation of the broader scope of what they deal with, beyond the operating systems that they are currently managing. This book may help correct it, if any of those SAs get around to reading it.<br /><br />It's also a good read, from a career perspective. SAs are certainly aware of Moore's Law and the continually changing hardware and software they deal with. This book helps make clearer ideas that you can carry with you, as your environment changes. Makes you more adaptable. Evolve or die!	2004-05-12

Of all the companies that arose to make a business around linux, Red Hat is perhaps the most successful, at least in the US. Many people wanting to install linux on their machines, or those buying machines with linux pre-installed, often encounter Red Hat's version. Accordingly, this book is in its 4th edition, updated in part because linux keeps expanding its functionality. But another change from previous editions is due to Red Hat replacing Red Hat Linux with an Enterprise and Professional versions. Plus, a group of volunteers, independent of, but supported by, Red Hat, split off a version called Fedora. The reason for Red Hat's actions seems to be a search for higher margins. Anyway, McCarty describes both the Enterprise and Fedora. As he explains, currently there is in fact little difference. Mostly due to the recent divergence.<br />If you are currently using an earlier Red Hat Linux, and feel quite comfortable with it, then you might want to just glance at this book to decide if you find enough need to upgrade now.<br />But if  you have never used linux, of any ilk, then perhaps this book might be more useful. If you are going to migrate, you might as well do so to as recent a stable version as possible. McCarty presupposes no prior knowledge of linux or unix on your part. He explains clearly the salient features. The numerous screen captures are well chosen, in support of the text.<br />But you should be aware that McCarty does assume some prior acquaintance with computers. Most commonly Microsoft or Apple. In keeping with the O'Reilly tradition, the book does not start from scratch.	2004-05-09

This book, in just this one volume, gives you an incisive description of information theory. It assumes that you have no prior experience in this field. It develops the theory from the first principles of Claude Shannon, and rapidly shows you his major results.<br />If you are a student, a valuable and essential part of the book are the several hundred questions. You really need to tackle as many of these as you can. By doing so, you can substantially deepen your understanding of the subject. The problem sets are probably also another reason why this book has become a common text in Information Theory classes.<br />The first edition of this book (and now hopefully this edition!) has been compared by some to Richard Feynman's Lectures on Physics, as a standard and authoritative book in its field.	2004-05-09

While Microsoft overwhelmingly dominates the desktop market, on the server side, things are far more contentious. Hunt offers us here his vision of how to use a linux machine for many practical server duties.<br /><br />He starts by explaining how to install linux. Then how to set up accounts for users and, very importantly, how to properly set up a mail server. Email was the first killer app of the internet, and configuring a mail server is probably one of your most important duties. A nice thing as shown by the book is that once you have a mail server running, there is relatively little maintenance. (With the notable exception of performing various antispam techniques.)<br /><br />Other sysadmin duties are then explained. If you have already been a sysadmin for Unix machines, then there should be little difficulty here. The difference between linux and any given Unix version is no greater than between that version and another Unix version.	2004-05-09

The Nasdaq index peaked in March 2000, and that is taken as the high water market of the high technology boom, a grouping which encompasses the dot coms, startup telecoms and the biotechs. So you might read this book as a retrospective on those times. Especially if you had fruitlessly invested some of your own funds in any of those startups.<br />Kettell's ideas for new metrics by which to evaluate these and future startups are interesting. Though some (many?) might consider these to be discredited by the multiyear slump after March 2000, and the resultant bankruptcies of numerous startups. It was then said that the traditional metrics of performance were still best, and time-tested.	2004-05-09

You may wonder, is the book still relevant?<br />Yes, for two reasons. Firstly, the rate of improvement of display hardware has not been as rapid as Moore's Law, which tends to apply to memory/cpu/disk. CRTs and thin displays tend to drop in price far less rapidly.<br />Secondly, many of the issues described in the book are largely independent of any specific hardware in which they are implemented. Like the suggestions for optimal ergonomic design. Or, in a given display, how to layout the information.<br />But having said the above, there is one thing that has arisen in the intervening years that is little covered in the book. Nowadays, cellphones have become far more common and far more powerful. The latest have colour displays. As time goes on, we can expect these displays to have ever greater resolution. So now, in some platforms like J2ME, the design of software optimised for such constrained hardware is an important issue.	2004-05-09

So much so that one might need guidance to the best/most reliable websites. Hence Jiao has produced this book.<br />But this type of book ages quickly. The listing of over 1400 websites with financial data is indeed quite useful. But it can easily grow stale. This type of information is better maintained on a website.<br />By contrast, other portions of the book have slightly greater utility. The classification of the various investment subjects that a reader should be aware of is good. And likewise for the general description of desirable traits in a website. However, when Jiao then assesses the main websites in each subject, that too ages badly.	2004-05-09

The narrative is straightforward to follow, and does not involve much previous acquaintance with linux. It does help, however, to know some Java, going into this book, which does not attempt to teach it, per se.<br />You can see that it is easy to install a web server container, and to hook this up to a backend database. All of which can be free, open source code! Given that this rests on a free linux operating system, the combination is ideal for startups or those of you on limited budgets.<br />An alternative reason for using this book is pedagogic. You can learn about running web servers and databases, even if you have no current need, but want to understand and be able to say that you know this material. For example, if you want to upgrade your job skills.	2004-05-09

Then, Fortran was the main language for numerically intensive applications. (Go back far enough and it was the only language.) So Fortran was taught from that perspective.<br />Likewise with this book. The emphasis is from the point of view of a user who is NOT a computer scientist. Rather, she hails from some other subject, and needs to know enough of Java to apply it to her problems. A very utilitarian approach. Java purists might bewail this, but remember, not everyone can be, or desires to be, a full time programmer.<br />If you are a physical science major (especially in physics), or an engineering student, then you should have the ideal background for this book.	2004-05-09

Technically, that is usually difficult for any author, for it can make the plot line somewhat disjointed. To some extent, this has happened here. The reader does indeed have to focus carefully on the frequent shifts in narrative.<br />The dustjacket quotes a reviewer who compares Ellis to the great American author of the early 20th century, Willa Catha. Indeed, there are similarities. Though whereas Catha tended to write about the windswept Great Plains, Ellis gives us a diorama spanning 40 years of the bleak hardscrabble ambience of rural Wisconsin.<br />Personally, what I found most interesting was precisely that depiction of Wisconsin and its ethnic German communities. The book gives an insight, presumably accurate, into a milieu that few readers outside Wisconsin might be familiar with.	2004-05-09

If you peruse a list of their recent offerings, this book stands out as rather more specialised. Certainly, in general there is no shortage of linux books, from a variety of publishers. But typically such books are aimed at using linux or they describe applications built atop it. Whereas the technical ability and interest in actually understanding and changing any operating system (not just linux) acts as a tremendous barrier. Hence, the potential audience for Gorman's book is quite exclusive. An upside is that it reduces the potential competition from other authors and publishers.<br />Gorman is attempting an outreach to potential linux developers. The book has two parts. The first explains key concepts for the VMM. He quickly gets into the issues, with little preamble. In other words, you need at a minimum to be fluent in C, and have some acquaintance with the ideas of memory management, though not necessarily with linux.<br />Each algorithm in this book is not that intricate. As a rough guide to difficulty level, if you can understand a typical algorithm from the texts by Knuth or Aho or Sedgewick, then you should not have any trouble here.<br />The second part of the book has code listings with accompanying detailed commentary. This is different from, and substantially improves upon the inline comments, which are sparse to non-existent in the exampled code. To some of you who want to try changing code, the second part's annotations may be the crucial portions of the book. It is rare to see such extensive commentary of source code in book form.	2004-05-08

WarDriving is a (sub)cultural phenomenon that has emerged with the rapid growth in WiFi networks. As these have increasingly been adopted by the great unwashed, the vendors have gone to great lengths to simplify the WiFi access setup. Often, this has led to people turning off any encryption, and choosing the vendor's default settings, including for passwords. Hence, as the author points out, some hackers use their computers in cars and cruise around a city, looking for any open access points.<br />This book has two audiences. The first is those who want to WarDrive. Here, you find all necessary nuts and bolts information about configuring your computer, be it running MS Windows or Linux. Plus descriptions of antennas. Enough to get you up and running, or driving, as the case probably is. You should find it quite facile, if you follow the book's guidelines.<br />The other audience is those of you running a WiFi net, or planning to. By squinting a little at the text, you get simple and effective advice on preventing unwanted access.<br />Did I say 2 audiences? There is a third, which may have some intersection with the others. Suppose you just want to learn more about WarDriving, perhaps out of pure curiosity. This book is ideal for that. The author is the organiser of the first 3 WWWarDrives. Well qualified to expound on this subject. The chapter on WWWarDrives will be good in later years, from a historical viewpoint.<br />As a bonus, Hurley &quot;exposes&quot; WarChalking. This is a meme that spread widely in 2002. Hurley claims that amongst actual WarDrivers, few actually do this. Basically, WarChalking is a cute, easy to understand idea, especially because it is so visual. Which undoubtedly helped the general media latch onto it and spread it.	2004-05-07

The authors focus on describing the key points of J2EE 1.4, that most users can expect to need, most of the time. The reason this is necessary is because J2EE in this latest iteration encompasses a group of subjects, each of which can be, and has been, the sole subject of a book.<br />Specifically, we have Java Server Pages and Java Servlets. These are often used to make dynamic web pages, within a web server container like Tomcat, which gets an appendix of its own here, due to its importance.<br />As a practical matter, these JSPs/Servlets often hook up to databases. So J2EE involves using JDBC. Another 2 chapters here.<br />Business logic is often encapsulated using Enterprise Java Beans. These are now quite mature. Their widespread use in a J2EE context is reflected here in the 4 chapters devoted to them. These include a discussion of the recently introduced Message Driven Beans, used in JMS.<br />Finally, 2 chapters are given over to Web Services. Here the discussion is somewhat skimpy. Not thru any fault of the authors. Web Services are currently very inchoate. Much is being claimed for their future potential. But in terms of what is defined and available right now - well there isn't much. If you really are interested in Web Services, try a companion volume from the same publisher, &quot;Google, Amazon and Beyond: Creating and Consuming Web Services&quot; by Nakhimovsky and Myers.<br />The utility of this book is in letting you quickly come up to speed on J2EE. As a practical matter, once you have done so, you may want to get comprehensive books on the specific J2EE subjects that you will be dealing with. A virtue of this book is that it deliberately is NOT comprehensive. But it gives you the gist of each subject.	2004-05-07

In large part to reduce the complexity often present in current computing environments.<br /><br />Sadly, the message is undermined by signs of hasty writing and slipshod proofreading. In the three pages of the Preface, there are 7 typos. Not a reassuring sign for the reader. Especially if you read the blurb on the back cover, and then read the Preface for more information, as part of your deciding whether to get the book or not. The rest of the book contains more typos. Plus, several figures, like Fig. 5.1, are poorly done. They look like screen captures, where the detail is blurred. The figures should have been redrawn, using some graphics package, for greater clarity.<br /><br />Then there are inaccuracies, like this: \\"More importantly, despite Microsoft, IBM, and other proprietary software suppliers' rapid involvement, the Internet started life as openly as possible, with shared code as the normal mode.\\" Well, the Internet's first connection was in 1969. Microsoft was not started till 1975. Six years later. It had nothing to do with the early Internet. And even after Microsoft was founded, for several years, its products were for isolated personal computers, possibly being able to communicate via modems. The implementation of an IP stack in MSDOS did not come till the 1980s.<br /><br />Well alright, you might say. Can we put these aside? What about the overall message? Okay, it is aimed at the management level. For example, you need to know about XML, which is one of the underlying standards used, but you do not necessarily need to know how to use XML itself, though that certainly does not hurt.<br /><br />There is some overlap in content between chapters. Probably unavoidable. It does have the advantage that you can pick an arbitrary chapter to start reading from, and not have to know much about the preceding chapters.<br /><br />At the book's level of discussion, it does furnish a good overview of IBM's efforts in this field. Plus the descriptions of competitors' offerings seems pretty objective. The overall impression given is that much remains to be fleshed out, by the entire computer industry, in terms of building actual autonomic systems.<br /><br />===================================================<br /><br />In an earlier review, I stated that there were several typos in the book; specifically 7 in three pages of the Preface, and others later in the text.

But the text says \\"The agent delivers the results to the user.\\" A key role for the agent is to mediate between a user and an application, so that the user never has to directly deal with an application.	2004-05-06

Now, scarcely a year late, he has brought forth the second edition. One could be cynical and say that a second edition is in part to trigger users of the first edition to upgrade, much as some hardware and software vendors might so. But WiFi has been growing rapidly on several fronts. It is a measure of its vitality that in the space of a year, this new edition is indeed useful.<br />Here are the salient recent developments, as explained by Duntemann. For starters, the IEEE 802.11g is now well defined and a slew of products has become available that support it. So much so that Duntemann recommends that you consider 802.11a products obsoleted by these, in most circumstances. Related to this, he provides an updated assessment of many types of 802.11 hardware.<br />A common need by some WiFi users who travel is knowledge of public hotspots. A chapter is devoted to this topic, with summaries of major networks like Boingo and T-Mobile. A field in major flux.<br />Every text on WiFi talks about security. Because when you use wireless, anyone in the vicinity could evesdrop. But this book is slightly unusual in the amount of attention devoted to it. Fully 5 chapters (a quarter of the book) expound on security. The level of this discussion is necessarily technical. But not forbiddingly so. Hopefully, most of you can glean something from this, if you pay attention.	2004-05-05

An environment in which you can program, with a lot of supporting utilities. Well, this book is also an IDE in its own right, where here IDE means an Integrated Design Environment, in the context of mobile applications. Aimed at the burgeoning field of smart portable devices, that usually communicate in a wireless fashion.<br /><br />The authors describe two main types of design efforts. The first is that of designing the UI for these mobile devices. Typically, there are severe constraints of screen size, resolution and power consumption. Care has to be taken because, after all, this is what the user sees.<br /><br />The second effort is in choosing and designing an architecture for this UI to interact with a server. Various issues are discussed, like how much \\"intelligence\\" will reside on the device (\\"fat\\" versus \\"thin\\"). And on the server, whether to have a 1, 2 or 3 tier system.<br /><br />The authors are at HP, and the book is part of the HP Professional Books series. Yet, search though I did, I could find no bias towards HP. In the narrative, there is only one mention of an HP product, OpenView, but this is in the context of listing various vendors' offerings. A very commendable, objective, vendor-neutral text. The design guidelines could be applied to most choices of current hardware, on the mobile device and on the server side. Plus, at the software level, you could choose a J2EE/J2ME or .NET approach. The book's advice supports both.	2004-05-02

He has produced a How-To for Eclipse, geared towards the Java programmer. Eclipse is an Integrated Development Environment that is free. IBM is reputed to have spent $40 million in its development, before putting it into open source. Since then, the enthusiastic response by programmers has led to even more improvements in its functionality.<br /><br />When Holzner calls Eclipse an IDE, he means more than just the ability to develop a standalone Java application. Some of you may have used IBM's Visual Age for Java. It was quite a nice IDE, and Eclipse is descended from it. But VAJ was really geared towards a standalone context. In contrast, these days you might have to build an application that will be used in a web server. Holzner shows how to do this, using Tomcat as the web container. Plus, if there will be several of you working on a project, and you need a version control system, he describes using CVS with Eclipse. Also, for an easy installation of your application, he gives examples of using Ant and Eclipse.<br /><br />These examples (Tomcat, CVS, Ant) were chosen deliberately. They are probably the most common tools/programs in their fields. And they are free.<br /><br />In this way, the \\"Integrated\\" in IDE takes on a powerful meaning to a Java programmer.	2004-04-30

But over the next few years, this is expected to be exhausted, as China and other developing countries increasingly come online. Plus as your digital camera, car, cellphone and PDA are increasingly likely to have their own Internet addresses. Beyond IPv4 is IPv6, using 128 bits.<br /><br />So the question is not if IPv6 will be implemented, but when. Concomitant with this are questions about its viability, and, as a huge practical matter, how can it be incrementally deployed, side by side with existing IPv4 networks? Plus, how can mobile devices (think cellphones as the prime example) efficiently use IPv6? This is the subject of Soliman's book.<br /><br />The bulk of the book revolves around a problem which can best be described by a simple analogy. Suppose you have a cellphone with a phone number, which includes an area code. Nowadays, you can take that phone to any region in your country that supports cellphones, and expect your phone to work. Even if you are outside your area code. The phone companies have implemented algorithms that allow this.<br /><br />Mobility in IPv6 deals with the corresponding problem on the Internet. Imagine now that your cellphone or other device has a fixed IPv6 address. This is desirable so that others can contact you. Many issues now arise, along with possible solutions, as explained by Soliman. Like authentication and authorisation. That is, if you go to another IPv6 network and try to connect, it must somehow ascertain that you have a valid IPv6 address elsewhere.<br /><br />Or consider the very act of moving between two IPv6 networks, when you are communicating with someone else. How can that person's messages be forwarded to your new (temporary) IPv6 location, and how can it be done efficiently?<br /><br />The book describes these problems (and others) and their proposed solutions in detail. I say proposed solutions deliberately. As Soliman makes clear, some of these solutions will need further research as to their efficacies, and may well be modified as a result of this. You can get a clear sense of the subject and what the key issues are from this book.ese solutions will need further research as to their efficacies, and may well be modified as a result of this.

The book shows how this can be done with or without a supporting XML Schema or DTD that describes the XML. The authors explain why this goes beyond a Google-type search. The latter does not (at least currently) know or use any structural information about data, primarily because it scans all types of mostly unstructured data.<br />But the rise of XML has driven demand for XQuery, to take advantage of this structure. The book also shows how XPath is used, as part of the XQuery implementation.<br />Another merit of the book is its good description of the difference between XQuery and XSLT. The latter also has been getting a lot of attention from programmers. But, as explained by the authors, XSLT is mainly used on document centric data, mostly to generate HTML. By contrast, XQuery has no such restriction.	2004-04-30

Schaffer emphasises finding the right people, starting at senior management, as much as the tasks that the people then do. The 'institutionalisation' in the title refers to this emphasis. He contrasts this with standard usability texts that focus on the methodology instead of the people who have to perform it.<br />Speaking of methodology, he devotes an entire chapter to it. He shows a figure of the old way, where the design of a technical solution was done first, followed by a design of the interface that would overlay it. He suggests reversing this order. Not bad, and probably valid in most cases. But there is one important case where the old way is still viable. Research. Where it is not certain that a solution exists. By necessity, investigation and implementation of a solution should come first. Because if it cannot be done, interface design is moot. Granted, most of his book refers to a commercial product, so the rejoinder could be that a research situation is outside the book's scope. But just keep this in mind when reading it.<br />He also includes a very topical section on the challenges of offshore staffings. (Indians, anyone?) It is certainly possible, though not trivial, to integrate such staff into the entire design cycle, in his experience. Of course, some American readers will find this unsettling. But it should not be a surprise. As offshore staff gain in experience, inevitably they will be able to do this.	2004-04-29

The attraction of its open source and free nature is compelling to many. So much so that it is part of the so-called LAMP, with Linux, Apache and PHP. It does not have many advanced features that Oracle and IBM's dB2 possess. But what it has often suffices for many purposes. The intent of this book is to go beyond the material often covered in an introductory MySQL text, whose main purpose is to teach syntax.<br /><br />The book shows how you can tune the performance by adjusting the sizes of various buffers, and other tweaks. Combine this with a means of load balancing and you have a database capable of mission critical commercial applications. It also discusses backups. Mundane, actually. But you need to be able to do this, in anticipation of the inevitable crash. If you need a mirror, the replication capability comes in handy. The book shows how to easily do this.<br /><br />But for a book that talks about advanced features, it would have been nice if it had briefly spent some time explaining certain crucial features currently lacking. Like no means of doing stored procedures. This is an important optimisation ability in other databases. Another thing lacking (except in a very limited context) is foreign keys. In the theory of databases, this is extensively used, and other databases do implement this.<br /><br />Granted, the company MySQL.com is continuously adding functionality. In time, MySQL will probably have the above items. But until then, a book like this would usefully serve its readers by also explaining the current limitations.	2004-04-28
689340:US	38491967	R3700BGN7F13X2	1590591097	199753337	The Definitive Guide to GCC	Books	4	53	54	N	N	Greatly expands the standard documentation	To some of us, gcc is an old friend. It has been around since the 80s. Predating linux, and from a time when free open source code was something weird. Gcc is a collection of compilers, and if you have a linux machine, gcc appears on it by default.<br />But if gcc is free, why do you need this book? Well, the authors discovered a curious omission in the computing marketplace. There does not seem to be any other book in print, devoted to gcc. Other programming books, if they refer to gcc, do so only briefly. You might then ask, &quot;can't I just use the accompanying documentation?&quot; Yes, but that documentation is geared towards the experienced gcc user. It is terse at the best of times, and portions can be opaque.<br />Wall and Hagen point out that this lack of understandable documentation often turns users off gcc. They end up never using many of the powerful features added to it by experienced designers over the years. You should exploit their efforts, via this book. It explains at length the innumerable compiler options that most users never try. After reading this book, you do not have to shy away by using simple Makefiles. You can get enough understanding to actually build more powerful Makefiles; that use more fully gcc's potential.<br />The book also treats affiliated programs. Like gcov for doing test coverage analysis. Or libtool, to make libraries.<br />The heft of the book also answers a possible objection to the authors' efforts. That is, is there really enough to discuss to warrant an entire book? Indeed there is. Between the detailed discussion and a plentitude of examples, you might gain some appreciation of why the standard gcc documentation has been fleshed out here.	2004-04-28

Highsmith writes gracefully and most of the book sounds sensible. To me, the key point in APM is the continuous innovation. If the cost of experimenting falls sufficiently, then the people working on a project should seriously consider an overall strategy of attempting development phases that are, say, a week or so in length. And iterating. The idea is to explore as much as possible, with the cost in time being minimal.<br />This is in contrast to the conventional method of drawing up detailed specifications and a timeline, at the start of a project, in Pert or Gantt charts, and then forcing development to conform to those specifications and schedule.<br />[The continuous innovation and reduced delivery schedules are also explored at length in a companion book, &quot;User Stories Applied&quot; by Cohn, ISBN 0321-205685.]<br />Perhaps the best nugget I found in Highsmith's book is that &quot;agility&quot; involves an optimal amount of structure. He illustrated that by saying that in a highly changing development environment, a rigorous configuration management discipline is essential as the bedrock framework. In software, that is spot on. The quicker your group's code changes, the more the need for strict checkin. Invariably, rollbacks (oops!) are necessary.<br />APM may work best for software and small hardware projects. Where you can experiment cheaply, especially with simulations. For large hardware projects, this basic premise may not hold. The widespread use of Pert and Gantt charts, and the techniques behind these, exist not entirely, or even mostly, because of inertia. Expert judgment does usually go into these, and sometimes there is no other alternative.<br />His putdown of Business Process Reengineering is that its greatest flaw was in elevating process over people. Some of you will surely have wry grins over this.	2004-04-26

The first is the usage of linux as a free operating system. This has intersected with the second trend, wireless networking. The book is a detailed description of the extent of this overlap. To some of you, it will be a sign of the vitality of the linux market; that it already has and continuous to develop support for the major wireless modalities.<br />Half the book is devoted to WiFi. A direct measure of its popularity. It describes the various types of hardware available for the different 802.11 protocols. Specific instructions on installing and using. They also provide an entire chapter on the installing and running of an access point. Some WiFi users have this as their key need, because the access point is how a WiFi net communicates with the rest of the world.<br />Other types of wireless interactions are possible. Bluetooth. Infrared. Cellular. GPS. Each gets its own chapter. Typically with a survey of the latest vendors' hardware. The level of discussion is detailed enough for practical use.	2004-04-25

So far there has been much speculation. But to develop anything nontrivial presents a severe problem to programmers. It is hard to simulate a large, multigigabyte database, that has credible applications.<br />Luckily, two successful Internet companies, Google and Amazon, have done so. They offer access to their data via XML queries. The authors thus explain how you can sign up with these companies and use their Web Services as a testbed. They treat each company separately and show examples of how you can mine the data and possibly integrate it with your own data and display the results, typically in a browser fashion.<br />The companies are used as learning examples, since many of you are likely to have already used their regular browser based offerings. The authors use this familiarity to motivate why and how you can get at the data, without all that HTML clutter of a pre-Web Service screen scraping approach. They also use this as a vehicle to explain how to use DOM, SOAP, XSLT and JSPs on your website, as part of your Web Service. Tomcat is chosen as the web container because it is very stable and, let's face it, free. So you do gain fluency in an impressive number of important packages.<br />They even offer examples of how to use DAV. This, in the 10 year history of the web, refers to distributed authoring. It was present in the http specifications of 1992/3. But this has rarely been implemented in browsers or http servers ever since. A backwater that is now starting to attract attention. Especially when recast in the rubric of Web Services.	2004-04-25

Does that knowledge and your digital camera make you an expert on digital photography? Probably not!<br />It is true that for digital photography, Photoshop is the standard, and knowledge of it is necessary. But not sufficient. This, basically, is the motivator of Milburn's book. He assumes you're conversant with the mechanics of Photoshop. But now that you have that down, his book concentrates on higher level skills. He has acquired these over 20 years as a digital photographer, from back when tools were totally primitive.<br />The book is replete with tips on image composition. In the process, you learn to appreciate and use many perhaps hitherto obscure capabilities of Photoshop. Like being able to reduce noise in JPEGs. Or precise edge sharpening. Or painting with filters. And so on. Chances are that an introductory Photoshop book may have given these only cursory attention.<br />Most Photoshop books are the equivalent of books on grammar and syntax. This book is about writing essays.<br />The book is also a fun read. The visuals are dazzling! Printed on high quality glossy paper that will still be as fresh decades from now. Deliberately so. There is a timeless quality about the book. Its techniques will still be applicable years hence. Future versions of Photoshop will have at least the capabilities of the current Photoshop. And even if Photoshop gets supplanted by another product, that will be a superset of today's.<br />Of course, there is no doubt that new techniques will be invented. And those will necessitate new texts. But digital photography is a mature enough field, as documented by this book, that it may endure.	2004-04-24

Grant deals with what would have been Red Hat Linux 10. There is officially no such thing, because in 2003, Red Hat announced that it was concentrating on its corporate products, where it would actually make some money. In retrospect, all us users who had downloaded the earlier free versions of Red Hat had been lucky for years. So independently of Red Hat, volunteers made what is now called the Fedora Core. (Fedora as in 'hat'.) This book comes with 2 CDs for it.<br />Having used Red Hat Linux 9 and now the Fedora Core, I have to agree with Grant. There are many changes, but clearly evolutionary. Anyone who has used KDE will be comfortable here. The UI has gotten smoother. Even easier to use. And the functionality has increased; evermore RPM packages.<br />Grant pitches this book towards nontechnical users; he assumes no prior acquaintance with linux. But you know what? Even current linux users may want to check out his writings, looking for new material in Fedora. Certainly, some of you will refrain  on principle. You'd rather learn it from the UI. Which is fine for power users. But others may be more pragmatic and consult this book.<br />One slight caveat is that perhaps in a future edition, he could also discuss running linux on the AMD 64 bit Opteron. There is already a version of Fedora for this. And the chip is far cheaper than Intel's 64 bit offering.	2004-04-24

I won't say none. But if you know anyone in a company writing games, the chances are high that it is in C++. The main problem is that the most lucrative games tend to be twitch games like Doom or Quake. For these, you need the utmost in CPU performance and screen rendering.<br /><br />Java fails on both counts. Its bytecode nature has a performance penalty on a typical Intel or AMD CPU. Plus its graphic libraries, while adequate, did not easily let the programmer have direct access to the graphics memory.<br /><br />But all is not lost. Croft's book will appeal to those who still wish to write Java games, despite the above caveats. For one thing, strategy or turn based games do not necessarily need the highest performance. Java is quite viable here. Plus, as he strongly points out, having a game written in pure Java, without even any JNI hooks, increases vastly the places where is can be played. Because it is far easier to install. Fewer (none!) extra libraries to drag along. And of course, there is the operating system independence.<br /><br />Another point in the favour of Java games is that there can be far less danger of security risks, compared to anything written in C or C++. By running a Java game inside a JVM, you gain this safety. Not absolute, surely, but still reassuring.<br /><br />Also, Croft devotes considerable space to the treatment of advanced graphics. He discards AWT, and sticks to Swing. This will be familiar to many current programmers who are not writing games. He describes how to use hardware accelerated images to improve the effective frame rate. And many other graphics techniques.<br /><br />Overall, very encouraging for games in Java. You might want to try it out.	2004-04-22

Plenty of books on such languages as Java, C++, C# and Visual Basic. But try finding a book on plain old C. Perhaps there is an issue of Kernighan and Ritchie. But, quite possibly, there is no C book at all.<br />But a need for C still exists. Most of the unix variants, and linux, are coded in C, with perhaps a C++ overlayer. And on Microsoft machines, a vast body of C code also exists, for such things as device drivers, for example. K&amp;R is the definitive text for C, but awkward for users new to any programming. Its terseness and lack of many examples make it so.<br />Which is why it is nice to see a new edition of Horton's book. It deliberately eschews the conciseness of K&amp;R. Instead, it has extensive discussions of every feature of C. Aimed squarely at a newbie. Horton is generous with code examples, many of which are entire (small) programs. Naturally these days, the code can be downloaded from the publisher.<br />Horton even discusses what may be fairly advanced stuff for a beginner. Like structuring data via the struct command. What this means, though, is that the book can be used as a complete text for the language.<br />As an important practical matter, you do not need to understand all, or even most, of the book, to start coding. The emphasis from the first chapter is on writing code, even with only partial knowledge of C.<br />Purely as a conjecture, it may be astute planning on the part of Hortan and his publisher to come out with this edition. A real gap seems to have opened up in the market over C books. This might fill it.	2004-04-21

The techniques are non-destructive. Often, the aim is to study the surface composition. This is especially true in the important case where one substance is a fluid, typically air, and the other substance is a solid. Do oxide layers form in such a situation, for example? Do molecules from the air clump onto the surface?<br />Most of the cases considered have a subject that is flat. This enables spectroscopy with specular reflections, as opposed to diffuse reflections from rough surfaces. Plus, when you get specular reflections, you might also get refracted transmission inside the target substance. And possible the excitation of surface plasmons on the surface, for example. Under such circumstances, we get nice instances of applied electromagnetic theory.	2004-04-20

Partly, perhaps, it may be from a desire to describe the purely Indian contributions to science.<br /><br />But what happened in science, engineering and medicine when the British ruled India has been relatively neglected, compared to both the pre and post colonial eras. Arnold attempts to redress this deficit here. He describes how indigenous Indian scientists and doctors learned from and also influenced the British.<br /><br />Especially in the area of tropical medicine. From their African colonies, the British also had experiences in this field. But India had much higher population densities and a more highly developed infrastructure than in Africa. Plus the Indians had perhaps better, though incomplete, knowledge of solutions.<br /><br />It is still surprising that up till now, there has been little scholarly work done on this subject. One might speculate that previous British authors might have concentrated on science done in Britain itself. And Indian authors might have wanted, even if only subconsciously, to deprecate the colonial period.	2004-04-20

There is usually little description, beyond a table of dielectric constants for various materials. But in engineering/materials science, there is often need for a more indepth treatment.<br />Which is what the authors provide. They start with the basic properties of dielectrics and develop the often neglected theory. It is nice to see this comprehensive treatment. The emphasis here is on a macroscopic scale. The typical audience for this book has no need for a microscopic quantum mechanical treatment. The analysis can be considered a good excursion into applied electromagnetism.

It is centred on Stanford and Hewlett Packard. But there is another hub, based around MIT in Cambridge. Sometimes known as Route 128, for the main highway that runs through it. In this region was spawned many technology startups, often with MIT connections via their founders.<br />This book celebrates MIT's role in nucleating and nuturing the startups. From providing alumni, faculty and students who became founders or initial employees, to encouraging an entrepreneurial attitude in them, before they left for these companies. It's good for a historical overview of the region in the postware period.<br />Storied names echo from this book. Digital Equipment Corporation, Data General, Wang, Apollo. Though if you look carefully, most of these were later taken over.<br />The book seems to have an undercurrent of rivalry with Stanford. No surprise.

Clearly, they had to draw the line somewhere. So they chose the most common or important fields, in their estimation. But you have to imagine that had they chosen another 200 fields, the book might be easily twice as thick.<br />Yes, people do like to read a book, as opposed to reading the same material on a computer screen. But for reference subjects like this, one has to wonder if a DVD might not suffice. After all, who is going to read such a reference from page to page?<br />And a DVD enables computer searching. Far better than any index.	2004-04-20

But when one wants to derive browser viewable HTML from XML, then XSLT is used to make the transformation. For XSLT, there have also been books describing it. But thus far, most were about version 1.0. Plus, the HTML output might often be considered small scale. That is, a single page or a few pages.<br />This book differs in two important ways. Firstly, Kirsanov deals with the recently approved XSLT 2.0 and the accompanying XPath 2.0. There have been many improvements in functionality, which he explains cogently.<br />But, more importantly, he expands the scope of the discussion about the HTML output. No longer are we just designing a few pages. He imagines that we are now responsible for an entire website. It could be a personal one, or a corporate site of any size. This necessitates careful attention to designing the architecture of the site and the organising of the source XML documents. For example, he recommends always have a master document, listing all the pages of a site, a &quot;site directory&quot; in XML. Throughout the text, he gives numerous practical suggestions like this, that should be effective on any website.<br />Just as valuable, and perhaps more so to some, are the copious code examples, liberally embedded in the narrative. Gives flesh to the ideas. You can take these as inspiration, or even as starting templates, for your own website.	2004-04-20

Written near the end of his long life, it describes his many achievements.<br />Born in 1905, his life spanned the century. He studied physics under Fowler at Cambridge. Then he worked under Niels Bohr at Copenhagen and under Max Born at Gottingen, before World War 2. This was during a time of great intellectual ferment in physics. The underpinnings of quantum mechanics were being hashed out at both places.<br />Mott specialised in solid state research. He is remembered in the &quot;Mott transition&quot;.<br />The book describes his work in a manner suitable for a general audience. And how in 1977, he shared the Nobel in physics. Also of interest are his remarks on the role of physicists in the post war period. He chaired a Pugwash group in England. (Pugwash related to nuclear nonproliferation issues.)	2004-04-20

Perhaps Crawford's most striking suggestion is that a project should be headed by a designer who has an arts background and who is also able to program. To him, this is an ideal, which may take the field decades to achieve.<br /><br />I am dubious as to how necessary this is, in the first place. He claims that it is easier to find someone from the arts and have her learn the rudiments of programming, than vice versa. But in a specialised environment, like engineering, science or education, it may be better for her to hail from that field, so that she can better know what users might want. Granted, though, for a mass market audience, a more general background might be better.<br /><br />When it comes to specific suggestions regarding the design of a program, he has good ideas. Like using progress bars if a task takes longer than ten seconds. Or using first or second person active voice, rather than a third person passive. These do increase the interactivity.<br /><br />The book is somewhat verbose. He writes at length to illustrate his points. But a little brevity may have been possible, without losing any clarity.	2004-04-19

From the raw machine code of the 1940s to assembler to Fortran and later to C, C++, Java, C#. Once past assembler, all the higher constructs give us hardware independence. But suppose we have a system we want to code. The system could be defined textually or graphically. Currently, the implementation of a system is dependent on the software.<br />MDA is an attempt to give us software independence. The promise is to build a model according to some rules. This model documentation can then be run through a black box that makes implementation code. The user does not have to know the details of the black box. Exactly analogous to how you might write a C program and then turn it over to a compiler.<br />Clearly, there is immense value if MDA is possible. The authors say much of the value lies in the model being closer to what the user desires. Ideally, the user would draw up the model and be able to test it, without any knowledge of the lower, programming level. So there is no &quot;verification gap&quot;. The document the user makes can be thus executed.<br />Some of you will remember similar claims made for fifth generation languages and their like back in the late 80s. These would turn every user into a programmer, eh?! Unfortunately, those efforts failed. The problem was too hard.<br />Sadly, as the authors themselves point out, MDA has not reached this goal either. A work still in progress. The book shows the current borders of research. It could do with some non-trivial examples. Important because of the abstract level of most of the discussion. Whilst there are some examples, they are of limited complexity.	2004-04-19

He is still well known to this day as (in his own words) Darwin's Bulldog. His robust defense of Evolution in the 19th century contributed greatly to its acceptance by scientists and the lay public.<br />But though he is remembered, obtaining a comprehensive collection of his writings has hitherto been a task for a historian. His essays were scattered over many publications, and the gathering together of these is not a trivial task.<br />Reading these will give you some flavour of his times, and of an intellect that still shines through the dry pages. All the more so since he died in 1895. So his essays span over half the century and gives the sweep of biology in those crucial years.	2004-04-16

A not-so-small cottage industry has arisen to help users buy or sell more easily. Of this, an important subset handles cases where users are companies that might want to integrate and automate their inventory needs with eBay.<br />Rischpater points out that there are two ways to do this. The first, and chronologically it certainly was, is to write code that screen scraps eBay pages and extracts the desired data. Brittle. Because when eBay changes the layout, it breaks the scraping and you have to recode. There is also a problem for eBay. If you scrape, you end up discarding most of the page, like the HTML formatting commands. Unnecessary bandwidth usage, on both your end and eBay's. More burden on their servers.<br />The problem for eBay is that it cannot stop scraping. Indistinguishable from users manually requesting pages. So in part because of this, eBay offers an XML data feed and a higher level Software Development Kit (SDK). The XML feed is conceptually the simplest and also the most general, for your computer operating system and language can be anything that has an XML parser. Like linux and C++ or Java, for example. If you already know XML, this will be easy.<br />But the bulk of his presentation centres around using the SDK. This is a set of .NET assemblies (class libraries). So you are restricted to running your application on Microsoft Windows, because currently that is the only thing that supports .NET. But one of the virtues of .NET is that it supports a host of languages, like C, C++. C# and Perl. He strongly suggests that you consider using the SDK, and an associated library, because these are well debugged by eBay and offer functionality that has been found to be broadly useful by many developers. Whereas using the raw XML feed requires you to replicate some or most of this functionality.<br />Still, both are good choices, as compared to screen scraping. The book's explanations are good enough that you can tackle either.tackle either.	2004-04-16

But given the parlous nature of some code, this is scarcely reassuring about the testing.<br />For Java code, Cohen attempts to inject some discipline. He describes the by now well known need for comprehensive unit testing. But this is just the lowest level. Above these are functional tests, scalability and performance tests, and quality of service tests. These require that you consider what users will typically do. In practice, he suggests that the users' collective behaviour might be considered polymodal. You try to divide the users into different categories of behaviour, and then represent each category by a generic user. He calls these archetypes. This effort is not trivial in most cases.<br />But, in his experience, the main difficulty is in the next step. You should try to build programs, called test agents, which can simulate each archetype. The test agents then access the main program in such a way that the latter cannot distinguish between these and real users. This takes automated unit testing to the next level.<br />If you are a programmer, you can appreciate the amount of work needed to do this. Much of the book revolves around explaining how to make a test agent and the various test automation tools available to help you.	2004-04-15

A programmer may not be skilled at eliciting requirements from users. This can be very much a qualitative, fuzzy interaction. Far removed from writing of code, where one can usually objectively measure the functionality.<br />But Cohn points out that the users' needs cannot be ignored for the project to be successful. He says that in the drawing up of these needs, the effort should be equally influenced by both the users and the programmers. An imbalance here can adversely affect the usefulness of the project.<br />He devotes the book towards what he says the group should draw up. User stories. These are functionalities needed by the eventual users. He considers user stories to be of lesser scope than use cases, where the latter may be better known to most. The main merit of a user story seems to be that it involves a &quot;bite-sized&quot; programming effort. He suggests less than 10 days of development. So that a team could quickly iterate through several development cycles, with the cost of a bad choice of user story being small.	2004-04-15

As such, it is very suitable in a high school or university context, where possibly students might want to be encouraged by role models from different regional or ethnic backgrounds.<br />Not surprisingly, the most famous scientists are here.

Canada, like Australia, has had perennial problems with educating a population spread over vast distances. It is natural that Canada would have an intense interest in a means of providing remote higher education.<br />The authors argue that e-learning is not some mirage of the dot com boom. In this book, they explain that it can be a fundamentally disruptive technology. That if correctly implemented, it can empower a more economic and effective teaching of specialised material, irrespective of the actual subject of the material.<br />The application of e-learning to higher education is seen as better than for general primary or secondary education. There, the material is much the same across a nation, and traditional teaching methods are adequate. But for tertiary education, across an entire nation, there might be only limited demand for certain subjects, making it inefficient for every university to offer those.<br />They don't claim that there are exclusive pedagogies to be used in e-learning.

The author/editor Nick Metropolis is quite famous in scientific circles for what is now known as the Metropolis-Monte Carlo algorithmn. It is often used in numerical integration, where this might be over several variables. Before Metropolis found his method, many such problems were often impractical to compute. So he is well qualified to write a history of computing.<br />The book's time span is an era just before the advent of personal computers and workstations. A lot of the narrative discusses government computing, often military-classified. The heritage of computing. The first modern computer, ENIAC/MANIAC, was built during World War 2 to solve problems in the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos. Ever since, Los Alamos has been at the forefront of high powered computing. Where Metropolis was for decades, in fact.<br />Soviet computing gets a mention, but understandably sparse. This book was written during the Cold War, and much of the other side's effort was very secretive.

Microsoft has produced heavy tomes, delineating all that is possible with its system. Her problem is worsened if the computer is for her home. Then there is no corporate IT staff to pester. But the prospects of reading several large volumes is daunting.<br />So Holzman has given her an alternative. His book is directed squarely at the new user. It covers both looking after the software and hardware. In the latter, to give you an idea of the level of expertise he is pitching to, he explains that &quot;the motherboard is the largest circuit board in the PC&quot;. An experienced user may snigger, but there are millions of people out there (perhaps you?) for which this is new and nonobvious.<br />As for software, he has chosen an order of presentation which is a symptom of what Microsoft dreads. Holzman starts by describing how to connect to the Internet and then he discusses the browser, email and a firewall. Only after these does he go into outlining how to use the Microsoft operating system. Because what drives much uptake of computers these days is the web, as contrasted to a purely local interaction. Not that he is anti-Microsoft, but he is predicting that many readers have precisely these priorities for their computer usages.	2004-04-12

The idea is to push a bug that might violate the logic into being found at compile time rather than at run time.<br /><br />Amongst later topics is proxies. You might be familiar with these, in CORBA, EJB and RMI. But of all the Java texts I have read, Simmons has the clearest, most lucid explanation of proxies. A simple description that cuts through the necessarily detailed clutter often used elsewhere. There are chapters of other books, and indeed entire books, on each of CORBA, EJB and RMI. But in the involved explanations of each, though the term proxy may be used, there is often lacking a simple unifying description, encompassing all three.<br /><br />Simmons also has a chapter on References, which are often neglected.

The basic idea is that if you have a text string in some human language, and you run an MT program, it will output a correctly translated string in another human language. Notice that this has nothing to do with speech recognition. That is another complicated problem in itself.<br />Well, MT is one of these problems that has proved elusive in solving. Clearly, it should be solvable. Simply by you reading the input, you could translate it into another language that you knew. So we know that a solution does indeed exist.<br />Newton wrote this book in 1992, and it describes MT's capabilities as they existed then. The basic problem of MT seems to be isomorphic to a general AI problem. We (wetware) can translate, because over the years we have built up a world view that lets us do so. Computers have no such thing, thus far. The book describes how practical MT consisted of cleverly restricting the context of the subject matter, so that reasonably accurate translations could be made. Like weather reports, or airline reservations.<br />The book is still useful today. The increase in computing power since 1992 means that its techniques could be applied on far cheaper hardware. Or, that they could be applied with more power, in a brute force manner. But there seems to have been very little advance in the way of fundamental understanding in MT. So the book's methods are still pretty much state of the art.	2004-04-10

You see, during the Cold War, in the free world, one rarely heard about Soviet computing. The one notable exception was in 1984/5, when a computer magazine described a Macintosh clone from Russia, called the Agatha. But that, like Yugoslavia's Yugo car, gained little traction elsewhere.<br /><br />Readers will notice a key difference between the Soviet computing effort and our own. Theirs was almost entirely black; enclosed within their military industrial complex. Soviet domestic consumer products, like the Agatha, were clunky and rare. In part because a personal computer, especially if it had a printer attached, was a potential printing press for samizdat. This always crippled their efforts.<br /><br />The book describes how Soviet computing focused on the high end, to match the American effort, especially in supercomputers. But always one step (at least!) behind. The names of the Soviet researchers will probably also be unknown to you. But at least here and now, they get some belated recognition for their achievements.	2004-04-10

The most important of which are those that support web operations.<br />The promise is the taking of the World Wide Web to its next stage - a mobile web. To some extent, phone companies have seen the first edge of this, with the latest cellphones that incorporate GIS to give the location of the user. But that is just a harbinger.<br />If a server on the web could access and use the locations of those who come to it via the web, then this can enable new types of commerce and interactions. Currently, most web servers know little more than the IP address of the person contacting them. In future, that may be seen as very limited.<br />The book revolves around explaining how this might come about.	2004-04-10

By now, these are locateable via Google. But how does one cluster them? That is, who are the key ones of interest to you?<br />The book describes how to use the Internet for social science research, in ways that go beyond any search engine.

You might consider this as showing a simple way for you to use Web Services.<br />Spidering is the way that search engines gather their data. But you do not have to be Altavista or Google to use spiders. Nor do you have to be scanning a large fraction of the Web. The authors demistify spiders. If you can follow their examples, then you get concrete instances of usage that might help your particular application.<br />Thoughtfully, the examples are mostly written in Perl, with a few in Java. These languages should be familiar to many. Though even if you don't know them, the logic of the code can still be useful. (That is, you can treat the code as pseudocode.)<br />While spiders are probably best known as being used by search engines, they are really only the starting point for the latter. The much harder problems start when you have the data amassed by a spider. Now you have to efficiently find correlations between the various web pages. You should be aware that the book does not discuss these with any significant depth. Not surprising, because these are outside the scope of the book. The examples do show how to use the data found by spiders. But most of these are for web pages that sit in a given domain. So the pages are closely affiliated in content and structure.	2004-04-08

This review was written on 3 December 2007.]<br /><br />Over 3 years has elapsed since McNab wrote his first edition. Much of that edition is still valid. Sadly, in a way, because it means that despite the best efforts of that book and others of its ilk, we remain plagued with network attackers and insecure systems.<br /><br />One of the constants between the editions is the focus on IPv4. Still! IPv6 only gets a glancing mention in the second edition. While everyone recognises that IPv4 will get exhausted of addresses, the transition to v6 still gets postponed. McNab ruminates that this very transition will of its own accord generate compromises. I wish he'd expand on this remark. But maybe there is yet little market reason to do so.<br /><br />Another thing that does not get mentioned is phishing. In early 2004, it was still a minor threat. It has since blossomed into a chronic problem. But McNab is correct to ignore it, up to a point. He believes, as apparently does most of the IT security field, that phishing is largely a social engineering problem. That it is not a technical problem of patching bugs, per se. Yet viewed properly, phishing is a network attack that uses social engineering, and it is amenable to technical countermeasures that involve, in part, network actions.<br /><br />I especially favour this edition, for the reasons in the preceding paragraph. In 2004, I and a co-inventor, Marvin Shannon, devised a US Patent Pending against phishing. The second edition of McNab's book came out in November 2007, and by not discussing phishing, it buttresses our claims of non-obviousness, 3 years after our filing.<br /><br />==============================================================================<br />[A review of the 1st Edition. This review was written on 3 April 2004.]<br /><br />A logically very systematic delineation of ways that your system could be attacked over the Internet. There are standard ways to access your computer like rlogin, telnet, ssh and ftp. But each implementation of these faces the risk that an error was made in its coding, which might then be found and exploited by a cracker. Plus, since the advent of the Web, there are Web services that have not checked for the stereotypical but very real case of buffer overflow in submitted input over the network.<br /><br />McNab describes all these, and more. But perhaps more usefully, his book is not a simple recital of implementation versions and associated known bugs and available patches. He tries instead to guide the reader into understanding the broad ideas in network access, and using a viewpoint of logically analysing for any weaknesses. Because any static listing of versions and bugs runs the risk of being obsoleted in a few years.<br /><br />He presents web sites that are good resources for patches or latest versions of key programs. If you are concerned about a specific program, try going straight to it in the book and seeing what advice he offers.<br /><br />For all the programs he mentions, some prior knowledge of their use would be handy. He gives a succinct description of each, but really he assumes you have already used it.mentation of these faces the risk that an error was made in its coding, which might then be found and exploited by a cracker.

The operating systems were totally different and the fans of either tended to hark from different fields.<br />Well, ever since Apply redid its Mac to use the Mach kernel, now a Mac runs a dialect of unix. No less inferior than any other version. In some ways, this book is interesting in how it caters to the unix crowd. The book has numerous screen captures of the OS X UI. It sure is pretty! Even unix geeks ought to appreciate this.<br />Graphics-wise, perhaps the closest overlap of the unix and Mac experiences comes in the book's chapter on X Windows [=X11]. Most unix versions use X11 to implement their GUIs. The chapter shows the X11 treatment on the Mac to be very seamless. Though the Mac actually uses Quartz to make its GUI, an X11 development kit is provided, that will satisfy any X11 developer.<br />Unix is distinguished from traditional Mac or Microsoft OSes by emphasising a command line, and very powerful utilities that are often accessed via this command line. Panther gives you most of the common unix utilities in this customary environment.<br />Overall, unix fans might like this book for its presentation of a very cohesively integrated system that is perhaps easier to use than any other unix or linux offering.	2004-04-02

The cracker is inherently at a disadvantage. For one, you (the sysadmin) have physical access to your machine. You can reboot it at will; compare signatures of installed programs against known signatures that are stored readonly; and you can install network analysers and other computers to check your main machine.<br />But there is an entirely different cracker activity where she now has built in edges. This consists of where you write code that others can install on their computers. Your code can end up on a cracker's machine. She has (you have to assume) a good deassembler and decompiler, and is fluent in the assembly language of your code.<br />You don't have it easy. Cerven explains the many measures you might take to protect the running of your code. Alas, for most of these, if not all, over time, a sufficiently talented cracker can find a countermeasure. The book is a tribute to human ingenuity. As a purely intellectual puzzle, you may find his explanations intriguing.<br />He describes a small cottage industry of companies that offer licensing programs that try to control access to your code. The best known may be installshield. This is very common on Microsoft platforms. Also mentioned is flexlm, which unix sysadmins should find familiar.<br />The bottom line is given in the last chapter. A list of suggested best practices. None of which are guaranteed to offer absolute protection. But the cumulative applications of these practices should act as a good deterrent.<br />The only thing that seems to be missing is a discussion of code that comes on DVDs. He describes CDs. Surely by now some large code packages must come on DVDs. (Especially the games.)	2004-04-02

The book explains why this became so; like the fact that java now runs on most computers, enabling a development of code that can be easily migrated to different computers.<br />But the opening up of a company's computers to the web has a downside. It exposes the company to a broad range of attacks; far more so than the traditional glass house mainframe with the occasionaly modem dialin. So an adopter of java for enterprise computing might reasonably ask: Can java provide adequate security?<br />The book is devoted to answering that question. The authors expound on a slew of acronymic laden methods: JCA, JCE, PKCS, JSSE. All under the rubric of J2EE, which is the enterprise version of J2SE. It helps in many chapters to be versed in XML. The configuration files (&quot;deployment descriptors&quot;) are all in XML. Acquaintance with the rudiments of public key cryptography wouldn't hurt either.<br />There is one advantage of the book which the authors modestly decline to point out. The book says that all the authors are from IBM. But it doesn't say one way in which this is a plus. A certain unnamed company in Seattle keeps murmuring that java is owned by Sun, and that should you use java, you are tying your company's future to Sun, which has had revenue problems lately.<br />But J2EE and J2SE and JCA (etc) are massively supported by other computer firms. IBM most prominently amongst these. In fact, IBM claims that its java effort is second only to Sun's. This book is a good statement of that.	2004-03-22

Most of the projects/hacks described will probably do just that.<br />To the tinkerer in you, perhaps the best allure of the book is the chance of serendipity. Surely some hacks will not be of interest, or not relevant to you. The latter may be in part because the authors provide hacks for a wide range of hardware; from a recent Playstation 2 to the venerable Atari 5200 (which dates from 1982) to 802.11 to an iPod and others. So if you lack an iPod, say, and have no intention of getting one, then the chapter on it may be purely theoretical. But the sheer range of hardware increases the odds that there will be somethings to pique your fancy.<br />The final chapter sticks out. It is not a hack but the modicum of programming. A minimal walkthrough to let you get the gist. But if you find that this chapter is new to you, perhaps you should either pick a hack that does not require it, or consult a programming book for more comprehensive coverage.<br />The 8 (!) authors and presumably you seem to be hardware fanatics.	2004-03-20

Dillinger then gives a detailed comprehensive explanation of VLSI. Beginning with the design and layout of integrated circuits, because VLSI circuits are massive combinations of these. There are discussions on how to scale up from the IC to a full VLSI layout. The pros and cons of a modular standard cell library versus using a full custom approach. The latter can give better optimisation in some aspects, like performance or area on the die. But often at a cost of greater complexity and development.<br />There is good coverage of placement and wiring algorithms. The latter are significant because often nowadays the area taken up by wires might exceed that of the cells themselves.<br />Test methods and design rule checking are also covered. The book ends with a chapter on VLSI processing steps.<br />The book is from 1988 but most of it is still germane. If anything, issues like design for testing are even more important now than then. An update of the last chapter would be useful, giving details on deep submicron processing that did not exist in 1988. Plus, current state of the art layout may have quad metallisation, instead of at most dual metallisation in 1988. The influence of this on layout flexibility would be  useful.	2004-03-20

In part because these objects might be physically quite distant from each other, like an application client and a web container that are both on the Internet. The objects may have variable loads and so the buffering of messages is preferable if any object is too busy to attend to an incoming message. Plus, objects may have intermittent connectivity to the net. Especially if mobile/nomadic computing takes off.<br />In any of these scenarios, IBM sees a need for a web server, mediating between applications and a large database (DB2 in IBM's case). That server or container is WebSphere. The bulk of the book therefore deals with how WebSphere implements JMS. The book makes explicitly clear that IBM's implementation fully satisfies the JMS versions 1.02b and 1.1 APIs. Which means that a third party client application that can handle these versions can send and receive messages to WebSphere via JMS. You can consider this as an extra enabling inducement for independent software vendors to write code that hooks to WebSphere.<br />Various examples are given; the book terms these JMS scenarios. Most importantly is how to use Enterprise Java Beans to swap messages via JMS. For commercial applications, another example shows the ability to encrypt the messages.<br />Now hopefully, ISVs will partake of the book's offerings.	2004-03-16

Has a cracker taken over one of your machines and is using it to sniff your traffic? Or maybe to propagate worms, or emit spam, especially the phishing variety, which needs a server that cannot be directly owned by the phisher. For all these reasons, and as a prophylactic measure against them, sysadmins often use network analysis tools that come with their operating systems, like tcpdump under linux and unix and windump under Microsoft.<br />But these tend to be limited in their analytic capability. A group of people wanted to improve matters. They banded together and called their product Ethereal. It is offered freely as open source, and has been tested on linux, most unixes and various Microsoft OSs. Strictly speaking, it has not been officially released. Which makes this book a little curious, on first glance. The book documents version 0.10.0, and has a CD with all the necessary code. The authors felt that pragmatically this version is stable enough and offers significantly better functionality over the alternatives.<br />Granted, you may be trepid about installing beta code, on principle. But the authors argue persuasively that the Ethereal functionality, both in a GUI and at the command line, warrants a serious consideration by any sysadmin.<br />Another reason to install Ethereal has to do with the case where you are already using some proprietary network analyser. If you also run Ethereal, then the two analysers act as cross checks on each other. While Ethereal may have some bugs, so too might that other product. But how might you ever know about the latter, without using Ethereal?	2004-03-14

It has an excellent description of the key concepts behind all the major p2p implementations then existing. Napster, of course, was the best known. But Seti@home, Gnutella, Jabber, Freenet, Free Haven and others are also explained. These are compared with each other, so that you can see the different emphases and strengths of each.<br />Since the book's release, p2p usage has grown, and the attendant controversy about the downloading of copyrighted material, mainly music, has continued unabated. Napster in its original incarnation has gone. But other p2p networks, like Kazaa, have arisen.<br />Another type of p2p network has also emerged - for social networks. Companies include Friendster, Tribe.net, Ryze and others. Of course, these aren't covered in the book, because they did not exist when it was written. But as a measure of how comprehensive the book is, one of its chapters describes the key work on social networks and encompasses this entire group of companies.<br />The technical level is moderate throughout the book. While XML, SOAP and cryptography are described, you only need slight familiarity with these topics. The discussion involving them tends to be at a higher level of usage.	2004-03-12

And I mean this in a positive sense. Hogland and McGraw explain the major ways in which software can be attacked.<br />They describe how reverse engineering can be done, even if all you have is binary code to work on. Given a disassembler and a decompiler, and these exist for all the major platforms, you can systematically apply white box, black box and grey box analysis to deconstruct a program.<br />They show how attacks can be done against servers, because nowadays on the net, servers are often tempting, fat targets. But from your standpoint, if you wish to defend against these attacks, you really need to be aware of the issues they raises. &quot;Know the enemy&quot;. Plus, they also show how a server could attack, or be used to attack, unsuspecting clients that connect to it.<br />Of course, buffer overflows are the most commonly known source of attacks. Thus an entire chapter is devoted to this.<br />PHP users may not be thrilled to hear that it is fundamentally insecure. Its ease of learning and coding comes with this heavy price. Still, it is all the more reason that PHP users and sysadmins running web servers that use PHP, should be aware of the dangers in it.<br />The book is not a trivial read. The authors give detailed examples at the level of the x86 assembler. A strong background in this and in C/C++ will give you the greatest benefit when studying the book.	2004-03-10

Grid computing is extensively described here as a means of providing high powered utility computing on demand. Currently, its potential is mostly unrealised. Many companies and universities have different grid implementations, as described by the authors. The universities' main motivation is to dragoon enough computing resources for hard research problems. While in the commercial sector, computer companies like IBM want to sell on demand access as a means of entering a hopefully vast new market.<br />The grid approaches in the book collectively can be contrasted with p2p computing. Grid systems tend to use more diverse and powerful hardware and relatively small number of users. Think of this as the high end, while p2p is low end (e.g. the SETI desktop application). The book describes the vast amount of effort that has gone into devising grid standards and the various toolkits, most notably Globus.<br />A potential problem which may occur to the reader of this book is the sheer complexity of the grid approach. Its proponents argue that this is necessary complexity. But perhaps a p2p methodology might be easier to understand and use.<br />An analogy is with the X.400 and X.500 email and directory standards. While these are used by some companies, many have not done so. Due to the complexity and slowness. Too heavyweight. The danger for grid computing is meeting a similar fate. It may end up occupying a small high value niche, but no more.	2004-03-09

He depicts a future where you can rejuvenate your mind into a younger body. But before this, you can also regularly backup your mind so that if you die in an accident, this backup can be used to restore your mind from when it was last written to. The analogy to existing computer backups is clear. This future raises very hard questions about consciousness and mortality. If you die, your consciousness still dies. A new thread started via a backup is still a different consciousness. But Hamilton describes people as reasoning that how different is this from a normal waking from sleep? Given the premise that such a backup and restoration might be feasible oneday, this reasoning is surely what will arise. Most recently, the idea of mind backup and restore was explored in &quot;Altered Carbon&quot; by Richard Morgan, which essentially devotes that entire novel around it.<br />But Hamilton is far more ambitious. In a standard SF novel, the above issues are enough for a strong exposition. He goes further. He depicts a spacefaring civilisation that achieves this via wormholes from planet to planet, traversed by trains. Visually quite compelling. Grand Central Station to the max! This idea alone would suffice for many a novel.<br />More yet. The main plot complication is due to an expansionistic, militarism of an alien race, that has been confined to two stellar systems by another more powerful race. Similar to the Moties in &quot;The Mote In God's Eye&quot; by Niven and Pournelle. Though there, the Moties were confined by natural means. Niven and Pournelle then wrote &quot;The Gripping Hand&quot; sequel, which showed the Moties getting loose and threatening mankind. Hamilton in essence incorporates the ideas in these two books, by having his humans accidently release the aliens. Who proceed to make genocidal war against them.<br />Hamilton does tend to go on and on in his novels. A trend from his earlier works. For the most part, it is well done. Perhaps the most interesting to some readers will be his depiction of human society. Fleshed out at some length, with enough entrancing detail of its underlying intricacy. Computers are deeply interwoven into this society, and indeed physically into the humans themselves. He extrapolates the Internet into a pervasive web that people can always access on any civilised planet, with each person having her own &quot;intelligent agent&quot; mediating this interaction..

Typically, a book might give only cursory explanation, especially if it is not devoted to hacking. But suppose you write in C. Chances are you've inadvertantly created buffer overflows and then spent hours chasing this down, after your program crashed. So how on earth can a deliberate overflow lead to a breakin?<br />It is for such matters that Erickson expounds here. Written for you, whether you want to create such exploits or prevent them. In either case, the knowledge is the same.<br />What the book requires is some knowledge of C and assembly. For the latter, it is the language of the Intel x86 family. But even if you don't know it, so long as you are familiar with any assembly language and the theory of a Neumann machine, then you can follow the text.<br />This book is not for every programmer. It turns out that a fair number of programmers get into the field by learning a high level language like C, Fortran, Java or Pascal. But they never learn any assembly. To them, anything compiled from source is a black box. Instead, you need some background in assembly.<br />The book also gives neat coverage of how to sniff network traffic and manipulate it. There is a section on cryptography. But for this, it is so specialised and vital that you should consult texts dedicated to it.	2004-03-05

New cellphones now often have GIS locator capability builtin. Plus, we can easily imagine other mobile devices like laptops, PDAs and vehicles having GIS by default. Combine this with an ever-increasing pervasive web, as suggested by WiFi and next generation  WiFi, and you can see the need for ever more GIS databases. Where these would have street information, for example.<br />One future direction is in developing innovative ways to query the GIS data, and to hook it up to other databases, like weather maps.<br />Thus far, GIS has existed for what will one day be seen as small, specialised applications, like oceanside and mining activities. In reality, the much larger markets exist in urban areas, where most people are. By checking out this book, you can get a feel for how these new applications might be developed.	2004-03-03

Vendors like Sun, IBM and BEA differentiate themselves in offering containers of varying functionality in which these can be implemented.<br />This book explains the approach taken by IBM, which uses WebSphere. A very powerful container, whose scope is so extensive that it is reflected in the heft of the book.<br />Several chapters give good generic descriptions of J2EE, Model-View-Container, Enterprise Java Beans, JSPs and Servlets. These are generic in that little here is IBM specific. Concise. But if you are new to these subjects, you may want to search for books dedicated to those, rather than turn here as a first resort.<br />The core chapters show how to use WebSphere to implement and host the above items. This, after all, is the emphasis of the book. Especially comprehensive descriptions are presented of Container Managed Persistence and Bean Managed Persistence and Message Driven Beans. And, most importantly, because this is central to commercial applications, how WebSphere rigourously handles transactions. Two-phase commit, rollback etc. These MUST work, and Chapter 28 explains how.<br />Throughout all this, the authors provide many screen captures of the WebSphere UI, as useful guides. Even just at this level, you can see the tremendous effort that IBM has put into making it as useful as possible. I do not say &quot;easy&quot;, please note. WebSphere is highly intricate, and the book will give you an understanding of why this has to be so.	2004-03-03

Conversely, the real world has a physical geography. Thus far, there have been some linkages between the two, like mapping software on the web.<br />But the authors go way beyond that simple application. They provide imaginative suggestions of how cyberspace, and most importantly, a pervasive wireless connectivity to it, can enable a nomadic environment where you can get information from cyberspace about your physical surroundings. Plus, of course, enhanced interactions with those surroundings, based on this data.<br />It appears that the study and use of geography, as currently performed, may soon undergo profound changes, in a way that will give it key commercial utility.	2004-03-03

And you still don't look like the Jetsons. But perhaps you want to see what is coming down the pike?<br />The book offers suggestions on the future, by examining the so-called cyberculture. A nonlinear blend of fact and cyberpunk science fiction. The facts include trends in hardware and software engineering. Plus the social usages of these. Like the rise of massive multiplayer environments (Everquest etc). And how people voluntarily immerse themselves in these in an addictive wirehead mode. Where wirehead is a term borrowed from science fiction of the 1980s and earlier, when this behaviour was predicted.<br />The book examines the rise of a new type of community, mainly extent on the Web, comprised of people, most of whom will never meet in person. How exotic this would have seemed in the 1970s. Yet this has crept up on us. Is this a harbinger? Will people withdraw into themselves and their net connections? Such issues are speculated upon in the book.<br />As you can imagine, the book span many fields, including sociology, psychology, computer science and science fiction. Worth a perusal.	2004-03-03

For example, IBM came up with SMIT. Of course, each UI was only for that vendor's unix. A developer, Cameron, set out to simplify this across vendors, by writing Webmin. As the book explains, it has now been ported to most unixes and linux.<br />The book shows that Webmin is ideal for a new sysadmin. Reduces the intimidation factor of unix. It may be increasingly relevant if linux keeps growing on servers and even on desktops. On the latter, a sysadmin (you!) may well be a former Microsoft OS user who decided to take the plunge into a free operating system, but is worried about the necessary level of expertise.<br />All the important admin tasks, like making new user accounts, setting up a mailer, and networking, are possible via Webmin. So if you are still trepid, this book might assuage your concerns. Cooper writes clearly and at a level accessible to many. No prerequisite knowledge of unix is assumed. Plus, he gives only the core functionality of Webmin, to avoid information overload. The book deliberately eshews explaining every module.	2004-03-03

If you already know some scripting, you should be quite at ease here. Taylor does decide to restrict his discussion to the Bourne shell and its descendent, bash. He drops the C shell! But, as he points out, the scripts he gives can be easily rewritten in the latter if you desire.<br />The book can be roughly divided into two parts. The first is essentially traditional scripting tasks. A user from 1988 would see original material here, but no qualitative surprises.<br />The second half of the book is more interesting. It centres on Web applications. For example, when running a Web server that uses CGI, Perl and C are often the choice for implementing logic. But sometimes you can get by with a simpler approach - using a Bourne shell. Taylor shows how to do this to make simple web pages, with images, even. Cool! Though this outlook lacks the full expressive power of generating dynamic pages via Java Server Pages/Servlets, these latter alternatives can be quite forbidding to learn. If you are already comfortable with sed, awk, grep [etc], you may want to try this approach, provided your web site is not too complex.<br />In summary, the web scripting approach suggested here may be the most distinctive and useful sections. Worth checking out.	2004-03-02

Did you ace the logic part of an SAT or GRE exam? Then this book is for you!<br />You are learning C++. Or perhaps you need a refresher. You may not be facile with all the nuances. Learn by doing. The book has 111 programs that don't quite work. All you need is enough discipline to work through the programs without peeking at the answers until you have give it your best try. The book assumes that you are already mostly familiar with the syntax of C++. While some programs explore the subtleties of this, the author expects that you can at least code a simple C++ task.<br />The programs are not antipatterns, though. I could not discern any higher level structure across the programs to suggest this.<br />Perhaps the best way to regard this book is as a cheap refresher exam. Mental stretching exercises.	2004-03-01

But the steady rise of linux on fast, cheap hardware and the parallel rise of an open source community leads one to wonder if there are alternatives.<br />Which leads to this book. It has some of the ambience of the flashback to the 70s or 80s, when programmers in their spare time might gin up a cool game, which would then spread like a virus when word got out. Of course, you can use the book's advice to design a proprietary game. Nobody says you need give it away.<br />The book's code examples are in C. Not Java, please note. While Java is good for some applications, typically in gaming, performance is always an issue, as measured by latency, for example. The book also does not mention C++. Pity. C++ compilers nowadays are usually as efficient as C compilers. Plus, if you want to code a game of any complexity (over 100 000 lines, say), then C scales badly, unless you use really strict design and coding standards.<br />Overall, though, the book is well done. Very easy reading if you're experienced. Very little knowledge of graphics is required. The book is more about the back end design. Graphics is pushed out to OpenGL and similar packages.	2004-03-01

This book gives a lot of the mathematical background for actuarial tables. The chapters discuss various conditional probabilities in the developed world for life expectancy, given this precondition or that precondition.<br />In some ways, the book is greatly unattainable. That is, if you live in subSaharan Africa or northern India or central China, where disease and malnutrition are still common. Plus the spectre of Aids/HIV, which has already had measurable lowering of the average life expectancy in several African countries. Those regions can only hope for the relevance of the book.<br />Reasonably advanced knowledge of statistics is needed to get the most out of the book.	2004-02-28

For decades Gregory Benford has been writing both science fiction and physics research papers.

He speculates as to what forms cyborgs might take, and what the social reaction might be to them. Along the way, he suggests what a lengthy extension of the human lifespan might do to society. He discusses the various depictions in science fiction and movies, starting all the way back with Frankenstein. Of course, Blade Runner gets a mention, as you might expect!<br />Very readable. He writes with his usual skill, and aims the book at a general audience. Don't worry about any equations!	2004-02-27

It covers a wide variety of experimental situations, including reactors, accelerators, lasers and masers. Useful not just to theorists but also to experimentalists who want a good understanding of the topic.<br />Aggregates material scattered through journal papers and much more specialised monographs.<br />A distinctive feature of the book is the extensive problem sets per chapter.

After the Second World War, the Soviets initiated a crash program to catch up to and, hopefully to them, exceed the Americans. In Soviet society, this was done in several remote towns, some built expressly for this project.<br />The book sheds light on such details as had been speculated upon in the free world during the Cold War, but which little was clearly known. At least, outside the US intelligence agencies.<br />Having lived briefly in Los Alamos during the last years of the Cold War, though none of us knew it at the time, I found the book especially compelling. By then, Los Alamos had been openly known since 1945. But the Soviets were still applying such wartime-type rigours as keeping several of their towns off their official maps. And access was tightly restricted. (Still is, to several.) Whereas, Los Alamos National Laboratory had several buildings available to the public, as a public face.	2004-02-25

Yet, in a larger context, he has been largely forgotten, despite his vast contributions across many sciences of the 19th century. Perhaps it speaks to the finite size of a curriculum and the onrushing progress of science.<br />This book attempts to redress that ignorance. It gives a well written description of his many experiments and writings. Very readable, without requiring specialised knowledge of its fields. The level of explanation is comparable to that of Scientific American. What is also neat is how the book fits him into his time, describing the cultural milieu of Germany and its scientific strivings.	2004-02-23

In the period 1850-1900, these may have been the most important ideas in biology, chemistry and physics. The names of those key scientists are now august, and several wrote the excerpts, and others were mentioned in other articles.<br />This book gives the high tide of 19th century science. A treat for the reader to go back to some original sources.<br />For American readers, what may also be striking is how little impact the US had in these pages. During that time, the US was still playing catch up to the Europeans. (Something it would not achieve for another 40 years.)	2004-02-23

That is, it was not speaker independent. Plus, due to the limited memory and slow cpus, often the analysis was not in anything approaching realtime. Typically, the speaker would say something, word by word, and this would be recorded in digital form, which would then be analysed.<br />Even with these hardware limitations, the papers describe promising approaches and indeed of good progress in the subject. Which is actually what did happen subsequently.<br />As an aside, Kai-Fu Lee came to prominence at Carnegie Mellon in the late 80s, writing key parts of the Sphinx speech recognition system, which was highly regarded as the benchmark of its time.	2004-02-23

It's nice to know some of the theory behind p2p networks. This book shows that serious research is being conducted in the field, for ever better p2p nets.<br />What is interesting is how perhaps some of the research described could lead to a p2p network whose main usage is not the unauthorised copying of copyrighted material. Right now [2004], most nontechnical articles on p2p focus on this issue, because there is yet not widespread p2p net whose main usage has not become exactly this.<br />Most of the research deals with ways to improve a p2p network. Like easier discovery mechanisms, or more robust downloading. Which is especially germane if one is downloading large files and the duration of which increases the chance of a hiccup on the network. The larger issue is that if one solves these problems and builds a better p2p network, that just increases its allure for downloading music and video.	2004-02-22

Can this be so? It was published in late 2003. Seems rather late. Surely another earlier book would have described this topic.<br />Certainly, there is no gainsaying the importance of the topic. DWDM is used in long haul optical networks, because those fibres are at a premium. But DWDM is probably also increasingly used in shorted optical networks, like inside a city. If the net is used primarily for phone transmission, then those protocols are quite different from TCP/IP. But the growth rates of data transmission are greater in the developed world than those for voice, typically. And it appears that eventually, the Internet will subsume other communications protocols. Hence the need for this topic and a book like this.<br />It explains DWDM to a newcomer to the field. Experienced readers can safely skip entire sections of the book. On discussions of Quality of Service, IPv6 is mentioned. Because it is really only in this that QoS can be implemented at a fundamental level. The current IP (version 4) was never designed with QoS in mind.	2004-02-22

The amazing uptake of cellphones worldwide in just 10 years has shown this. But in such markets as India, cellphone usage is still in its infancy. Plus, in developed countries, the introduction of more powerful cellphones and other wireless devices has driven ever greater bandwidth consumption.<br />The papers in this book give suggestions on possible directions that may unfold. The papers covering ad hoc networks are especially fascinating, for these merge into existing ideas of smart dust and pervasive, nomadic, wearable computing.<br /><br />It's probably true to say that each major topic in the book has vast commercial applications. As just one example, it describes significant difficulties in deploying a wireless net inside a building. Yet, just in homes, the market is huge, as attested by the domestic usage of WiFi. Plus, of course, inside commercial buildings, wireless is attractive because of the cost of the cabling alternative.<br /><br />To some readers, perhaps frustration may result from reading the text. Some of the vistas suggested are indeed glittering. Still, if that is how you feel, perhaps you can use this book to help bring about that future.	2004-02-22

Thumbing through its pages reveals what now feels like a bygone era. The endless, uninterrupted climb upwards, with the first mover advantage imperative still driving the reader (presumably), coupled with Internet usage that at the time was doubling every quarter, and hence multiplying 16 fold every year.<br />Alas, though the author and the rest of the world did not know it at the time, those bandwidth figures were fake.

That a tiny glass fibre could transmit so much. It made copper obsolete, if it wasn't for the cost of the last kilometer to many end users.<br /><br />How could we ever fill such a wide pipe? Well, actually, usage increased, quarter after quarter. And so did progress in the fibre field, as shown in this book. Now we have DWDM. Ever more capacious fibre. Some readers may query the worth of this research described here. After all, with the telecom crash, and the huge overbuilding of fibre capacity worldwide, what is the point of ever more gains? Shouldn't Laude and the rest of his ilk just declare a moratorium for ten years, say, till usage catches up?<br /><br />Not so. The current installed fibre, including the dark fibre, will barely suffice when viewing or sending video becomes common over fibre. Even with advanced software multicasting to minimise the bandwidth usage, one can expect usage to just keep growing.	2004-02-22

But what the author is trying to do is give a broader overview, that is not tied to specific cryptosystems that are currently deployed.<br />All the good stuff is here - elliptic methods, el Gamal, hashing/hash digests, Public Key Infrastructure etc.<br />Perhaps this book can be compared to Bruce Schneier's groundbreaking &quot;Applied Cryptography&quot; of over ten years ago. Both books deliberately refrained from tying their textual descriptions too closely to contemporary implementations.<br />The mathematical treatment in this book is perhaps a little deeper than Schneier's book, but still far easier for most users than a fully fledged math treatise.<br />The most interesting parts may be Rhee's speculations on the future directions of cryptography. Potentially, if you are a researcher, this may be the most useful to you, with potential indicators of where to go.	2004-02-22

At one extreme is the scattering studied in high energy and nuclear physics. The distances at which the interactions occur can be measured in fermis (10**-15 meters) or less. And the interaction energies can go over an MeV. Needless to say, the technologies developed to study this in particle accelerators and nuclear reactors are quite specialized. The books give detailed treatment of this.<br />Off to another side is the scattering in classical electromagnetism. Nowadays, this is heavily used in engineering. For example, in antenna design in every region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Due if nothing else to the technological importance of this field, the books also treat it extensively.<br />Yet another type of scattering covered in the volumes is acoustic scattering. Useful in sonar, ie. underwater, and especially military applications. But also used in more prosaic applications like designing musical devices or directional microphones.<br />It is rare to see all such covered together well in just 2 volumes.	2004-02-18

In fact, the Voice over Internet Protocol (Voip) appears more germane and more useful now than in 2000. The largest companies, like ATT, have pledged to bring out products based on it.(Partly to circumvent paying access charges to the Baby Bells.)<br />One thing that has helped since 2000 is that the intervening years have made the Internet more accessible, in terms of bandwidth, price and reach, throughout the developed world.<br />The technical issues discussed in the book are applicable worldwide.

Puzzling out how to name a compound in organic chemistry that had 15 carbon atoms, with multiple double and triple bonds. And with the odd nitrogen and oxygen thrown in for added flavour? Plus, you also enjoyed enumerating all those aromatics, didn't you?<br />Well, if that cranked your handle, then this is the book for you! Pages and pages of awesome stuff. Gathered together for joyous perusal. The essence of your dreams.

But in an ever upward spiralling of technological complexity, it helps to see the scientific underpinnings suggested by this book. It is aimed squarely at the intersection of applied physics with engineering.<br />Here are discussions on the various possible improvements in semiconductors. How much longer can Moore's Law run? Will silicon still remain the most important semiconductor? Does gallium arsenide have a possibility of being more than a niche product for high speed circuitry? Can optical processing be integrated into standard silicon-based technology?<br />Plus solid expositions on the field of high temperature superconductors. Since 1987, the field has been largely confined to pure research. The technological spinoffs have been modest, due, in part, to a still incomplete theoretical framework. Plus also practical synthesis problems.<br />This Update 2 keeps us abrest of the latest important unfoldings in this field.	2004-02-18

There was once a time when computer algebra seems amazingly exotic. Sure, computers could crunch raw numbers. But no surprises there. It was quite another event to see a computer factor a simple algebraic expression, or perform symbolic integration. Wow!<br />But now, computer algebra is available on such widespread packages as Mathematica and Maple. This book studies the subject, as a coherent entity. (Wish it had been available in 1982!) For those of you who might be interested in developing ever more sophisticated techniques in this field. It explains the ideas clearly. It shows that you can understand it systematically. And not as an ad hoc, grab bag of unrelated but nifty tricks. Brings together in one volume ideas that are scattered throughout many scientific papers over decades.	2004-02-18

The 'cookbook' in the title means that Perry emphasises what he considers to be many common tasks needed to be done by Java Servlets and JSPs, in a J2EE context. Similar in spirit to OReilly's other books like 'eBay Hacks' and 'google Hacks'. In fact, in the 26 chapters of Perry's book, there are on average over 5 tasks in each that he explains, which are akin to the hacks of the other books. Except here, he gives you over 130 hacks.<br />He assumes you know the basics of the subject. Certainly, the book does not claim to be a comprehensive listing of the subject's features. But if you satisfy this requirement, you can dive straight into any section of any chapter. Don't have to read this book linearly.<br />However, if you aren't using Tomcat or BEA WebLogic as containers, then the relevance of the book may, frankly, be more limited. Different containers have slightly different functionalities, and the examples he gives are very specific to those 2 containers. If you are in fact using another, perhaps you can use this book to provide design patterns and inspiration, but not actual code.	2004-02-10

Because this book is for a select few. The ceaseless tinkerers who never left their childhoods. The common theme thru all the projects Fullam describes is one of hands on experimentalism. Enthusiasm is a more important prerequisite than technical background or skill. Electronics naturally pervades more examples. But simple stuff, and he even has explanations of how to read the colour coding of resistors. There is a modicum of software, because these days, even for hardware purists, you can rarely totally ignore software.<br />Perhaps what Fullam should do is consider an advanced sequel to this book, if the latter is well received. Those who enjoy the projects here may appreciate something more challenging. There is a burgeoning field of people using mini ITX systems for all sorts of crazy off the wall stuff. These ITXs are full computer systems, reduced to the basics of motherboard with cpu, memory and disk, all for a few hundred dollars. Hobbyists are putting them into funky mobile applications. From Fullam's expertise shown in this book, he is well qualified to take your tinkering to the next level.	2004-02-08

Successfully writing and maintaining what is perhaps now large source code bodies. In doing so, you've become quite experienced and you know the ins and outs of Visual C++. But about 2 years ago, Microsoft starting pushing a wonderful new .NET platform. Impressive claims about how one could develop code in several languages sitting atop this. Technically nice. But for you, much of this was moot. You and others in your group have no inclination to start coding in Pascal, anyway. You cannot abandon Visual C++.<br />So the authors wrote this book, targeted towards you. It is not a comprehensive introduction to .NET. But they chose to focus on a few topics that you might value. XML for example. This is now a widely adopted standard for data interchange, and if your code isn't already familiar with it, then it might be a good thing to add. It motivates you to start dipping into .NET. Plus, in order to parse XML, they show how to use the standard Document Object Model (DOM) parser that is available under .NET. All useful stuff.<br />They also use cryptography as another hook into .NET. It is just a guess, but some of your applications might need this. So here is how to use some of the latest advanced implementations of hashing and public key infrastructure. And if these are done in .NET, well, gosh, what a coincidence. :)	2004-02-08

As technical fields grow and subspecialities develop, and as technology progresses and new terms are coined, who can keep track? So the author has done this for you.<br />Neat gathering of information. Possibly the more useful stuff is the list of workshops in the various IT fields. Because, apart from that, it might simply be easier and quicker for you to look up an acronym on the web, especially if you can add keywords related to the subject, to narrow down searching.<br />The book has limited utility.

Series)	Books	4	12	12	N	N	How to write and maintain large Fortran code	Fortran is still widely used in science and engineering, though if you look at new computer books, you can scarcely tell this. Since those usually discuss languages like C, C++ and Java. But when it comes to raw number crunching, and where a GUI might be nice, but is strictly secondary, there is a ton of legacy code in Fortran.<br />So there is still a need for a book like this, which discusses how to use the latest version, Fortran 95. What the author strives for is to cover something lacking in many older Fortran texts. Those tend to explain the syntax and how to write small programs, of a few thousand lines or less.<br />But there is often little discussion on how to manage the complexity of libraries stretching to 10^5 lines or 10^6 lines of code. How can you maintain and understand and add to these bodies? Issues like unit testing, which quite often discussed in java or C++, are well described here. Design discipline is also emphasised.<br />So if you are still writing in Fortran, and are wondering about coping with growing code, consider this book.	2004-02-08

This is due to the Central Limit Theorem, which says, basically, that a sum of independent samples from the same underlying distribution, will assume a Gaussian form, regardless of the original distribution. So Gaussians are crucial.<br />But often, you might run into distributions that exhibit significant skewness or kurtosis, and a Gaussian simply won't do, even as a first approximation. True, most statistics texts do discuss other types of distributions: Student's T, binomial, multinomial, Poisson etc. Notice that many are for discrete values, like the binomial. For a continuous probability density function, you might like a broader choice.<br />Which is the purview of this text. Bury takes you well beyond the Gaussian, with many other distributions clearly explained. Fills a gap in many other texts.	2004-02-08

During which, and since then, offshoring has become a very hot topic in the US, and also in Europe. Much has already been written elsewhere about the outsourcing of call centers and information technology to India, Phillipines and China, with the anticipation of more outsourcing to inevitably follow.<br />Which is why this book may be more topical now that just a few years ago, when it came out. It attempts to describe enterprise modelling in a global context. How to measure it and to then use this ability to, as objectively as possible, improve the global competitiveness of a company. The book has descriptions of metrics that can be computed and then compared across companies, for benchmarking. Plus, these measures could also be used across different national subsidiaries of a multinational, say. Or to compare the competitiveness measurements arising from two choices - to develop or maintain some ability inhouse, or to outsource it overseas.	2004-02-08

GaAs and InGaAs compounds are already widely used in many commercial applications that take advantage of the ability to make solid state lasers and light emitting diodes out of them. But if it is possible to make these smaller and cheaper, then the economics may enable even more applications.<br />Hence the practical emphasis of this book. Though, of course, it is meant for the researcher.<br />The self assembling property offers a glittering [pun] chance to make cheaper devices. Hopefully, this might eliminate a few lithographic steps and hence help push up device yield. Plus, of course, the small size of the dots leads to novel quantum effects. For example, if the current thresholds could be lowered due to this, it might reduce power consumption, which is no bad thing.<br />While the book is presented mostly at the research level, you should expect, since the authors are from a company, Fujitsu, with large interests in this topic, that not all the experimental steps might be fully described. The science is. But, for proprietary reasons, experimental steps which cannot be patented might be not disclosed, and held as trade secrets. Which actually is not too different from papers written by university researchers, anyway.	2004-02-08

The author shows how oil has been a very mixed blessing in Muslim countries. While producing great wealth, this has sometimes been unevenly distributed through the originating countries. And in cases like Saudi Arabia and Brunei, it was used to put off democracy by providing material benefits, that at least arguably were received by most of the population.<br />As an aside, it was through the industrialisation of Saudi Arabia, and many government contracts for this, that Osama bin Laden amassed much of his wealth, which then bankrolled his later activities. Though the book, written in 1997, of course does not mention him, as he was an obscure figure then.<br />The author also discusses Iraq, with almost half the world's proven resources. Here, the oil managed to pay for twenty years of war and internal repression. The consequences of which are still unfolding daily.<br />A good background primer on current political affairs.	2004-02-08

At one point, all that was known about this subject was anecdotal. And since events like earthquakes occur irregularly, it was hard for researchers to systematically study this phenomenon.<br />But thanks to the authors, a large body of evidence has been collected into this text. It spans the fields of geology and seismology. The hope is that by methodically studying the gaseous outdiffusion from the earth, reliable precursors can be found. Even if these give only a few minutes warning, that is enough for critical power supplies to come online, lifts to unload, and other precautions.<br />The ever increasing cheapness of sensors and the increasing coverage of wireless networks means that the suggestions in the book might be adopted by dispersing a wide array of wireless sensors at earthquake prone regions.	2004-02-08

Excellent book! Has utility. But perhaps a CD of the tables might be more useful to readers?<br />There's a real problem nowadays with a book like this. With the increasing use of computers, the book's data should be able to be integrated easily with a reader's computer. But the quandary is that if the publisher makes a CD available, there is no effective copy protection. It is one thing if the book is mostly readable text, because most people still prefer to read a nice hardcopy, than from a computer screen. But no one really reads a table of numbers, per se.<br />So people who use this book may have to enter parts of tables by hand, or scan it in via optical character recognition.	2004-02-08

Most clearly seen in the huge uptake of cellphones in Europe, Japan and, to a lesser extent, the United States and China. Plus, WiFi has taken off strongly in the developed world, with enhanced 802.11 standards being quickly solidified and adopted.<br />This volume, as of its writing in 2000, describes much of the engineering and theoretical underpinning of this field. It does not have the 802.11 standards that came out after 2000, but much of the book is still very germane. There is no lack of research interest in this field, driven in no small part by the anticipation that nomadic computer and the rise of the pervasive Web have yet to occur. Still early days for those, we hope.<br />The field contains tough issues, as may be seen in several papers in the book. In earlier decades, wireless communications were often to and from antennas at fixed locations, with ample power. Or, if the antennas were mobile, like on planes, usually power was not a consideration. Nor the possible maximum length of the antennas. But in modern personal mobile uses, the constraints are far tighter. Power must be minimized, and you cannot draw out a one meter antenna.<br />Which gives great potential for researchers like yourself to invent and commercialise new applications, if you can overcome these challenges, aided perhaps by ideas in this book!	2004-02-08

The book, and many of its ilk, were focused on how Japanese firms seemed to be outcompeting American firms in industry after industry.<br />This book focuses on the design and manufacture of integrated circuits. A field which spans both ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits), memory (RAM, ROM) and microprocessors. Methe interviewed CEOs of various Japanese firms, and tried to analyse the reasons for the firms' success. He cites examples of the firms cooperating and competing with each other, and under the umbrella of the Japanese government's economic policies. From these, he drew conclusions about how the US might imitate such arrangements.<br />However, since 1990, Japan went into a lost decade of little or no growth, and the urgent tone of part of the book seems so quaint now. With hindsight, this book was done at the height of an economic cycle, with concomitant distortions. In the 90s, the US semiconductor industry went on to thrive, with its dominance in microprocessors sustained. Whereas, many of the Japanese firms cited in the book faced heavier competition from their Taiwanese and Korean counterparts.	2004-02-08

Europe, Asia, US. Crikey, even the occasional Australian and New Zealander craft! A huge amount of work went into collating all this.<br />A definitive tome.

Typically, these might be more of interest to a physicist or chemist than to an engineer, as these are more research oriented.<br />Various semiconductor devices are also described, like tunnel diodes and Zener diodes. Here, perhaps, this book faces more competition from other books that are explicitly on semiconductor devices. In this book, the descriptions are mostly just that, descriptions. Whereas other semiconductor texts would give lengthier, explanatory passages.<br />The book claims to describe the transitioning from Si to GaAs in MOSFET manufacturing. A bit of a stretch. Yes, GaAs is heavier used in certain, high speed devices. But the vast majority of MOSFETS are still Si based, and there is no indication of that changing.<br />In summary, the book is more of a reference than a text. Its best value is in the gathering of the material properties and the references therein to the original papers from which these are collated.	2004-01-23

There is a stereotype that the average engineer could not write for beans. Most engineers might vociferously deny this. But if you have ever had the &quot;good&quot; fortune to read a typical manual or paper written by an engineer for his peers, or even for laymen, then you may indeed would about the writing ability.<br />Traditionally in an engineering syllabus, writing was barely mentioned, if at all. There is simply too much competing for mindshare in an undergraduate cirriculum.<br />van Emden tries to counteract this by putting together a concise handbook for engineers faced with this quandary. It is concise out of necessity, because most engineers will not read a lengthy tome on this subject. Her advice is pretty easy to understand. No engineer should have a problem with her suggestions. But being able to implement them is another matter. Facility in converting an engineering scheme or system into an understandable verbal precis is an underrated skill. It is one of these things where the best written engineering descriptions are so logically and clearly laid out that they hide the necessary skill that made it so.	2004-01-23

Many undergraduate courses also use it, by assigning problems that explicity require running it to obtain answers. Certainly, its ability to perform symbolic algebra is excellent.<br />Given all this, the authors have produced a worthy book that meets a real need amongst some students for an explanatory text. In some ways, perhaps the most useful thing is the ample number of problems, that for a given topic, scale from simple to hard. Possibly the best way for the reader to assimilate the ideas and to be able to manipulate Mathematica facilely.<br />The book does not offer a comprehensive description of all the features of Mathematica. Which may be for the best, in terms of avoiding information overload on the student. Rather, it is seen as the place to defer to the official Mathematica online and hardcopy documentation.	2004-01-23

Probably does live up to the publisher's claim. Tables of dielectric constants, thermal conductivities, electric conductivities, Young's constant, etc. Plus the most used formulas in each field, with succinct descriptions of how to use them. Granted, these descriptions will be of limited use if you have never encountered the formulas before. But the book is intended as a one stop review of things you have hopefully already studied.

Most Java programming books are written assuming that the reader will be programming full time. Fair enough. But there is an important subset of readers to whom programming is only a side issue. They have other interests and duties. Not surprisingly, the typical Java book is not geared towards them. For one thing, it might assume a prior level of programming experience which they simply do not have. Plus, the book might simply be too long, and go into programming issues that are not really germane to them.<br />Such a description of readers neatly encompasses many engineering students. The authors have attempted to address this by providing a Java text geared explicitly towards this audience. They describe Java to the minimal extent necessary for a student to quickly be able to do useful computations. Trickier than teaching Fortran, because the object oriented nature of Java needs a little more explanation and a little more getting used to by the student.<br />They assume that the usual engineering computation will not require a long program. It is for the latter that Java and its OO nature are really geared to. Hence, the authors deprecate such things like interfaces, though these are mentioned. Because these are meant to aid building complex structured code.<br />The graphics treatment is a little cursory, frankly. A student wanting to put a GUI in front of her code should really look elsewhere for guidance. But if a student has a primarily computational task, then a simple GUI might suffice, or even just stdout.	2004-01-23

Often, those texts have good explanations of their concepts. But then provide only limited tables of commonly encountered distributions. Part of this may be that to those authors, such tables let them add relatively little value. To an author, her value is in her origina musings, and not necessarily in filling the latter part of her book with reams of tables.<br />Thus, there is a natural inclination of statistics authors to only provide a modicum of tables. The barest minimum! Well, your answer to this might be to amass several texts, so that hopefully, the tables you need can be found in one of these.<br />An alternative is to get this book. Not a text, but a reference manual. Though the editors thoughtfully precede the tables with brief explanations of their usage and some cogent examples. You will find here the most commonly needed distributions in an easy to find and use format.	2004-01-23

Generations of engineers, and not a few chemists and physicists either, have depended on this book as the standard reference for the properties of water.<br />This is the 1969 edition, and there is no more recent edition. Which should give you some idea of how definitively the authors described their subject.<br />Perhaps the only suggestion for improvement is for a CD version that has the tables in some XML format that can be easily integrated into a computer program. Notice that this is different from other books which might have a CD version that duplicates the contents of the hardcopy. There, the CD's main advantage might be the ability to have a comprehensive all-word index. Here, where most of the book are tables of numbers, that need is not really relevant. Instead, where there are tables, the best use of CD would be to hold XML formatted tables.	2004-01-23

Plus, the use of computers is quite decoupled from physical strength.  Given, this, one might imagine that there would be little gender differences in the study and use of computers.<br />To some extent that is true, and certainly less so than in other more established fields, like engineering, which remain heavily male dominated. But these papers presented here show that, sadly, there are indeed some gender differences. The intake of females into computer science has lagged males. Partly, it reflects the mathematical nature of the subject, which acts as a deterrent to many high school girls. In other ways, computing is seen as a solitary venture, with minimal social interaction, acting as another deterrent.<br />Overall, the tone across the papers is generally optimistic. Progress is needed to remove discrimination effects. But these are generally not explict or systemic. In large part, mostly attitudinal changes that may require generational changes to resolve.	2004-01-23

It has immensely deepened our understanding of nature. The ideas of basins of attraction, Julia sets, stability in chaotic systems and others have been discovered and been found quite valid.<br />During much of this, engineers have probably glanced at it with interest. But until recently, engineering systems did not deal with it or invoke even the presence or possibility of chaotic behaviour. Which is why this book is promising. It moves chaos firmly into the engineering sphere.<br />Most of the discussion is on dynamical systems, with remarks on the impact on traditional control systems theory of the presence of chaos. The mathematical treatment is fairly sophisticated, and engineering readers should probably already be quite well versed in understanding dynamical systems.	2004-01-23

This distribution has a standard deviation, sigma. Then, if you measure the area under the curve that is greater than 6*sigma from the mean, you get something like under 10^-6. So the idea is that if you make something with a property that can vary from item to item, you want to reduce the deviation so that all items within 6*sigma of the mean are acceptable. And thus, unacceptable items are less than one in a million.<br />Of course, if the distribution is not Normal, then this is not necessarily true. In this case, Six Sigma is used metaphorically. The basic idea is the same.<br />The Six Sigma approach has been widely publicised in recent years. Perhaps the best known proponent in the United States is Motorola, who claimed that they successfully applied it to their manufacturing operations. Especially those for cellphones and microprocessors.<br />Perhaps its greatest merit is that it stresses hard numerical criteria that are easily and economically measurable. So that you can conduct these measurements on a large subset of the items you are making. Or indeed perhaps on all the items.	2004-01-23

Typically, when you study ODEs, your text will describe a standard pedagogical set, like systems of DEs with constant coefficients, etc. Look at Boyce and diPrima's &quot;Elementary Differential Equations&quot; as a good example of this.<br />But just as people have compiled tables of numerical values of useful functions, like Abramowitz and Stegun's &quot;Handbook of Mathematical Functions&quot;, did anyone do likewise for ODEs? Well, Polyanin et al have done so.<br />These days, many who face solving an ODE might resort to doing so numerically, since computers and software packages have become so powerful. But analytic solutions are still always preferable, assuming that they exist and you can find them. The reasons are threefold. Firstly, they are more compact to encode than tables, from a computational viewpoint. Secondly, it is often easier to search for understanding in a known functional form than in a table. Thirdly, if you have a solution in the form of a function, and that function is differentiable or integrable, then you may be able to gain more insight, or apply the answer to broader usage, by doing so.<br />Thus analytic solutions are desirable. The problem is in finding them. That is where this book has value. It encapsulates a lot of specialised ODE solving techniques, applied to reams of equations.<br />As an aside, the book also shows a qualitative difference between Russia and the US. The Soviets always lagged behind the US in computing. So by necessity, Soviet scientists emphasised more the traditional pencil and paper approach to solving equations. Whereas Americans were more likely to toss it over to a nearby computer. This has lead in the US to the deprecating of courses and texts in differential equation solving. Hence if you are an American researcher facing an ODE with no obvious solution, it may be quite difficult for you, ab initio, to find a solution. So check this book first for answers.eck this book first for answers.	2004-01-23

Starting at the conceptual basis with a detailed exposition of the theory. You should already have the equivalent of at least two years of undergraduate courses in statistics and probability to follow the exposition.<br />Graduate students and researchers in the field would benefit immensely from having this series close at hand. Aside from the theory, the other virtue of the series is a huge description of the applications, from pure research to industrial contexts. The breadth shows the importance of fuzzy sets. Even if you are concerned with only one particular application, by scanning this series to see how fuzzy sets were used in other contexts, you may be able to abstract inspiration and detailed ideas that can be used in your field.<br />Along these lines, the series shows the prominent researchers using fuzzy sets. You can use this as a starting point into the Citation Indices to find the latest published work.	2004-01-22

In Computer Aided Design, this is a collection of papers that have made key contributions to the advancement of the field. Historic significance.<br />From the early usages of Spice (and its derivatives) to model simple, small electronic circuits. Typically then (early 80s), there was no graphical interface. You had to manually construct netlists for your circuit and then submit this text file to Spice. Clumsy and slow. But still a vast improvement over not having it. Then, as most papers show, graphical interfaces became common. First in monochrome, then quickly to colour.<br />You can see the influence of the Conway-Mead approach to generalising VLSI design so that undergraduates could use it to make chips. A vast step at the time, though taken for granted now. The papers show chronologically how the size of the circuits and of entire chips, grew steadily, pacing the growth of the power of the workstation modelling hardware and software. So that now it is possible to model 100 million transistor chips!<br />For those who might wonder if the field has any more to offer, the concluding papers give good descriptions of the challenges ahead. Difficult, certainly. But not more so than those overcome by the earlier papers.	2004-01-22

His Difference and Analytical Engines are regarded by historians of science as the first computers.<br />This book is a seminal description of his beliefs, inspired in part and intertwined with what he learned during the construction of his Engines. Anyone interested in the history of computers should find her way to this book.<br />In it, you can find explicitly the struggles of the early Industrial Revolution and on who owned a worker's labour. His success in building his Engine led him to the broader view that a tradesman's skill was fungible, if it could be decomposed into its simplest steps, and those optimised, presumably by machinery. This view would foreshadow the rest of the Industrial Revolution, to this day, as machinery (not necessarily computers, mind you) became more sophisticated. Plus, you can see elements in it of Frederick Taylor's time and motion studies of the early 20th century, that were then applied in American factories.<br />Indeed, if you abstract away the idea of algorithm from computing, you can see that the book describes our modern conception of it.<br />But there is one huge problem with this book. Its price. At ninety dollars, it is far too high. The contents are in the public domain since the author has been dead for over 100 years. So the publisher does not have to pay royalties. Plus, the publisher did not have to conduct any research to get the book. It has been in and out of print since it first came out in the 19th century. All the publisher needed to do was get an old copy, scan it into a computer, proofread it and then sent it out to a printing firm, with a new choice of fonts. In the worst case, instead of scanning it with an OCR program, the publisher would have had to hire someone at barely above minimum wage to read an old edition and type it into a computer.<br />Now the publisher might claim that this is a specialised book, with limited print runs. So what? If the book was cheaper, it would expand the potential audience. Especially because of Babbage's fame. Perhaps the publisher is aiming the book at university libraries and researchers who could buy this out of grant money.<br />Recently, I reviewed a book of Michael Faraday's letters that had many which were never published. That book was similarly priced. But in this case, the publisher presumably had to hire someone to do some research in amassing the letters. So greater costs were incurred.<br />But not here.

Now, the pervasive presence of computers has meant that students can tackle problems that were totally impractical then.<br />The book reflects this advance by offering algorithms and problems for students to crank up their computers on. No longer are they restricted to only the elegant problems, with analytic answers. Now, &quot;grubby&quot; numbers can be crunched to give insight into problems.<br />The book also aims at students in the biological and social sciences, who typically do not deal much in differential equations beyond a simple predator-prey problem.<br />The treatment should be straightforward to most students, who only need a prior course on introductory calculus.	2004-01-22

This book explains its significance in a variety of contexts. To the researcher interested in pure science, its properties are sufficiently different from crystalline or polycrystalline silicon to offer nontrivial studies.<br />But the greatest potential for amorphous silicon is in vast pervasive applications. Firstly, silicon is very common in the earth's crust, so applications that can make use of it can benefit from this. But, as the book makes clear, it is the expense of making pure crystalline silicon that has driven a lot of the research into amorphous silicon. Crystalline silicon is the base material in most semiconductor fabs. (The only major exception are the fabs that use GaAs. But those are for niche applications.) Amorphous silicon can be made by inherently cheaper means, like sputtering, and under far less stringent particulate contamination limits.<br />This motivates the book's discussion on the use of amorphous silicon in various contexts, like for solar cells. If the efficiency could be pushed sufficiently high, without a concomitant increase in the cost of manufacturing, then this could be a huge commercial field.<br />Interesting and challenging readings.	2004-01-22

In fact, it was more or less in the era that he lived that physics and chemistry separated as sciences. He may be considered as the last major figure to span both disciplines. He is reputed to have complained that the word &quot;physicist&quot; was so awkward to pronounce, unlike &quot;chemist&quot;, which just rolls off the tongue.<br />The attraction of this book to students and historians of science are the many unpublished letters. Now accessible to a much broader audience. You can get some insight into his mental workings. Plus, his correspondents include some towering figures in 19th century Britain. Isambard Brunel, Charles Babbage and others stride across this book in cameo appearances.	2004-01-22

The hope was for a synergistic effect of disparate ideas being commingled in unexpected ways, leading to advances in energy storage density or easier/cheaper manufacturing steps.<br />It is unclear to what extent they were successful, seen from a vantage point of several years later. Yes, there certainly have been increases in performance of commercially available batteries of this type. Presumably, some of this might have been due to that conference. But the overall impression from this text is that of a mature field. Improvements seem incremental. Which is not a detraction on the researchers themselves, but on the very nature of the field. Diminishing returns despite the sometimes strenous and ingenious approaches in several papers.<br />Which is a pity. Because one of the great bottlenecks in wireless computing has been the inability of batteries to offer the same performance increases as that of computer memory and disk storage, which follow approximately Moore's Law of doubling in density every two years or so.	2004-01-22

As I write this, NASA has one Rover on the surface of Mars, with a second hopefully due in a few days time. The relevance to this book is to the papers contained therein on the use of AI in intelligent, autonomous or semiautonomous vehicles. For several years, NASA and others have been very interested in this application of AI. The reason is that if a vehicle cannot be easily controlled remotely, then it needs some simple smarts to navigate safely. In the case of a vehicle on Mars, the reason is simply the speed of light which causes several seconds lag. This precludes real time detailed remote control of navigation around obstacles.<br />As a disclaimer, I can't say that the CD's papers on AI in vehicles were necessarily part of the actual research that went into the 2 Mars Rovers. But if not, they are certainly germane, and show the control issues involved.<br />On a more general note, interested readers will find other papers on this CD on many other applications of AI. It will appeal to those of you wanting practical, real world instantiations of AI, as constrated to endless theoretical musings.	2004-01-22

Designed explicitly to cater to engineering undergraduates, it forsakes strict mathematical rigour for what is more useful to engineers. Namely, there is emphasis on numerous examples, that are fully described. So much so that they may be considered case studies.<br />The theme is one of a pragmatic approach to using statistics in an engineering context. Many algorithms are not presented as actual code in some computer language, but as pseudocode. This may be of use to an instructor wondering whether to use this book or not. The pseudocode readily lends itself to assignment problems where the student has to implement it in some actual source code. This has a moderate level of difficulty, and would be reasonable problems to assign. Each should not take more than a few hours (3?), assuming that the student is already competent in a computer language.	2004-01-22

Why did Excel outrun its competitors (remember them)? Bluttman suggests that the crucial point came in Excel 5, when you could now use Visual Basic to build quick, simple applications on top of Excel. It is along these lines that he motivates this book. What he attempts to show is how you can easily customise each of the MS Office products, through relatively straightforward programming.<br />He systematically goes through MS Word, Excel, Access, PowerPoint and Outlook. For each, he gives examples of how to extend the functionality. Typically, these are done through Visual Basic. Now, VB does have its limitations. Fundamentally, it is a procedural language in which it is hard to write large programs. But it turns out that when you extend an Office product, the amount of coding is usually not that much. The basic reason is that the bulk of the complexity in what you want to do often already resides in Office. What you need customised is a few simple steps to tie various parts of [eg] your spreadsheet together.<br />The OTHER major point of the book is how to use the new XML capabilities in Office. You can now save data in an XML format, instead of it being buried in a Microsoft proprietary binary format. What is the big deal? Well, this now opens the way to much easier integration with non-Microsoft applications. The Visual Basic customisation discussed above really only can be run on top of Office. It has a strength and a weakness. The strength is that it can let you be a consultant, say, to companies that need these customisations. (Apparently, Bluttman was quite successful at this!) But this very strength can be a weakness. Typically, those customisations are client-specific. There is little code reuse. Sure, you may be able to command a nice hourly rate. But all you can transfer between clients is your expertise. Nice, but labour intensive.<br />By contrast, you now have a way to build a separate, full standalone application that can take advantage of Office. The use of XML for data interchange opens entirely new vistas. Given the worldwide distribution of Office, this enables a potentially enormous third party market for you, if you can implement a novel enough application with broad appeal. Maybe there is a business here for you?e use of XML for data interchange opens entirely new vistas.

Since then, email has become all pervasive to educated persons. En route, sendmail also grew vastly in complexity to handle this. So much so that just manipulating its configuration files became convoluted. Worse yet was the actual debugging of its source code.<br />Despite all this, sendmail is still the most powerful Message Transfer Agent on unix/linux. But Venema recently tried a totally different approach. From the onset, he used a modular design and a set of 5 queues in which to process messages. In essence, we have a finite state machine, where the state of a message is the queue that it is in. Dent here shows how Postfix is fundamentally a queue management system. Analogous to how any operating system is basically a file management system.<br />The hope is that Postfix will be easier to maintain and debug. Certainly, from a sysadmin's viewpoint, the configuration files seem simpler than sendmail's. But perhaps this is partly because Postfix does not yet have the full capability of sendmail?<br />As a sign of the times we live in, Dent devotes 2 chapters to antispam measures possible in Postfix. This is equivalent functionality to sendmail's Milter API. Likewise, the current Postfix antispam implementations are no more effective than Milter's. Which leaves room for you to try your hand at improving this state of affairs!<br />As Dent describes, Postfix is now open source and easily available. Still not as widely installed as sendmail. But you now have a credible alternative to it.	2004-01-19

This is the level of architecture, which is covered in this book, recently updated to reflect the latest industry practices.<br />The book tries to help you make strategically correct decisions EARLY in a project. Should you go for a client-server architecture, for example. If so, then it shows how you probably need familiarity with Remote Procedure Calls and the Distributed Computing Environment and with CORBA. Or maybe you should use an Object Oriented technology? Helpfully, the book guides you towards Java and J2EE as a development platform to do this. But it also suggests C# and .NET as an alternative platform.<br />The authors are thoughtful enough to suggest that you steer away from a procedural paradigm if you have a commercial project, though they do give a careful, respectful description of what that approach is.<br />The book covers more topics than just the above. I mentioned those because they may well be the most useful to you. Other important topics are the solidying of UML as the industry's standard design notation, and the use of XML as the most robust format for data interchange.<br />Malveau and Mowbray write in a clear, down to earth style. Yes, they describe the standard jargon, because you need to know this. But the prose thankfully minimises the interspersed sprinkling of acronyms. In other words, you can read entire sections fluidly, and understand them, without having to constantly refer to a glossary of obscure acronyms.	2004-01-16

She has produced a book that brings together a comprehensive view of metadata and of its parent, meta-metadata.<br />It is rather easy to find a book on the details of XML, for example. Or on SQL and its various commercial and open source implementations. And on database design.<br />But all these can be regarded as lower level details. What if you have several data warehouses, each with its own DBMS catalog, and the warehouses are not from the same vendor? Plus, there are manifold, quite separate application tools that read/write to these. You want to develop a coherent integrated view of the data, hopefully by using metadata descriptors. The type of texts mentioned above are of little help here. The vendor specific books typically orient you to their product alone.<br />Tannenbaum has striven to fill this market gap. She explains what metadata is, and what a metamodel is. All done at a high level that frees you from the syntax of XML or SQL. Though she does use UML in many diagrams, you do not need to know UML to understand them.<br />My only quibble is that perhaps some more detailed examples would have been instructive. The high level discussions are good. But some readers might miss the significances of some remarks. More explicit pedagogic examples might drive home the points.	2004-01-15

The dominance of Hidden Markov Models and Linear Predictive Coding had been clear by then, for practical, near-realtime ASRs.<br />There is reference in several sections to the high speed microprocessors and cheap memory and disk space that made all this possible. Given that this is 2004 and the book came out in 1999, it means that in the described research, typically the CPU clocks were under 1 GHz, and memory was maybe less than 100 Mb. In other words, with current hardware, you should be able to implement most of the described algorithms with possibly greater efficacy than achieved in the text. The other implication is that now there might be greater commercial applications possible using these methods.<br />There is some discussion of how to improve ASR recognition.

Whilst this book lacks the turgid, pompous ponderosity of Ayn Rand's tomes, you can see a pronounced preachy, didactic tone at many places. Now Steve Stirling and other authors have said that it is a common mistake by some readers to assume that a narrative viewpoint in a book is necessarily the author's personal viewpoint. So do keep that in mind.<br /><br />But in this book, the depiction of the society is so utopic to some political worldviews, and takes up so much of the text, that you have to wonder if indeed it does represent the author's beliefs. Even if not, the plot is trifle more than a wrapper around these descriptions.<br /><br />Some of you with a historical bent in science fiction will recognise this as the traditional criticism of science fiction. In regular fiction, the characters and the plot are primary. In SF, often it is the idea that is the real hero. The characters are really tokens shuffling across a chessboard in order to give life to the idea.<br /><br />The influence of Robert Heinlein is pretty clear, even without the inclusion of a spaceship by that name in the plot. One consequence is not necessarily good to the book. By explicitly invoking Heinlein, the author can cause you to compare it against Heinlein's works, especially his best works, because isn't that how you remember most authors? That comparison of Williamson's first novel against Heinlein's finest is not really fair, but inevitable. Well, the two may have similar views, but Heinlein at his peak was a far better writer.<br /><br />Speaking of which, of Heinlein's works, are we meant to compare this to \\"Farnham's Freehold\\"? Superficially, there is the similarity in titles. Dig deeper. Farnham's was a small group struggling to survive a nuclear war. Society had disappeared, and they only themselves to depend on. A graphic, very explicit novel for its time [early 60s] that, amongst other things, depicted incest and interracial sex.<br /><br />The society in Williamson's Freehold follows the individualistic nature of Heinlein's. But the Heinlein book had a far stronger plot line. More taut. Yes, Williamson's book has its action sequences and characters. Both aspects are far weaker.<br /><br />Williamson adds a twist. The book is not a simple rewrite of Heinlein's. He appears to be redoing the American Revolution, with this new planet's society mapping to the Americans, and the United Nations being the British. Fine. But the UN characters in the invading forces are totally cardboard oafs, whose main role seems to be clumsily stumble about the land before being killed by the brave colonists. One dimensional cartoon characters. Now, publishing constraints means that authors face practical limits as to the length of a novel. But by not fleshing out the bad guys in any depth just reduces them, and the pedagogic views they stand for, to straw dummies.<br /><br />One other thing. The society depicted does not have state funded education. Families are expected to pay directly for their children's education. Now it is one thing for parents to support private education alongside an existing state education system. But consider from actual history what societies had no state education. All the preindustrial societies. But of the industrial societies, ALL have state education. If you consider countries without this, they invariably are the poorest, most wretched. Mostly in subSaharan Africa. Or Afghanistan under the Taliban. If you look at the newly industrialised countries - Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, etc, they all invest heavily in state education.<br /><br />The book posits that you can have, and maintain, an industrial society, without it. And also not have pockets of poverty striken ignorance arise due to this policy. These may really be the most controversial claims in the entire book. Totally at variance with empirical observations of actual industrial development. Most other reviewers appear to have concentrated on the glitz of the plot, without thinking deeper about the implications of the declaimed construct.wers appear to have concentrated on the glitz of the plot, without thinking deeper about the implications of the declaimed construct.	2004-01-05

Since this is so, surely it is not too difficult for Wiley to update this CD into a 9th edition? They have the material that went into the 9th hardcopy, and that material sits in their computer databases anyway. The incremental effort to cut new CDs is small.<br />Granted, it would obsolete this 8th edition CD. But the 9th hardcopy obsoleted the 8th hardcopy anyway. And for large hardcopy books, that is a heftier inventory writeoff than for CDs and their associated packaging.<br />Avoid this CD. Wait till the 9th edition CD comes out.	2004-01-04

In semiconductor fabs, as high a yield as possible is paramount. Defects kill devices. All the more so as devices get smaller and so are more susceptible to failure.<br />To this ends, every semiconductor company has a tightly guarded collection of secret recipes to reduce the incidence of defects during manufacture. True, some of these are patented, and thus become public knowledge. But a lot of fab techniques may not be easily patentable. And sometimes, with those that could be, a company might decide that it is competitively better to keep it proprietary.<br />So what this book has are results from universities and what some companies are willing to report. If the latter, just keep the above comments in mind when reading the book.<br />Another thing to consider is that the book was published in 1990. Now, most advanced fabs are producing devices in the deep submicron size range and on 300 mm diameter wafers. In 1990, most wafers were 200 mm or smaller, and fabs were just reaching below the micron mark. So this book may be rather dated and limited use to you.	2004-01-04

Quite possibly, there are few to gainsay Meyers in this.<br />This edition was published in 1992. Naturally, some sections need revising. The greatest omission to us, now, is no description of the World Wide Web, which is undoubtedly how you are perusing this review right now! The first browser, Mosaic, was released around 1992-3. So unintentionally, this Encyclopedia marks the end of the pre-Web era. Any update, or competing tome, has to acknowledge that in a basic way, something qualitatively different has jelled and is now probably the most common daily interaction of an educated person with technology.<br />Related to this is the relatively skimpy discussion of electronic communication in the Encyclopedia. At that time, the ubiquitous email notation of user@company was still struggling against competing mail protocols like DECNET and UUNET. Bulletin Boards were state of the art.<br />Plus if you read the descriptions of typical computers, mini and personal, it already has the feel, heck, it is, of a bygone era.<br />However, if you turn to the sciences, the descriptions of the basics of each science are still superb.<br />No doubt the author and his publisher have contemplated updating. But there is now another factor, caused by the rise of the Web. The prospect of compiling another huge hardcover that will be outdated as soon as it is published is daunting. And, as you might know, the traditional encyclopedia market has imploded, due to CDs, DVDs and the web.<br />Books like this Encylopedia may have been the last of their ilk.	2004-01-04

In some ways, this is the next natural step beyond a realistic, real time rendition of images, as in Doom or Quake. Those and other games used simple optics and trigonometry to derive accurate images.<br />But as computers get more powerful, and players might find themselves driving cars, for example, then having these vehicles respond accurately when driven became the next logical step in simulation.<br />The book covers Newtonian mechanics, because that is what we are typically familiar with. If you are a physicist, you should recall that historically there were 2 great advances within this - Hamiltonian and Lagrangian methods. (Cf. Goldstein's \\"Classical Mechanics\\".) A little ironic, wouldn't you say, that now some jobs in applying these are for games?! Who would have thought it, some twenty years ago.<br />The book is good for helping you focus on what objects in the system you should be modelling. Part of your experience comes in deciding this level of detail. Actually, this is not restricted to games, but to any physical system that you are analysing.<br />The graphics in this book are really a secondary consideration. Stay focused. Model the system FIRST. Then attend to the views. Even though the views are what the player sees.<br />To this end, you should be pleased to know that the author sticks to graphics standards like OpenGL, which can be ported to most current computers. So you don't have to invest your time in learning some restricted graphics language.	2004-01-03

That is basically the level of treatment in this book of research topics at the boundary of physics and engineering.<br />The most relevant chapters are probably those discussing how we can take the semiconductor progress and keep pushing, pushing and pushing it ever onwards. Moore's Law, you understand. Current industry techniques may give us another 10 years. But what then? Various new physical phenomena are suggested in the book as possible novel ways to encode and change information. Of course, when these will prove economically feasible is totally open at this time.

Well, you might consider this recent book. The authors have gone to some length to explain events without appealing to more than simple calculus.<br />Nothing flashy.

Suppose you would be transported to another planet and you had to attempt to rebuild our civilisation. But you could only take 6 books with you.<br />What would you take?<br />Well, that author gave a list of his suggestions. One of which was this; well an earlier edition anyway. He pointed out something about the Rubber Handbook, which is what anyone who regularly uses this book calls it. So easy to take for granted, because in any lab, you can usually rummage around and find some edition of it. But it represents millions of hours of engineering and research to measure and collate its results.<br />If there is one book that summarises the engineering of our civilisation, it is this.<br />Always nice to see CRC continually updating it. But having said the above, whether you need this latest edition is another matter. The changes are incremental. If you have an older edition, and there is no specific reason to upgrade, then you probably shouldn't. Note that I did not say never. Just tell yourself you can defer it till next year.

Whereas 15 years ago, say, texture maps and NURBS would have been cutting edge, now those have been incorporated into most software packages and even hardware.<br /><br />There is still more to be done with fractals, as the book reveals. Better, more lifelike landscapes, for example.<br /><br />But perhaps the hardest, and least developed aspect treated in the book is that of modelling human faces, and the inverse problem of recognising faces from actual photographs. This is not meant as a criticism of those authors discussing it. Rather it is because of evolution. How does an animal recognise another of its own species? Ever since sight evolved, this is a fundamental issue that is crucial to species propagation. Hence, when you recognise a familiar face, you are invoking old and opaque algorithms buried deep in our brain.<br /><br />As a result, when you look at a computer generated human face, you are far more likely to find something \\"off\\" about it than you are with an image of a tree.<br /><br />The book's facial methods are an excellent start to this problem.

It was first published in 1967, and has not been updated since. But its material is correct. Discoveries in physics since 1967 have not refuted the analysis here.<br />It is an easy introduction to theoretical condensed matter physics. Subjects like second quantisation, superconductivity and superfluidity are explained. If you have read Kittel's book on solid state physics, that is adequate preparation for this.<br />Understand, though, that the superconductivity described here is that of BCS; the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. The standard model. It does not treat the high temperature superconductors, as those hail from 1987 onwards. But that field is in tremendous flux [pun intended] and if you are interested in that, seek out a text devoted to it.	2004-01-03

Computers are now powerful enough that you can construct ever more realistic simulations of particle-particle interactions.<br />Certainly, since the 1950s, there have been molecular dynamics simulations. But because of severe computational constraints, those might have been in two dimensions or even one.<br />This book goes far beyond those humble beginnings. It describes two and three dimensional spaces wherein the molecules roam. In case you wonder why anyone would treat two dimensional spaces nowadays, keep in mind that a lot of industrial chemistry revolves around catalysis. And this may often be on a solid substrate which might be adequately modelled as flat.<br />Plus, the book describes how you are no longer restricted to just atoms interacting via isotropic van der Waals forces. Now you can use the active unfilled orbitals in atoms and molecules, and build quite complex molecules, some of biological importance, and collide them. Here the quantum mechanics is usually simplified to a semiempirical computation of a potential energy surface for the molecule.<br />Parts of the book also describe simulations of truly quantum systems. Still quite intensive. Here, you are usually restricted to small molecules.	2004-01-03

Well, those of sepia toned photographs from 1850 onwards. But invariably for most, illustrations from musty old tomes also arise. The first country with mass literacy still found cartoons and other illustrations useful in many books. Remember that for them, the cost of including these was far greater than for a modern publisher. The plummetting cost of images since the 19th century  should not blind us to this. Thus, by inference, when you see the wonderfully chosen examples in this book, the very existence, as independently decided by different authors and publishers over the space of a century, gives some clue as to the value the illustrations were perceived to have.<br />Maxwell shows some very traditional religious illustrations that explicitly hark back to medieval monasteries. But he also shows illustrations, especially by Aubrey Beardsley, form the late 19th century, that would not look out of place in today's New Yorker. The clean, clear cuts of Beardsley eerily anticipate by a mere 20 years those of Heath Robinson and the associated, minimalist Art Deco architecture. By contrast, the book has other illustrations from early in the 19th century that unmistakably are redolent of the century that just passed on.<br />Nice.	2004-01-02

In their political processes, rarely does anyone die. Of course, we all know of the Presidents assassinated. But when you look over all who run for office in the US, violence is very infrequent. This book demonstrates that it is not always so elsewhere. For example, in India, the world's largest democracy, two prime ministers have died in office, while their federal elections regularly have associated death tolls. The book surveys other places with similar travails. Northern Ireland. Sri Lanka. Israel. South Africa.<br />Indeed, the book poses an uncomfortable question to thosre who swear by democracy. Can an electoral process actually exacerbate or incite violence? Likewise, self determination is usually considered a good thing. Consent of the governed and all that. This was the basis for the US Revolutionary War, after all, and for the post WW2 decolonisation of the European empires. But when one looks at the breakup of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, this self determination seemed to trigger a series of little wars.<br />The book also discusses something very topical. Democracy and Islamic fundamentalism. For example, if an Arab country is being ruled by a de facto dictatorship, and fundamentalists are agitating for democracy, this can pose dilemmas for the US. If the US supports them in gaining power peacefully, will they be grateful, to put it bluntly? Or might they then use the tyranny of the majority at the ballot box to discriminate against ethnic or religious minorities?<br />Given the current situations in Iraq and Afghanistan, readers may see this as a very germane question. Plus, in both countries, quite aside from religion, there are several ethnic groups with possible aspirations for a more independent role, which relates to the issues discussed earlier for other parts of the world.<br />An awkward book, for the issues it raises.	2004-01-01

So I read with interest this recent offering, written by Kim Dae Jung, who was President of South Korea till February 2003.<br />He writes from the viewpoint of a historian and an economist, and above all, as a human rights activist. He describes, with the manifest pride of any Korean, the stunning rise of South Korea from ruins and famine in the 1950s to the world's 8th largest economy.<br />But the book is not a dry recitation of statistics. He devotes much space to analysing the society. Most notably, he points out that Korean capitalism grew up under and was nourished by the military dictatorships. In fact, it uneasily closely parallels the economic systems of Germany and Japan before World War 2, and those of many Latin American dictatorships after the war. He calls it an unholy alliance of &quot;monopoly dictatorship&quot; capitalism, where the state actively promotes favoured companies. In South Korea, as in other places, this was done by getting banks to lead cheap capital, and by the government stifling independent trade unions.<br />Kim describes how he wished to break this by truly promoting fair competition between firms and to give consumers greater choice of products. He warns that otherwise, the continued military-industrial ties may lead South Korea to disaster, as had happened in Germany and Japan.<br />Though he is no longer President, so long as he remains an important influence in Korea, this book is indispensible for understanding his views.	2004-01-01

For over twenty years, the most common program used to handle this was sendmail, written by Eric Allman. Over this time, sendmail has become a fully fledged language, with a very inelegant syntax. To learn how this, you need the book &quot;Sendmail&quot; by Costales and Allman.<br />The basic problem is that twenty years of ever increasing complexity in mail handling has created concomitant complexity in sendmail. For system adminstrators, the sendmail configuration files are probably the most complicated things they have to understand and maintain.<br />The rub is that most sysadmins have many duties, and little time to thoroughly read the above book. What is needed is a crib sheet, that lets you quickly solve very common sendmail configuration issues. Wherein the need for this book. Hunt takes a pragmatic approach. He tells you enough to handle these common issues. Sometimes, this comes at a slight cost. For example, he never really fully explains the the sendmail class notation. For a rigorous explanation, you still need Allman's book. But as a practical matter, you probably not that curious about the notation anyway. Hunt's approach may solve your problems quicker!<br />An interesting aspect of this Cookbook is that it shows the recent evolution of sendmail, as seen in the subtitle at the top of the cover, &quot;Spam-Fighting&quot;. Sysadmins who dealt with sendmail from 5 years ago or earlier will recall nothing pertaining to antispam techniques.<br />But just as email was the first killer application, the second killer application was the browser, starting in 1992-3. The third killer application was spam, often viewed via the second application. In the last 5 years, spam has grown amazingly. So much so that it has been debated on the floors of the US Parliament! It has gotten to the point that some alarmists are even claiming that this third killer app might be crippling the first app!<br />Well, this Cookbook has several sections, including an entire chapter, focussed on various antispam techniques, like procmail parsing, or hooking up to Real Time Block Lists like spamhaus.org. The efficacy of such methods may vary widely, but you do get a choice. Though none of these currently appear to offer a truly effective countermeasure. You are still getting tons of spam, aren't you?<br />Perhaps some genius in the not too distant future can help us!okbook has several sections, including an entire chapter, focussed on various antispam techniques, like procmail parsing, or hooking up to Real Time Block Lists like spamhaus.org.

Roger Penrose is well known to the educated public from his book, &quot;The Emperor's New Mind&quot;, where he mused on the physical origin of consciousness. Whether you agreed with that or not, you should be aware that prior to that book, he was well reknowned in mathematics and theoretical physics.<br />Penrose made his name with groundbreaking papers on twistor theory, where he posited a conformally invariant physics in the 4 dimensions of spacetime. He found a mapping between a field equation in physics and a projective space that was later called by others the Penrose Transform.<br />This book extends that work by making a generalisation of the transform so that twistors can be applied to higher dimensional spaces. This may be of interest to you, if you study superstrings or supergravity. There, our mundane spacetime is subsumed in a much larger space.<br />You need to be familiar with the theory of continuous groups and Dynkin diagrams to use this book. (Cf. Wybourne's &quot;Classical Groups for Physicists&quot; for good preparation.) The level of development is quite advanced.	2003-12-30

The book spans 1500 to 1850, the latter being essentially before the American Civil War. It concentrates on events inside the present day United States. You should be aware that there is little coverage of Mexico and the Canadas. Lest you think this restrictive, remember that we are still referring to a span of 350 years and the US. Given this vast field in time and space, the book does not claim comprehensiveness. What it does have are chapters on numerous aspects of the encounters. Intermarriage, religion, trading, disease and, of course, war and the forced relocation of the few survivors.<br />There is coverage not just of the eastern seaboard, with the well known incidents at Plymouth and the selling of Manhattan. Also presented are chapters on the Spanish incursions and settlements in the South West. The chapters strive to go beyond the stereotypical, marginal roles played by the natives in standard histories. You can get some understanding of the intricacies of their societies and the range of their dealings with the Europeans. There is, though, a continual frustration; which is not the fault of the authors. The written records we have are overwhelmingly those left by the settlers. We can only wonder now at what was never recorded directly by the natives, and which has been irretrievably forsaken to the nameless dust of history.	2003-12-29

This book discusses one such migration, of Jews from agricultural communities in Tunisia. Schely-Newman focuses on the women who made this transition. While Jewish societies in Muslim countries did not have the same degree of purdah for their women as did their Muslim neighbours, over the centuries, such attitudes had their impact.<br />So these Jewish women tended to have secluded lifestyles. The change in moving to a predominantly secular and industrial society must have been severe for some, even if they moved to rural Israel. The author explores in case studies how several women coped and modified their traditions in their new homeland.<br />The descriptions here are broader than just for Jews. Indeed, in countries like Saudi Arabia, which industrialised in one generation, and Turkey and Indonesia, which are still doing so, there was large internal migration. One can see interesting parallels in the Muslim experiences with modernisation.	2003-12-29

Or kept forbidden? Perhaps you have no strong feelings either way, but are interested in some neutral information that is reasonably well argued. You don't want a stridently &quot;anti&quot; screed, a la William [Reefer Madness] Bennett. Neither do you want something issued by a long time, zonked out, dreadlocked subscriber to High Times.<br />Take a gander here. Kleiman analyses marijuana with a strong economic bent. He shows various supply-demand curves for it, treating it as a regular commodity, subject to classical economic analysis. He also looks similarly at drug enforcement effectiveness and various elasticities of demand.<br />The book was published in 1989 and his data is thence from the 80s. Still timely. In parts of the US and elsewhere, there has been some slight easing of prohibition. But much of the status quo of the 80s remains, as though in a time warp.<br />Kleiman also provides a comprehensive appendix. Useful if you want original sources.	2003-12-29

Many papers on all aspects of applying Bayesian methods were presented. The topics include temporal coherence, probabilities of nuclear war [!, sic], multiparameter Bayesian inference, undetected errors and survey sampling.<br />Also, the book has more than some other conference writeups that you may be familiar with. Here, the discussion session after each paper was presented is cogently summarised. So more than just a formal set of papers. You can get a feel of the ideas and research prospects.<br />Some of you might say that a 20 year old text is outdated. Well, maybe in some fields. But in mathematics, usually results are rarely outrightly refuted. Plus, on the subject of statistics, one might see an extra effect. Papers can become more useful with time, as computing keeps getting vastly cheaper, since the tedious gruntwork of gathering and crunching data falls. So methods can become more powerful.	2003-12-28

Scads of exercises, which is utterly essential for you to gain fluency. As a nice touch, the author also provides answers to half the questions. Alternatively, if you are a lecturer casting around for a suitable text for your class, then this may be useful. You can assign many problems for which your students cannot blithely look up the answers.<br />The book covers topics like Euler's Totient, Quadratic residues, Chinese Remainder Theorem and Diophantine equations. The breadth of number theory.<br />The book has another merit. Pure number theory texts are suitable for those majoring in the field. But even amongst mathematicians, this is a small set. These days, number theory forms the foundations of cryptography. The continued rise of the Internet, especially for commercial applications, including the still incipient web services, has spawned a critical need for better encryption. A major theme of the book is its usefulness to cryptographers. To this end, public keys, elliptic curves and other related topics are prominently described.	2003-12-28

Added to this melange is the interaction (a euphemism for occupation) by three European empires, German, French and British. Mix all these up and one gets an amazingly complex narrative for such a compact region.<br />The book is a collection of monographs by scholars of the country; who call themselves Cameroonists, by the way. Some chapters are a straightforward description of historial periods. Others touch on more involved issues of ethnic identity amongst the various peoples. Gives you depth of understanding about a country that is often cursorily described in most encyclopedias. Yet which has about as many people as, say, Belgium or Switzerland.	2003-12-28

So much so that sometimes you hear of the &quot;Berserker hypothesis&quot;, as to why there might not be much sentient life out there. Yet, for decades, he has also written well received fantasy. This book is a recent reissue of what was originally several short stories seemlessly stitched into one organic narrative.<br />A strange and original blend of fantasy with high technology. True, this is strictly a fantasy. But Saberhagen seemingly places it in the far future after a devastating nuclear war. We see a still functioning tank, nuclear powered, though not as capable as Keith Laumer's Bolos. Plus, throughout the text, there are continual references, and instances of surviving technology.<br />These are sometimes invoked with deliberate hilarity. As when a magic spell sets fire to a villain's court. He then calmly uses a bright red fire extinguisher to snuff it out. The utter incongruity of this scene would make marvellous filming!	2003-12-28

Firstly, that three siblings would prove to be so gifted in the same field. For example, we can only wonder what if Charles Dickens had had two such siblings?<br />Then, of course, there is the obvious factor that all three Brontes were female. At a time when wealthy British women had such circumscribed career choices. Ever since their lifetimes, many have thusly commented.<br />But apparently few have focused on how the Brontes depicted families in their fiction, and how these tied in with their own familial situation and the Victorian ethos of family. In retrospect, this is one of those analyses whose idea is stunningly obvious. But for some reason, a priori to this book, it has been little (none?) touched on.<br />Most interestingly, Lamonica suggests that while the Brontes never actually denied the prospect of a woman being content through her family, they never made this out to be the only choice. A very contemporary stance.	2003-12-28

Their locale geographically dominates the entire region, and historically the Bakweri leveraged this into various forms of advantage, at times commercial and at times political.<br />When the Europeans arrived, they too saw the strategic significance of the Bakwiri's area. Four centuries of interaction followed, as described here in a posthumous collection of papers written by the anthropologist Edwin Ardener. He covered many aspects of that history in research that took him decades to amass.<br />Some readers may find most compelling the narrative of how the Bakwiri defeated the Germans in an 1894 battle, though they eventually lost that war. A European defeat in Africa in the 19th century was rare indeed. But for some reason, this battle has been far less remembered than the British defeat by the Zulus at Isandlwana.	2003-12-28

In histories of the region, written by Europeans, passing mention might be made of them. And then, invariably, from the standpoint of the British colonial records. Typically, the Gogo might be called 'tribes without rulers' or 'peoples without history'. The doctrine of 'terra nullius'. Scarcely acknowledged was a rich precolonial history. In the ethos of 19th century colonialism, the Gogo were considered barely more than seminaked primitives.<br />What the author has done is translate from Swahili to English the narrative history of the Gogo, as researched by the Tanzanian author M E Mnyampala. It is important because it exposes to a broader world the local history, as seen unconfined to the lens of the former colonial rulers.<br />The complexity of the narrative structure offers some insight into the sophistication of local culture that otherwise would be unappreciated by anyone not knowning Swahili.	2003-12-27

It is putting forth a programming environment whereby you could combine modules written in different languages, without recompiling, let alone rewriting.<br />Arguably, Microsoft set itself a harder task than did Sun with java. Along this road, as the book describes, a standard arose - the Common Language Infrastructure. It describes a Virtual Execution System and what type of executable code can use it. So a version of Pascal, say, that wanted to run on a VES would need to pass the compilation rules of a Pascal compiler that adhered to CLI.<br />An analogy might help. In some rough way, you might consider CLI + VES to be like a java virtual machine, and the choice of a language to use atop CLI to be like running java under its jvm. Granted, this is crude, but many readers are probably unfamiliar with CLI, whilst having more acquaintance with java.<br />Warning. The book may be heavy sledding for most. The main audience is compiler writers and language developers. Daresay that even experienced developers may not usually deal with a language at this level.<br />A slight irony is that CLI is meant to decouple programmers from any specific platform, which is why Microsoft pushed it over to a standards body. But the most developed instantiation currently appears to be .NET, which is inextricably interwoved with Microsoft's operating systems.	2003-12-25

Not so long ago (well, the 80s), if you wanted to do computer graphics with, say, a light source and Gourard shading, the only recourse was a $100 000 Evans and Sutherland machine. Plus, any code was in the latter's native graphics library, further increasing your dependence on that company. Along came SGI, who basically then took the workstation graphics market in the 90s.<br /><br />One of the good things SGI did was to promote OpenGL as a set of graphics routines. Gradually, with each iteration of OpenGL, it moved from a dependence on SGI hardware and IRIX (their version of Unix) to a software interface that frees you from a given hardware platform. This, and the sheer functional sweep of the graphics capabilities described in the book, may make OpenGL the easiest way for anyone to learn and apply graphics. The book describes such necessities (which is what these have become nowadays) as texture mapping, NURBS, tesselations and motion blur.<br /><br />The book covers topics up to, but not including, ray tracing. The book is an ideal companion to a pure graphics text, that goes into the theory. The emphasis here is on showing how you can apply that theory, without having to code elementary operations from scratch. The authors do describe some theory, but only the pragmatic minimum necessary to motivate an explanation of the library's routines. In other words, you will not get drowned in maths!	2003-12-25

Not for beginners. Has the merit of not being too verbose. It deals mainly with the syntax of C++. And, yes, while it certainly covers OOP, this may be why some other reviewers say it is not a good OOP book. The thing is, if you have start explaining the language at the lowest level, syntax, then this necessarily takes up space in the book.<br />What some may notice is the lack of diagrams, whether UML or flowcharts or whatever. There is relatively little coverage of higher level design, from an OOP standpoint or any other, for that matter.<br />Plus, unlike some more recent programming books, which use multicolours on the text pages to draw the reader's attention, this is very much a traditional text, in plain black and white. Nothing wrong with that, but some of you expecting a more &quot;popular&quot; style should look elsewhere. But if you knuckle down and read this text, you can benefit.	2003-12-18

But you have never done so? Well, texts have started to appear; the latest being this one by Chatterjee and Webber. It has several merits. Perhaps the strongest is that it does not take sides in the J2EE versus Microsoft's .NET debate. Wait a minute, you might say! You have heard enough about Web Services to know that it is vendor and platform independent, much like HTML, which is an industry standard. So how could a book on Web Services NOT be neutral?<br />Well, consider how HTML is a standard, but different browsers render an HTML page slightly differently. And HTML is pretty simple, remember. Now consider that Web Services is far more complex. The XML messages going to and from a WS are vendor neural. But, as is made clear by the examples in the book, the XML does not describe the processing logic implementation on a WS provider, by deliberate design, to make things loosely coupled. But if that provider has, say, a transaction capability, then you can get into the nuances of implementation.<br />Thus, if for example you get a book on J2EE WS, that may be fine. But it may also be hard to disentangle the truly neutral design details from the necessarily hairy implementation.<br />The neutrality of this book should be a design virtue to you. Look, if you are going to build a WS, you probably already have preferences for .NET or J2EE (or something else). So, indeed, do get a WS book specific to that platform. But consider this book as a good second opinion, and much cheaper than hiring a consultant.	2003-12-17

The part on ADO.NET refers to further enhancements to accessing MS SQL Server on the .NET platform, as well as sundry bug fixes.<br />The other part concerns how .NET handles XML data management. Here Microsoft has put in a ton of work to handle the latest XML standards, including XML Schema, XPath and XQuery. The entire XML field has been growing rapidly and this book shows how Microsoft is keeping pace. Very reassuring.<br />Also, as one might expect, Microsoft has added custom enhancements to XML. There are two standard XML parsers, DOM and SAX, each with its well known advantages and disadvantages. With the SAX parser, you essentially add one of your routines to it as a listener for events you specify. Then you run SAX on an XML object. Via the listener, it pushes instances of those events to you. GUI building follows this approach. But some developers find this very awkward and unnatural. To answer this, Microsoft has come up with an &quot;XMLReader&quot; that reads XML objects and pull data into your code in a more intuitive way. Interesting, and this may be useful to some who are new to XML.<br />The book is more than just two disjoint halves. Basically, Microsoft is weaving the SQL access of ADO every more closely with XML, where the latter can be used as a data viewing language into the SQL. What about the impedance mismatch? Considerable effort has been expended to subsume this into low level details that more developers can ignore.<br />So for all these reasons, if you are already using .NET and SQL Server, you may want to check out these details more fully.	2003-12-17

Microsoft's Internet Exploreer won, right? Certainly, on desktops, IE is said to be on over 90%, with the rest divvied up between Netscape, Mozilla, Konqueror, Opera and sundry others. Plus, by now most browsers have the same core functionality. So on your desktop, regardless of what browser you are currently using, why switch to another type anyway? As opposed to following the upgrade path for your browser.<br />Given all this, you might askk why we need a book on Mozilla? Game over, right? Well, Mozilla has become far more than just a browser. It is now a chassis or platform upon which to quickly develop applications. It has a library of over 1000 objects, GUI and nonGUI, that have been extensively tested. The idea is that you can then easily write your application in JavaScript, using this library. By the way, JavaScript is the only choice. You might compare Mozilla to java and its now large library, or to C++ and its Standard Template Library.<br />The book points out repeatedly that this is open source and free. Here, free is the operative word. Because, as McFarlane is careful to note, for the typical developer, open source Mozilla is moot. If you want rapid development, you have neither the time or inclination to acquaint yourself with the source at a level that you can usefully change it.<br />The book does not seem to say the following, but I offer it as extra guidance. If you want to compare Mozilla with a Microsoft product of similar functionality, then that is not IE. Rather, it might be Visual Studio .NET. Also, in the open source arena, another alternative to Mozilla is Eclipse, donated by IBM. Eclipse is also extensible, but where you program in Java.	2003-12-14

It comprehensively surveys the field of malware. It clearly explains viruses, worms and Trojans. Plus, given the universal prevalence of browsers on computers these days, careful attention is given to infiltrations via buggy browsers.<br />The authors write in an easy to follow style, aimed at the programmer. Though if you are not such, but know the rudiments of computers as a user, you can follow most of the discussion.<br />If you have ever wondered at the brief explanations of viruses or worms that appear in the general media, or even in the technical magazines, then this is an instructive book. For example, you have probably heard of &quot;buffer overflows&quot;. But due to the constraints of space or audience type, the explanations left you unsatisfied. Turn instead here.<br />Some of you may look with askance upon this book. After all, haven't the authors just written a HowTo for new malware wretches? Strictly, perhaps so. But before you berate the authors, consider this. The top malware writers probably devote the bulk of their formidable intellectual creativity to malware. But if you want to guard against it, and you are a programmer or sysadmin, typically this is not your only responsibility. Without a book like this, it is much harder to come up to speed. You then face a very unlevel playing field.<br />The only strange thing about this book is that there should be more like it, at its level of detail. If you survey the field of computer books, it can seem like there are multiple books on most topics, not matter how obscure. But on THIS topic, which is of broad, pervasive import to most users, there exists little.<br />Until now.	2003-12-13

A very nice analysis of the correlation between the transport networks in and out of a developing country, and its level of affluence. Hilling explains all the forms of transport - ports, roads, rail and air, and how these affect and can limit the productivity of the regions they service. He surveys examples from all over the world.<br />Certainly, he shows how a poor network inside a developing country can leave entire regions backward, even relative to the rest of the country, let alone to the developed world. It isolates them, making it too expensive to sell their goods in a broader market. Thus these poor regions cannot use what is often their only comparative advantage - the cheap cost of their labour.<br />By comparison, regions with very good transport, especially to the developed world, can lift themselves out of poverty within a generation. Hilling cites the cases of Hong Kong and Singapore, which in fact rose to developed status.	2003-12-11

That proved adequate for SGML, but its limitations soon became clear in XML. Several alternatives were proposed, but XML Schema seems to be winning. Thus Bradley has delivered a timely exposition. He covers all the features clearly. A brief mention is made of its competitors, Relax NG and Schematron. But they do seem to be fading fast.<br />The most interesting part of Bradley's text are the chapters on namespaces. Other aspects of Schema are lower level and, while useful, are frankly mundane. By contrast, namespaces are the critical feature of Schema. They let you build on pre-existing schemas that have been published on the web. And you can publish your schemas so that others might benefit. You and those in your field or industry can cooperatively derive a net gain by agreeing and publishing standard definitions. A Network effect.<br />I assume that you are familiar with HTML. In that, the crucial element are the hyperlinks (the href and src attributes in certain tags). It is these that put the &quot;H&quot; in HTML. Without them, HTML just becomes a limited page markup language. It is that ability to link to arbitrary locations on the Internet which produced the Web. Likewise, in the much heralded Web Services, these exchange data via XML. Which in turn depends on XML Schema to build consistent hyperlinked semantics.<br />You should read Bradley's chapters on namespaces thoroughly.	2003-12-11

See for example seminal work by Wolfram in the early 80s. The gist of these is that very rudimentary rules for short range interactions between these automata can give rise to ordered phenomena over larger distances and times. This book posits such an ordering over some 1600 years, from the fall of the Roman Empire to the present time.<br />Baxter also seems to implicitly use work by Richard Dawkins, in &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;, where Dawkins argues that organisms are just the vessels by which their genes propagate in time. For the most part, this refers to nonsentient creatures. But the most provocative implication of Dawkins' work is that we too are bound by such imperatives. The plot in this book also seems to follow this thread.<br />Somewhat enjoyable. Though the subplot of possible aliens in outer space seems to be quite jarring, and not well fitting, as compared to the way Baxter interleaves two narrative flows, from the present and the past.	2003-12-04

At the very least, the latter can have different byte orderings an datatype sizes, if you write in C or C++. Now in C, by the late 1980s, such headaches caused several unix vendors (mainly Sun) to converge on supporting a key utility, rpcgen (and affiliated routines). This let you write common C code for client/server applications, and compile these on various platforms. Lo, things usually worked!<br /><br />But as software projects grew in complexity, writing in procedural language like C became harder. Hence the rise of C++. Well, wouldn't it be nice to reimplement and extend rpcgen? (It had numerous limitations.) The idea was to finesse/bury OS specific details at a lower level of the code, where you could often ignore it. You can imagine ACE as filling this need. I'm not saying that this is how or why ACE was developed. But I am trying to argue from YOUR background, which I assume is C++ and C.<br /><br />The book describes significantly more functionality in ACE than merely an extension of rpcgen. Even if you don't have a C++ networking application, but are writing a standalone application, ACE may be useful. It increases your chances of writing portable code. For one thing, it heavily downplays the use of OS-supplied compiler macros. In both C++ and C code that will be maintained on several platforms, this is a notorious source of bugs. Very brittle. Just having ACE subsume these issues should give a maintenance productivity gain. You won't see this immediately when coding the first version of your application. But experienced developers should see the payoff.<br /><br />Plus, ACE also offers higher level design patterns. Here, I don't know how applicable they might be to your specific problems. But just having the patterns increases your coding arsenal.	2003-12-04

You can soak up the ambience of other societies, in the format of a fictional narrative. As contrasted perhaps to reading a dry sociology text.<br />The backdrop of the book is complicated. Set in Sicily, it depicts the interleaving of Italian, Arab and French cultures. The plotline has these intricately entangled, due to geography and history. Plus, there are allusions to the different Italian regions and the concomitant stereotypes. For example, the hero is Sicilian, but his girlfriend is Ligurian. At one point, he contrasts their backgrounds in a brief remark. An Italian would catch these immediately, based on her background. But for me, and possibly for you  too, these remain opaque.<br />An analogy might be familiar to you. Think of the various British regional demotics: The dour Scot, the garrulous, overfriendly Cockney, the bloody minded Yorkshireman. Please understand that I do not say these are at all correct, or that I agree with them. But if you are British or American, these should be known to you. Well, something similar is going on in this novel.	2003-12-03

Their writing skill shows clearly in the clarity of the step-by-step pedagogy that they use. They define a &quot;Contribution Circle&quot; of different types of Eclipse usage, from User to Configurer to Extender to Publisher to Enabler and back to User. They suggest how each role can get code from its predecessor, add to it or extract ideas for a new code base, and then offer these new changes to its successor. In doing so, we see the emergence of a virtuous positive feedback loop, and the rise of an Eclipse community.<br />Granted, this may sound nice but vague. So Gamma and Beck proceed in the book to describe 4 such circles, in gradually increasing detail, that illustrate the concept. As is obligatory in a software text, they start with the demotic &quot;Hello World&quot;. The coding is trivial. But even here, they show the various needed files and a look at the Eclipse framework. Plus, and this is good teaching style, most readers will gain some understanding immediately from this first example. Encourages you to delve further. (As opposed to a text that is totally over most readers' heads from the first chapter.)<br />The book gives the big picture of Eclipse, in explaining the various roles of users. As such, it is a good complement to other Eclipse texts, which tend to focus on specific Eclipse features or applications.	2003-12-02

Both books looked forward a hundred years to 2000. Each author gave his vision of the future. Astor imbues this book with a somewhat polemical slant. [As indeed did Bellamy in his.] The result is a book that may not be the most gripping of reading by current standards, but which still gives insight into a mindset of that era.<br /><br />The contrast between the two books is reflected in Astor being a successful inventor. No doubt this gave him a very rosy tinged worldview, unlike Bellamy's socialist leanings. And that is the value of these two books considered as a pair. One uses the dominant value system of its time, the agressive capitalism, and the other speaks forth from the resultant opposite.<br /><br />Interesting to see Steve Stirling edit this book. He has done good research for his science fiction novels, and perhaps that led him to this, long obscure text.	2003-12-01

There is extra flesh on those bones, where we have a good description of the social struggles that parallel and drive the armed conflict. Some of the characters may indeed seem more real than others. It may well be that the authors spent more time expanding out some and just cursory attention to others.<br />If you end up liking this book, the biggest problem may be that there are no sequels. In this future history of Pournelle's, he and his co-authors have done little in recent years. Perhaps it is because it posits as its starting point the CoDominium - an alliance between the US and the USSR. Since the latter imploded, this future history has become alternate future history. Maybe that is perceived by Pournelle or the publisher to have negative impact on future sales?	2003-12-01

Written in 1987, this is still a wonderful explanation of the key issues in a computer analysis of a three dimensional image, to try to construct an internal model of the reality that gave rise to the image. The maths is well described and, as you might expect, is focused on matrix algebra.<br />Keep in mind one thing. The mathematical principles in the book are independent of the hardware used to capture an image and the computer that analyses it. Why is this important? Because in the intervening years since publication, there have been immense gains in the resolution and size of CCD cameras. Plus Carver Mead's Foveon has released semiconductor-based cameras with even higher resolution. This is &quot;just&quot; on the imaging side. Compute-wise, Moore's Law has continued unabated since 1987, reducing the cost of computation by a factor of 2 every 18 months or so. Thus the cost has falled by around 2**10=1000.<br />Thus this book is even more relevant and useful today that when it was first printed. As just one example, the chapter on Stereo vision mentions that since it needs much computation, it was not heavily. Such constaints are surely gone now.<br />Along these lines, the book is useful to those involved in writing VRML type applications (like 3D games). In these, you have a 3D world and you want to display it as quickly as possible. The inverse problem to the analysis in this book. But light rays can travel in both directions, so the geometric analysis is mostly the same.	2003-11-30

But since the book came out, there is a poignant note for American readers. When Manhattan is captured by aliens and put inside a vast spaceship, with cities captured from other races, the humans go to the highest building to see these other cities. That building is one of those in the World Trade Center. And later, when our intrepid humans tunnel out to another alien city, they get their bearings by looking for the tallest towers of Manhattan.<br />If this book is even made into a movie, certain scenes will have to be altered from the book's.	2003-11-30

Apparently, while both Pournelle and his publisher hoped for the best when it came out, the reception was superb.<br />Thence came the demand for a sequel and later, after that, for the next one. In the mid 1980s, Pournelle was asked about this at a Los Angeles SF Convention, and he replied &quot;Soon&quot;. Indeed, the third volume was soon published. But, like any good author who knows how to write well and milk a successful series, dangling threads were left. It is from these that other reviewers here have asked for a fourth volume.<br />It has now been 15 years since the 3rd volume! Frustrating. Sadly, it appears that Pournelle's productivity has fallen in recent years. Still, we can only hope... And also hope for a reissue, maybe in hardcover, of THIS first volume. As you may recall, the first publication was in an extra large paperback format, with illustrations. It has been sufficiently long that perhaps now a hardcover with the lovely drawings might be justified.	2003-11-29

In the book, she refers to a bubble type environment, where someone is isolated, for fear that he might infect others. She says it is under positive pressure. Not so. It would actually be negative pressure, where the pressure inside would be less than in the entrance rooms. This is so that any particles would tend to be swept inside the room when the door is open.<br /><br />Positive pressure is just the opposite, and is used mostly in semiconductor clean rooms and surgical theatres, where you don't care if stuff inside the room leaks out, but you do not want particulates from outside leaking in.	2003-11-29

All these can be effectively summarised by the phrase &quot;Basic Profile 1.0&quot;. This is needed for interoperability of any web service application you might be developing. It is a set of rules telling how to use XML, WSDL, SOAP and UDDI to make your application available as a Web service.<br />If you don't know these 4 items, then basically you need to read most of the book, before being able to deploy an application. The chapters span 733 well written pages (plus there are large appendices). So be warned, it is not trivial to develop a Web service. The clarity of the writing helps assimilation, but the sheer bulk of the text seems necessary.<br />On the positive side, now with BP 1, if you conform to it, your application should indeed work in a diverse environment. Such could not easily be said prior to it. Along the way, you may certainly wonder if the large amount of material needed to be understood is indicative of a still developing field. This barrier may be the single greatest impediment to Web service development. Certainly not the author's fault. He is explaining industry-wide agreed upon standards. Though in the last chapter, he does suggest along these lines that XML deployment descriptors used in J2EE are far too bulky and brittle.	2003-11-28

But Microsoft has put a huge amount of work into beefing it up, as shown in this book. Henderson has done far more than just write a straightforward guide to the query syntax. In fact, the latter is not the emphasis here. Rather, he explains how SQL Server integrates into the Microsoft operating system, for one thing. Like memory mapped files, WinSock and network connections, and how they relate to SQL Server. He provides a long discussion of its memory management; crucial if you are heavily loading up the database. With queries and table joins, you get help on how to optimise, based on knowledge of SQL Server's innards.<br />At over 900 pages, the breadth might seem daunting. But it reflects the complexity and potential of SQL Server.<br />Henderson also provides some nice extra touches. Each chapter ends in a quick list of review questions, to see if you have been paying attention. Plus, at the book's end, he has 2 essays. One is on the drivel that constitutes most [all?] management fads. The second is on pseudo experts in newsgroups. The entire book is worth it, just for these essays! Very biting.	2003-11-28

Like Knuth, Storer thoughtfully supplies an extensive list of questions at the end of each chapter that will greatly deepen your appreciation of the field if you tackle them. Ok, he doesn't give answers, but think of that as greater incentive on your part to solve them. There are almost 400 questions in the book.<br />The teaching style is similar to Knuth, in that it has all the rigour needed by an algorithm designer like yourself, without drowning you in epsilon-delta ultra rigour like a pure maths text.<br />Note that the only code fragments are in pseudocode. This should not be a problem for you. I am assuming you are experienced enough that what you need is understanding of an algorithm, and that manually converting it to code is straightforward and a purely secondary issue.<br />The take home message is that this is excellent for anyone doing serious programming.	2003-11-28

The prose is concise and to the point. A key feature is that at the start of each chapter is a ticklist of action items to do or at least be aware of, for that chapter's topic. This may have value to you, from a management viewpoint. Also similarly useful are the extensive tables at the back of the book, that complement the ticklists.<br />For me, the most relevant sections were those describing metadata and how this is commonly defined and used by people in  the data mining/business intelligence community. I enjoyed the description of a metadata repository/silo as a navigation tool.<br />The book is readily accessible to a nontechnical manager. There is little mathematical jargon, and there are clear explanations of common data mining techniques. Enough so that you can converse intelligently with personnel in that field. A strength of the book is that is lets you understand and direct a technical team, in a top-down fashion, driven by business imperatives, rather than by technical capabilities.	2003-11-26

It is not about low level instances of how you query or modify your dB2 data, unlike several other books in this IBM Press/Addison-Wesley series. This book builds upon those, by assuming you are already well versed in dB2 itself.<br />Each chapter is quite internally coherent, and most can be considered case studies. But between chapters, as you might expect, there is only a minor narrative thread. Only one chapter really delves into actual code description (on CRM email), and it is written in java. The other chapters give higher level examples of how you might plug different products together, some of which you might have to develop, rather than buy. The common theme, of course, is how they all sit atop a dB2 instance.<br />In fact, the discussion is well written enough, and general enough, that you might be able to swap out dB2 and plug in a competitor's database. Sure, there are dB2 specific traits mentioned throughout. But if you have the ability and the commitment to develop a project above dB2, in a similar way to those described in the chapters, then you surely are able to make the necessary changes if you use another database.<br />It is a tribute to the authors' skills that you can contemplate this. Though, given that they are at IBM, I doubt that they would regard this with equanimity.	2003-11-26

As you may known, there have been several books on J2ME published in the last year. Like &quot;Java Development on PDAs&quot; by Wilding-McBride. For the most part, these have been aimed at someone completely new to J2ME development. They have tended to focus on the client side, because this is more tangible and easier to explain.<br />Here Yuan shifts the focus to the server side. He does have screen shots of some client UIs and related code. But the bulk of the discussion moves to server related issues, like how can you sync to a database, or how to send SMS messages in a network. You can consider the book to be focused on connectivity. Not at the lowest level of network connections, but at a higher conceptual level of hooking to existing applications.<br />In part, this is because UI capabilities are much more limited compared to those on a full Java desktop or even a laptop. But it is mostly because the bigger value is in building logic on the server.<br />Sound familiar? Mainstream java traced this route from applet development in 1996 to, a few years later, J2EE/XML on the server, when people realised that is where java is best suited. In about half the time, J2ME is walking down the same path. Yuan does not suggest this, but the impression I got from the book is that in a few more years, if J2ME is running on a server that is not as resource constained as its clients, then it may be replaced by J2EE. It seems that if server side J2ME is to prosper, it may be only on very physically limited servers.	2003-11-25

While it was not the first book to introduce the concept of travel to a backward parallel universe, it is widely considered to be the one of the best of its ilk. Turtledove has made his name specialising in science fiction about alternate history. So this is a natural and slight shift in emphasis, where travel is permitted between the universes. None of his other books depict this, if I recall.<br />Certainly, the cover raises high hopes of a similarly swashbuckling tale of war, akin to Piper's classic. Alas, it falls short. The book is not military science fiction. Rather, you might consider it as a fitting sequel to \\"Household Gods\\" that Turtledove wrote with Judith Tarr. Granted that was pure fantasy, while this is hard SF. But the bulk of both books are thematically similar. Household Gods shows life in ancient Rome. This book depicts it in a Roman Empire in about 2100 CE, but at the technological level of our 17th century. In both are the gritty details of everyday life that most novels set in those eras omit. It is quite well done for that. Turtledove shows his scholarship in his attention for historical detail.<br />The plot is quiet. The war is just a backdrop. This may disappoint some readers.<br />He does introduce some deliberate cognitive dissonance, by having his American characters loathe the touch of furs. He uses that to place some separation between us and them, since they are depicted as being from the late 21st century. But therein is my biggest problem with this book. His depiction of that is far too similar to ours. Apart from the ability to travel between dimensions, he posits very little change. And in one paragraph, one of the characters uses a Powerbook?! In case you didn't know, that is a computer made by Apple now, in the early 21st century. What are the chances that anyone eighty years from now will use that piece of junk? Turtledove goofed on that one, sadly. But the rest of the book is ok.<br />The closing paragraphs are the most promising. They allude to the possibility that other technologically advanced dimensions might also develop this capability. The problem is that several of these are quite loathsome and would be a mortal peril to us. Which is why we have to keep an eye on them...<br />Does this suggest sequels of a more warlike nature?t the rest of the book is ok.<br />The closing paragraphs are the most promising.

If you read the book, the main character is a Negro male. Yet can you tell the race or ethnicity from the cover? If it depicts any character, surely the most appropriate is the main persona? Though perhaps the figure is meant to be an abstraction.<br /><br />The alternative is that Barnes is again having problems with a publisher being reluctant to show a Negro on the cover. Now if you have never read any of his books, or you have read little science fiction, you might think this is absurd. But experienced readers may know what I mean. Barnes' first novel was Streetlethal, published in the early 80s. It was quite well received.<br /><br />But within some SF circles, it was wryly cited as another example of residual racism in the publishing industry. The lead character, as here, was a Negro. But that cover showed a bare chested man, facing the reader. His upper body was in shadow. He looked more like a dark skinned European than a Negro. As a result, in the Los Angeles SF Conventions of the late 80s, you could incite an argument by mentioning Streetlethal.<br /><br />Perhaps here, we are seeing a subtler example. Now don't get me wrong. I'm not accusing the publisher of racism per se. After all, it published Charisma, where many characters are Negro, and so is the author. But there still seems to be a perception by publishers that putting a Negro on a cover can diminish sales. (Look for example at the covers of Steve Stirling's Nantucket trilogy. The lead character is a female Negro, but the covers show white Americans.)	2003-11-24

Many of the other, earlier reviews are about the First Edition.]<br /><br />There are many computer programming books, but only a handful of languages in widespread use. One way to choose which books to read is to look for the intersection between these 2 ideas. Namely, books written [or co-authored] by the authors of a language. Think Kernighan and Ritchie for C, Jensen and Wirth for Pascal. Well, for C#, we have this book, co-authored by C#'s architect, Hejlsberg.<br /><br />The book itself is probably not best for a complete newcomer to C#, who has no background in other languages. There are no easy to learn tutorial-type lessons. The authors plunge straight into the language. It might be good if you already know the basics of C#. Then this book can be used as an [the?] authoritative reference when you have questions, or if there are ambiguities in other texts.<br /><br />The book does show that C# is inherently easy to use. Its syntax is on a par with Java. Generally, clearer than C++, from which many readers might hail. In various newsgroups and blogs, there are ongoing arguments about the relative merits of C# and Java. Yet this book might show to many readers that the 2 languages are broadly equivalent in ease of use and functionality. (Leaving aside issues of what platforms you can run a language on.)<br /><br />One thing that will strike some readers is that no graphics are covered. The core C# classes described in the book are inherently those for pure computation. In this sense, the style of the book harks back to traditional texts on C and C++. Experienced programmers won't have a problem with this. But one can readily imagine new programmers, who have always used widgets, experiencing an impedance mismatch. C# does of course have graphics, using its Graphics class and System.Drawing, but the authors have chosen to exclude those from the current discussion.<br /><br />Also, what distinguishes this book from its first edition is the coverage of C# 2.0. Seven chapters are devoted to 2.0. I'm not going to tediously enumerate all the differences from 1.0. But perhaps the biggest improvement in 2.0 is the use of Generics. (By the way, this follows in the footsteps of Java 1.5, whose Generics have roughly the same functionality.) Whenever possible, you should use Generics. They let you parameterise the arguments of class methods and interfaces. So that some automated code checking can be moved from run time to compile time. Worth its weight in gold. Run time bug detection is expensive, especially if it's in code that is already at a customer site. Compile time checking occurs much earlier, and is essentially free by comparison.hat distinguishes this book from its first edition is the coverage of C# 2.0. Seven chapters are devoted to 2.0.

The vendor's stamp of approval on a successful passing grade has a built-in cachet. Well IBM's dB2 is one of the oldest major packages, and it certainly has exams. As is typical in these things, IBM also offers a book on exam preparation.<br />Naturally comprehensive. Has test questions AND answers. It does not each the theory of relational databases. You need to be clear on this. Now it certainly shows the many SQL options that IBM has implemented in dB2. But here also, you need to know that the book does not really teach SQL either. You are expected to already know SQL and have enough familiarity with dB2. The intent here is to cover the topics that will be in the exam, and do this well enough so that you can find any gaps in your knowledge and remedy these. The focus is strictly utilitarian. Lest you think this is too restrictive, let me note that it is often so with such books, and not just by IBM.<br />You might be encouraged to know that the book covers just the introductory certification. More advanced exams are outside its purview. For example, in a companion IBM text, &quot;DB2 Version 8 - The Official Guide&quot; by Zikopoulous et al, you can find more difficult topics to master. But if you are time constrained, the Study Guide will be better value.	2003-11-19

If two ships are battling on the open ocean when it is almost sundown, then if the ship due west has an important advantage, because the sun is in its opponent's eyes. The gunners on the latter have trouble discerning where their shells land, relative to the target. But suppose the sun now sets? Then the situation reverses totally. The east ship is now in shadow. But there is enough residual sunlight, from over the horizon, to highlight the west ship against it. It is obvious once you think about it, but how many of us have? Very nice - how the tactical situation can complete reverse in minutes, and due to the geometry of a sphere. Plus it is something that is true only of naval battles. On land, even on plains, there is usually some terrain folding to obviate this.<br />Also, this tactic only really held true when Dreadnoughts ruled. Prior, there were sailing ships. But the cannons mounted on those had much shorter range (a few hundred meters). So it was far easier for either ship to see where its shells landed, irrespective of the sun's position. And by the end of World War 2, ships could use radar, instead of direct visuals, to aim, and also use ship-launched missiles, which could hit over the horizon.	2003-11-19

Sullivan focuses on the salient issues, without getting bogged down in arguments over technical choices. Like do we use IBM's dB2 or Oracle? Do we use a J2EE or .NET environment? While these are important concerns, the basic design concepts are at a higher level, and are addressed in the book.<br />A substantial portion of which is devoted to searching. Not surprising, because a commonality across most portals in aggregating information that can be searched. Why not just use Google for this portion of the portal, you might ask? Well, Google indexes the public Web. Most corporate portals also, and hopefully more germanely, can access internal corporate documents, including email, that the outside world cannot reach.<br />But this leads into something which you should be aware of if you find yourself designing searches for your portal. Google sells a piece of hardware that sits inside your firewall. It can index and search your internal data, and present the results in a similar fashion to what it does for the Web. Sullivan does not mention this, because he is not plugging any particular vendor. Fair enough. So let me mention it. Because it is useful to know of this option, since it offers a quick, easy implementation of internal search on your portal.	2003-11-19

Sierra and Bates are making quite a splash with these books. They wrote an earlier book (Head First Java) where they used a very informal cartoon-heavy teaching method. Now they have produced this book on Enterprise Java Beans. I have been reading about EJBs since they first came out, but I never knew there was anything funny about them. Just ignorant, I guess!<br />Certainly their graphic narratives help illuminate what some might consider a bone-dry subject. But their lengthy explanations with diagrams may be more instructive for you than the standard EJB texts. The thing is, EJB usage is inherently more abstract than just learning java, where, for example, GUI coding gives you immediate visual feedback. With EJBs, and transactions and hooking up to a database [etc], there are usually no visuals (apart from the command line). So a diagrammatic pedagogy is correspondingly more valuable for understanding, because these diagrams may well be your ONLY visuals.<br />Maybe you are new to EJBs and have a standard text. But for you, its explanations are too cursory? And it did not have any exercises? If so, try temporarily scaling back and using this book. It may put you on a firmer conceptual footing, and then you can return to a more &quot;mainstream&quot; book.	2003-11-18

It was published in 1987, when Japanese growth seemed endless, having essentially risen monotonically since 1946. The book is typical of its time. Handwringing about how Japanese financial companies, from banks to brokerages, were going to overwhelm their American and European counterparts.<br />It cites how the Japanese savings rate (then at 17% of disposable income) was the highest in the developed world. This let their banks and brokers amass huge amounts of capital, giving them the firepower to storm overseas financial markets. And of course there was also the Japanese trade surplus. All combined into a &quot;tidal wave&quot;.<br />Logically very impressive. Yet two years after this book was written,  their economy peaked and has since endured three recessions in ten years. The supposedly unstoppable banks were discovered to have squandered fortunes in Japanese real estate speculation and in manufacturing overproduction, just as China was ramping up far cheaper factories.<br />Why would you want this book, then? Its main value now is as postmortem fodder. If you are an economics researcher, it has appeal as a cogent, well argued text of its time. You might get a Master's thesis out of a point by point rebuttal of its claims. Though granted, you would be doing this with perfect hindsight.	2003-11-17

During which, the ideological push for deregulation grew hugely. The book reflects this, and indeed Hahn and the American Enterprise Institute from which he hails probably played no small part in this.<br />The book's arguments are well marshalled, and can be summarised simply as stating that a cost effective way for an economy to grow is by reducing the amount of government regulation in various industries.<br />Hahn does not confine his arguments to the US. Indeed, half the book describes the impact on the developing world, where the need for growth is far more acute, due to burgeoning populations, subsections of which subsist at very minimal levels. Empirically, the massive growth of Chinese manufacturing and Indian information technology has been attributed in no small part to their governments reducing regulations.<br />For the US, Hash predicted that some industries like telecommunications and electricity would deregulate slowly, due to their complexity. He specifically cited these two! From the perspective of three short years later, and the scandals of WorldCom and Enron, you could suggest that a hasty deregulation might have costs of its own. And that deregulation does not necessarily mean less government monitoring of industries.	2003-11-17

Readers accustomed to McDevitt's earlier works will enjoy this book. His style tends to resemble that of Asimov's books. The book is hard science fiction, but far removed from the grand space opera of clashing Dreadnought fleets in David Weber's work, or the technopolistic beepings of William Gibson. The action scenes in Omega, while well done, are comparatively low key. It is the idea that dominates, that of robots (or somethings) going from star to star, destroying civilisations that make buildings. In some ways a toned down version of Saberhagen's berserker hypothesis. The Omega clouds do not try to kill all life. And given that Saberhagen has not published anything recently about berserkers, McDevitt's musings are the best that you will find, from a current major author.<br />The descriptive prose is minimal. Again you can see the resemblance to Asimov's works. The planetary scenes include several in the countryside of an inhabited world.

By deliberately using the histories of ancient Greece as the underlayer of this story, he imbues it with a stirring, mythic flavour. Done in many explicit ways. The wife of Sim, the lost hero, is an instructor in Greek philosophy and history. Sim himself, before the way, is depicted as writing a book on the war between Greece and Persia.<br />The main events of the war are two hundred years before the contemporary events. McDevitt uses this to add a sepia tone of nostalgia. Akin to Americans looking back at their Civil War. McDevitt adds amusing little sidenotes for detailed depth. All this is set in the far future, in a high technological star-spanning setting. Yet McDevitt has the narrator say how the advances of the narrator's time has taken the romance out of daily life, unlike the stirring days of the war.<br />The narrator's search across space to solve the mystery is akin to that in Asimov's Foundation Trilogy, in the last volume, when members of the First Foundation search for the Second. There are other similarities. Firstly in style. McDevitt cultivates a sparse descriptive narrative, much like that used by Asimov throughout his books. But there is something more. Joseph Patrouch in the late 70s wrote &quot;The Science Fiction of Isaac Asimov&quot;, where he critiqued the Foundation Trilogy. He noted that the major action events were not usually described directly (&quot;in real time&quot;). Rather, Asimov would have his characters recall the events, after they had occurred. McDevitt's book resembles this. To large extent, it is not really a book on military science fiction. A reader of Drake, Weber, Pournelle or Stirling would see this quickly. But at a subtler level, the saga-like backdrop does give this book such a cadence.	2003-11-15

The author clearly loves to tinker, as seen by his description of how he and friends put together a waveguide antenna built around a Pringles can. Perusing the book seems to give some of the flavour of the Homebrew Computer Club in San Francisco during the 1970s, when the PC revolution was gestating.<br />To some (many?) of you, the do-it-yourself ethos of this book may be its greatest allure. Flickenger reinforces this with many examples of analysis programs contributed by enthusiasts, often with source code available for your modification.<br />If indeed you seem attracted, do not tarry. Flickenger may not explicitly state this anywhere in the book, but it really describes a field and hobby that will rapidly make much of the book obsolete. Chances are, in a few years hardware will be standardised by a few major manufacturers, and most operating systems will have all the necessary wireless software. So if you want some fun, perhaps now is the time.	2003-11-13

A parallel universe of code development, as it were. If you hail from a java-centric J2EE background, most of this book will be familiar turf. Indeed, over 80% of the book is germane to any operating system and language environment. The higher level stages, like getting system requirements or nutting out the analysis model, should be independent of the eventual implementation minutiae. Thus, of the ten chapters, only one, on the implementation model, is truly tied to .NET. (Which suggest that the book's audience is broader than the &quot;.NET&quot; in the title might imply.)<br />Now if you scan a typical book on designing using java/J2EE, you will be lucky to find even cursory mention of any alternative environments, let alone .NET. This book returns the favour; studiously minimising references to java/J2EE. But, as suggested above, on this topic such differences are only at the lowest level.<br />So from your standpoint, if you are engaging in a .NET-based project and you come from elsewhere, this book might considerably ease the pain of transition.	2003-11-07

It is not that you doubt the need for a backup. But a whole book? In unix, you do a &quot;man&quot; on the backup command and you are shown a few screens of options. Likewise for restoring. Under Microsoft, a similar situation prevails. But unix and Microsoft are general purpose operating systems. An operating system is basically about file manipulation. In essence, a file is the atomic unit to the OS. So the backup and restore options are limited to the richness of this information.<br />But Oracle's database is a specialised and elaborate &quot;operating system&quot;. The data is constrained and structured far more than files in a real OS. A backup can take advantage of this by offering hugely more options to you; a far more expressive set of commands to do a fine grained backup of fairly arbitrary subsets of the data. And of course, also with the restore.<br />This increased power comes at a price. Remembering all those darned options, especially the obscure, rarely invoked ones. Hence this book. Its value is strictly as a memory aid. You have to already understand what those options do, from Oracle's official documentation. The book uses a common flow chart style graph for the options, for easier use.	2003-10-30

Such a thing should be independent of any specific crypto algorithm, since new ones come into being, and sometimes existing ones are found to be inadequate. We should also be able to handle symmetric and public/private key systems.<br />Ideally, such capabilities would be as intrinsic to J2EE as, say, Exception handling is to standard java.<br />Well, is this so? Kumar shows in this book that for the most part, this is indeed so. Numerous code examples covering many aspects like https, Enterprise Java Beans and certificates. He points out one shortcoming; namely that RMI usage is not inherently secure. This was a legacy of when java got started and before it moved into enterprise applications. Still, he does show examples of how to add in security to RMI, though it may not be totally fullproof. In any event, today's J2EE applications have RMI relatively superceded, and the book's attention reflects this.<br />As a quick note, Kumar describes a 'person-in-the-middle' attack. There is an important, insidious mutation of this, popularly known as 'Phishing'. He never uses this term or explains this variant. Pity, given its multiple recent incarnations (the emails purporting to be from Paypal, eBay, BestBuy...) in mass mailings to millions, and the subsequent broad publicity in the mainstream media.	2003-10-29

IBM invented relational databases and SQL and they have since always been in the forefront of offering the most advanced features in RDBs, via their  DB2 product. (Though it must be a source of considerable chargrin that Oracle has the bigger market share.) Nowadays, dB2 is in its 8th major  revision, attesting to its maturity.<br />So what does this book offer? A veritable laundry list of enhancements.  These range from improvements in the GUI to tighter integration into  their  Websphere container, and into java. Plus showing how to run it under  Microsoft's .NET. As far as the core RDB usage is concerned, you do  need  prior knowledge of SQL and the theory of RDBs. It is not the book's place to teach that. You need it to fully appreciate the usefulness of the new features.<br />To me, it seems like there are no surprises here, with one exception, discussed below. The new features are all useful, but they are mostly continuous improvments on earlier functionality.<br />What is the exception? Multidimensional Clustering tables. A conceptual discontinuity. It automatically clusters data on the disk in multiple data field dimensions. IBM claims big improvements in query speeds, especially for complex queries. IBM is bragging! But they certainly seem entitled to do so. Oracle 9 and MySql appear to have nonesuch comparable feature. Granted, I am taking IBM's claim at face value from this book. But IBM's technical literature has always been credible. If IBM's clients independently affirm the utility of MDC, we can expect IBM to push hard on rapidly expanding this.<br />Even if you do use another database, just out of the need to keep abreast of changes in your field, you should check out this offering.<br />[If you do need to learn SQL itself, or RDB theory, try \\"Fundamentals of Database Systems\\" by El Masri and Navathe, also published by Addison-Wesley.]	2003-10-27

But despite one's best efforts, instead of focusing on  writing business logic in a modular, fully encapsulated way, you often also have to deal with reading and writing to a persistent format; usually a relational database. The gritty details of the impedance mismathc between your [hopefully] object oriented approach and the latter might eat up too much of your time.<br />Realising this, Sun devised Java Data Objects. The book describes their main promise, which is to hide away the details of persistence. The big gain is in increasing the potential developer audience, as compared with EJBs. And you have less need of expert knowledge of RDBs. Previously, that was often a de facto requirement. You can now focus on the business logic. The second gain is shown in the JDO code examples, which are often cleaner without the persistence details. Of course, any realistic business logic will have more complicated details than the simple examples in the book, but at least persistence can be pushed offline.<br />Last year, Robin Roos wrote &quot;Java Data Objects&quot; [also by the same publisher]. At that time, JDO was just getting started. Now, Sun has moved it deeper into J2EE. There is a lot more support for transactions and JDBC. JDO is no longer a speculative fling.	2003-10-23

Though I do not want to draw this constraint too tightly. Systems administrators and programmers who have been tasked to this field will also find it useful.<br />The book gives a good synopsis of the field of computer security. It tells you what the issues are, and the broader resources available out there. Most significantly, you learn about Carnegie-Mellon's Computer Emergency Response Team, aka CERT CC. This is the main organisation in the world that pools data on incidents and disseminates authoritative information on countermeasures and patches. I would posit that the best value in this book is in telling you of CERT and how to use them to your best advantage. Especially advantageous if you are new to managing computer security. CERT means you do not stand alone.<br />Other sections of the book also discuss how to organise a team and gives a broad overview of what types of incidents to check.<br />Please note that no code examples are actually given in the book. For example, buffer overruns are mentioned, but not described further. Such things would be the purview of a more technical text, aimed directly at a programmer.	2003-10-17

Very quickly, the CGI-bin parsing method was supplanted by more powerful backend approaches like PHP, Java Server Pages and Active Server Pages. (And others.) For all of their competings with each other, which happens to this day, they had one thing in common. Their input and output was HTML. Granted, current HTML has improved since 1993. But not by much. It is as though it remains in a time warp, adrift while entire server side methodologies rose. There were several reasons. Primarily that the problems on the server side, like integrating with a data base, and separating business logic from presentation and from the data queries, were indeed harder problems. It was correct for developers to concentrate on the main issues.<br />But now, finally, attention has focussed on HTML itself, and indeed on broader interactive issues. Aided by the rise of cell phones and other media where you do not necessarily have a mouse or monitor. And where I/O might be audio with a limited keyboard. People asked, is there a way to write display logic that can easily handle both computers and phones? From this flowed a generalisation of HTML called XForms. The book emphasises XForms' close links with HTML. Deliberately so, to take advantage of the widespread knowledge of HTML. XForms is shown to have an elegant simplicity.<br />You should know, it IS more complex than HTML. It requires some knowledge of XML namespaces and XPath and CSS. But if you want to develop and easily support products that deploy on computers and phones and maybe other future platforms, then it is well worth it. Imagine XForms as a refactoring of HTML into XML.<br />By the way, the book talks of various motivations for using XForms, like making your products accessible to the blind. All to the good. But the blunt reality is that all other markets except those mentioned above are an afterthought.	2003-10-16

Ideally suited for those of you already well-versed in UML and refactoring, though not necessarily in J2EE per se. If you have used legacy applications and have done some case studies of abstracting out the business logic with the idea of redeploying into a large multiuser web environment, then the book should have value to you. The patterns described herein may well be germane to your problems. Plus, going through some of the steps in identifying and implementing these patterns may have merit in and of themselves, quite separate from any particular pattern. Because in a complex development environment with participants from quite varied backgrounds, the sheer mass of detail can obscure the essential level of abstraction to usefully tackle the problem.<br />Think of it like this. Applying the book's methodology to your situation can be like setting an agenda for a meeting. Gives focus and discipline and, hopefully, an endpoint.<br />There is another cogent reason for the book to have merit to you. It discusses candidly the scaling limitations of using Enterprise Java Beans. This is an official Sun book. Earlier texts from Sun that I have read rarely point out any of the EJBs' problems. Perhaps when EJBs were first introduced, these were unknown. But several soon became apparent to developers. Unfortunately, in other Sun books, little of this is presented. You had to scan the newsgroups on the web to find out. Finally, we have it in &quot;official&quot; form.	2003-10-13

Now available in its fifth major revision, PHP code looks so much like C, with the added benefit of being OO. PHP is still very specialised, confined to essentially web server applications. While it is true that PHP is no longer strictly confined to this, the de facto reality is that the vast majority of applications, and the concomitant employment prospects, are in the context of web servers.<br />Clearly, if you are a web programmer, knowing PHP is a big plus. A hardcore way of doing this is to use the online documentation scattered throughout the web, and learn by downloading and analysing code examples. PHP veterans, including maybe the authors, probably did this. Nothing better at the time. While it works for some, this approach is awkward to many, and is quite ad hoc. The danger is in learning quick kludges as opposed to methodically designing and coding, with a full appreciation of the language's extent. Luckily, as PHP has matured, you can turn to this book for a logical pedagogy.<br />The treatment is exhaustive and shows starkly how far PHP has come. For example, you can use all the major encryption algorithms (Rijndael, Serpent, DES...) as extensively and easily as though you were coding in C. On another tack, the image analysis routines now handle all the important image formats (GIF, JPEG, TIFF...). The book displays the breadth of such computing topics now available, and the wealth of library routines in each topic describes the depth of the treatment.<br />Are you familiar with Fortran and the IMSL mathematical package so often associated with it? Or with C++ and its standard template library? Or C and the Numerical Recipes routines? If so, this book lets you appreciate that intellectually, PHP now ranks with those luminaries.	2003-10-09

The folks at Tivo must have been pleased! So too might you, if you have a Tivo or are thinking of getting one. The article said that in the field of Digital Video Recorders, Tivo is the dominant one. [Though the article also said that the competition is increasing.]<br />As far as this book is concerned, that article is reassuring. It says a Tivo is your safest choice of DVR; independent validation of the book's topic. Now considering the book itself, it is easily readable. Much more so than your typical instruction manual that comes with a software package, and usually feels like it was written as an afterthought. (As it probably was.)<br />The copious diagrams in the book of the screen captures of software, and of the hardware, greatly help the understandability. Essentially, the book appeals to the tinkerer of either software or hardware. It gives you an appreciation of how open the product is, either explicitly by its manufacturer, or, perhaps more importantly, by the vast user community that has arisen around it.	2003-10-09

XML has captured overwhelming mindshare amongst developers as the preferred means of data interchange between programs. Plus, for recording to and from files, if you are starting a project with no legacy hangups, XML is often used.<br />Notice the caveat. Unfortunately, you as a developer cannot often start with a blank page. You may have to cater to existing data being stored in various formats, like CSV (Comma Separated Values). Or you have flat files with each line like &quot;a=b&quot;. Or perhaps existing apps talk via EDI, which is quite common in certain industries.<br />Most XML books gloss over such details. Usually for good reason. Typically, they are trying to educate a reader who has never used XML. So for pedagogic clarity they deprecate these impedance mismatches. Which is correct, but of little help to you right here and now.<br />Rawlins tries to fill this gap. He assumes you know XML. The book rapidly goes into the grubby little details of how to overcome those impedance mismatches. Mundane but necessary. Somewhat inelegant manipulations, by the very nature of the topic. The book fills a real need. Though I suspect that many readers, and maybe even the author, wish this need will eventually evaporate. The pragmatists amongst you won't see this as imminent. The reality is that we will all have to support legacy apps indefinitely. Which should generate a steady demand for this book.	2003-10-03

(You know, something like 'Moron's Guide to eBay'.) Are you wavering on going to buy or sell on it, never having done so? Or you are already on eBay. But you are wondering if there are ways to get better prices, where 'better' of course depends on whether you are buying or selling. Well, here is an excellent how-to manual that still keeps some objective distance from its subject. That separation lets the author offer some disinterested advice. You can best see this when Karp evaluates the various listing options available to a seller. His suggestions, especially on one option, which he considers a total waste of money, are excellent.<br />There are some omissions that would have made this a stronger book. He offers 100 tips. But...<br />He discusses Phishing. Which has been used against eBay and Paypal users. But, as far  as I can tell, he never uses this term. He REALLY should. We can imagine new users hearing about it, wanting to know more and not finding it in this book's index and hence passing on the book. And phishing is actually more dangerous than just one bad auction.<br />Also, he omits three important tips. Firstly, once you have sold to a satisfied buyer, you should add that buyer to an email list. Next time you offer a similar item, very politely email her about it. (Of course, drop her if she opts out.) You can also add unsuccessful bidders in your  auctions to this list, though you may have to go thru eBay's mailer to contact them. He mentions keeping a spreadsheet of your auctions, including the email addresses of your buyers. But he doesn't take the next simple step.<br />Secondly, consider first offering future items directly to previous buyers, instead of listing on eBay. If no takers, then put on eBay. This does NOT violate any eBay rules because the buyer and seller now know each other and can talk about nonlisted items. There have been reports in the media about businesses selling on eBay partly to get just such a list of customers. Of course, there is now no eBay protection for buyer or seller. But if you are a business with a website and a good eBay rating, this reassures buyers. And you, as a seller, have a defacto credit check on buyers, by looking at their ratings.<br />Thirdly, what would have been good is a tip on when it is NOT economic to list an item on eBay. Note that I did not say 'sell'. Amongst some power sellers, there has been increasing dissatisfaction. Prices are falling, eBay raises its fees and more auctions end without any bids. If you have an item for which there is little demand, then what is the chance that within 7 or 10 days of an auction, potential buyers will go to eBay and look for it? Remember, eBay always charges a listing fee. Of course, you can lower your price, to spur demand. But that costs you. At some point, things become uneconomic. In fact, if you have specialised books with a limited audience, Amazon is a viable alternative as it levies no listing fee, albeit with a higher commission if the book actually sells.<br />Karp is a very experienced eBay user and a good programmer. But I really do not think the greatest readership for this book is people who want to or are able to program, and they will not be enamoured by the code examples. I suspect he could have expanded greatly on the points I raised, to the benefit of that readership.list of customers. Of course, there is now no eBay protection for buyer or seller.

As many well know, Microsoft has done this successfully in the past, ranging from the browser war against Netscape to deploying a fully fledged GUI against Apple, who squandered a many year lead.<br />Can Microsoft repeat this with .NET? Well, it needs to present .NET as a fully fledged environment for code design and development. The book gives an independent explanation of .NET's capabilities. At the highest level, the authors devote an entire crucial chapter to showing how all the common development models ( Extreme Programming, Waterfall, Spiral, Adaptive,...) can be done in the .NET context. They flush out the book by providing an extended example application and show how to apply the full development cycle to it. In working through this, they (no surprise!) hit on the salient features of .NET.<br />As a java/linux developer, I do have to say that it does seem quite formidable and complete. A key existing strength that they are leveraging is Visual Studio for .NET. If you have used the pre-.NET Visual Studio, it greatly eases the learning curve.<br />J2EE should look in its rear view mirror.	2003-10-03

No one disputes this. Its allure is enhanced by there being no overly dominant player hoovering up over 50% of the profits, like Microsoft and Intel collectively in PCs.<br />Logically, Sun sees growth here and this book is part of its frenetic rollout. It differs from the first edition because of significant upgrades to the 2 standards its describes. The Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC) went from version 1 in 1999 to 1.1 in 2002. It added more features that the book describes in detail. Basically, they give a richer compatibility with standard java (J2SE). The other standard, Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP) went from version 1 to 2 in 2002. To developers the key additions were APIs for sound and games. In retrospect, MIDP 1 was indeed primitive, to lack these.<br />Commercially, the MIDP 2 changes in the book may be more important than the CLDC changes. It means that you can now develop games and other applications using sound, at a high enough level of abstraction that they can be run on a broader range of hardware. Well at least that is the idea. I have not done so. But the book's explanation seems logical and thorough enough to make this plausible. Undoubtedly, if you and others follow this path, gaps or insufficiencies will be found, leading to the next increments of the standards.<br />If you are still clutching the first edition of this book, or any other book that only covers CLDC 1 or MIDP 1, then drop it. Obsolete. Upgrade here.	2003-09-29

In server side generation of dynamic web pages, java is the most commonly used language. Some developers emphasise using servlets and downplay Java Server Pages. Others do the opposite. If you troll various newsgroups, you can see arguments between the two views. What Hall and Brown posit is that this debate is a false dichotomy.<br />They offer a deeper understanding of both, and how often you need to implement both in real applications. These have complementary attributes that together let you fully implement a Model-View-Controller architecture.<br />That is one emphasis of the book. You should find it straightforward. But the other emphasis is, I believe, more useful. They show how to implement server side applications. Everything from choosing a web container like Tomcat, to showing how your app can accessing a back end SQL database like MySQL or Oracle.  The full Monty, as it were.<br />If you are casting around for how to build an online store, say, with a shopping cart and ease of use, and you have not built one before, or you need a fresh outlook, you should study carefully the examples.

Sometimes with other computing books, I have wondered why their authors omit questions. Perhaps the nature of the topic makes it awkward to provide problem sets. But not for Oracle's PL/SQL language. So this book is chock-a-block with them.<br />To students, retention is greatly enhanced by doing, and the book will take you a long way into facility with PL/SQL if you can discipline yourself to go through it methodically and not peek at the answers till you have given the problems a fair go.<br />As far as the language itself, the book's presentation reminds me of a text on fortran or C, and unlike a text on java or C#. Firstly, the latter two are object-oriented, while PL/SQL, fortran and C are procedural. So if you have already learnt fortran or C and you read this book, step back and defocus a little from the specific syntax. Stylistically, the book has the flavour of many texts in those languages. Reinforced by PL/SQL not having a GUI. The I/O is character based. A slight retro feel. [Though PL/SQL should NOT have a GUI. It is optimised as a query language.]<br />One thing to note is that the book explains using examples and exercises that are at the subroutine or procedural level, as mentioned above. Bite sized. What it lacks are higher level examples that necessitate decomposing a problem into several procedures. But this may be unfair. Those are harder, more abstract issues, whereas this book is meant for someone who still needs to learn the syntax in the first place. It does suggest the utility of such a book, as a logical successor to this.<br />A final note relates to the problem sets. There is a difficulty with learning PL/SQL compared to, say, C or java. With C you can download an open source compiler. With java, you can get a free compiler from Sun or IBM. With SQL, there is the open source MySQL. Not so with PL/SQL. I don't think Oracle offers a free version. So if you are studying on your own, this is a severe quandary. How do you get a PL/SQL executable? Otherwise, the attraction of this book, or any other on PL/SQL, for that matter, is greatly restricted to classrooms or companies that already have that, and not to individuals. Well, the authors and the publisher offer access, at the publisher's website. This may be the strongest merit of the book.from Sun or IBM. With SQL, there is the open source MySQL.

Harold has put together an advanced overview of ALL<br />XML.<br />A significant part of the value of this book is in Harold's assessment of the various proposed extensions to XML, like the XML Schema language, or the abovementioned XLink and XQuery. XML is still growing rapidly, and there is a real need for various extensions. But there is also a consequent need for<br />independent comparative assessments of those extensions. For example, if you have a book devoted to XML Schema, it might not even tell you that there are other competing schema languages.<br />En passant, he gives an unusually clear explanation of the difference between a character set and a character encoding. The former is a mapping of some characters to numbers. The latter is an instantiation of those numbers as an actual numerical storage. Often in other books, you can see the two phrases used interchangeably and imprecisely. By contrast,<br />throughout this book Harold emphasises a precision of terminology. A priori, if you are into XML, then you need to be precise.<br />I have one minor quibble. He says that multiple XML documents \\"can be stored in a single file, though this is unusual in practice.\\" He might have added that one of these instances is instructive. If you have a continuously running program that periodically writes to a log file in XML, then during the writing, for efficiency, you would append XML documents to the file. So notice that at all times, the entire file is not an XML document, because there are no enclosing tags.	2003-09-27

Very intuitive and kindly donated by IBM to open source. So when I opened this book, I anticipated oodles of helpful tweaks and shortcuts.<br />But not so. IBM has indeed provided these in the book. But their goals were far more ambitious. The Eclipse Modelling Framework is a serious effort to incorporate into a development environment java, XML and UML. They found, perhaps correctly, that most Java programmers, including, and maybe especially the experienced ones, don't really use UML much. Okay, as an afterthought, to document a code base upon a major release. But rarely as a starting point. So one intent is to seamlessly let java programmers incorporate UML. More strongly, they claim that EMF lets you define a model in any of java, XML or UML. Then simply clicking a button will make EMF generate the other 2 forms. The greatest payoff for this is that it lets programmers, who may not be fluent in UML, make a graphical UML model and thence have EMF make the java code stubs. Much less error prone than doing it manually.<br />There is an analogy here with Spice, if any of you have an electrical engineering background. Until the late 80s, if you wanted to model a circuit in Spice, you typically drew it by hand on paper. Then you manually transcribed these into a text file of netlists that was input into Spice. Slow and very error prone. Then along came MicroSim, Carver Mead's Magic program and others, that let you construct a circuit diagram on a console, and from which you could press a button and a Spice input file would be made. Much more productive.<br />The book offers a similar gain in productivity. All you are asked to risk is your time in understanding the book.	2003-09-21

Java, for instance, was designed from its inception to use Unicode. Earlier computer languages like C and C++ can have routines added to handle these, while C# uses XML and hence Unicode.<br />But chances are, when you deal with Unicode, you only deal with a subset. Often only a small subset at that, unless you are using Chinese/Japanese. Typically you work with ascii and the codes for your spoken language if that is not a Western European language. Very few of us deal with much more than this.<br />Which illustrates the appeal of the book. The Big Picture. ALL of Unicode. The breadth is stunning. It shows the written form of every major spoken language and many minor ones. Has the pictograms for Chinese [of course]. But also the symbols for Khmer, Canadian Aboriginal, Tamil, Syraic, et cetera, et cetera. Thumbing through this, you may encounter languages that you did not even know existed. It is one thing to say that we live in a multilingual world. But it is another to actually see it expressed comprehensively at the most basic level.<br />There are two audiences for this book. The first is any computer person who has to deal with issues of internationalisation.<br />But another audience is every Department of Languages or Cultural Anthropology in a university. If this describes your background, then you should know that you do not need facility in computing to appreciate the significance of this book. You can use it as a standard reference, akin to the Oxford English Dictionary vis-a-vis the English language. Look, ignore the computer stuff in the text. Yes, you can do this. The book groups related languages into common chapters. The explanatory text is lucid and the graphics for the languages lets you easily cross compare. Of course, at a higher level of meaning like sentences, you will need specialised texts in those languages. But to understand a language, you need to start at its letters or pictograms.<br />Think of this book as an index into all the languages of man.texts in those languages.

Now comes this very latest JSP book, fully current on JSP 2.0. What a change. JSPs are now very mature, as the book makes clear. In 2000 there was limited integration with XML. Partly because XML was still on its way to broad acceptance, and maybe because XML parsers were still slow and buggy, and not as common as now, where a parser comes bundled with Java 1.4. The book's treatment of XML emphasises its prominence. It points out the complementary nature of JSP and XML. JSPs are a viewing technology while XML is for data modelling. The two fit together well.<br />Another welcome new addition is the discussion on Struts, which lets you make more powerful controllers in the Model-View-Controller framework. Indeed, I think Structs didn't exist in 2000?!<br />A common and welcome thread running through the book is that all the software discussed is free open source. No proprietary lock-ins. Which might make the book's approach an easier sell to management in these days of tight IT budgets.	2003-09-21

A striking look at how women's lack of access to mobility can be often discriminating in Asia and Africa. The book is a gathering of papers by various authors that shows common threads across vast underdeveloped populations, giving insight into an often overlooked viewpoint.<br />Separate and unequal. A phrase often associated with racial discrimination in the US. But one that springs to mind in the descriptions here, as applied to women and men having access to transport, which here refers to bicycles, buses, rickshaws and boats. Only rarely to cars.<br />A paper on Bangladesh describes how in an overwhelmingly rural Muslim area, societal mores often restrict women to the confines of their households. With concomitant deleterious effects on their abilities to earn cash incomes. Or even to get  educated or see doctors. Which is not to say that such things do not happen, but that female participation rates are usually significantly lower than males'. Not all the blame can be laid at the door of Islam. Several articles outline similar occurrences in rural Hindu India and Christian Kenya.	2003-09-10

Published in 1997 by Yonsei University in South Korea, this book is a series of articles about the post World War 2 relations between the various East Asian countries.<br />There is a passing mention of South East Asia, with one author remarking that ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) has done little in its history. Which may be a little unfair. ASEAN was founded for two reasons. The first was external. To group what was seen as a handful of fragile dominos to hold off Chinese and Soviet expansionism. But the second reason was internal. To keep the peace between its members. Not unlike NATO, with one of its founding objectives to stop France and Germany going to war again.<br />Most of the book is devoted to the tensions on the Korean peninsula. You might think this arises because the publisher is Korean. But even to a totally external observer, Korea is inarguably the most dangerous part of East Asia. Several articles speculate on the possible modes of unification, ranging from benign to very parlous. No author considers the long term viability of North Korea to be plausible. These scenarios lack what has eventuated since the book was published. Today, North Korea appears close to having nuclear weapons, and has a more advanced and publicly tested delivery system. Which is not to say that the book is outdated, but that some even more negative events can now be postulated.	2003-09-10

There are 3 types of people who might benefit from this book. The first is someone who wants to use Amazon in a non-technical context. Suppose you are interested in posting reviews of your favourite books, or in selling via Amazon's fixed price Marketplace or using its auctions. You can directly follow the instructions on their website. But maybe you want an independent assessment that is easy to understand? If so, here is the book.<br />The second case is someone who runs a website and knows some programming and is interested in perhaps earning some extra income by directing traffic from her site to Amazon. Or maybe using the gigabytes of data that Amazon makes available via its Web Services [AWS] in some fashion that adds value to her site. The beauty of this book is that for a given task [which the author calls a \\"tip\\"], 2 key things are supplied. Most importantly, Bausch shows that the task is possible. The proof of concept, if you will. Experienced analysts know that this is often the hardest step. Next, he shows a way to do that task. He has carefully written these in various languages, like perl, JavaScript and ASP. If he wrote a particular task in, say, perl, and you don't particularly care for perl, you can easily recode it in C, C++ or whatever. Straightforward.<br />The third type of reader is someone who has no interest in Amazon, per se. Rather, you are acutely interested in learning and writing Web Services. This is such a nascent field that there is a paucity of real life applications that an arbitrary user on the net can experiment with. Amazon is one of the few companies that currently makes available Web Services with a rich pool of data. If you are keen, Bausch has several tasks where he integrates AWS with those of Google, USPS and other sites. Well worth studying carefully for inspiration. Of course, ten years from now, we will all laugh at how primitive the current Web Services are. But perhaps you can take some ideas gleaned from this book to bring about that very outcome. The whole field of Web Services is so inchoate that maybe just as Jeff Bezos came up with the idea of selling books online several years ago, you might do likewise with an innovative service.bring about that very outcome.

While the 20th century saw the independence of Africa, it was and still largely remains trapped in the context of the European empires that ruled it in the 19th century.<br />This book traces this afterglow of imperialism and how it still affects events today. A European man of the late 19th century transported to today would scarcely recognise the names of the countries. But chances are good that he would recognise many of the countries' shapes, for these largely correspond to those of the various colonies of his time. The author describes how newly independent countries had little to hold themselves together. Ethnic affiliation in so many ways trumped national identity. So that one group often gained power and refused to relinquish it, proceeding to oppress others. Sometimes, and not too rarely at that, this would trigger civil wars.<br />It is through this prism that certain recent events make more sense. Like the use of famine by the Sudanese central government against its southern rebels. Not just religious differences, but ethnic. Or the parlous poverty of the people in the Nigerian delta, from where much oil is extracted, most of whose revenues accrue to Lagos. Not just venality by the ruling class.<br />Well written, easily accessible to the educated reader. You don't need previous knowledge of African history. Plus, the author does not use much of the jargon of economics or sociology. the emphasis is on political history. Quite welcome are the numerous maps. Africa is so fragmented and most of the countries are so little known to outsiders that these maps are very helpful.	2003-08-22

The author analyses the interdependencies of the region, to try to understand the behaviour of the various countries. The most salient feature is the continued, pronounced poverty throughout. Leading to a dependence on external aid and technology. Concomitant with this is a strong reliance on trade with non-African countries. The region trades relatively with themselves, except in refugees.<br />We can see echoes of the European empires in the often-used division of nations in the Francophone and Anglophone groups. The former is especially cohesive, driven in large part by France still having pretensions of empire.<br />The author fills a gap in the understanding of West Africa. Few other previous studies have tried to systematically compare the foreign policies of the countries; typically such have concentrated on the issues of trade and investment. Not surprisingly, Anda finds that the larger and relatively better off states, especially Nigeria, have the economic and military resources to pursue an agressive outwardly engaging foreign policy. The reader might well pause upon reaching this, for Nigeria has tremendous poverty, corruption and internal, often violent divisions between its many ethnic groups. Yet such is the parlous nature of West Africa that Nigeria would qualify as better off.<br />This book was written just before the terrorist attacks of 2001, after which concern grew about the danger of \\"failed states\\". If you share this interest, this book will have relevance, for it discusses several states, like Liberia and Sierra Leone, which would probably qualify.	2003-08-21

But suppose you actually want to use some of the symmetric key or public key methods he describes? If you want to code from scratch, his book is a good starting point. But if you want to quickly avail yourself of the best existing methods and you don't want to reinvent the wheel by recoding? Also, it can be risky to do that. A mistake made in coding a crypto algorithm might render it insecure. Better to use reviewed, tested code.<br />If this describes your needs and you code in C or C++, then this book will be invaluable. Extensive code fragments that show how you can interface to existing crypto packages. Very detailed. You won't find theorems or any elegant maths here. No Chinese Remainder Theorem or Fermat's theorems. You have to already know or accept the theoretical underpinnings.<br />Given this, the book takes you into the nitty gritty of every major publicly available cryptosystem. With up to date assessments of their comparative strengths.<br />All of the above is aimed at application developers. The book also has sections for sysadmins of both unix and Microsoft operating systems, replete with suggestions on patching and good practice.<br />Don't be daunted by the book's heft. It is encyclopaedic in scope, and access is reasonably random access. The authors have striven to comprehensively span the field. You don't have to read from start to finish before you can commence using it.	2003-08-17

Portuguese claims to be one, with over 200 million who use it as their main tongue. Yet few English speakers are familiar with Portuguese fiction in its own language. But it offers a wide cultural diversity that can be as enriching as that of the English speaking nations. In essence, this is the attraction of the book to those of us who do not know Portuguese. Written in English, it gathers in one place summaries of others' cultural varieties.<br />The strongest influences are naturally from Brazil and Portugal. There is some discussion of Mozambique and Angola, but those 2 nations are so poor and still struggling to rebuild from decades of war that their cultural influence outside their borders is marginal. Likewise, there is really no discussion of Goa and East Timor. But these have much smaller populations than the African countries. Beside, it appears that in newly independent East Timor, Portuguese is losing out to Bahasa and English.<br />There is a nice chapter on modern Portugal's vision of itself, and how that had to change after 1974, when its dictatorship ended and its colonies were let go. Readers may find echos here of when Britain and France divested themselves of their empires after World War 2 and seemed to lose some of their moorings. But of course, they still remained great industrial powers. For Portugal, it was a starker loss, though their former African colonies undoubtedly had a more upbeat view of independence.	2003-08-15

Given that the electorate is half female, one might expect similarly of public administration. Indeed, there is no shortage of women in it. But when we look at the managerial positions, overwhelmingly they are male.<br />The author asks why this is so. She claims that the self images of leadership and expertise is &quot;culturally masculine&quot;, though this is not generally recognised. She dissects its history, going back to the early 20th century when the massive expansion of the federal government began. Through the lens of gender analysis, she shows that the characteristics of leadership in the administration has always had masculine undertones. Not surprisingly, few females were thus promoted. This legacy of resultant career discrimination against women persists; all the more pernicious because it is mostly subliminal and scarcely acknowledged.<br />The author has done us a great service by raising these issues.	2003-08-14

It is a scripting language that can make vanilla HTML pages more interactive. By now it, like HTML, is very stable. And if you design web pages, it is a good addition to your skill set. Being stable and popular means that there is no shortage of books on it. So on what basis should you prefer this book?<br />Well, it takes its title very literally. The pedagogy really does emphasise copious examples. In a typical chapter, the examples take up over half the space. Plus each chapter includes a problem set. Yay! You need to learn by doing. Yet so many computer books omit this. Granted, some topics require so many parts to interoperate that writing problems is nontrivial. But to test JavaScript code, all you need is a browser, text editor and a web server. These days, all computers have the first two items. And, in the context of you wanting to learn JavaScript, you DO have a web server that you can load files onto, don't you?<br />My only quibble is that I wish there were more problems in each chapter. This could take up very little extra room, say a page per chapter. But it would roughly triple the number of problems, and give the reader an even more exhaustive exploration of the topics.	2003-08-12

Over a billion people in the world still live in absolute and near-absolute poverty, where the former is defined as a daily income of less than $US1. Of these, the book notes that women bear more than their share. If we wish to remedy the poverty, the authors suggest analysing how and why the women in it have experiences different from men.<br />Several articles describe how girls often get less education than boys, which then constrains their future employment prospects. Related to this are results of how poorer women have less knowledge of contraception and less means to purchase them. One such article studied lower and upper class girls in Argentina. But the results certainly apply elsewhere. One consequence is higher fertility by the poor, who have less resources to cope. So the wheel turns on another cycle.<br />The book is scholarly and dispassionate in reporting what must really seem at times to be ineradicable suffering. I leave it to you to decide if the remedies suggested in the book will have much impact. In part, it is the sheer scale of numbers that is so daunting. Maybe we can only hope for the best with these measures.	2003-08-11

The author points out that in the 19th century, many of the local groups that people joined were chapters of national or transnational organisations. This was part of their attractiveness. Joining a local group gave comradely ties with others across the nation, that you had never met, and probably would never meet. How peculiar was this to the US, as compared with the European countries from which many of these people recently left? Is there any way to quantify this? A little unfair to ask, perhaps, because of the sheer amount of research needed to flesh it out. But the above questions arise naturally out of the research summarised in the book.<br />Historians have asked if the US was qualitatively different from other countries. (&quot;Vineyard of liberty&quot; etc.) The issues raised by the book give us another way to address the question. Perhaps Americans were more inclined to join such nation spanning groups because as an immigrant, footloose people, if they did not have centuries of binding to the same soil and neighbours, they wanted some other and multiple means of belonging? Was the striking success of the groups in some part due to such inchoate urgings?<br />Another way to test would be to look into the history of similar groups in Canada, Australia and New Zealand.<br />Skocpol also points out that from the 1960s onwards, the membership of such groups in the US fell significantly. She advanced several reasons. But there is one possible reason for some of the decline that she did not mention. From the mid 1950s, TV became pervasive. Remember that joining a volunteer group is done in your recreational time. TV is a notorious competitor for that time, due to its convenience and cheapness. Plus, and more specifically, if one of your reasons (possibly unconscious) for joining a national group is to be part of a larger world, then TV assuages that to some extent. Granted, some of this may be illusory, but so what?ry, but so what?	2003-08-10

She is careful, even in the title, not to say &quot;Literature&quot;. She does not restrict herself to what we now call literature of that period (Dickens, Hardy,...). Rather, she also looks at newspapers and magazines. Why? Because when amassed as a gestalt, a deepening appreciation arises. For example, most novels were not read by most of their audiences in the form of a single printed book. High cost, worsened by a curious custom of publishing a novel in 3 volumes, which priced it out of the reach of many. So to attract readership and add a revenue stream, the book would be serialised in a magazine. That is how people of that time often read their fiction. Of course, this had significant effects on the structure of the Victorian novel. You needed delay and suspense at appropriate intervals; the tendency to converge toward a play-like format of several distinct Acts,... Modern readers may see an analogy with TV miniseries.<br />There is an interesting similarity to early 20th century science fiction that the author does not point out. Prior to World War 2, most SF was also published in magazines (&quot;pulps&quot;) as short stories or serialised novels. The advent of the mass paperback only happened after the war. Prior, it was very rare to have an SF novel in hardcover because the market for it was not seen to be large enough to justify the printing. Unless of course the author was already famous, like Wells. It is neat how two different fields of fiction, roughly a century apart, by necessity found the same answer to similar problems.<br />She ends her survey around 1910, as a good proxy for the end of the previous century. Also an excellent choice for another reason. It was the last period when printing was the only form of recorded entertainment. After 1910, cinema, then radio, television and computers arose. Truly a quite different era. The period analysed was the last one where the terms print and recorded entertainment were co-extensive and indeed redundant. A golden age, though of course these can only been seen in retrospect.terms print and recorded entertainment were co-extensive and indeed redundant.

A distinguishing characteristic of that war, and unforeseen by many, was Israel sitting it out; passively enduring missile attacks on its cities.<br />Levran describes the political and military constraints forced on Israel during and after the war. The frustration and the diminished deterrent credibility caused by non-retaliation; though mitigated by the realisation to the Arabs that a major war could not be waged without American patronage.  And that the American military technology which won the war was, for the most part, available to Israel but not to the Arabs. He describes in detail the various advantages and disadvantages of Israel's non-actions.<br />Now if you believe that thanks to the US occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan, there will be no more wars in the Middle East, then this book may be idle chatter. But the cynical minded will find this to be informative and possibly pertinent to future conflicts.	2003-08-08

It sought to analyse the mass membership in the context of a decades-long decline. More pointedly, it was written shortly after the massive electoral defeats in the 80s. A barely concealed subtext was the worry that this presaged a permanent falloff in Labour's electoral base, and the entrenching of an immovable Conservative party.<br />But as I write this in 2003, the book comes across as a piquant curiosity. A few years after it came out, Tony Blair became leader and he moved it to the centre of British politics, repeatedly trouncing the Conservatives, who are now a demoralised husk. The book's concluding chapter does contain hints of this. It describes how the party leadership in the early 90s developed a strategy for victory. In part, this included downplaying controversy and suppressing internal dissent. The Left of course criticised it as &quot;sanitised&quot;. But, hey, it worked.<br />An amusing sidenote: If you peruse the index, you can see names of many Labour luminaries (Kinnock, Benn...). But no mention of Blair! Yet today, he is or will soon be the longer serving prime minister in British history.	2003-08-08

With India's detonation of several fission bombs in the late 90s, and the subsequent matching of these tests by Pakistan, the danger of nuclear war in South Asia became very real. Much discussion soon followed in the US and elsewhere. This book expands on that, with papers by distinguished authors on many aspects of India's strategic policies. The biggest focus is of course vis-a-vis Pakistan's military doctrine and the hazards of both stumbling into war with inadequate controls of their stockpiles. There are also secondary issues, like India wanting a deterrence against a nuclear-armed China whose economy is also growing faster. The Indian space program is also seen in a different light, after their tests. Now, it offers not just prestige value, but also a complement to the tests, giving India an indigenous missile delivery capability.<br />If you are interested in the issue of nuclear proliferation, then I recommend this book. Its analyses of South Asia go well beyond those in a typical magazine or newspaper.<br />Americans may also be interested in this book for a more specific reason. Pakistan has amassed several nuclear weapons, to counter India. But Pakistan also has millions of admirers of Osama bin Laden. The government has imperfect control over the country. It is a fear of American strategists that terrorists might be able to &quot;access&quot; the Pakistani arsenal. If so, the effects could be far more deleterious than a few hijacked planes.	2003-08-08

The suffragettes of the 19th and 20th centuries did not strive in vain. Where elections are held, women can vote, and at the same starting age as men. Contraception and abortion are mostly accessible. Women can exist as legal entities, not just as adjuncts of their spouses.<br />Overt barriers to women have been abolished. Surely feminists can declare the game over? Well not quite. And this is really what the book is about. It has papers from a conference at Cambridge, Britain, with researchers from political science, philosophy and law. The mood seems to be of a field uncertain of its direction. Issues of pay inequity still persist in every country and most professions. At the managerial level, men still vastly outnumber women. Thus too in parliaments. In some contexts, like pregnancy, women might not have full legal status, on a par with men.<br />How to redress these? The issues lack the rallying clarity of (say) a denial of suffrage, and thusly too there is a lack of consensus on possible solutions. In that, the book seems a good representative of current feminist thought.	2003-08-07

Of these welfare recipients, those that are single women with children consistently attract the most opprobrium. The US has the added overly of race: The stereotype of a racial minority single mother. This admixture exacerbates feelings, at the very least. An American might ask: If we could somehow remove the racial stereotype, would there still be an animus towards women-headed households on welfare?<br />That is the attraction of this book. It looks at the travails of such women in Egypt. The women are all of the same ethnicity as most of the population, and mostly too of the same religion, Islam. The narrative shows that prejudice still exists; of a conservative patriarchal bent, where the women are blamed for their situations and discriminated against, to &quot;encourage&quot; them to find a husband to head their households. Due to Egypt being a conservative Muslim country. Yet such attitudes are scarcely unknown amongst social and Christian conservatives here.<br />Bibars writes in a clear style, readily understandable to laymen. Mostly dispassionate. But she presents excerpts from several interviewees that starkly describe the difficulties they face. A constant theme is poverty or near-poverty; and these are Egyptian levels of subsistence. Some readers may find these passages not easy going.	2003-08-07

At possibly the peak of the British Empire,  the franchise was quite limited. Half the population, women, could not vote. Of the men, you had to own property worth above a certain amount, or you had to pay above another amount in annual rent. Plus the district in which you could vote might be of vastly different size in electorate compared to another district.<br />As Britain industrialised, the cities grew, as did the educated populations therein. By the 1860s, a thriving educated working and middle class had arisen. This book describes their increasing awareness of their disenfranchisement and their consequent struggles to get the vote. The ratcheting up of social tensions and their manifestations in Parliament and on the streets is recounted. But unlike a history text written in, say, 1910, there is more analysis made of the role of the women's movement, the Free Irish, and the class tensions between the skilled artisans and the middle class. All these were factors which publicly preceded and culminated in the passage of the Reform Act.<br />The authors give an eloquent analysis of events that most Americans are unfamiliar with, inasmuch as the contemporary events here were the Civil War and Reconstruction.	2003-08-07

In science, one often strives to conduct experiments where you have 2 sets of similar subjects, and you vary the environments in different ways, to see what transpires. That is the spirit of this fascinating treatise. The authors contrast the experiences of female managers in Britain and Hong Kong. Both groups are well educated (usually with an undergraduate degree at least) and are middle class to upper middle class. Plus, both countries are developed.<br />They found some striking differences. In Britain, if you are a middle class woman, chances are, so too were your parents. Courtesy in part of the British class structure. But in Hong Kong, due to the rapid postwar industrialisation, there is far less correlation, and a greater belief by the women in meritocratic advancement.<br />The authors go on to discuss other factors. An interesting sidenote is the availability of servants to the Hong Kong women, due to an endless supply of uneducated labour in Guangdong. This lets women maintain a career path soon after childbirth. A harder option in Britain, despite maternity leave legislation.<br />All in all, a good comparison of the female struggle for careers and achievements across cultures.	2003-08-06

I can use tables to display these, but showing linkages is awkward. It is far more natural to graph them. This lets me use evolution, for the human eye and brain are excellent at processing images and discerning patterns in them. But I also want to algorithmically find groupings and invariant properties of the graphs. There is a danger here. In graph theory, it is very easy to inadvertantly pose a simple question that is computationally hard to solve (NP-hard). Conversely, I don't want to reinvent the wheel. From graph theory, there may well be properties of my graph that I can easily extract. Certainly, the amount of research on graphs is voluminous.<br />But how does one take advantage of that? Consulting research journals in maths for papers on graph theory is really feasible only for the career mathematician. But for me, graphs are just a tool; not an ends per se. So I need a book that has the right amount of complexity. It needs to get enough into the subject, beyond the trivial exposition of definitions. Yet it should not bury me in lemmas and theorems.<br />I found such a book! This one. A well deserved third iteration. The explanations are extremely clear. Before I encountered this text, I used Donald Knuth's &quot;Art of Computer Programming&quot; (which is also put out by Addison-Wesley) and his treatment of graphs. But Sedgewick's discourse is far more extensive and, to me, just as well written.<br />A bonus is the extensive problem sets at the ends of each chapter. Even if I have no inclination to do them, the results they give are a valuable extension of the text, by providing an extra summary of the research. I only wish that Sedgewick would provide answers, like Knuth. But this is a just a quibble.<br />This edition has example code in Java. Certainly nothing wrong with that. [I program in Java.] But really the code should be a secondary consideration to you. If you are a programmer and you can understand the text, then you should be of a calibre that you can write the code.rstand the text, then you should be of a calibre that you can write the code.	2003-08-01

In 1981 I knew someone by that name, at the University of Western Australia, in Perth, Australia. Then I read the dustjacket, and indeed it is the same person. Didn't know back then that he was interested in science fiction. Small world.<br />What I did know in 1981 was that he was quite articulate and logical; no surprise since he is a lawyer. Quite skilled at analysing political issues. In this book, he shows these qualities, along with a polished writing flair. The book is a gathering of short stories set at the start and end of the Man-Kzin Wars. They mesh smoothly into the framework set by the 9 other volumes in this series. No impedance mismatch.<br /><br />The first story is the most interesting; set when the Kzin invade Wunderland at the beginning of the first war. Earlier volumes have episodes set on Wunderland during and at the end of the occupation. Those contain brief allusions to the invasion. This story fleshes it out. The battle scenes are quite well done, with the requisite gore and minor human victories. The humans cannot actually WIN in the story, you see, because they have to endure a 50 year occupation, as depicted in the previous volumes.<br /><br />Subsequent stories are set after the war. Not badly done, either. But for me, I found the first to be the most compelling. Its depictions of the social structure of the human world and the underlying tensions made it seem more credible. There is an analogy here with David Weber's well received Honor Harrington series. While those are military science fiction, he has also expanded on the intricacies of the warring societies, and in doing so, made it more than just a cardboard space opera. Something similar seems to be happening here.<br />Let us hope Colepatch keeps writing!	2003-07-31

Scalzo gives a chatty, informal exposition of tuning large data warehouses using Oracle software. He uses a strong conversational tone that makes such issues as star schema query optimisations straightforward to follow, under the assumption that you are already an experienced Oracle database administrator.<br />The book is independent of Oracle. What is unclear to me is how Oracle would regard this book. In several places, Scalzo describes the appallingly slow performance of Oracle 7 vis-a-vis Oracle 8i and 9i. He basically says that for certain tasks on large data sets, Oracle 7 was badly designed. No one who is currently using Oracle 7 will be thrilled to hear this. (Hee hee.) Cynically, one migh think Oracle 7 was overpromised and it underdelivered in some ways. But positively for Oracle, Scalzo gives typically much better results for 8i and 9i. An inducement to upgrade, if you have not done so already.<br />The biggest quibble about this book is the chatty style. Doesn't bother me. But it may perturb some of you, if you prefer a more &quot;serious&quot; timbre to the discussion of expensive design and deployment issues. If you can see your way clear past this, then the book may have merit in your DBA job.	2003-07-31

Now we've reached the heights of Oracle 9i. How things are grown. The multiple table joins; the many obscure syntactical variants added by what are now centuries of person years of coding. Perhaps it is inevitable that any successful software will continually add refinements that increase its capabilities, but usually this is done at a concomitant loss of simplicity. Typically you as a database administrator will rarely use most features. But how to find the occasional rarity that you need, and have forgotten (or perhaps never knew)?<br />By definition, the vendor's manuals are authoritative. But often these fall short in usability or pedagogy. (Oracle is by no means alone in this.) So here, Russel and Cordingley give you an independent, simple index into 9i. A quick perusal shows no index. But a second look shows that the entire book is really a graphical index into, and a refresher of, the command syntax. Like conventional indices, the book does not attempt to explain its entries. For example, on page 146, we see a graph for \\"add hash substitution\\". They assume you know what this means, but that you need a quick reminder of HOW to invoke it. Given that you have the database and its online help accessible (otherwise why would you need this book?), this is a fair assumption. Clearly, you can consult the online or hardcopy documentation for more information. The stress in the book is on simplicity.<br />There is a little irony here. A database is a means whereby you can store data in a silo and easily get summaries and subsets (\\"views\\") of it. When you strip away the technical jargon, every database package aspires to this. If you regard the commands and capabilities of a database as data (or metadata), then you cannot usually change these. But how do you get summaries and views of THIS data? That is what the vendor's online help and documentation is all about.<br />The irony about this book is not that it was written, but that it was not written by Oracle. The vendor's raison d'etre is to provide tools for access to information. But here, others have seen a need to write another tool to get at the vendor's own data.but that it was not written by Oracle.

The patterns were described at a general enough level that you could hope to apply them against code, regardless of its application, be it scientific, business or whatever. But one of the boundaries was that Fowler did not discuss patterns when java is used in a narrower but very important context - enterprise computing. This covers cases where you have a web server using java for dynamically generate web pages, and it interacts with a backend database in a multitier structure.<br />Various extensions to java have been made to handle these - servlets, Java Beans, Enterprise Java Beans, Java Server Pages, Data Access Objects. Typically, each has grown in power and complexity such as to have books dedicated solely to its explication. Much more specialised than generic java.<br />The authors of this book discovered that when you code using these enterprise extensions, often similar problems or patterns recur. They ask, can these problems and solutions be systematically elucidated in a form akin to a taxonomy? Their answer is yes, and that answer is this book.<br />It assumes that you already have a fairly high level of competence in the enterprise extensions like EJBs. For example, the book often mentions HttpServlet in the context of JSPs. You need to know what this is. The book wastes no time in describing such things. There are perfectly adequate other texts that do so. At the level of treatment in this book, those are mundane details.<br />The value added by this book is in describing how to optimise the design when you combine the various enterprise extensions into a real product. It has the flavour of Fowler's Refactoring, and in the context of J2EE, may be just as influential.	2003-07-21

Ostensibly, the book is for managers and not engineers. There is not a stitch of source code in the book. The author does not assume that you know how to write code, but that you know how businesses use software. My impression is that the book is too useful to be restricted to managers. Programmers can also benefit, if they are about to embark on design and coding of a Web Service, and they have never done so before. Try starting here, as the first step in the design.<br />Manes gives an excellent summary of the field, with what I consider realistic assessments of its prospects. Part of the book's appeal is the vendor independence. Yes, you can go to the websites of IBM, Microsoft, BEA Systems and others, and find the latest status of their WS offerings and white papers on their strategic takes. And you probably should do that. But getting an independent comparison of their efforts is futile from their own papers.<br />I especially agree with her assertion that the dynamic assembly of software services is at least 10 years away. This is like in the 80s, when 4th and 5th Generation Languages were touted as just around the corner. When they arrived, you could instruct your computer in new tasks, without having to program! Well, that never happened. The complexity of business and research applications precluded it. Likewise with Web Services. Manes warns the reader not to be beguiled by such claims, but to focus on immediate do-ables.	2003-07-18

All the more so if the computer acts as a server, rather than just a desktop leaf on a network. On the server side, you often have unix or linux systems.<br />This recent book by OReilly is hence timely. Concise, with a good contents and index. The authors write clearly, in what may be considered a &quot;standard&quot; cookbook style. Each problem is summarised, and a brief but entirely adequate how-to answer is then given. It is part of this style that they do not go into the theory of public/private key encryption, for example. But they readily provide references to fuller discussions on many topics.<br />Checking the index for comprehensiveness revealed one curious omission. There is no entry for &quot;virus&quot;. While it seems like a glaring oversight, I think the authors are correct in doing so. Antivirus software exists, and you would merely have to run it against a set of files. And this software is not usually part of an operating system. Also, most viruses are written for Microsoft desktops. Thus far, linux viruses are actually pretty rare.<br />The title says &quot;Linux&quot;. Actually, if you are running any major unix (Solaris, HPUX...), don't take that title too literally. The problems you face will often be the same as those described here. The solutions will often likewise be the same. Most unixes now have many utilities in common with each other and linux. You may be able to map an answer given here to a similar approach on your machine.	2003-07-16

So while you may be a programmer on a current workstation with heaps more memory and speed than a &quot;constrained&quot; PDA, migrating to it would still mark you as a power developer by the standards of a not so distant past.<br />If you are already programming in Java for a desktop, then this book will be an easy stroll in the park. The graphics and networking libraries are different from J2SE and J2EE. But this is only insofar as they have necessarily much less functionality, though retaining just enough to hopefully do what you need.  Gnash your teeth at the loss of cool graphics, if you must, but that is how things are. The neatest part of the book is the descriptions on how to offload the heavy computations via web services. This may be new to you.<br />By the way, if you are interested in the book, also check out &quot;MIDP 2.0 Style Guide&quot; by Bloch and Wagner; also published by Addison-Wesley. The two books complement each other. The latter gives a high level description of the appearance and functionality of a UI on a small device. Wilding-McBride's book then shows code examples to actually let you do this, at least for PDAs. Surprisingly, neither book appears to reference the other, though they are by the same publisher and came out just a few months apart. So, at least let me do that for them here.	2003-07-11

The book is the complement of the first Terminator movie, T2 and T3 (due in a few weeks). Remember in T1 the glimpses of the future, showing Reese and others fighting in the rubble, amidst skeletons? It has been nineteen years since the T1 movie, but finally we can see extra details alluded to.<br />Stylistically, this differs from most of Stirling's works. In part because he must fit it into the boundary conditions set by the movies. The narrative is sparser. Details are considerably less, especially of the scenery, which is his trademark in many other stories. There is simply not the dense weave of descriptions and subplots seen in the Nantucket trilogy or the Peshawar Lancers. Plus, the combat scenes don't have the same intensity as those in Marching Through Georgia. (One scene in Future War alludes to another in the latter; see if you can find it.)<br />My impression is that Stirling wrote this book simply to tie up the loose ends in the movies and close out his two other Terminator novels. Just work-for-hire. Fans of the movies should check this book out for more flesh on the movies. Fans of Stirling should probably look to his other wholly-owned works.	2003-06-24

Sun and Microsoft have been duking it out for several years for control of the desktop and servers. Microsoft dominates the desktop, but on the server side, Sun holds greater sway. When Sun introduced Java in 1995, it was in an attempt to prise open the desktop. Though java has gained massive uptake on servers, Sun has been unsuccessful on the desktop. But on cellphones, Sun has used java and the phone manufacturers' fear of Microsoft to great success. About 100 million cellphones in the world use Java. Sun says the number of such phones sold this year will be greater than the number of PCs sold; though of course the unit cost of PCs is greater.<br />Which brings us to this book. Written for those who wish to develop using Java on cellphones, PDAs or other small mobile devices. Very topical in the context of the above struggle. In the struggle for mindshare amongst developers, Sun and Addison-Wesley have put forth with this style guide.<br />Very straightforward. The biggest difference, if you are a Java programmer on a server or desktop, is that the resources are now much more limited. The screen might be 1 bit deep and only 96 x 54 pixels, and you might have less than 1Mb of RAM. In a way, if you have been programming since the 80s, some of the constraints are a blast from the past. Back then, on standalone, non-mobile platforms, you probably have no more and maybe much less than 1Mb. You certainly didn't have a 24 bit deep 1600 x 1200 colour display like today's desktops. We have all become pampered with the flush resources on the latter. Now, with the AWT gone, replaced by much skimpier graphics, you can relive the fun you had in the 80s!	2003-06-24

Not a single image of a Java widget. The diagrams are graphs of various scientific equations. Palmer knows his audience. Primarily, you are in a field where programming is very much just a tool; a means and definitely not an end in itself. Typically, you had to learn Fortran or C to, say, integrate an equation or converge a series.<br />While a snazzy GUI might be pretty, you often just want a set of numbers as output. Granted, this might reflect when you learnt programming. Before 1990, graphics were still uncommon. But even today, output as a set of numbers is still the most important case, because often that output becomes the input of another number cruncher.<br />If the above describes your case, and you have never used Java, then this book may be well suited. Palmer expends no time in teaching a GUI. And scarcely more time on an exposition of object-oriented layout. He puts enough details that you can easily read the examples, which are really the core of the book. These show how you can solve a common equation with relatively small amounts of code.<br />Guess what? It is not difficult at all. The core subroutines in numerical programming look much the same in Fortran, C, C++ or Java. If you can take an equation on paper and express it in one of the first 3 languages, then you can easily transition to doing it in Java. For a given problem, the amount of work you have to do to express and debug it in code is about the same, across all these languages. None of these languages gives you a magic potion that makes your work much easier.<br />So why choose Java? Well, if down the road you want a GUI, then only Java [of these 4 languages], comes with a built in set of widgets. And using them is very easy. Much easier that writing with X on top of C or C++, for example. Plus, if you want to assemble a library of subroutines, and make it widely available, then Java offers nice ways to arrange these in a hierarchical fashion.	2003-06-13

You know perhaps how Postscript is resolution independent? One major reason for its becoming the defacto standard for printing hardcopy images. Trouble is, Adobe owns it. Well, after HTML came along, people wondered if there was a way to take the inspiration of Postscript, and apply it in a different context - Web pages. SVG is one such implementation.<br />Given the inherent visual nature of SVG, and the tag constructs, it looks like HTML and should be as earn to learn. The title of the book gives the prerequisite: Are you already a Web developer? At a minimum, you know HTML.<br />You do not need to have XML prior to this. In point of fact, suppose you do NOT know XML? You can treat this book as a means of learning XML, with SVG just as a useful example topic. XML deals mostly with data representation, and not usually display. In this way, it is more of an abtraction than HTML. With the latter, when you tweak an HTML page, you get immediate visual feedback. This in no small part helped HTML become successful. But with a typical XML book, you have to work a little harder to decipher your efforts. The neat thing about using this book is that XML becomes as easy as learning HTML!	2003-06-09

I remember the first time several years ago that I used an Integrated Development Environment to code. Thought it was gimmicky at first, having been used to a vanilla vi monochrome display. But it really is quite helpful as a visual aid. Likewise with this book. It is the most immediate thing that will grab you, because it is on almost every page. What might seem a frivolous affectation soon becomes an obvious necessity. Why the heck don't other books do this? (Actually, it adds considerably to the printing costs.) Presentation does matter, something known to good authors and editors.<br />But what about the content? Well, it certainly is not the &quot;Cretin's 3 Day Guide to Java&quot;. It can take you a lot longer than 3 days to plow through this. The authors have aimed this at both the beginner and the experienced programmer. You need never have tweaked a computer before. But the book also delves into Java Server Pages, JDBC, Design Patterns, UML, New I/O and Web Servers. Typically in the Java literature, these 6 topics are covered in books of their own; and not for novices either. But if you are a beginner, this should not put you off. You do not need to read far before you can start coding effectively. And you can hold the later chapters in reserve till you gain experience.<br />The authors are clearly trying to move up the food chain. They have put a lot of material into the text. Plus added two CDs, with thousand of lines of source code, and freeware for a full development environment. The latter is not strictly necessary for an experienced user who knows where to look for it on the web. But a nice aid to the beginner, saving hours of aggravation over what are strictly setup tasks, and not actual programming efforts.	2003-06-02

NT 5). For the first time in NT's history, the desktop version (=XP) was released separately from the server version. XP has gotten very good reviews in the marketplace, as being very stable; comparable to a mature unix line like Solaris. So now, finally, we have the server version!<br />The author is upfront about offering an independent view of WS2003. For example, he states that MS's minimum hardware requirements are inadequate for good runtime performance in a real workplace. Others have also said this about MS's earlier operating systems. [Cynically, one might think MS is understating the full cost of the system, to jack up sales.]<br />The book certainly is comprehensive; walking through all aspects of installing, configuring and running the OS. The quality of the prose is clear and should be understandable if you have any sysadmin experience with MS. My own background is unix, but I had no problem following his steps.<br />A compelling claim of this book is that it aspires to be more than a mechanistic drill. Typically, each chapter begins with a good outline of its subject. If you do not have a specific problem to fix, but want a lucid synopsis of a topic, try finding the relevant chapter and read the first third or so. Nice level of abstraction, without bogging you in minutae.	2003-05-18

And you have dealt with HTML. But that is strictly for Web pages, and deals best only with the presentation of data. While for the printed page, you may have worked with TeX or Postscript/PDF.<br />But is there a way to go from data in XML to its display on the web or on a page? And is this possible using a consistent syntax for both cases? More ambitiously, can we handle any human language, where the order of reading a page will vary? At the broadest level, this is where XSL-FO fits in. It is an intermediary language that does this translation. This book, by an expert in the field, actually emphasises the many variants of a printed page that cause a lot of the language's complexity.<br />Not too surprising. Printing incorporates conventions accrued over the centuries, from many different cultures. Devising a language rich enough to merge all of the possible variations is not simple. (A bottoms-up problem, if you will.) Plus, printing onto pages is much trickier than printed onto a browser. In the latter, you can have an infinitely long page, and you can hyperlink to anywhere. Real pages have finite length, and hence you get grubby little details like widows and orphans and footnotes that have to be handled carefully.<br />So be warned. The subject is far harder than HTML. This book is well suited for someone who has some prior experience in printed typography. Experience with TeX, troff or some of the Adobe page layout packages will be highly useful.<br />It is all a little ironic. XSL-FO is a computer language. But if we all read solely from computer displays, then much of the rationale for it would vanish. However, that day is the day of the paperless office. And until we gain those sunlit uplands, there is a need for XSL-FO and for an authoritative book to describe it, like this one.	2003-05-18

Soon, we got to the point that we needed a more formal way to read/write data than merely an ad hoc approach. We use XML. The obvious approach is to use a well tested relational database, like those supplied by IBM, Oracle or Microsoft. A problem was getting detailed, objective explanations of what would be involved with each choice. Each vendor is perfectly willing to be our &quot;friend&quot; and supply us with reams of documentation. But still...<br />The chapters in this book that describe how to hook up XML to those 3 vendors' databases were excellent and clear.<br />But what we ended up doing was going with something suggested in ANOTHER chapter - building an embedded XML database. You will not see this advocated by a vendor; there is no sale for them here. Other than this book, we found it tough to get lucid explanations of the pros and cons of this route. It will take more work, but we hope it will give better performance - no interprocess communication, for one thing. Plus of course no licence fees, and easier installation and management, since we will have access/own all the source code. This was not our original intention, by any means. But the book's comparative analysis was so persuasive that we ended up taking this road. (Hopefully, it will not be a dead end.)<br />That one chapter on embedded XML databases was, to us, the most precious thing in the entire book!	2003-05-01

They were marked as out of print, with book 2 selling from $ upwards, used. Similarly for books 3 to 5. This is very atypical for paperbacks published in the last 12 years. Typically, a used paperback of this \\"vintage\\" will go for 50 cents or so. Take a look for your favourite recent paperbacks and see for yourself. (Book 1 has been continually in print.) Quite striking. Because these prices are not determined by the publisher or bookseller, but by the independent secondary market.<br />Apparently, Baen (the publisher) underestimated the demand. I have also found that at least in Los Angeles, the used bookstores rarely have the General books in stock. It may well be that as Stirling's commercial successes grew in the 90s, so did demand for his backlist.<br />Baen has decided to assuage this demand, and strike for higher margins, by reissuing the series as 2 hardcovers. Good for them!	2003-04-23

No set theory. No predicate calculus. This book is about the logical design of databases for someone who has never done that before. The tasks here are independent of any actual SQL software, and you do not need to know any SQL either.<br />This is ostensibly a computer book. But interestingly enough, you do not need a computer to do anything it describes. From an object-oriented view, if that is your background, the author has done a skilful job of separating the design methodology from any software implementation or environment.<br />It is also useful if you are not from a computing background, but you need to know what your technical coworkers, subordinates or the people in the department next door do when they maintain databases. Ok. The author does not discuss issues like transaction processing. But that is off-topic. Here, with a few hours reading, you can get the essence of database design.	2003-04-20

Remember when java burst onto the scene on 1996, and you could write cool applets that showed animations on a web page? Well things have progressed vastly since then, and especially after the dotcom crash, being essential is far more important than being cool. The emphasis with java has shifted from towards backend, web server-type applications, when you have to interact with legacy databases and management tools. The problem with the latter is that if you are writing a java application that is to be controlled by some management level software, this latter item could be furnished by several companies. It is expensive to customise your code for each management package; but not to do so may severely restrict your sales.<br /><br />JMX, Java Management Extensions, arose to solve this puzzle. It is still fairly new, and not many java programmers may be familiar with it. If so, this new book [2003 vintage] will help educate you. The authors point out a simple analogy that may clarify. Shortly after java was introduced, there was a need to let java programs access data in databases made by various<br />vendors. The solution was an industry standard API, called JDBC. Each database vendor wrote an implementation of this API, which was hence called a JDBC driver. This let java programmers program to that interface and ignore any lower level details.<br /><br />So if you can understand that, you can understand JMX. The difference is that here your java application will be controlled by some management software, whereas with JDBC, your java program would have been the controlling entity.<br /><br />The bulk of the book goes into the details of the JMX API. [Ok, it may not be literally an application programmable interface, but conceptually you can think of it that way.] The exposition is straightforward and logical.<br /><br />A nice resource for the aspiring JMX developer.	2003-03-24

Four years ago, I read his first edition. It had a rare elegance amongst the literal ton of Java books already on the market. Enough others must have agreed, for a second edition came out soon thereafter. And now we have this third edition, that describes the latest Java, version 1.4.<br />If you are new to Java and are casting around for a suitable book, try this. The code examples and explanatory text are very clear. Little is assumed for prerequisites. Even if you have never programmed inany language, this will still be useful. Object oriented programming is explained in general terms that will be familiar to any C++ programmers.<br />Plus, if you already know some Java, but are uncertain about various nooks and crannies, this book may also help flesh out your understanding. It is not a Dummies [trade mark??] book. The most complicated chapter seems to be about multithreading/concurrency. Always a difficult topic for many readers. Eckel carefully steps through the issues here in a lucid way.<br />By the way, Eckel makes the text available on his website. But he and his publisher, Pearson, have made the calculation that most readers will still prefer a traditional bound copy, than peering at a computer screen or shuffling through looseleaf hardcopy. Which I suppose is a little ironic, given the subject material and the audience.	2003-03-23

It worked well, but was very kludgy. JSPs invariably mix the HTML display code with some of the internal data logic. Through a judicious use of the<br />Model-View-Controller paradigm, I was able to reduce this mixing. But a minimal amount was still inevitable. This is a common experience with JSPs. You end up with files containing java code and HTML. Ugly and brittle. Plus, it calls upon two areas of expertise. A separation of the two would be much more<br />robust, and allow people with skills in only one of these areas to still contribute to the development.<br />In answer to this, Sun has been refining its Standard Tag Library. Specifically, it now has an expression language that is a programming language in its own right and is comprehensively described in this book, which bears Sun's official impramateur. Programmers versed in other languages can quickly absorb this. Thru it, you can easily write code to access Java Beans and other java programs. Plenty of clear examples are provided.<br />Of interest to several will be how to use STL to hook up to back end SQL databases; transferring from them into webpages and transmitting user changes back into the databases.<br />The author also covers the important case of interacting with XML, which is now a de facto standard for data interchange. Nor does he neglect describing issues of internationalisation. Practical for those who have to support several languages.<br />The sum of all these is to make this book very useful for those of you needing to build JSPs in business applications. I do wish I had this book last year!	2003-03-20

The interminable debates on the web and at programmers' forums... Never actually learnt C#, until I came across this book.<br />Mok expounds specifically for the Java person[*], as that is his background and he thinks that there are others like us out there who have a similar curiosity. You can treat the book as a generalised &quot;diff&quot; of the two languages. Which may actually be more useful than the thick hardcover tomes put out by Microsoft, which scrupulously avoid mention of that four letter word, Java. As Mok makes clear, C# has clear intellectual roots in Java, plus C and C++.<br />In some ways, C# is a mishmash of those languages. It chose to follow Java in things like single inheritance and garbage collection, unlike C++. But it adopts the operator overloading of C++, unlike Java. And, it uses pointers, which is completely forbidden in Java. The last chapter of his book, which dealt with pointer manipulation was a stroll down memory lane. The functionality is straight out of C, and will be home ground for the many C programmers out there. (As I once was, too.) With this capability, it seems like Microsoft is aiming C# at a market from which Java has been virtually locked out - real time systems, where you need direct memory access.<br />The book seems very balanced in its treatment of C# versus Java. I thought his critiques of Java were fair, as were those of C#. He carefully points out the limitations of both.<br />[*] = Java man? No, he is extinct.	2003-02-26

In 1988, when I was first involved with it, the state of the art did not involve real time capability. You had to record the utterance and then analyse it with a computer. Typically, you also had to train the software with the speaker beforehand.<br /><br />Now, we have commercially available real time, speaker independent products. Some of the largest companies, like United Airlines and ATT, have deployed these, to try and reduce call centre costs, and to improve the user's experience when dialling into such a place. Are you considering installing such software? Of course, you can talk to the vendors. But where can you get objective advice? One possibility is to ask researchers in the field. But they can easily and inadvertantly drown you in jargon, especially if you do not have a technical background. This book attempts to fill that need. You do not need a degree in computer science or maths to understand it.<br /><br />The book does not explain how speech recognition works. Rather the emphasis is at a higher level: Using it in your workplace. The author gives many lucid examples of this. Basically, he outlines a commonsensical appproach that can be understood by anybody. He explains how not to overburden the user with long utterances full of information, but to take advantage of the context of the conversation to omit unnecessary details. He emphasises thorough testing, with a disciplined scaling up to a real life deployment in a call centre. Something that may well have been omitted in other deployments, leading to users gnashing their teeth in frustration at an obtuse dialog, or at busy phone lines.<br /><br />He also discusses why companies should regard this as part of their corporate branding, and how to choose an appropriate \\"noble\\" voice as part of that branding. I think the \\"noble\\" sounds rather pompous, actually. But that's not his fault! It is a standard phrase in this field, and you too might get used to it.t get used to it.	2003-02-24

He depicts us as successfully depositing a Neumann probe on Mars, just before our civilisation collapses. The probe replicates itself. Its descendents undergo machine evolution, subject to much the same forces as biological evolution. Eventually the robots dismantle Mars and have some kind of rocket drive that lets them wander.  This is just a minor subplot; the book concerns itself mostly with Earth.<br />But the way he wrote the fate of Mars seemed strongly ominous. If the robots could dismantle it, and has rockets, surely Earth would be a natural destination for some of them? It is the closest planet to Mars, for one. Sheer proximity, and the fact that there are a plethora of robots and that we are surveying geological time spans would ensure this. (Somewhat akin to Saberhagen's Berserkers.) Subsequent chapters never follow up. This I found very implausible, given his premises.<br />On an unrelated note: The fate of Mankind is indeed shown as depressing. Am I reading too much between the lines? Or is there an unstated advocacy for human space travel? For the colonisation of other worlds? Nowhere are these explicitly stated, apart maybe from the abovementioned robot probe to Mars. And that did not involve human travel. But by presenting a possible depiction of our fate if we do not get off this globe, is Baxter trying to say this?	2003-02-17

In a like way, Steve Stirling is doing so with the theme that he first instantiated in his Draka series. To wit, what happens when a group of people is put in an environment where they are a technologically advanced minority? How do they behave, and indeed how should they, towards a backward majority.  What type of society will arise?<br /><br />In the Draka books, the Draka are a ruthless, expansionist, slave owning power. In \\"The Chosen\\", he gave us  a very slightly more benign version. Then in the Nantucket trilogy, he created two societies. The Republic is explictly the US; benign and expansionistic. Walker's Kingdom of Greater Archaea is literally sadistic, and aggressively imperialistic.<br /><br />Now, Conquistador takes it further, and is more nuanced. The breakaway society is aristocratic and, where it suits itself, ruthless. But there is no slavery, or even the serf-like chattals posited in his other books. The leader is admirable at times; a benevolent dictator. Whereas with the Draka, Nantucket and Chosen scenarios, few readers would empathise with the villains, here it is fuzzier. In fact, this society and its leader, Rolfe, map closely into that of Isketerol's in the Nantucket books. Recall in those that Isketerol is shown as bold, as per his sneak attack on Nantucket itself, but also as genuinely concerned for his society, and humane when he can afford to be, because in the long run, this yields more.<br /><br />If you have read and enjoyed Stirling's other books, then you will too, here. The portal idea is scarcely new, but Stirling, with his usual skill, has made a fresh variant. The scenes in San Francisco and Los Angeles, especially in the alternate universe, are well drawn. The descriptions of a teeming Nature are most attractive, and will be no surprise to his readers. A seductive window into an alternate California.<br /><br />Plus, if this book is well received, he has left an ending begging for a sequel.no surprise to his readers.

It is a comprehensive reference manual for InfiniBand. Typical usage of this book may be by engineers at companies that have already committed to developing InfiniBand supported systems. (Mostly members of the InfiniBand Trade Association.)<br />What it does not discuss is WHY your company should do such a thing. There is a good reason for this. Mentioning such issues invariably involves quite subjective estimates of future demand for InfiniBand products, and the technological and economic merits of it versus alternatives like Fibre Channel or Ultra SCSI. This can be hazy and contentious. Good for many a flame war on the Internet. Quite rightly, the author decided to stick to the demonstrable facts.<br />If you are unfamiliar with InfiniBand, as it is still rather new, let me offer an analogy for this book. Compare it to a definitive text on the 7 layer OSI stack or the 5 layer TCP/IP stack. Except that Shanley concentrates on the equivalent of the physical layer and the datalink layer. InfiniBand leaves higher layers to the operating system.<br />To reiterate: This is an excellent book that teaches you HOW to design an InfiniBand-supported chip or system. But the higher level managerial decision on WHY you would do so needs to be made from other input.	2003-01-17

Yes, yes, here and there, the text refers to java files, but it delves no further into the specifics of the language. Rather, the principles described are good, general coding practices, for teams of two or more programmers that want to maximise their efficiency. You could be a C++, C# or even a[gasp] Cobol house, and derive benefit from reading this book.<br />There is minimal use of jargon. The authors appear to have gone to some trouble to make their points as simply and as broadly accessible as possible. One, possibly unintended, consequence is that a tyro programmer may consider this book trivial or vacuous. No complex UML diagrams, no intricate refactoring examples,... It may well be that an experienced old hand might get more out of the book, having endured many an unwieldy or uncoordinated project.<br /><br />Another significant point is that this book is accessible to nontechnical managers. Two scenarios are possible:<br />1. You are a manager, possibly nontechnical. You want to avoid mismanaging a team of programmers that wants to do things their way. This book might give valuable guidelines; plus you can use it to persuade the team about the logic of your decisions.<br />2. You are a programmer that is in a project that has had bad management decisions. This book might offer better strategies. Plus, it gives you a way to argue them persuasively to your bosses, even if they are nontechnical.	2003-01-10

Something for overworked sysadmins	A significant component of the Total Cost of Ownership of a network of personal computers is due to the myriad different pieces of hardware and software that these can contain; invariably from a slew of vendors. Integrating and managing the totality can be quite labour intensive for the systems administrator. Also too for the developer; whether she is writing the interface for a piece of software that others will use or if she is on the other side, and has to write code that runs that package and others.<br />Accordingly, Microsoft has pushed forward Windows Management Instrumentation. The book describes how to use WMI straightforwardly. You do need to know C++, COM and Active Template Library. No surprise there. Several sections also describe using  the still new C# and .NET to write OO applications that easily connect to WMI. If you have not used C# and .NET, the book's coverage is concise enough to get you started. The authors treat a minimal subset that is enough for you to do useful work vis-a-vis WMI.<br />On the scripting aspect, the authors rightly give this careful coverage. Scripting files may not have the sexy appeal of a GUI-driven methodology. But in fact, for automated systems administration of many machines, they are usually far more important. Veterans of DOS and Unix batch file writing will see much of familiar approaches here.<br />Part of Microsoft's incentive for promoting WMI is to help it stay ahead of linux. The basic functionality of a browser and  Microsoft Office are already in various linux applications. So at least in the network sphere, WMI helps Microsoft hold off linux. The authors do not discuss this, but if you read this book, you should keep it in mind; in the broader context of where the PC market is going.	2003-01-05

Though it has been over 25 years between the two. Nonetheless, the latter is exemplary hard military science fiction. But what about this book?<br />Its descriptions, told in the first person, of the late nineteenth century in the United States, are wonderfully done. They span the Civil War to the Alaskan gold rush. Reconstruction and the Gilded Age. But unlike say Jack Finney's &quot;Time and Again&quot;, there is little intrigue here. Rather, we see society through the eyes of a single woman trying to raise her son. The constraints and norms it imposes on her seem so confining to us, but she describes them matter-of-factly, which deliberately adds to the dissonance that the author intends between the subject's experiences and ours.<br />Read this if you want some understanding of what it meant to be female and not wealthy or powerful in that United States.<br />Ah, but what about the SCIENCE fiction? A little sparse. Such as it is appears only in the last quarter or less of the book. The first three quarters is straight historical fiction, though within which, the subject keeps alluding to this mysterious thing. Slightly annoying. When it finally does happen, it is rather hokey. Bloody risible, actually. I found it unconvincing and simply not up to the author's standards in his earlier books.	2002-12-30

A book of this short length, on such a subject, simply cannot cover it to any detail, no matter how skilfully written. Though the latter it certainly is, given the author's expertise as a writer and a historian.<br />The chapters are disconnected. There is little flow between one and the next. Which means that you can read them in any order, with little narrative loss.<br />Within a chapter, we see sharp anecdotes, that highlight the subject, be it the culture/s, migrants, religion or whatever. Some of these are bloody hilarious. Like, did you know that in some French cities, people were emptying slop buckets into the streets till the 1950s? Yuk! :-( Wow! That regular bathing was rare, and widely considered unhealthy?<br />Some attitudes, like the suspicion of the emanations of power lines, echo today's views in France and elsewhere in Europe, about genetically modified foods.<br />Quite a nice read.	2002-12-30

Though his English is now archaic, the intricate cleverness of his plot lines and their timeless insights into human nature have made him acclaimed. Which presents a serious problem for any author attempting to have him as a major character in a novel. Can you better his prose? Well Turtledove lacks any temerity! He makes Shakespeare the central character of this novel.<br />Both Shakespeare's spoken dialogue, and the invented writings in his play Boudicca are well done. More to the point, and the harder of it, read carefully the few stanzas of the latter that are presented in the text. Turtledove seems to have captured the cadences of authentic Shakespeare. As another reviewer said, it feels like an undiscovered Shakespeare play!<br />Having said all this, I should add that the story is a little sparse on action. It's a lighthearted romp through England of that time. Certainly, it does not compare in action or grimness of subject with Turtledove's WorldWar series, with its subtext of Nazi genocide, or his Civil War series.<br />The forced admixture of Spanish and English cultures is amusing. Turtledove lives in Los Angeles, as do I. Here there is a melange of both, with the Anglo influence being dominant. I think he used this experience and inverted it, to get some of the everyday depictions of London under the Spaniards. The casual use of a few Spanish phrases in English is unremarkable in 21-st century LA, but would certainly have been rare in 16-th century London, but for the Occupation.<br />This book may appeal more to the fans of Shakespearean and Middle English literature than your dyed-in-the-wool science fiction fans. In this, it resembles Turtledove's early short stories set in an alternate Byzantium Empire. As you may know, he has a PhD in Byzantine history from UCLA. He parlayed this expertise into various stories. Someone asked him about this once: How do people in that field feel about what he did. He said about half thought it was just weird. But the other half thought it was cool that he could put such arcana to use. He has done similarly here.t field feel about what he did. He said about half thought it was just weird.

Dating in fact to the first book on time travel, \\"The Time Machine\\" by HG Wells. Later authors like Isaac Asimov with \\"The End of Eternity\\", and Poul Anderson and his Time Patrol stories expanded on this idea. Now comes this book, which combines it with rummaging through the Age of Dinosaurs, a la Crichton's \\"Jurassic Park\\".<br /><br />The book can be divided into three parts. The first is when our heros go from the 21st century to the Cretaceous. This section lacked tautness. The bad blokes are thin cardboard, and the plot unfolding was predictable and boring.<br /><br />The second part, and the most interesting, is when the heroes get stranded after the asteroid that kills most of the dinosaurs hits Earth. We learn how our heroes barely survive. A different take on most dinosaur books, which describe the lush environment. Here, there is only devastation. Fans of Jurassic Park will like this section.<br /><br />There is one implausibility here. At one point, the heroine tells her male companions to look the other way, before she strips in order to swim a river. By this time, they are struggling to survive. To get enough to eat and to keep warm. I suggest to you that a nudity taboo is a luxury that would have disappeared much earlier. Heck, think of your own experiences if you have ever been backpacking for several days in a coed group. Chances are, after a day or so, most of you would readily skinny dip.<br /><br />The third part concerns when our heroes are rescued by time travellers from the far future. Far enough that they have physically changed, and are unaware of normal human emotions of love, and of sex. Very implausible. We can imagine descendents that have decided to reshape themselves physically, and also emotionally. But even if they removed emotions, would they have lost knowledge of those? And what of sex? The descendents are male or female. Even if they reproduced asexually, the fact that they have kept vestigial sexual characteristics suggests that they would retain the knowledge of what those implied, even if they were no longer relevant.<br /><br />One of the descendents says they lost a lot of knowledge of earlier times, which supposedly accounts for their ignorance of the above. The author is confused. Losing records means that they might not know who was King of France in 1750. But their genes carry their own biological history.<br /><br />Overall, an uneven book. As science fiction, only moderately original. As an adventure novel, middling.reproduced asexually, the fact that they have kept vestigial sexual characteristics suggests that they would retain the knowledge of what those implied, even if they were no longer relevant.<br /><br />One of the descendents says they lost a lot of knowledge of earlier times, which supposedly accounts for their ignorance of the above.

There are background details here that really localise it in time and space. So much so that if this book is read 50 years hence, editorial footnotes might be useful. For example, there is a slumlord who is ordered by a judge to live in one of his decrepit flats. Based on an actual case in the 90s. Then there is the city councillor who was caught with narcotics. Again inspired by a recent incident. Plus the LAPD Chief, who is a strict disciplinarian who rose from the ranks. Based on the previous actual Chief, who was replaced in 2002.<br />There are novels which deliberately do not say which year they are in. Typically, these are contemporary novels, and the authors do not want the books to soon appear dated. Think of the original James Bond novels, for example. The most you can say is that they are set in some decade.<br />Well, based on the clues above, this novel can be pinpointed quite accurately. The LAPD Chief in question held that position from 1997 to 2002. So the upper bound is 2002. The lower bound is greater than 1997. Why? Well, cellphones are casually used and pervasive. Likewise, the hero often uses search engines to look for people, and expects to find positive results. 1997 was a little too early for this. Probably 2000 and later.<br />In fact, think of this as the answer to a English assignment question, circa 2050. &quot;WHEN was this novel?&quot;	2002-12-14

The first is how you will store and read data. If you inherit legacy data, chances are they are in a relational database, and you need SQL and JDBC to get at them. The data are not usually in an object oriented layout, as you might wish. So the notorious &quot;impedance mismatch&quot; arises. A second issue is that business rules are often coded in EJBs, and specifically in Entity EJBs. The idea is that in a java application, the latter are objects to which you can apply OO methodology. But such EJBs are usually awkward to program, and poor performance has been reported in several development efforts.<br />An alternative to all this has been proposed. Java Data Objects. It defines an interface to which data can be made persistent. You access the data via the functionality of the interface. On the other side, responding to your queries, is a third party package that gives an instantiation of the interface. Vendors optimise their packages for various things, and they compete on this basis.<br />Roos explains the API from your standpoint. It really does seem simpler than entity EJBs, SQL and JDBC. His explanations and examples are clear. JDOs do look promising.<br />But there is no quantitative comparison between JDO and the alternatives. Undoubtedly a reflection of the newness. Roos quotes industry estimates that as much as 20% can be shaved off development time. Well, ok, that would be great if it is true. Be nice to have actual benchmarks. Plus also comparisons of runtime performance versus going the other route.<br />So if you find JDO intriguing, by all means try it. Be warned that this is cutting edge stuff. The vendor implementations are essentially first generation, compared to second generation or higher for (EJB, SQL, JDBC). There is no guarantee of reduced coding time or higher performance. Alternatively, you could wait for the second generation JDO, though if everyone does that, there will be nonesuch.l be nonesuch.	2002-11-29

But today we have a severe high tech slump, and technology has also moved on. The former has caused companies that are still hiring, and those that are picking programmers to retain, to require a broader skill set. One of these has been produced by the latter, XML. It really is shaping up that data serialisation is increasingly in XML format, if that data exists outside a database. So for professional reasons you should learn XML, if you are indeed any type of programmer. For example, Microsoft's .NET revolves around XML, and they don't use java. But it turns out that the coupling between java and XML is tight. The most advanced parsers for XML exist for java. In C++ and C#, the parsers are essentially one step/generation behind.<br />Given this, where do you turn to learn XML? An excellent choice is this book. A voluminous and eloquent exposition of the uses of XML. Harold covers the latest versions of the SAX and DOM parsers, explaining the relative merits. As a java programmer, you should find the idea behind SAX simple. It uses a callback, similar to that in GUIs. Simpler, in fact, because you can only have a single callback. SAX's biggest drawback is that it does not build a tree of the document. DOM addresses this. Harold explains the tradeoffs, and how you can decide which to use. Plus, he describes JDOM, which is DOM-like, but written expressly for java. You should find JDOM far more intuitive than DOM.<br />There is one place where I must differ with the author. He claims that this book is for the experienced java programmer who has already had some XML. I think he is being too conservative; he doesn't want to oversell this book to someone who will not benefit from it. I claim that if you are experienced, by which I mean you have a year or more in java, then you have the intellectual wherewithal to gain, even if you have never seen a stitch of XML.n, even if you have never seen a stitch of XML.	2002-11-22

If you are already using XML, it is probably with DTDs, as this was the first implementation of XML. Both came out of SGML, in which the role of DTDs was defined in the early 1990s. Unfortunately, the drawbacks of DTDs were not fully appreciated until they began to be widely used in XML. A DTD cannot easily constrain an integer variable to a range of values from 5 to 10, say. It has no conception of common primitive types like float or double found in many programming languages. Also, the structure of a DTD is quite unlike that of the XML document it supports. From the point of view of writing parsers, you end up effectively needing two parsing algorithms to read a DTD and an XML document. XML Schemas answer all these issues. Plus namespaces are built into them, to handle collisions in tag names when you use multiple Schemas in a document. With DTDs, namespaces came into being after DTDs were first defined, and had to be bolted on in a most awkward fashion. XML Schema notation for namespaces is much more natural.<br />The problem right now with XML Schema is that it is new. Most XML books use DTDs, in part because when they were written, the Schema specification was not finished by W3C (in May 2001). Some XML books since then do describe Schema. They usually give a good overview and provide examples that work for the XML document examples they describe. So if you have an application that you want to write a Schema for, you can get started. But chances are, you soon run into problems if your application is not a carbon copy of a text's example. You soon need some Schema component or attribute whose usage or even existence was not disclosed in that book.<br />This book addresses that shortfall. It provides at least one example of how to use every attribute of EVERY Schema element. A formidably comprehensive task. Which accounts for the near thousand page size. But this is far more than just some dictionary-style exposition. They describe important closely related issues, like how to use the DOM and Xerces SAX parsers, and the different outlooks these take. Also, from your viewpoint of how to write a Schema for YOUR application, they offer a top-down approach. Schemas can be result-oriented or data-oriented. You get enough details to help decide which case yours fits. This can greatly aid developing a facile &quot;natural&quot; Schema. One where once you have it and an example XML document that uses it, the layout taxonomy seems axiomatic. Which should be your goal. It is not enough to define a Schema that can hold all the information you have. The skill is in making a Schema that does that and has a clear, obvious logic. Because in many cases others, probably not as technically adept as you, get to fill in documents based on it. So the logic should be clear to them. Even if they do not directly write into an XML document, but build it from a GUI, the clearer the Schema, the easier it is for someone to build a GUI to populate a document based on it.<br />The authors also provide a website (XMLSchemaReference.com) that has the code described in the book, and many more examples.

The front end is a set of http servers that invoke Java application servers to run servlets and JSPs. The servlets read and write, maybe via Enterprise Java Beans, to a relational database. The website might be financial (like eTrade), or a portal (like Yahoo), or an information site (like google), or a B2C commerce site (like Amazon) or a C2C (like eBay). You want to measure and improve key metrics like response time, throughput and caching. Security may also be important, but for efficiency, you only want to encrypt the minimum possible. You also probably have a firewall or two; in the latter case, you have a DMZ. And in this case, you often put the http servers inside the DMZ and the application servers and database behind the DMZ. Plus, you anticipate and hope for (and dread) heavy usage. So you also have a caching proxy server and router in the DMZ, where the router will load balance incoming requests to the http servers. So you have many different pieces of hardware and software, usually from multiple vendors. The database could be from Oracle or IBM or Sybase. The application servers could be IBM's Websphere or BEA's Weblogic or the freeware from jBoss. Perhaps the http servers are Apache freeware.<br />The key business logic may be written in java and running on the application servers. There are tons of books on java. But how to test and optimise the entire system? Do you have to hire expensive consultants? Maybe not. Try first looking at this book. Written in fact by 3 IBM consultants.<br />You might be thinking, \\"Is this some going to be some smarmy sales pitch?\\" Where the take home message is buy only IBM and you will achieve nirvana?<br />The book does not unfold that way. The authors describe the various problems at a vendor neutral level. The examples (and screen captures) are drawn from several vendors. The writing is clear and rises above being buried in the minutae of specific code. The book is for both the programmer and the systems administrator. This is not really a programming book per se. Rather, it deals with test and design strategies for optimising those abovementioned metrics. Emphasis is placed on quantifying results and on incremental ramp up, where you install hardware and software in stages, measuring at each stage so that you isolate the effect of just that stage. Key issues like network bandwidth, network traffic analysis and vertical and horizontal scaling are the purview of sysadmins. If you are a sysadmin who knows some java, but that's not really your cup of tea, and are confronted with these issues, try this book.<br />IBM, through its alphaworks division and Websphere, has one of the largest development efforts in java.

It has four parts, but the first two are the bulk of the book. Part 1 lists each java package. Within a package, it tells of each class and interface and provides examples of how to do often needed tasks. You already need to know java to fully take advantage of this. Part 2 is an alphabetical listing of all classes, from all packages. For each class you can see its ancestors and all members of the class, with calling arguments and return values.  Part 3 has miscellaneous topics; most usefully the difference between java 1.3 and 1.4 (the latest), as in the title. Part 4 is basically an index, being a cross reference of classes and interfaces.<br />The sweep of the book is comprehensive and up to date. But of limited use.

As a practical matter, these systems are often mobile, and hence wireless. Think perhaps of the increasingly powerful and ubiquitous cellphones, PDAs and laptops. Less familiar to the public, but even more pervasive, are products using embedded microprocessors like cars and home appliances. Typically, most distributed systems have less memory and power than conventional computers, and their network connections may be intermittent. Developing applications to run under these conditions is tough, and Jini tries to make it practical. But in the last two years the pace of Jini development seems to have slowed. A rival open source approach, JXTA, has quickly grown and captured a lot of mindshare amongst developers. Its proponents say that it is far easier to learn and use. Naturally, Jini enthusiasts strongly disagree.<br />But for the sake of argument, suppose Jini is indeed more difficult to program. Then if you are Sun, it makes sense to develop useful utilities on top of Jini that simplify coding. JavaSpaces, for example. Which is the subject of this book. It is a Jini service (=utility) that can be easily used by other devices on the network. A JavaSpace holds data that can be read and altered in a transactional context. This means that if the set of operations in a transaction fails, it can be rolled back; a fundamental necessity in a distributed system, where things can fail in many ways. As the authors clearly demonstrate, you need know little Jini to understand and use JavaSpaces. The interface is very clean, having essentially only three operations: &quot;write&quot; - to put something into the space; &quot;read&quot; - to read an item from the space into your device; &quot;take&quot; - to read the item into your device and remove it from the space.<br />The book is short and succinct. The code examples are easy to grasp, without being simplistic. If you have been thinking about using Jini, or perhaps you already are using it, but are stymied, then try this book. In a day's reading, you can get its essence. A low risk investment of your time.<br />Suppose though that you are a JXTA programmer. Or maybe you are using some other third way to develop distributed applications. There is probably no analog of JavaSpaces in your environment. Consider investing a day of your time in this book.

Took long enough, eh? From their standpoint, this greatly simplifies their development, instead of having to maintain two huge codebases. But sysadmins will still have problems. Always! So this book arose out of a website run by the author, windows2000faq.com. The website is tremendously successful, garnering over a million hits a month, and widely recognised, including by Microsoft, as having authoritative answers. The latter is crucial. If you are going to be doing delicate and perhaps irrevocable things to your computer, you want some reassurance that the suggestions you are following are credible. (Which is why some sysadmins prefer only manuals from the manufacturer.)<br />The book instantiates over 1000 tasks faced by sysadmins of MS Windows 2000 and XP. These are tasks of all levels of complexity.<br />The book has three great virtues. First, of course, is its comprehensiveness. The sheer sweep of the tasks is staggering, from the trivial &quot;What is the history of NT?&quot; to the &quot;How do I perform an unattended installation?&quot; (slacker) to the &quot;How do I recover a lost Administrator password?&quot; (naughty naughty). Naturally, you will never need to ask the latter!<br />The second virtue is that you have random access to the tasks. Wait a minute, you might say. &quot;Of course I have random access. I can turn to any page I want. It's a book, isn't it?&quot; Yes. But it is not a textbook. You do not need to read the earlier pages to understand a task. Crucial if you need an emergency fix NOW.<br />Its final virtue is the contents pages. The tasks are grouped into 38 chapters, for that number of broad topic clusters. Within each, the tasks are listed as questions. How do I do such-and-such? Gets to the point. You can quickly find your fix.<br />Part of the reason for the heft of this 1275 page book is that the author has been generous in providing screen captures of appropriate windows. Not, I hasten to add, merely to beef up the book. If you have done any sysadmin duties, you will know the value of a good screen capture of what you should be seeing or doing.<br />The toughest question about this book is &quot;Why buy it?&quot; It is derived from the author's website. So why can't you just go there? Of course you can. But what if your computer won't reboot, and no nearby computer has net access? What if your crashed computer was the gateway? (You're in deep doo-doo now.) Or maybe you only have one computer (it's your one and only home computer). Even a tyro sysadmin soon learns that it is good to have hardcopy manuals within reach.

A deep, definitive coverage of the theoretical basis of computer science. In fact, to the extent that computer science is a science, you should refer to these books, if you are ever in doubt. As a measure of how well regarded these are, Knuth mentions in his home page that American Scientist magazine ranked this amongst the top 12 scientific monographs of the twentieth century, alongside books by Einstein, Dirac, Pauling and Feynman.<br />Much of computer programming and usage today builds upon the algorithms described in the books. What does it mean to have a &quot;good&quot; random number generator? What are quantitative tests for randomness? How can you efficiently sort a list? How do you find the greatest common factor of two (large) positive integers?<br />It is true that the typical computer programmer does not know most of the material in the books. This is because she usually can access subroutines that come with the language or are in standard libraries that implement the core algorithms. For example, in Java, there is a routine called Collections.sort(), which you call with the name of a list in the brackets, and the routine will sort it.<br />But within the field of computer programming, sometimes you may be called upon to implement those core algorithms. So what do you do? Turn here for help.<br />The books are also graced with a vital attribute. Each section of a chapter has a set of questions. Typically these are tough; they can keep you busy indeed. Plus, Knuth supplies the answers. The combination is a great learning experience. So often have I wondered at textbooks that don't supply questions. Students need hands on experience.	2002-10-28

David Drake furnished the outline, which was laid flesh by Steve Stirling.<br />The books are superbly written, with a plausible, complicated neo-feudal world. You can feel the dust in the air and the sweat on the skin as General Raj's soldiers trudge to battle; and thence the stench of gunpowder and voided bowels as the casualties mounted in battle.<br />Sometimes, between battles, there are jarring scenes as people who transgress an autocrat's law are enslaved, along with their entire families. While the level of technology is roughly Civil War America, imagine instead an America where you did not have to be Negro to be a slave, and there was no restriction on a ruler's power. Where the Universal Declaration of the Rights of Man is unknown. The society is closer to that of Imperial Rome. No coincidence. The hero, Raj, is modelled on Belisarius, the Byzantine general.<br />There are lighter moments. The state religion is a worship of Computers (explicitly capitalised), based on a fragmented recollection of their power, prior to the nuclear war that brought down the earlier civilisation. Priests can be female. Fierce theological disputes arise over different interpretations of surviving computer manuals. Which were probably untelligible to begin with, anyway. Those of you who have read Byzantine history can see echoes of the nitpicking arguments that split early Christianity; arguments utterly meaningless to those outside a narrow frame of reference.<br />Oh, speaking of Christians, here they are like Jews; an unloved minority. But there are plenty of Muslims. In fact, they are the other Great Power on Bellevue. The series revolves around the two Powers confronting each other, to decide the fate of the planet.<br />Before you read this series, I urge that you do a quick scan of Belisarius in a good dictionary. You will get more from the series this way.<br />The biggest problem about this series is that it is hard to find in its entirety in a bookstore. You may have to scrounge in used bookstores. It doesn't appear to have been reprinted recently.ge that you do a quick scan of Belisarius in a good dictionary.

An oft recurring theme in science fiction is that of aliens kidnapping or recruiting humans to act as their slaves or mercenaries. Several well received stories spring to mind. \\"Janissaries\\" by Jerry Pournelle, which depicted contemporary American mercenaries, spawned two sequels. \\"The High Crusade\\" by Poul Anderson showed English knights in the Middle Ages ready to march on Jerusalem. Instead aliens abduct them. \\"Ranks of Bronze\\" by David Drake was a short story of a Roman legion sold to aliens to fight endless wars against enemies of comparable (non-)technology. This book is an authorised sequel to the latter. Think of it as an alternative starting scenario for \\"The High Crusade\\".<br />The book ends with the English knights overthrowing their masters and setting up a pocket empire that is ready to confront the aliens in a Galactic War!! As others have noted, the end of this book is slightly at askance. Weber is positioning probably many sequels. He has just released \\"War of Honor\\" (2002), which is clearly the start of a new Honor Harrington series. (See my review on that for more details.) Plus he also published \\"The Shiva Option\\" which ends that series. He has built up an expertise in writing interplanetary battle scenes, and in doing so has attracted a devoted fan base. From a marketing standpoint, he is reinforcing success by introducing different but related brands, like Coke and Diet Coke. Also, if he experiences a temporary writer's block in one series, he can switch to the other, to maintain productivity.<br />--------------------------------------------------------<br />Here is an aside, and something that does not seem to have been noted by others. The stories mentioned above about humans being kidnapped or recruited have all had humans as the heroes. Are there any where the humans are bad blokes? Not as far as I know. But if you relax the restriction that they be human, then you get Kzin! Yes, that's right. The Man-Kzin wars by Larry Niven. The Kzin were pretechnological tribals who overthrew and enslaved their spacefaring masters.

Unlike many books written by Westerners about Asia, where the protagonist is European or American, and Asia and its peoples are merely a passive or negative backdrop to the plot, this book gives a sympathetic and nuanced portrayal of Asian characters. From the downtrodden ex-South Vietnamese soldier eking a precarious living in Saigon to a Communist colonel and his family, we see well drawn people, moving to their own beliefs and constrained by their own circumstances. Far indeed from a Rambo-type novel, that has come to characterise so much of American writings on Vietnam after 1975.<br />The book is fascinating for its descriptions of Saigon after the war. Its descriptions of the sheer poverty and harassment endured by the ex-South Vietnamese soldiers, and the entire society of postwar Vietnam were vivid. Perhaps it is the presumed accuracy of these outlines that gives some explanation of why many (over a million) fled Vietnam after 1975, risking their lives in leaky, overcrowded boats to reach anyplace else. Certainly, at that time, the Western media said the refugees were fleeing persecution. But there was little elaboration on this. But this work of fiction gives flesh to what was happened. Yes, this is a work of fiction. So too was \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\", and that galvanised the antislavery movement in the US before the Civil War.<br />This novel is set in today's time, circa 2001-2. More the pity that an equivalently well-written novel was not done soon after 1975, to perhaps, like Harriet Beecher Stowe's book, explain what the losers suffered. Though I suspect that a war weary American public may never have made such a book a bestseller.<br />On a lighter note, the book describes Western Australia as a more backward part of Australia. I'm from WA, and I found that hilarious! Like we're a bunch of bare-arsed Abos living in humpies.	2002-10-25
1365770:US	38491967	R3A5M1T83A0W9D	0201770040	767098005	XML and Java¿: Developing Web Applications (2nd Edition)	Books	5	8	8	N	N	A Clear Exposition on Building Applications on top of XML	[This is a review of the second edition.]<br />It was with some trepidation that I opened this book. It has 9 authors. Sometimes this many can mean that the style varies widely between chapters, and that there may be little logical continuity. Glad am I to say that this book appears seamless. Thanks probably in part to good editorial management by the publisher.<br />This is an advanced treatment of XML. It presupposes that you are already familiar with java and XML. The emphasis is on developing higher level applications that use XML as message medium.<br />As a consequence of 8 of the authors being Japanese, they stress that for internationalisation, XML is a good choice for the medium. It was designed from the ground up to handle Unicode. This is needed to describe Chinese and Japanese, which, out of the major languages, are the hardest to deal with, because of the large number of symbols. You should design your applications to maximise outreach to as large a user base as possible. Native English speakers tend to live in a happy technological cocoon, because leading edge stuff mostly appears first in English speaking countries. It is easy when programming to inadvertantly build into your code restrictions to ascii or extended ascii. Then it becomes much harder larger to remove those. Whereas if you choose XML (andjava), you get internationalisation right out of the box.<br />The discussion of DOM (Document Object Model) and SAX parsers is very nice. Especially in showing how to add SAX filters, and in quantitative estimates of runtime and memory usage of the two approaches. They make the point that XML processors are the result of intensive intellectual work, and that hence you should use these, instead of writing your own. More reliable, and you can concentrate on higher level issues.<br />For more advanced XML uses, XML Schemas are described, largely supplanting DTDs, since they allow the easy handling of datatypes (like String and integer) and namespaces.<br />They give succinct examples of how to connect XML messages to databases via Enterprise Java Beans. In doing so, Java Server Pages and servlets are explained. Very logical progression. Then the Web Services Description Language is introduced, along with showing how to use it with UDDI. Security via XML Digital Signatures and Certificate Authorities is then implemented.<br />The logic flow is very clear. Plus the accompanying CD with the full example code is a great convenience for learning.They give succinct examples of how to connect XML messages to databases via Enterprise Java Beans.

He throws in a fascinating amalgam of 19th century Britain and India. Along the way, you get to learn a bunch of Indian words and, at least I did, salivate over the food descriptions.<br />The basic premise is that of a comet almost destroying the world, via many years of dust being thrown into the upper atmosphere, and inducing harsh winters. Plus of course the massive tidal waves from the comet's impact. He draws on recent scientific work on mass extinctions of the dinosaurs, and the nuclear winter hypothesis that arose in the last years of the Cold<br />War.<br />Patriotic American readers may not be thrilled by Stirling's scenario. What is left of the United States is populated by howling savages. And the British Raj lays nominal claim to North America. Though it barely bothers to enforce it, so irrelevant is the region. As if the American Revolution never happened. Europeans may not feel any better. There are cannibals on the Rhine, and what is left of French culture huddles along North Africa. The British Empire has decamped to India, with the aristocrats merging into the Indian upper castes. The bad fellas are cannibalistic Russians, worshipping the demon god Chernobog. This is the only unfortunate aspect of the novel. The evil doers are totally cardboard.<br />The crux of the actions happen in Afghanistan and the North-West Frontier of our Pakistan. The battle scenes are written with Stirling's usual flair in such matters. Plus, of course, his signature description of the rural landscape. Those of you who have read his General or Nantucket series will recognise this.<br />He has clearly positioned this as the start of a new series, given the amount of careful research he has done. Comparable, perhaps, to that which he put into the Bronze Age for the Nantucket series. We have much to look forward to.	2002-10-23

Well, nano tech is still promising; which one could interpret as it never hitting the levels of hype that the dot coms reached. This book gives a nice peep into the vagaries of fund raising for a nano tech startup. (Indeed, of any startup.) The frantic search for an angel investor; the gimlet eye on the burn rate; the negotiating over (percentage) points of equity that the angel can get for his money; anxiety over bad publicity queering a deal...<br />Connolly keeps the pace flowing. The protagonist is the chief scientist and founder of a startup, who find himself implacably manipulated by an unknown puppet master who seems to anticipate his reactions at every turn. Beatings, shootings, computer breakins, naked chicks. Gosh. An old fashioned whodunnit, updated for early 21st century Los Angeles.<br />I suggest this to you. Read this book. But while doing so, squint a little. Strip out the high tech references. Then see the beautiful murdered woman, the sleazy, live hooker, the vicious thugs, the confused, clever hero. All by the sun-drenched beaches and boulevards of Los Angeles. Can you find echoes of Raymond Chandler and the whole LA Noir scene?	2002-10-22

Very up to date. The author gives a clear summary of the history of XML and where the various portions stand. He is to be commended for having a colour diagram on the inside cover, summarising the many specifications that are part of XML or associated with it, like XPath, XLink, JDOM, JAXP, DOM. Affiliated with this is a large pull out colour chart, that gives the time line and status of the components. The book is near exhaustive in its description of these components. You would do well to constantly refer to these two diagrams.<br />Pin the chart above your computer!<br />This may sound trivial to some. But when you are digging your way through a detailed set of examples in the book, it really helps to have a schematic overview to place things in perspective. All the more so if you happen to be new to many of the topics. Even experienced users can benefit.<br />The book has a CD with full listings of the examples. A great time saver. Also, since the author did not provide problem sets, you can easily make up your own, based on the CD. For example, suppose you are looking at Chapter 8, &quot;Parsing with the DOM&quot;. Take an example document and its DTD from the CD. Change the DTD to add more elements and attributes. Make some of these mandatory. Run the parser on the document and the DTD. You should get errors, as expected, because the document is missing some new required items. Understand the error messages. Then correct the document by adding instances of those items. Rerun the parser. Any errors? If not, then try adding more to the DTD and document. This will really help you learn. You can quickly build up documents of some nontrivial complexity.<br />Of course, you can, and should, do analogous things with the other chapters.<br />In terms of the reader's background (I'm talking to you): You can come from either a formal programming environment, or from a publishing/designer background. In both cases, you should already be well familiar with HTML. This is not a formal prerequisite, but a lot of things in the book really do come easier if you know HTML. The programming examples in the book are usually in java, but the author emphasises that XML is not a procedural programming language like java. Rather, it is a declarative language, where you make templates. In this sense, XML is closer to HTML than to java or C.<br />This book is worth your attention.should already be well familiar with HTML.

Ancient Rome has attracted its share of modern writers, speculating about its nemeses. And of these, none came closer to destroying Rome than Carthage. (With the exception of Rome's ultimate collapse in the 5th century to the Huns.) In the first and second Punic Wars, Rome was locked in a death dance with Carthage, whose greatest leader, Hannibal is remembered to this day. Several years ago, Poul Anderson wrote a novelette, &#34;Delenda Est&#34;, invoking time travelling terrorists who use ray guns to put Carthage victorious. The result is an Earth utterly unlike ours.<br /><br />John Maddox Roberts chooses a different tack. Through the vagaries of the second Punic War, Hannibal crushes the Romans and forces them to migrate north. Hannibal's victory is not implausible. That war was a close run thing, to those who have read of it.<br />All this is the prelude to the novel, set a century later. The Romans have conquered in central Europe, and are pushing back into Italy, thirsting for revenge. Some of you science fiction readers may notice the resemblance thus far to S M Stirling's &#34;The Chosen&#34;. In that, a warlike people get defeated and forced into exile. But generations later, they have rearmed and are back for a rematch.<br /><br />The contrasts are interesting. Stirling's Chosen are the bad fellows (proto-Draka), while Roberts' Romans are our heroes. The Chosen and the Romans have a better military, and chalk up many successes. But somehow this novel plods. Technically each section of a chapter is ok. But something is missing. The Carthaginians seem more foolish than bad. The Romans effortlessly outthink and outfight their opponents, who are not actually Carthaginians in this novel, but Egyptians. The protagonists are almost cartoonish cardboards. Very little nuancing here.<br />Clearly, a sequel is planned. Perhaps it will be more compelling.	2002-10-17

A tome indeed.<br />Most of you have probably have read all of the preceding nine books. Here, the Star Kingdom has defeated the People's Republic of Haven and has spent five years negotiating, though not finalising, an uneasy peace. Haven has undergone another revolution and is now a wobbly, democratic Republic of Haven. All the surviving protagonists in the last novel are back, which will please many readers.<br />Qualitatively, this book is really the start of another series. If you think of it this way, several things make sense, like its length, and the criticisms of other reviewers. I suggest you take a time out here from reading my scribblings and peruse the other reviews, if you haven't already done so.<br />Several reviewers have panned this novel, saying that there is little action and way too much verbiage. I don't disagree. If it is space opera, there is essentially only one significant fleet action here. But look a little deeper at what Weber has done. In the early books, the Peeps were the out-and-out bad guys. No ambiguity here! And Manticore had several ratbags amongst its politicians and officers. But as the series went on, we saw several decent Peeps. Not so black and white any more. The nineth novel ends with the good Peeps successfully overthrowing their government. Along the way, the Andermani empire was increasingly mentioned. Weber was positioning it as a possible future plot complication.<br />Do you know what I found strange about the tenth novel? The top leaders amongst the Haveners (they are not Peeps anymore) are all decent chaps. A couple of lower ranking creeps, but not more so than in Manticore. Weber is writing a subtler game. It is also harder to write. He is setting the stage for future novels of greater ambiguity. This in part, I think, accounts for some of the book's length.<br />Don't forget the Andermani. A large portion of the book is set in the Silesian Confederacy, which sits between the Star Kingdom and the Andermani Empire. The Andermani are clearly modelled on Bismarck's Germany, a militaristic expansionist regime. Anyone reading this book might sense future trouble between them and the Star Kingdom. Clearly, Weber is hedging his bets. So he is fleshing out the terrain. He probably does not know how the future novels will turn, but he is keeping his options open. In part because a straightout rematch between the Star Kingdom and Haven might simply look too repetitive to readers. And there's even a hint that the Terran-based worlds may take an active part in future conflicts.<br />This is why I claim that this book is really the start of a new series. Compare it to the previous books for logical consistency. But it opens new arenas. Could be very interesting indeed!<br />So yes, I do agree with those reviewers who say that this book is long, with little action, and is not the best of the ten books. But I say to you: Dig deeper and see WHY this is, and what it implies for the future novels.esian Confederacy, which sits between the Star Kingdom and the Andermani Empire.

Since Tim Berners-Lee wrote of the Semantic Web<br />several years ago, there has been speculation about<br />how we might embed meaning within Web pages, as<br />opposed to merely displaying content. To answer this,<br />XML offers the separation of content from display.<br />From its user definable tags, different user<br />communities can define their own sets of tags and<br />associate meaning with those. XML offers the<br />infrastructure. But it is still fairly low level.<br />Assembler language, as it were, compared to more<br />powerful languages like C or Java.<br />So if XML is like an assembler, what is the analog of<br />C? This book puts forward XTM, XML Topic Maps, as the<br />answer. It consists of 17 chapters by different<br />authors, outlining various aspects of XTM. The<br />chapters can be divided into two types.<br />One type has nitty gritty explanations, replete with<br />examples of XTM written in XML. If you are a<br />programmer, these chapters are for you. There are web<br />sites listed with XTM definitions that you can<br />incorporate into your XTM, just like using standard<br />namespaces available on the web in normal XML.<br />The other chapters deal with the much deeper and<br />harder problem of how XTM may be used for Knowledge<br />Organisation  and Knowledge Representation. They are<br />high level and abstruse,  edging up to the issues of<br />semiotics and artificial intelligence.<br />As a side note: In the XTM examples and<br />implementations given, I was surprised to see no<br />mention of altavista's graphical representation of<br />search results, circa 1998. This was not in XTM, but<br />it conveyed the flavour. What happened was that if you<br />searched for, say, 'tornado', the results would appear<br />as a graph. The nodes would be the main keywords in<br />the documents containing 'tornado'. Nodes would be<br />connected to each other if documents contained both<br />those words.

There is just you and a friend.  Well you have problems. For one, a Roman legion has several thousand soldiers; many more than you have bullets. And in close quarters, like a town, you are vulnerable to enemy arrows and spears. Having a rifle does not make you invulnerable.<br />There have been great, classic science fiction stories written starting with such a premise. For example, \\"Janissaries\\" by Jerry Pournelle, the Lord Kalvan stories by H Beam Piper, and the Nantucket trilogy by S M Stirling. In all of these, the protagonists soon realise that they must start producing firearms for their allies. And in doing so, they must start with the simplest firearms. In fact, they must recap the Industrial Revolution.<br />This book by Podrug does not address these issues at all. Two Muslim terrorists flee back in time to the time of Christ, intent on overthrowing Roman rule, for their own aims. Their characters are cardboard - the stereotypical Muslim terrorists. Though I grant that to many American readers, that might indeed be plausible. But as far as practical implications of what they are attempting - the book says nothing.<br />The depictions of the Roman rulers and their puppets is right out of 'I Claudius'. Perhaps the author wanted to impress us with his erudition. Or maybe he was just being slack, and took his historical backdrop straight from Robert Graves' work.	2002-10-10

Typically, those wars have been against other humans. In this book the opponents are a horselike race from distant stars, in a massive armada, facing a mostly demilitarised humanity, that sprawls across many light years. Some branches of mankind have kept up their martial traditions. The humans desperately train infantry and build up virtually from scratch a navy.<br />The scenes in the book of the boot camp for infantry would be familiar to readers of military fiction, and not necessarily science fiction. (Think Full Metal Jacket, for example.) Dalmas adds nothing new here, but the character depictions are competently done. But much of the book is spent in boot camp. The actual infantry battle scenes are relatively late in the book.<br />What I found lacking were the space battles. ... the descriptions of the battles were flat, ... The book feels as though it was originally meant to be several volumes, given the slow plot development throughout most of it.<br />Skip this book, unless you are a diehard fan of Dalmas.	2002-10-08

Suppose you have XML data that you want to regularly<br />send to Bob, across the Internet. But it is of a<br />confidential nature, so you don't want to send it as<br />plaintext. Well, you can try using low level<br />encryptions, like SSL or TLS. But these don't give any<br />authentication, ie. Bob can't tell that you actually<br />sent them. Also, once Bob gets the messages, they are<br />all in plaintext, so he can't easily protect these<br />against others, if he is on a multiuser computer.<br />One answer is to incorporate encryption into XML, by<br />defining cryptographic standards that sit atop XML,<br />and generate XML documents with encrypted data. These<br />let you and Bob use powerful XML-based routines like<br />XPath, XLink and XPointer. Plus, you can now do things<br />like append your digital signature to your plaintext<br />file, encrypt the combination with Bob's public key,<br />and get a resultant XML document that you can send<br />Bob. Upon receipt, he can decrypt it and verify that<br />you are the author, all the while dealing with XML<br />documents.<br />This book explains the emerging XML standards that<br />make this possible. They discuss at a high level the<br />various cryptographic algorithms, like AES [Advanced<br />Encryption Standard], Diffie-Hellman and MD5. Little<br />mathematics is needed, as they leave the mechanics of<br />the algorithms to other books. Instead, they describe<br />the XML infrastructure that uses these.<br />The book has a necessarily comprehensive description<br />of canonicalisation; which refers to the rewriting of<br />an XML document in a standard form, prior to<br />encryption. Otherwise two semantically identical<br />documents would give different ciphertexts, which is<br />confusing.<br />If you have been wondering if you should encrypt your<br />XML documents, and how to do so, this book may clarify<br />many issues.	2002-10-06

You saw how intuitive it was that links were visible on a web page, and how easy it was to click on a link and be taken anyplace else on the web. The great acceptance of the web and its browsers was due in no small part to the ease of use, and the ease of writing HTML pages.<br />Then after a few years, some deficiencies became apparent. HTML does not separate content from presentation. To do so, XML arose, with its user definable tags.<br />But XML, by itself, does not take the concept of linking beyond a link being a one way connection between a single source and a single destination. Yet the concept of hyperlinks is much broader and older than the web's instantiation, having been worked on in the 1960s by Nelson and Englebart.<br />This book expounds on how hyperlinks generalise the links in HTML. You can have multiple sources and multiple destinations. The links can be bidirectional. Given a destination, you can find the documents with sources that link to it. Currently, with web pages, you have to use a search engine to see who links to your pages. And no search engine reaches over 50% of the web.<br />The book describes the concept of a linkbase: a database of links. It can be stored separately from the underlying documents that it references. This lets you annotate a document without changing it! Imagine the possibilities. The document could be on a CDROM, or on someone else's website.<br />The implementation of these concepts is through XLink, XPath and XPointer. The authors use Backus-Naur Formalism to describe the grammar and they illustrate it with examples. My only quibble is that perhaps they could have written problem sets, for  newcomers to cut their teeth on.<br />If you want to see a possible future direction of the Semantic Web, have a gander at this book.	2002-10-04

For those of you interested in a lucid summary of the principles of networking. Tanenbaum summarises well the concepts behind the Internet Protocol, and the various stacks/layers. This is an easy book to shed some light onto topical buzzwords like CDMA, CSMA, TCP/IP, 802.11b (WiFi), 802.15, 3G, WAP, broadband wireless, i-mode...<br />He gives enough details that can be understood by a reader with the equivalent of a sophomore level in science or engineering. The amount of maths needed is minimal. Some calculus and Fourier analysis and simple probability theory.<br />Each chapter has an extensive problem set. My only quibble is that perhaps the problems could have been harder. A lot are simple plug-into-equation types.	2002-10-01

Do you want to go<br />beyond building neat GUIs for applets or desktop<br />applications? Java has two great strengths. It was<br />built with graphical objects (widgets) being an<br />inherent part of the language. This is an immense<br />strategic advantage over earlier text-based languages<br />like C and C++. For graphics, those needed special<br />graphics libraries that were not part of the original<br />languages, and which varied from vendor to vendor and<br />between operating systems. The ease of use of Java<br />widgets led to its rapid gain of programmers'<br />mindshare. Indeed, if you look at a row of Java books<br />in a bookstore, you will see most packed with<br />attractive diagrams of cool graphics.<br />But there is a second great advantage of Java. It was<br />designed with Internet awareness from its inception. C<br />and C++, due to their earlier vintage, have to use<br />libraries that vary with the operating system. Java<br />gives you a consistent interface to network<br />programming, independent of the operating system. It<br />is to this exposition that this book from Addison-Wesley<br />is devoted. Written by two Queenslanders, it assumes<br />that you already know the rudiments of Java. This is not<br />a book for tyros. If you want to write a network client<br />(for example, a specialised mail reader), or a multiplayer<br />online game, or a software agent that trolls the Internet,<br />then this book can be very useful.<br />It describes how to use TCP sockets, UDP datagrams,<br />multithreading, HTTP and other topics. It expands on<br />CGI for building applets. For client-server<br />applications, it devotes entire chapters to servlets<br />and RMI (Remote Method Invocation). If you need to use<br />CORBA, maybe because you have some legacy code that<br />you want to write a Java program to interact with,<br />then you will find a chapter expounding on it.<br />If you have already been programming Java GUIs, then<br />this book will expose you to a more abstract class<br />of problems. There is no visual feedback from widget<br />layouts here. What feedback you get is from text-based<br />output. What you have to design against are problems<br />based on data flow across a network.<br />The authors have written clearly, and the code<br />examples are well done, illustrating simply the<br />desired concepts, without tangling you in the details.<br />The only slight critique I have is that there is no<br />comparative assessment of the network capabilities of<br />Java vis-a-vis C#/.NET. The latter pair is an even<br />newer language/programming environment that also has<br />networking built in. But this may be unfair and<br />straying from the book's scope. C# and .NET have just<br />been released by Microsoft, and it is not certain if<br />they will gain much traction. But if they do, you will<br />undoubtedly see many books arguing the relative<br />merits.ct class <BR>of problems. There is no visual feedback from widget <br />layouts here.

1566774:US	38491967	R1WGLVCIPMV2AQ	0201784726	415594750	Java¿ Message Service API Tutorial and Reference: Messaging for the J2EE¿ Platform	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Network Computing Using JMS	A lucid and authoritative description of Java Message<br />Service, from Sun Microsystems, which developed and<br />owns it. JMS is designed for an environment of<br />distributed computers, where applications need to<br />communicate with each other and databases across the<br />network. You can think of JMS as one of the enablers<br />of Sun's longtime slogan &quot;The Network IS The<br />Computer&quot;.<br />JMS is loosely coupled distributed networking, where<br />the sender and receiver do not have to be running at<br />the same time. Plus they do not need to know each<br />other's methods, quite unlike RMI [a tightly coupled<br />technology]. This makes for potentially much greater<br />flexibility in network computing.<br />The book emphasises this, with detailed examples of<br />source code showing how to use JMS with Enterprise<br />Java Beans, another technology invented by Sun. You<br />can see how to hook JMS to a session bean or an entity<br />bean, and how to combine JMS with several Message<br />Driven Beans. The text is clearly written, with<br />attention paid to how you can run the examples under<br />Microsoft Windows or Unix.<br />The book also suggests two sequels. It describes using JMS with J2EE, the Java Enterprise Edition, which is the full Java environment. But in a world of PDAs, cell phones and other mobile gadgets, what would be interesting is a description of JMS running under a slimmed down Java environment, like kvm, and how this would scale with the number of devices. A second sequel might be a comparison of JMS with JXTA, another Sun technology for mobile computing. Who know? Perhaps Sun is already working on this!<br />If you are programming in a distributed computing<br />environment, consider using JMS as an enabling<br />technology, and this book as its indispensible guide.	2002-04-25
