5796:US	50761804	RJDM1OAKE7QRW	0399149104	87876541	Rain Fall	Books	4	14	31	N	N	Been a Spy, Done Japan, This is a Great Tax Write Off	I've been a spy, out from under cover for a long time, and I would not normally have touched this, but my spouse suggested it on a rainy afternoon, and I have to give it four stars because it held my attention and I finished it.<br /><br />On balance, I would put this between a 3 and a 4, but I gave it a four for coherence.  Still, this author is not John Le Carre at his best (George Smiley series).<br /><br />What I found most interesting, as I read through the book and found connections with both my past and with Japan, was the manner in which the author appears to have found a formula for connecting what he has done in his own past, what he has read about, and what he is presumably writing off on his taxes--comprehensive travel.<br /><br />I put the book down, not disappointed--I certainly recommend this book to anyone who has not been a spy--but thinking to myself, WOW, this is what I can do when I retire--travel all over the world, write a spy novel with details about each place I visit, and presto, it is all a grand tax write-off.<br /><br />Professionally speaking the book is way too facile.  Planting an audio device is very very tough.  The need for line of sight from the transmitter to the receiver kills most applications.  Generally speaking, you have to listen for four hours to get five minutes worth of useful stuff.  Killer technologies certainly abound, but as CIA found when it tried to kill Castro with exploding cigars, infected dive suits, beard killers, and the bomb-dropping pigeons, generally technology is not the answer.<br /><br />3 for former spies, 5 for the general public, 4 on balance.  Absolutely recommended for a rainy afternoon.	2005-10-11
17949:US	50761804	R3LG7O5G4E2F36	1400061326	390460611	Imperial Grunts: The American Military on the Ground	Books	5	158	173	N	N	Admiring of Grunts, Deep Between the Lines Slam on Washington	Most important in this book is Kaplan's documentation of the fact that transformation of the U.S. military is NOT taking place--Washington is still enamored of multiple layers of rank heavy bureaucracy, the insertion of very large cumbersome task forces in to every clime and place; an over-emphasis on technology; and a lack of appreciation for the urgency of providing security, food, water, and electricity IMMEDIATELY so as to start the cycle of counter-insurgency information collection from volunteers.  The author is brutal in his indictment of the bureaucracy for failing to provide the linguistic skills, four years after 9/11, that are far more important to transformation than any weapons system.  He is also brutal on the delays in approving operations in the field that are associated with layered bureaucracies that come with joint task forces, and completely detrimental to fast moving tactical success at the A Team level.<br /><br />Key here is the conclusion that American power can only be exercised in a sustained way through discreet relationships at every level from neighborhood and village on up to provinces and tribes.  The emphasis here is on discreet, humanitarian, tangible goods and services including security.  When America introduces major forces, it spikes resistance and delays the achievement of its very objective.  What jumps out is the need to change how the US achieves its presence around the world.  The author recommends a change in the State Department model of embassies focused on countries--State tends to be co-opted country by country and loses sight--if it ever had it--of regional or tribal nuances.  The author also recommends a sustained peaceful presence at the provincial and village level around the world, through a combination of modern civil affairs and humanitarian assistance cadres and retired military given leave to choose a place they get to know and stay there to finish out their careers and then be \\"on tap\\" for retired reserve plus up.<br /><br />A third theme in this book, one that Ralph Peters also makes in \\"NEW GLORY,\\" is that a lot of these countries are NOT countries and should not be countries.  Many borders imposed by colonialism are simply lunatic when taking into account historical and geographic and related ethnic realities.  It *makes sense* to have regional summits that re-locate borders in a manner that respects historical, geographical and cultural realities, and to do so with a massive Berlin Airlift/Marshall Plan application of the benefits of peace.  Ceding southernmost Thailand and the insurgent southern part of the Philippines to Malaysia, and establishing an Indonesian-Malaysian Muslim Crescent, makes sense.  Similarly, in Africa and in the Middle East, there is good that could come of a deliberate recalculation of borders.<br /><br />A fourth theme, and I share his admiring view of Special Operations and the Marine Corps, is that of the separation of the military ethos of service and dedication to mission, from that of the Nation at large, where Tom Friedman in \\"The World is Flat\\" declares that we are suffering from a new generation that is, in a word, apathetic.  We need to return to universal service, with options for serving in the Peace Corps or the local constabulary at home.  America has lost its civic integrity.<br /><br />A fifth theme, one that corrected a misimpression I have shared, was of the rather special nature of the National Guard elements of the U.S. Special Forces and the Army civil affairs teams.  They come out in this book as being among the best of the best.<br /><br />Sixth, I found the author's field appreciation of citizen militia in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Philippines, and elsewhere to be quite illuminating.  Washington is wrong to rush the transition to a centralized Army in places where tribes and militia still hold sway and can be used to provide provincial stability.  We ignore the possibilities of unconventional indigenous forces at our peril.<br /><br />Seventh, as on page 230, the author highlight those occasions when our unconventional warriors point out that Toyotas are better than Humvees, commercial cell phones are better than military communications alternatives.  Across the book, a few good men and women with independent authority and cash resources to do instant compensation and instant aid authorization come across as vastly superior to Washington-style contracting and major joint force insertions.<br /><br />Eighth, throughout the book, force protection mania is killing us and gutting our counter-insurgency potential.  This comes out especially strongly in Colombia, where A Teams are forbidden to go tactical with the forces they are training, and are limited to training within safe encampments only.  Force protection is a modern variation of the Soldier's Load-we are so nuts about force protection and heavying up that we are shackling our troops and our small unit leaders and completely avoiding the military value of \\"fast and furious.\\"<br /><br />Ninth, national and military intelligence are not meeting needs of front-line grunts.  Bottom-up intelligence collection, including passive collection from observant civil affairs teams and foot patrols, is what is really working.  We appear to need a whole new concept of operations and a whole new doctrine for field intelligence, one that floods areas with non-official cover and overt personnel, one that puts analyst and translators heavy-up into the front lines.<br /><br />Sidenotes include great admiration for SOUTHCOM, accustomed as it is to getting along with the short end of the stick; and derision for PACOM, \\"twenty years behind the times, afraid of messy little wars and of a transparent humanitarian role for SF.\\"  The author regards the Global War on Terror (GWOT) as a convenient \\"set up\\" for a future war with China, not something I agree with but evidently a perception within the military that has specific outcomes from day to day.  Other side notes include a brutal indictment throughout of \\"Big Army\\" and also of the US Air Force which is obsessing on more super-bombers and unwilling to fund what really works well, long-haul transports, AC-130 gunships (Puff the Magic Dragon), and more air controllers in the field with the grunts.<br /><br />Super book!  NOTE:  I have the sense that some in the SF community have taken an intense dislike to Kaplan, and vote against the review as a way of voting against Kaplan.  Fair enough, but for what it's worth, the review is a good summary intended to be helpful to all in appreciating what I take to be some pretty useful themes.r highlight those occasions when our unconventional warriors point out that Toyotas are better than Humvees, commercial cell phones are better than military communications alternatives.

18829:US	50761804	R3EZSI7PWZY5FK	1589010698	553381600	Transforming U.S. Intelligence	Books	4	19	23	N	Y	"Must Read" Superb Collection, But Not Transformative	This is a valuable book and merits careful study by policymakers, practitioners, and students who may be future intelligence professionals.  The book is not, however, transformative, nor is it particularly innovative, and for that, I must with reluctance limit it to four stars, but with the caveat that it is a \\"must read.\\"<br /><br />Some of the best contributions are those of Jennifer Sims, and the deeper that I read into the works of others, the more I wished that she had had the time to make the entire book her own, casting a broader net for iconoclastic thinkers, foreign intelligence practitioners, non-governmental experts in open source intelligence, religious and labor experts on foreign threats from foreign religions, whose thoughts do not appear in this book.<br /><br />The book's major premise is that it was not the institutions that failed, but rather leadership--that all that is needed is a change in priorities, perspective, and methods.  This is typical of books written by those who, by their own admission, were \\"part of the problem.\\"<br /><br />The section on new requirements is more than adequate if one wishes to continue to focus on unilateral secret intelligence about major state threats but fails to acknowledge that we earned a D, at best, on everything else, to include terrorism, proliferation, environmental scarcity, ethnic conflict, and dictatorial corruption (our friends) as a long-term threat to our vision of participatory democracy and moral capitalism.  The requirements section suffers from a rather staid focus on states and \\"actor\\" threats, with little mention of history, geography, culture, religion, or demographics, all forces vastly more potent than your average failed state or single transnational group.<br /><br />The middle third of the book, on capabilities, is the strongest part of the book.  It opens with a chapter on open sources by Amy Sands that I would say is now the best available short summary of that discipline's potential.  I especially applaud the focus on the need for analysts (who are NOT under cover) to have professional networks that transcend borders and cultures, and to be comfortable with local as well as global information.  Where this important chapter falls short, however, is in failing to recognize that 90% of what we need to know from open sources will never be shared with U.S. \\"intelligence\\" and we therefore need an Open Source Agency under diplomatic sponsorship; and that we will never unilaterally collect and process all that we need to know, hence we need a global network of regional information-sharing centers, initially doing open sources, eventually doing all sources.  These latter two ideas are transformative, the chapter itself, while very solid, is not.<br /><br />Clandestine intelligence is well covered from a traditional perspective, but stops short by contenting itself with asking for more authority, tighter lanes in the road, and \\"staying the course.\\"  It does have gems of insight on both possibilities and obstacles, and is a good read.  It does not, however, make the transformative leap toward a much larger non-official cover cadre hired at mid-career; toward regional multinational clandestine stations with mature officers on rotation from other nations; toward a much larger career principal agent network; and toward the excellent idea of one recently retired ADDO, that of one-time \\"it's just business\\" contracts for specific operations.<br /><br />Digital dimension is very fine but could have benefited from a much stronger appreciation of what can be done in addressing the contributions that can be made now by man-machine translation networks with automated online dictionaries, and advanced geospatially-based analytics including predictive analysis.<br /><br />I have no quarrel with the substance of either the analysis or denial sections, other than to observe that they completely eschew multinational, multiagency analysis.<br /><br />The management sectionis strong in terms of understanding what insiders think the problems and solutions are, but for one who has read most books in this field, it is so deeply tied to the past and to past biases and perceptions as to forego any claim to being transformative.<br /><br />The section on homeland defense is well-meaning, but incorrect in its assertion that the FBI has done well with a good model for joint terrorism task forces (JTTF).  First off, the FBI remains a completely dysfunctional organization when it comes to either counterintelligence or sharing with state and local organizations.  Secondly, as more than one expert has noted, it is the height of ignorance, especially in the aftermath of Hurricane KATRINA and the imminent bird-flu pandemic, to obsess on terrorism as the sole area where national to state and local sharing will take place.  50% of the \\"dots\\" that will help prevent the next 9/11 are bottom up dots observed by citizens and cops on the beat, and those dots have no place to go.  We need 50 state intelligence centers and networks.<br /><br />Britt Snider is unique in America-one of two people, the other being Loch Johnson-who have served on both the Church Committee staff and the Aspin-Brown Commission staff.  He is one of America's foremost observers of national intelligence, and his chapter on Congressional oversight is one of the best pieces in the book.  Having said that, I would note that it lacks two transformative thoughts, both being explored at this time: first, the time has come for every Congressional committee to have its own Sub-Committee on Intelligence and Information Operations (I2O), and for the ranking members of those sub-committees to form a new Special Committee on I2O with concurrent jurisdiction over both secret and open source information expenditures and capabilities across the entire U.S. Government; secondly, and enabled by this new committee, it is  time for a new form of hybrid agency, an Open Source Agency that integrates the Library of Congress and is equally responsive to Congress, the Governors, and the Executive as well as the public, with its Director appointed for life, as are Supreme Court justices, and a fixed percentage of the disposable budget (1%) for complete independence from the White  House.<br /><br />\\"Must read,\\" but not transformative.r />The management section is strong in terms of understanding what insiders think the problems and solutions are, but for one who has read most books in this field, it is so deeply tied to the past and to past biases and perceptions as to forego any claim to being transformative.   <br /> <br />The section on homeland defense is well-meaning, but incorrect in its assertion that the FBI has done well with a good model for joint terrorism task forces (JTTF).

27131:US	50761804	R3CBTO9JJS4KE9	1594200297	499059352	Democracy Matters: Winning the Fight Against Imperialism	Books	5	22	36	N	Y	Nobel Prize Material--Extraordinarily Thoughtful and Articulate	I found this gem in the Tampa Airport bookstore and bought it for the title, not realizing that the author was the world-class professor that Larry Summers disrespected.<br /><br />This is, easily, Nobel Prize material.  The reflections of Professor West are extraordinary, and they are well-presented with a wealth of both names and carefully selected quotations from the works of others that make this book both a tour of the horizon, and a bright shining light on the topic of democracy and how to save the American democracy.<br /><br />As I absorbed this superb material over the course of flying from Tampa to DC and into the evening, I felt that on the one hand, Professor West was truly gifted at singling out and embracing the best literary, religious, and musical talents, and that I was receiving, in the course of a single book, a course on thoughts of others that mattered to democracy.  My other thought, once reminded of his dust-up with Larry Summers, was how extraordinarily courteous this author is, in identifying the very destructive tendencies of extremist Christianity, extremist Judaism, and extremist Islam.  This is a man who is both innovative and polite.<br /><br />A few notes from the margins of this heavily under-lined and annotated work....<br /><br />1)  There is marvelous deliberate aliteration throughout the book, with many pages having the resonance of poetry.  This is gifted articulation and reflection, hand-crafted communication of the highest order.  \\"Superb artistry of words\\" is my note on page 27.<br /><br />2)  Professor West is absolute correct to highlight the fact that America is built on genocide against the Native Americans, and slavery of the Africans, and remains in denial of these core realities.  Then fast forward to America's support of 44 dictators, its virtual colonialism, its immoral capitalism, it schism between rich and all others--I am reminded by Professor West of Nelson Mandela, and write in the margins: America needs two \\"Truth and Reconciliation Commissions\\"--one for what we have done to our own Native Americans, Americans of African descent, and to the working poor, another for what we have done to the rest of the world.<br /><br />3)  Thoughout this book run the themes of prophetic or embracive Christianity, love versus materialism, nurturing versus imperialism.  Most interesting to me is the consistency of thought between Professor West and that icon of the leadership literature, Margarent Wheatley.  Both understand the extraordinary importance of dialog and openness and the need to share information and perspective, in sharp contrast to the ideologues in the White House that call General Anthony Zinni a traitor for questioning the false facts that led us into an unjust and prohibitively expensive war in Iraq.  Dialog, not force, is the way to spread democracy.<br /><br />4)  On page 104 I have the annotation \\"THIS IS THE MESSAGE!\\" and \\"WOW!!!!  If Karen Hughes wants to succeed as Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy, she has only to read this book and memorize page 104.  Professor West is stunningly brilliant in both his assessment of America's vulnerabilities from its inherent hipocrasy, and in his evaluation of the faith-based democratic message that has real possibilties in the Middle East and elsewhere.  Page 137 is also essential to Karen Hughes--Professor West is incisive in understanding that Western democracy has no chance in the Islamic world; that we must undermine the repressive autocratic clerics; and that we must help Islam modernize on its own terms--Islamic democracy will not look like Western democracy, but it can be democratic.<br /><br />5)  The author is just down-right superb in evaluating the Jewish condition, and the insanities of America's wasteful and counter-productive generosity toward extremist Jews who receive  33% of all our foreign aid, $500 per Israeli (against 10 cents a year for Africans).  He is brilliantly coherent when he suggests that weshould continue to spend these sums in the Middle East (Egypt gets 20% of our foreign aid) but put our money on the side of indigenous democratic movements, not the autocratic extremists on both the Arab and Israeli fronts.<br /><br />6)  Professor West gently slams Salman Rushdie and V. S. Naipaul while introducing the reader to the wealth of insight and passion in the literature from the African Islamic world.<br /><br />7)  The entire book, in its brilliance, coherence, and insightfulness, is a spanking of Larry Summers, one of Harvard's least qualified Presidents, but on page 189 ff the author addresses Summers directly, and his account of the encounters has the ring of truth.  Tenured at Yale and Princeton as well as Harvard, with more publications to his credit than most of his peers, one puts down the book with appreciation for the author's condemnation of the sell-out of universities to greed and corporate grants, and one can easily choose to respect the author over his antagonist.<br /><br />There are numerous other books I have reviewed here at Amazon that bear witness to Professor West's thoughtful and balanced critique of American imperialism and the loss of our democratic ideals here at home.  Princeton is fortunate to have this great mind return to its busom, and one can only pity Harvard for violating its motto and allowing a white supremacist (who does not respect women either) to eviscerate their prophetic Christian and Black Studies faculty.<br /><br />This is an absolutely grand piece of reflection, ably presented, with enormous respect for the views of others and very delicate manners in the discourse of disagreement.  Very few books have aroused in me a passion such as this one has--Bonhoffer would say it is the passon of the black Church.  I would say that this one man truly represents all that could \\"be\\" in the American democratic tradition.  He merits our affectionate respect, embodiying as he does the thought that struck me early on in the book: life as religion, religion as life.  In God We Trust, and damnation to those lawyers that seek to remove God from our Republic's identity.  One can separate the church from the state, but one cannot separate religious faith from the foundation of democracy--it is as water is to cement, an essential ingredient for a lasting construct.ets 20% of our foreign aid) but put our money on the side of indigenous democratic movements, not the autocratic extremists on both the Arab and Israeli fronts.    6)  Professor West gently slams Salman Rushdie and V.

28618:US	50761804	R1W7QH2S12BHG7	0786867825	113402600	Burn Before Reading: Presidents, CIA Directors, and Secret Intelligence	Books	4	39	52	N	N	Useful to Congress, a President, or a Future DCI	This is a useful retrospective by Admiral Stansfield Turner, Director of Central Intelligence under President Jimmy Carter, but it is most useful if you are a Member of Congress, a sitting or future President, or perhaps being considered as a future DCI.  For the general public, and even for intelligence professionals, this is an interesting personal recollection and evaluation that reflects a limited appreciation for the broader literature on intelligence reform and is less likely to be exciting to those seeking to understand the minutia of intelligence.<br /><br />It could be very useful to the public under one condition or rather one hope: that the public react to this book as I did, to wit, the author may not have intended this, but his superb tour of the relations between Presidents and Directors of Central (or in today's terms, National) Intelligence has persuaded me that our national intelligence community must be removed from the Executive Branch.  We need a new hybrid national intelligence community in which the Director is simultaneously responsive to the President, to Governors, to Congress, and to the public.  It's budget must be set as a fraction of the total disposable budget of the federal government, on the order of 1%.  This agency must be completely impervious to Executive or Congressional abuse, and must act as a national objective source of truth upon which to discuss policy and acqusition and liaison options.  A national board of overseers could be comprised of former Presidents, former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and former Leaders of the House and Senate, as well as selected representatives of the public.  Intelligence is now too important to be subject to the whims of politics.  Intelligence is the revolutionary source of wealth as well as conflict resolution, and this author has made it clear that most Presidents simply cannot be trusted to either manage it or listen to it with wisdom.  I would go so far as to suggest that national science and education also require a similar form of hybrid oversight and management.  This is not to say that each Executive agency should not have its own intelligence and information operations (I2O) capabilities and functions, only that intelligence and science, like justice, need a court of last resort that cannot be undermined by ideology and personality.<br /><br />This suggestion is probably too radical, BUT there is one opening for a first step: the DNI should recommend to the President and to Congress that the new planned Open Source Agency integrate the Library of Congress and be the first new hybrid organization, with the Director appointed for life, as are Supreme Court Justices.<br /><br />The author has done an excellent job, albeit with some obvious gaps and a few errors, in focusing on the relationships between Presidents and Directors of Central Intelligence.  However, the book suffers from the author's understandable but incorrect assumption that national intelligence should remain focused on secrets by, of, and for the President.  In fact, not only is most intelligence today from open sources of information, but finished intelligence is a small fraction of Information Operations (IO), that larger matrix of all operational, logistics, geospatial, and other information (including information from non-governmental organizations, universities, and corporations as well as religions and labor unions), and thus the author's perspective and recommendations, while valuable, are relevant only to 10% of the challenge facing DNI John Negroponte and DDNI Mike Hayden.<br /><br />A few notes from the margins:<br /><br />The author's largely cursory review of past reform efforts completely ignores  the earnest efforts of Senator Boren and Congressman McCurdy with the National Security Act of 1992.  That Act was undone by Dick Cheney, then Secretary of Defense, and Senator John Warner, then ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.  The author doescorrectly note that all of the recommendations of the Aspin-Brown Commission, a device used by Senator Warner to delay and stop reform, have not yet been implemented.<br /><br />The author is incorrect when he credits Tenet with focusing on the operational side of the CIA, and for focusing on global coverage.  In fact, Tenet appointed a White House mess buddy to be DDO, James Pavitt screwed up for seven years, and then Tenet has the temerity to tell the 9-11 Commission that he needed seven more years to get it right.  Tenet also commissioned and then refused to follow the recommendations of a report called \\"The Challenge of Global Coverage,\\" where Keith Hall, then Director of the National Reconnaissance Agency, among others, told Tenet directly that with the secret world's obession on seven hard targets, it desperately needed an insurance policy on the order of $10M a year for each of 150 countries or topics including terrorism and disease.  Tenet is reported by one present to have said \\"we are in the business of secrets, speak no more of this report.\\"<br /><br />The author is politically correct but wrong to give the recent intelligence reform legislation a qualified \\"yes\\" when asking it makes us safer.  It does not.  The lead article in the Fall issue of the International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, by Michael Turner, is absolutely on target when it calls the legislation a loss for the American people and the widows and orphans of 9-11, and a victory for entrenched interests including Congressional pork rolling in Virginia.<br /><br />The author is completely correct to suggest that \\"CIA\\" is an acronym ready for retirement.  As I suggested in my first book, ON INTELLIGENCE (with a Foreword by Senator David Boren), CIA needs to be come the National Analysis Agency, and be stripped of its S&T and clandestine functions.  [NSA needs to become the National Processing Agency--Washington is operating on 2% of the relevant information, and most of it is not online.]<br /><br />There are two important recurring themes across the book that the author is extraordinarily qualified to address.  The first is the long-term political, social, economic, and cultural costs of \\"covert actions\\" including assassinations, coups, and other nefarious interventions in foreign affairs.  The second is the extremely negative impact on national intelligence of military ownership of three \\"national\\" agencies.  He points out that we missed the Indian nuclear developments in part because the Department of Defense was demanding that all the satellite capabilities be focused on Iraq, and through ownership, was able to enforce its demands and neglect national priorities.<br /><br />The author praises George Bush the First as a model President and director, and seems to hint that the son would do well to follow his father's active engagement.  The author is brutal about Casey, suggesting (to this reader) that not until Karl Rove has there been a more negative employment of government assets for political advantage.  The author is subtly critical of Henry Kissinger, calls Woolsey's tenure a lost opportunity to redirect CIA, and has many other insights that can only come from a DCI, about other DCIs.  Overall this is a good read for anyone who cares deeply about the health and nuances of U.S. intelligence.<br /><br />The book loses one star for gaps here and there.

The author is incorrect when he credits Tenet with focusing on the operational side of the CIA, and for focusing on global coverage.  In fact, Tenet appointed a White House mess buddy to be DDO, James Pavitt screwed up for seven years, and then Tenet has the temerity to tell the 9-11 Commission that he needed seven more years to get it right.  Tenet also commissioned and then refused to follow the recommendations of a report called \\"The Challenge of Global Coverage,\\" where Keith Hall, then Director of the National Reconnaissance Agency, among others, told Tenet directly that with the secret world's obession on seven hard targets, it desperately needed an insurance policy on the order of $10M a year for each of 150 countries or topics including terrorism and disease.  Tenet is reported by one present to have said \\"we are in the business of secrets, speak no more of this report.\\"    The author is politically correct but wrong to give the recent intelligence reform legislation a qualified \\"yes\\" when asking it makes us safer.  It does not.  The lead article in the Fall issue of the International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, by Michael Turner, is absolutely on target when it calls the legislation a loss for the American people and the widows and orphans of 9-11, and a victory for entrenched interests including Congressional pork rolling in Virginia.    The author is completely correct to suggest that \\"CIA\\" is an acronym ready for retirement.  As I suggested in my first book, ON INTELLIGENCE (with a Foreword by Senator David Boren), CIA needs to be come the National Analysis Agency, and be stripped of its S&T and clandestine functions.  [NSA needs to become the National Processing Agency--Washington is operating on 2% of the relevant information, and most of it is not online.]    There are two important recurring themes across the book that the author is extraordinarily qualified to address.  The first is the long-term political, social, economic, and cultural costs of \\"covert actions\\" including assassinations, coups, and other nefarious interventions in foreign affairs.  The second is the extremely negative impact on national intelligence of military ownership of three \\"national\\" agencies.  He points out that we missed the Indian nuclear developments in part because the Department of Defense was demanding that all the satellite capabilities be focused on Iraq, and through ownership, was able to enforce its demands and neglect national priorities.    The author praises George Bush the First as a model President and director, and seems to hint that the son would do well to follow his father's active engagement.  The author is brutal about Casey, suggesting (to this reader) that not until Karl Rove has there been a more negative employment of government assets for political advantage.  The author is subtly critical of Henry Kissinger, calls Woolsey's tenure a lost opportunity to redirect CIA, and has many other insights that can only come from a DCI, about other DCIs.  Overall this is a good read for anyone who cares deeply about the health and nuances of U.S. intelligence.    The book loses one star for gaps here and there.  The sources used are very limited--in the critical Viet-Nam era, for example, the author does not cite George Allen's \\"NONE SO BLIND,\\" and he does not mention at least 15 other retrospective books on intelligence that would have added substantially to his endeavor, which seeks to end with recommendations for the DNI and future reform legislation that remains needed.	2005-09-28

Ralph Peters has written about this in [[ASIN:B000EUKR7C New Glory : Expanding America's Global Supremacy]] but speaks mostly of legal treason--corruption and waste.

Originally a series of lectures, the author has developed some useful, and calmly articulated, thoughts on both why there is a disconnect between the \\"West\\" and \\"the Rest,\\" and why the West is on a downward spiral to oblivion in practical terms, with the triple whammy of declining birth rates (non-replenishment), increased longevity (generally among those who are not necessarily productive in their older years), and substantial apathy among the self-absorbed, self-righteous, and largely clueless teen-agers and 20-30 \\"me me me\\" generation.<br /><br />There are many books that I have reviewed here for Amazon that support this author's personal reflections, and his citations of those books that did stimulate him are more than adequate.  A few themes made by the author strike me as worthy of emphasis, for they provide a road-map for any Western society that wishes to survive into the 22nd century:<br /><br />1)  Morality matters.  It is a historical force.  Will and Ariel Durant emphasized this in their \\"Lessons of History,\\" and many strategic confrontations have borne out the point.  Tribes and nations that become amoral ultimately decline and fall.<br /><br />2)  Western myopia cannot be understated.  The ignorance of the West regarding global realities and the relationship between Western behavior (inclusive of US support for 44 dictators, immoral and predatory capitalism, virtual colonialism, and the general view of others that the West is \\"barbaric\\" in sexual and other matters of fidelity and integrity) and how others view is simply unrealistic.<br /><br />3)  The West fails to understand that the rest of the world, where faith and integrity and loyalty to the family and tribe are often all that keeps the entire society from disintegrating in the face of more primitive environments that we ourselves experience, wants to be modern but not Western--modern with cultural cohesion, not modern with the commoditization of the individual, which both the author of Lionel Tiger (\\"The Manufacture of Evil\\") credit with destroying family, community, tribe, and nation.<br /><br />4)  The author excels at discussion how Western individuals today have lost the context of history, the reverence for tradition, the utility of specified morality.  Westerners are \\"out of touch\\" with the lessons of history, out of touch with the implications of our selfish decisions in the present that have implications for the future generations.<br /><br />5)  The author discusses competing concepts of legitimacy, and here he goes into nuances all too often lacking in \\"objective\\" Western analysis of competing social models.  He sees the value of personal versus impersonal authority in the context of societies where bureaucracy is not yet developed and kinship remains the foundation for trust.<br /><br />6)  The author, educated at Oxford, would agree with Philip Alcott, brilliant Cambridge scholar and author of \\"Health of Nations,\\" in dismissing most nations as false constructs inconsistent with their tribal and religious networks and beliefs.  This is as true of the \\"Nine Nations of North America\\" (Joel Garreau) as it is of most of Africa, where colonialism heritage is that of inevitable genocide.<br /><br />The author concludes, as one would expect of a Christian moralist, that \\"Nothing less than a massive cultural reversal is necessary.  We need to rejoin the rest of the human race.\\"  He focuses on the renewed relevance of religious and moral vision, and here he would find common cause with David Johnson, distinguished author of books on \\"Faith-Based Diplomacy\\" and the vital role of religion in fostering reasoned dialog between West and East.<br /><br />Apart from restoring the role of morality within our over-all culture, the author concludes that we must become informed--like it or not, our lives are bound up with those of everyone else all over the world.  Here he is in tight agreement with both President David Boren (former Senator) of the University of Oklahoma, and David Gergen, advisor to multiple Presidents of the United States (most of whom did not listen too well).  We must internationalize and modernize our educational system, restore the importance of history and international studies, and give life to the finding of E. O. Wilson from \\"Consilience,\\" to wit, that the sciences demand the humanities if they are to be in the service of humanity.<br /><br />This is a most thoughtful book, reverent in its arguments, one that reminds us all of the value that can be had from listening to or reading the careful reflections of a man of the cloth, born in Wales, educated in England, and now speaking to all of us.n tight agreement with both President David Boren (former Senator) of the University of Oklahoma, and David Gergen, advisor to multiple Presidents of the United States (most of whom did not listen too well).

Instead of the current didactic form of instruction (one-way lectures) we should be teaching, at every level, interactive discovery.  It's not what you can remember from the past, but what what you can discover in tandem with others, and apply constructively!<br /><br />EDIT of 12 Dec 07: Lots has happened since I reviewed this book, and it was a delight to discover that this long buried insight actually found itself manifested in the new non-profit, the Earth Intelligence Network, whose 24 co-founders recognize that we need an EarthGame where we all play ourselves, and that to save the planet, we must educate the five billion poor \\"one cell call (or conversation) at a time,\\" something we can do by giving out free cell phones and recruiting 100 million volunteers with Internet access who among them cover the 183 languages we do not speak--that will create infinite wealth (see books at bottom of this review).<br /><br />As someone who has been trained to be dysfunctional, overly reliant on \\"command and control\\" and predictability, I can certainly see how this book would cause discomfort and inspire disbelief among the mandarins of industry and government, but I can also see this book sensibly defines the only path likely to lead to collective intelligence and collective consensus solutions.<br /><br />Context, hospitable spaces, questions that matter, encouraging everyone's contribution, cross-pollination of diverse perspectives, listening for patterns, cultivating collective intelligence and insight through dialog instead of debate--this book has it all.<br /><br />My last annotation in the book is \\"Wiki!\\"  As smart people like Jock Gill and Howard Rheingold start to think about how to create a global Wiki that enables a World Cafe with a space for every topic, every challenge, every zip code, every neighborhood, I have a strong feeling that \\"bottom up people power\\" may at last be in the offing.<br /><br />Alvin and Heidi Toffler are publishing a new book in April called [[ASIN:038552207X Revolutionary Wealth: How it will be created and how it will change our lives]]  Knowing their past work, I suspect it will be an epic statement that carries the work of Tom Stewart [[ASIN:0385500718 The Wealth of Knowledge: Intellectual Capital and the Twenty-first Century Organization]] and Barry Carter [[ASIN:075067184X Infinite Wealth: A New World of Collaboration and Abundance in the Knowledge Era]] to new heights, and that is where I will end this review: the world cafe is about creating wealth and peace through dialog.  Done right, there are no limits to our ability to engage one another in conversation, and no limits to the wealth that we might create, the peace we might foster, by so doing.<br /><br />EDIT of 12 Dec 07: two additional books have had a deep impact on me since this was first written:<br />[[ASIN:0131877291 The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty Through Profits (Wharton School Publishing Paperbacks)]]<br />[[ASIN:0300125771 The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom]]<br /><br />This book is very serious, very valuable.  It is worth reading and it is worth sharing with others.  It is part of our \\"Collective Intelligence\\" and leads straight to Peace Intelligence and Commercial Intellligence.

After reading \\"Leadership and the New Science\\" I have bought the rest of her books, and also those that she recommends by contributing a foreword.<br /><br />This book has a great deal of white space, lots of photos, is double-spaced, but by no means is it simplistic.  To play on the title, it is a \\"simpler way\\" to absorb the large deep ideas that are documented in \\"Leadership and the New Science.\\"  If her primary writing were a trilogy, this is the entry-level book, \\"Finding Our Way\\" is the intermediate volume, and \\"Leadership\\" is the graduate course.  However, I recommend they be read in reverse order, because the simpler books are more clearly appreciated if one has the deeper background.<br /><br />What I find most compelling about this book is the manner in which it captures core ideas from a wide variety of works that have been bubbling into human consciousness in the past 20 years.  The bibliography is quite good although by no means all-inclusive (missing Kurzweil, E. O. Wilson, and Stephen Wolfham, as well as Tom Atlee and Bill Moyers, among others).<br /><br />Among the core ideas in this book that are presented with elegance are the absurdity of thinking that life can have a boss--or that rigid ideas and identities will lead to anything other than rigid non-adjustable organizations.  The author stresses the value of diversity, passion, connectedness, humanity and humanness, and tieing it all together, the role of information and of ethics as facilitators for \\"being.\\"<br /><br />There is a very useful discussion of bacteria and the manner in which human attempts to impose machine and medical solutions are ultimately defeated by bacteria.  Although Howard Bloom's \\"Global Brain\\" is not in the bibliography, everything the authors discuss here is consistent with his concerns about bacteria winning the inter-species war with humanity.<br /><br />Taking this a step further, I would contrast this book, and the varied books on collective intelligence, wisdom of the crowd, ecological economics (Herman Daly) and so on, with a book I recently reviewed about the National Security Council, aptly titled \\"Running the World.\\"  The stupidity and arrogance of that title reveals all that we need to know about why U.S. foreign policy is failing, and how desperately we need to take the ideas from this book and apply them to how we manage ourselves and our relationships with other nations, other tribes, other religions, other communities.ied books on collective intelligence, wisdom of the crowd, ecological economics (Herman Daly) and so on, with a book I recently reviewed about the National Security Council, aptly titled \\"Running the World.\\"  The stupidity and arrogance of that title reveals all that we need to know about why U.S. foreign policy is failing, and how desperately we need to take the ideas from this book and apply them to how we manage ourselves and our relationships with other nations, other tribes, other religions, other communities.	2005-09-25

All four are exceptional in their detail, but somewhat dry.<br /><br />I was disappointed to see no mention of Kevin Kelly's [[ASIN:0201577933 Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization]] and just one tiny reference to Stewart Brand (co-evolution) in a note.  Howard Rheingold (virtual reality) and Tom Atlee (collective intelligence) go unmentioned.  It is almost as if Kurzweil, who is surely familiar with these \\"populist\\" works, has a disdain for those who evaluate the socio-cultural implications of technology, rather than only its technical merits.<br /><br />This is an important book, but it is by a nerd for nerds. [Sorry, but anyone who takes 250 vitamin supplements and has a schedule of both direct intravenous supplements and almost daily blood testing, is an obsessive nerd however worthy the cause.] It assumes that information technologies, growing exponentially, will solve world hunger, eliminate disease, replenish water, create renewable energy, and allow all of us to have the bodies we want, and to see and feel in our mates the bodies they want.  All of this is said somewhat blandly, without the socio-cultural exploration or global evaluation that is characteristic of other works by reporters on the technology, rather than the technologists themselves.<br /><br />The book is, in short, divorced from the humanities and the human condition, and devoid of any understanding of the pathos and pathology of immoral governments and corporations that will do anything they can to derail progress that is not profitable.  It addresses, but with cursory concern, most of the fears voiced by various critics about run-away machines and lethal technologies that self-replicate in toxic manners to the detriment of their human creators.<br /><br />The book is strongest in its detailed discussion of both computing power and draconian drops in needed energy for both computing and for manufacturing using new forms of computing.  The charts are fun and helpful.  The index is quite good.<br /><br />I put the book down, after a pleasant afternoon of study, with several feelings.<br /><br />First, that I should give Joel Garreau higher marks for making this interesting, and recommend that his book be bought at the same time as this one.<br /><br />Second, that there is an interesting schism between the Kurzweil-Gates gang that believes they can rule the world with machines; and the Atlee-Wheatley gang that believes that collective **human** intelligence, with machines playing a facilitating but not a dominant role, is the desired outcome.<br /><br />Third that there really are very promising technologies with considerable potential down the road, but that government is not being serious about stressing peaceful applications--the author is one of five advisors to the U.S. military on advanced technologies, and it distresses me that he supports a Defense Advanced Research Programs Agency (DARPA) that focuses on making war rather than peace--imagine if we applied the same resources to preventing war and creating wealth?<br /><br />Fourth, information technologies are indeed going to change the balance of power among nations, states, and neighborhoods--on balance, based on his explicit cautions, I predict a real estate collapse in the over-priced major cities of the US, and a phenomenal rise of high-technology villages in Costa Rica and elsewhere.<br /><br />The singularity may be near, as the author suggests, but between now and then tens of millions more will die.  Technology in isolation is not enough--absent broad ethical context, it remains primarily a vehicle for nerds to develop and corporations to exploit.

It was recommended to me by the author of [[ASIN:0071384715 Building a Knowledge-Driven Organization]] and I now recommend it to everyone I know. If there are two books that can \\"change the world,\\" these are the ones.<br /><br />Although the Chinese understood all this stuff centuries ago (Yin/Yang, space between the dots, the human web), the author is correct when she notes late in the book that the commoditization of the human worker (Cf. Lionel Tiger, [[ASIN:071452929X Manufacture of Evil: Ethics, Evolution, and the Industrial System]]) and the emphasis on scientific objectivity and scientific manager (Cf. Jean Ralston Saul, [[ASIN:0679748199 Voltaire's Bastards: The Dictatorship of Reason in the West]]) were perhaps the greatest error we might have made in terms of long-run progress. Coincidentally, as I finished the book, on the Discovery channel in the background they were discussing how the leveeing of the Mississippi blocked the Louisiana watershed from cleansing the Mississippi naturally, as it once used to.<br /><br />It's all about systems--the author does cite Donella Meadows' 1982 article in Stewart Brand's Co-Evolution Quarterly, but does not pay much heed to the large body of literature that thrived in the 1970's around the Club of Rome.<br /><br />There are perhaps three bottom lines in this book that I would recommend to any government leader who hopes to stabilize and reconstruct our world:<br /><br />1) Information is what defines who we are, what we can become, what we can perceive, what we are capable of achieving. Blocking or controlling information flows stunts our growth and virtually assures defeat if not death. It is the optimization of listening--being open to *all* information (and especially all the information the secret world now ignores)--that optimizes our ability to adjust, evolve, and grow.<br /><br />2) Command & control is history, block and wire diagrams are history. General Al Gray had it right in the 1990's when he talked about \\"commander's intent\\" as the baseline. Leaders today need to be disruptive, to look for dissonant views and news, and to empower all individuals at all levels with both information, and the authority to act on that information.<br /><br />3) Disorder is an *opportunity*. We have the power to define ourselves, our \\"opponents,\\" and our circumstances in ways that can either inspire protective, constricted, secretive, \\"armed\\" responses, or inclusive, open, sharing \\"pro-active\\" peaceful responses.<br /><br />EDIT of 12 Dec 07: Haver ordered and will be reviewing several books that highlight the importance of diversity as a foundation for innovation.<br /><br />The author is to be praised for noting early on in the book that \\"Ethical and moral questions are no longer fuzzy religious concepts but key elements in the relationship any organization has with colleagues, stakeholders, and communities.\\" I would extend that to note that social ethics and foreign policy ethics are the foundation for sustainable life on the planet, and we appear to be a long way from understanding that it is ethics, not guns, that will stabilize and fertilize...Cf Jonathan Schell, [[ASIN:0805044566 The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People]].<br /><br />It also merits comment that the author essentially kills the industry of forecasting, scenarios, modeling, and futures simulations. I agree with her view (and that of others) that early warning is achieved, not through the theft of secret plans and intentions or the forecasting of behavior, but rather by casting a very wide net, listening carefully to all that is openly available, sharing it very widely (as the LINUX guys say, put enough eyeballs on it, and no bug will be invisible), and then being open to changed relationships. Trying to maintain the status quo will simply not do.<br /><br />I give the author credit for carrying out an extraordinary survey of the literature on quantum mechanics, and for developing a PhD-level explanation of why old organization theory, based on the linear concepts of Newtonian physics, is bad for us, and how the new emergent organization theory, understood by too few, is let about the things and more about the relationships between and among the things.<br /><br />This is an elegant essay and a heroic personal work of discovery, interpretation, and integration. While I would have liked to see more credit given to Kuhn, Drucker, Garfield, Brand, Rheingold, and numerous others that I have reviewed here for Amazon, on balance, given the academic narrowness of her Harvard PhD, I think the author has performed at the Olympic level. This is a radical book, somewhat reminiscent of Charles Hampden-Turner's book, [[ASIN:0385084242 Radical Man: The Process of Psycho-Social Development.]] which as I recall was not accepted by Harvard as a thesis at the time. Perhaps Harvard is evolving (smile).<br /><br />For other key books that complement and precede this book, see my lists on information society, collective intelligence, business intelligence, and intelligence qua spies and secrecy in an open world.<br /><br />Read this book BEFORE you read her new collection of essays, [[ASIN:1576754057 Finding Our Way: Leadership for an Uncertain Time]]<br /><br />EDIT of 12 Dec 07: I must say, I am both astonished and disappointed that more of us have not found and absorbed this great work.  Margaret Wheatley, whom I have not met (but I have met Tom Atlee, Juanita Brown, and Robert Buckman) strikes me as the \\"Mother\\" of a new form of continuous global education and innovation.

Feelings must, as E. O. Wilson and others have documented so well, be fully factored into the whole of the human experience.<br /><br />This is the poetic humanist counterpart book, a series of essays from the past from before the author was recognized as one of the most brilliant leadership gurus in the English-language.  I certainly do recommend that her \\"serious\\" book, \\"Leadership and the New Science,\\" be read first, and then this one.<br /><br />The author has done a superb job of taking older essays and organizing them, putting them in context, to tell a new story.  This book of essays is a new book for having been re-created in the aftermath of the success of \\"Leadership and the New Science,\\" and I am choosing to give this book out to the audience of a gala leadership dinner in Washington, D.C., rather than the first book.<br /><br />The author stresses that the old story of organization is the \\"machine\\" model, where people control and domination are the management paradigm, and resistance to change is seen as obstinance rather than coherent humanist understanding of the badness of the imposed conditions.  The new story, by contrast, sees that everything is connected--as the author brilliantly puts it in her preface, \\"Independence is a political concept, not a biological concept.\\"<br /><br />She focuses on two fundamentals: the need for all mankind to be free to experiment, and in experimenting, create unlimited diversity; and the need to enhance and expand relationships with others as part of that diversity and sustainable mutually beneficial wealth creation.<br /><br />Translating that into meaning for organizational leaders, she stresses self-organization, listening, embracing all inputs, and striving to create self-identity, information-sharing, and relationships that in turn generate discovery, sharing, and fulfillment.<br /><br />This is not touchy-feely, this is common sense restored to the conversation of mankind.<br /><br />The other important theme in this book is the paradox of community, which sets the stage for her rather bleak conclusions about America facing an abyss.  She spends a lot of time examining how the web and nations are separating clusters of individuals, isolating groups, rather than nurturing a broadening of the communal ethos, what Paul Goodman understood so well in the 1980's as the need for \\"communitas\\" from neighborhood to globe.<br /><br />The author is one hundred per cent on the money when she says, in a notional conversation with America's teen-agers, \\"We haven't taught you well about honor, sustainability, community, or compassion.  We failed to show you how to be wise stewards of the earth, how to care for one another, how to resolve conflicts peacefully, how to enjoy others creativity as well as your own.  Yet miraculously, you are learning these things.\\"<br /><br />She concludes by lamenting America's litigous society, where everyone knows their rights, but few know how to be in a community (or fulfil their civic duties to include loyalty to the Nation and engagement in the democratic process).<br /><br />She tries to end the book on an uplifting note, speaking of the urgency of creating a web of hope, and of honoring those \\"few people who are not afraid to be insecure.\\"  She attributes most fear to the inherent tendency of organizations and nations to fight natural resistance to change with artificial fears of the unknown.  Instead of fearing the unknown, she suggests, we should embrace the new and find new paths, new hopes, new solutions by using our collective intelligence and our new-found global community.<br /><br />This is one of six booksthat I regard as a life-affirming, \\"must-read\\" collection for any person who aspires to contributing to a sustainable future for America, for any other nation, for any tribe, for any community, for any neighborhood.  If we fail to listen to Margaret Wheatley and embrace her human values--as E. O. Wilson does in \\"Consilience\\" where he explains in detail why science must have the humanities--then we are destined to lose to the bacteria that are winning the inter-species war.  We are our own worst enemy.  This author, and her two books, are a very powerful intellectual, moral, and spritual antidote to all that ails us.<br /><br />Five other books I recommend:<br />Robert Buckman, \\"Building a Knowledge-Driven Organization\\"<br />Clayton Christensen & Michael Raynor, \\"The Innovator's Solution\\"<br />Steve Denning's \\"The Springboard: How Storytelling Ignites Action in Knowledge-Era Organizations\\"<br />Don Maruska, How Great Decisions Get Made\\"<br />Margaret Wheatley, \\"Leadership and the New Science\\"contributing to a sustainable future for America, for any other nation, for any tribe, for any community, for any neighborhood.

It has just the right amount of text and white space, and its organization as well as its points are compelling.<br /><br />When the author itemizing the obstacles to cooperation and information sharing: battling egos, conflicting styles, lack of commitment and follow-though, office politics, knee-jerk actions, seemingly irreconciliable differences, an atmosphere of defeatism (or a culture of unfounded arrogance), and a legacy of distrust, he is talking about the $70 billion a year U.S. Intelligence Community that I am so familiar with, and he is probably also talking about the Department of Homeland Security, every local, state, and national organization associated with the catastrophic failure to cope with Hurricane Katrina, and just about any corporation or other organization out there.<br /><br />His ten easy steps merit listing here, not to rob the book of its punch, but to emphasize that each chapter on each of these steps is hugely sensible, implementable, and profitable: 1( enlist everyone including secretaries and maintenance folks; 2) discover shared hopes rather than differing problems; 3) uncover the real issues; 4) identify all options (in ignored foreign opinion, the US foregos most really implementable options); 5) gather the right information, and all of it; 6) get everything on the table; 7) write down choices; 8) map the solutions; 9) look ahead; and 10) stay charged up.<br /><br />These are NOT as simple as they sound, nor are they easily implementable without an understanding of the context and the methods that the author lays out in his coherent, concise, and comprehensible manner.<br /><br />His emphasis on full information, and exploring all the options (\\"look at the whole tree, not just the limb you are on\\" all resonate when one thinks about how badly the US has screwed up the so-called \\"Global War on Terror.\\"  First we cut taxes, gutted the Treasury, installed political cronies in key organizations that in turn drove out all the experts long ready for retirement; then we alienated all our allies, provided special tax deductions on gas guzzlers, and invaded Iraq under false pretenses.  Now we are creating more terrorists every day than we are able to kill in a year.<br /><br />For a specific sense of how pathetic our national-security decision making is, see my review of David J. Rothkopf's [[ASIN:B000MKYKWM Running The World: the Inside Story of the National Security Council and the Architects of American Power]]  In New Orleans we had a mayor that left town ahead of the crowd; a governor in denial; a head of FEMA with no clue; and a President on vacation not to be bothered.  Not a single one of these have any idea how to actually do reality-based decision-making, or even how to guide a sound inclusive non-ideological decision dialog (not a debate, which the author stresses over and over will destroy the ability to be open-minded).<br /><br />America is facing some very serious challenges at all levels, from family, neighborhood, and schoolhouse, to statehouse and White House.

The pretentiousness and unreality of \\"Running the World\\" is fittingly complemented by a cover photo of a Cabinet meeting, not an NSC meeting-the latter take place in crummy little rooms with poor ventilation, not at all the kind of image one wants as an Emperor, naked or not.<br /><br />There are three consistent and very useful themes throughout the book that make it extraordinarily valuable to any student of the pathologies of the national security \\"decision\\" process (I use that term *very* loosely).<br /><br />First, that each Administration allows personal ambitions and an almost pathological desire for \\"differentiation\\" from the previous Administration to first destroy and then slowly rebuilt the NSC.  Hence, it is dysfunctional much of the time, regardless of the ideology prevailing at the time.<br /><br />The second prevailing theme, one that Amy Zegart captured so well in her seminal scholarly work, \\"Flawed by Design,\\" is the perpetual dysfunctionality, a constant dysfunctionality, between the Departments of State and Defense, and between Defense and the loosely managed U.S. Intelligence Community.  The bottom line is that personalities and politics, not intelligence nor wisdom, are the prevailing drivers of U.S. national security.<br /><br />Lastly, the irrelevance of secret intelligence to the White House decision process, regardless of what Administration is in power, is documented.  Page 361 is an especially good indictment of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in particular, and with specific reference to its complete incompetence at economic intelligence needed by the Department of the Treasury.  In general, intelligence in this book is portrayed, accurately, as either irrelevant or a pawn to the politically-driven preferences of the White House.<br /><br />This is not a scholarly work, but merits great credit for the many interviews.  Over-all the author has leveraged close access to a large variety of U.S.players over time, while not engaging the other players, including foreign players, private sector players, and non-governmental players.  The book, even with its focus only on US players would have benefited from an annex charting and comparing the approaches of various NSC iterations to various issues and topics, to include number of action officers, number of meetings, and number of decision papers, but that kind of hard work does not appear to have been part of the plan.  There is also little mention of the role lobbying and blatant corruption play in making foreign and security policy--for example, there is no mention of how the White House and the U.S. Senate, from 1974-1979, knew full well that Peak Oil (the end of cheap oil) had arrived, but in what may well be the most treasonous and retrospectively impeachable offence against the public interest, both the White House and the Senators decided to \\"live the dream\\" and waste 25 years during which we could have achieved energy independence and sanity.<br /><br />The book, by virtue of its focus on primary research, does not address the substantive literature on global issues, nor the scholarly and practical literature on the NSC.  Morton Halperin's seminal work on \\"Bureaucratic Politics and Foreign Policy\\" and other works on the NSC such as those edited by Dr. Loch Johnson, the foremost academic observer of secrecy and policy, are essential complements to this author's offering.<br /><br />The book whitewashes Tony Lake, whose incapacity as an advisor merits note.  Most of what the author puts forward about Lake is contradicted by other accounts including those of Dick Clarke, who says he could not get Lake's support until the time came for the latter to leave government and write a book.  Naturally there are different points of view.<br /><br />The book is a hatchet job on the Reagan era, even catty in its tone, but the author avoids appearing to be a sycophant to Bush II in that he very properly documents the grotesque dysfunctionality of the Bush II team (and the extraordinary competence of Vice President Cheney in getting his way as co-President).  The author has done a good job of leading up to a severe indictment of the Bush II national security decision process, and excels at showing how Condi Rice was \\"run over\\" and side-lined by Cheney, Rumsfeld, and the neo-conservatives.  His documentation on Cheney as a de facto prime minister is quite good, and these few pages are alone worth the price of the book.  Pages 428-429 are \\"hot\\" and make it clear that the Bush II Administration, where Cheney was given the terrorism mandate in passing (something not widely known to the public), chose to emphasize invading Iraq, national missile defense, and energy sweetheart deals over counter-terrorism during the critical three months leading to 9-11.<br /><br />There are a few disconcerting errors or failures in the book.  In lambasting Reagan for invading Grenada, he says that 8,612 medals were handed out.  Had he troubled to check with the military, he might have learned the difference between medals and campaign ribbons.  He seriously over-sells both Burger and Lake while ignoring the blatant manner in which the Clinton Administration, and Madeline Albright in particular, sought to down-play terrorism to the point of suppressing alarmist reporting and ignoring or side-lining Dick Clarke.  He claims, on page 387, that the Clinton Administration \\"foiled plots against trans-Pacific jumbo jet traffic.\\"  Not so fast.  The terrorist blew himself up in the Philippines prior to executing the plot, which was completely undetected by U.S. intelligence, and it was that error that revealed the plot when Philippine authorities responded to the resulting fire.  On page 457 he makes the observation that the Congress has less turnover than the Soviet politburo.  This should have been credited to Peggy Noonan and Ronald Reagan, who used it in an address to a joint session of Congress.  He ends the book wisely, saying, \\"The ultimate check is an educated American public,\\" which thought tallies nicely with Thomas Jefferson, who said \\"A Nation's best defense is an educated citizenry.\\"<br /><br />This is a book that needed to be written.  It documents the pathetic manner in which U.S. national security is in the hands of a small group of people that place loyalty to one another above intelligence, wisdom, and strategic thinking.  We all suffer.  It is a primary reference for all who would wish to understand why the greatest Nation on the planet has such a pathetic lack of strategic culture, vision, process, and outcome.<br /><br />The Exective, and the Congress, and Broken.

The bottom line is as the author ends the book: [Our enemy] prepares its privates to loosely follow orders, outwit enemy technology, and take on many times their number.  In contrast, the American military prepares its privates to strictly follow orders, master their own technology, and seek a 3 to 1 advantage.\\"<br /><br />In combination with Jonathan Schell's book \\"Unconquerable World,\\" and other books about the larger losses of moral status and legitimate alliances that American has suffered since 9-11, this book, at a grass-roots \\"down in the gutter\\" level, is daunting, troubling, provocative, and deeply critical.<br /><br />It has been updated to address the current situation in Iraq, where foreign fighters and indigenous insurgents are slowly grinding down the U.S. occupying forces, while the improvised explosive device and suicidal terrorism techniques of Hezbollah spread rapidly to other countries.<br /><br />Sad to say, but this book is also a manual for how easily our homeland infrastructure, nuclear and chemical plants, and other key notes, will be penetrated and taken down by a handfull of skilled individuals, most of whom need not die in the endeavor.  \\"The Tiger's Way\\" is at once an indictment of U.S. military infantry training, and a handbook for just how vulnerable we are across every county in America.<br /><br />The author is in many ways a complement to Ralph Peters, our own Lawrence of Arabia.  The two together offer all that we need to know to transform our military and reassert our morality.<br /><br />See for the larger context:<br />[[ASIN:0316164968 The Fifty-Year Wound: How America's Cold War Victory Has Shaped Our World]]<br />[[ASIN:0805077979 The Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire Project)]]<br />[[ASIN:0742532550 Breaking the Real Axis of Evil: How to Oust the World's Last Dictators by 2025]]<br />[[ASIN:1400052688 Sleeping with the Devil: How Washington Sold Our Soul for Saudi Crude]]<br />[[ASIN:B0000C4JBT Wilson's Ghost: Reducing the Risk of Conflict, Killing, and Catastrophe in the 21st Century]]<br />[[ASIN:1590512383 Web of Deceit: The History of Western Complicity in Iraq, from Churchill to Kennedy to George W.

93780:US	50761804	R13QVQ7A6LEZWX	1595230114	189014283	New Glory: Expanding America's Global Supremacy	Books	5	70	80	N	N	Devastating on Middle East and Europe, Uncritical of US	Ralph Peters is more compelling than Tom Friedman, goes deeper than Robert Kaplan, runs the numbers as well as Clyde Prestowitz, and runs as many risks as Robert Young Pelton.  All of these men are among the best and the brightest of our generation.  Ralph Peters is first among these equals.<br /><br />New Glory is most devastating in its professional appreciation of the crash of Islamic civilization and the hollowness of Europe, with Germany and France coming in for special scorn.  While Peters is acutely sensitive to the mistakes that France and Germany have made with immigration--allowing millions to immigrate without enfranchising them or assuring their loyalty as citizens--he tends to overlook the same faults in the US and the UK, and this is my only criticism: patriot that he is, he tends to downplay US errors and misbehavior.  Having said that, I would also say there is no finer observer of reality outside the US than Ralph Peters.<br /><br />Like his earlier book, Beyond Terror, Peters again excels with gifted turns of phrase that sound like pure poetry.  Peters is not just a grand strategist equal to the likes of Scowcroft or Brzezinski (while less diplomatic than they), he is a gifted orator and his book reads as if one were in the Greek Senate listening to Socrates hold forth.<br /><br />Especially strong in this book is the author's focus on Africa and Latin America as area rich with potential that the Americans are ignoring.  Instead of obsessing on assassinating Chavez, as moronic an idea as there ever was, we should be focusing on how to include Africa and Latin America in our free trade zone, along with India and Japan.<br /><br />Peters jumps into the intellectual stratosphere when he takes on the issue of bad borders, the cancerous heritage of colonialism.  I would recommend that the book by Philip Allott, \\"Health of Nations,\\" and also the book by Jed Babbin, \\"Inside the Asylum\\" (on the UN) be read along with this book.  I would add Mark Palmer's book on \\"The Real Axis of Evil\\" as well, about the 44 dictators we support.  Taken together, perhaps adding Joe Nye's book on \\"Understanding International Conflicts\\" to have a really fine grasp of current challenges.<br /><br />Peters, author of a novel about treasonous defense contractors, comes out in the open with his sharp criticism of the military-industrial complex, pointing out that they are among the worst enemies of our national defense.  Their corruption, legalized by a Congress all too eager to take its standard 2.5% to 5% \\"cut\\" on delivered pork, diverts tens of billions of dollars from education, infrastructure, border control, public health, and other sources of national power.  When added to light-weight decision-making at the very top, where we go to war and waste thousands of lives and over $187 billion dollars on a war that was both unnecessary and pathologically in favor of Iranian ambitions against Iraq, one can quickly see that General Eisenhower and General  Smedley Butler (\\"war is a Racket\\") were both correct--we are our own worst enemy.  Peters concludes his real-world damnation of contractors by summing up the many problems that occurred in Iraq when contractors failed to deliver to US troops the ammunition, food, and water, as they were contracted to do.  I myself heard of units that lost 30 to 40 pounds per man after months on a diet of water and *one* Meal Ready to Eat (MRE) per day.<br /><br />Peters draws his book to a close with compelling thoughts down two distinct lines.  First, he clearly favors a policy of carefully identifying and then killing those who will not heed any other means of peaceful coexistence.  As with the author of \\"Civilization and It's Enemies,\\" he reminds us that liberty comes at the price of regular shedding of blood.  It is not free.<br /><br />Peters' second line is the most interesting to me.  He is scathingly on target when he labels US intelligence professionals to be uniformly timid and bureaucratic in nature, part of the problem, not part of the solution.  He goes on to dissect how we fail to listen to foreign cultures, and fail to understand what is in the minds of the very people we are trying to reach.  Finally, he concludes that education, not guns, are the heart of power.  Consistent with the findings of the Defense Science Board in their reports on \\"Strategic Communication\\" (July 2004) and \\"Transition to and From Hostilities\\" (December 2004), Peters recognizes that open source information in all languages must be gathered, read, understood, analyzed, and acted upon, before we can possible communicate any message to anyone.  He would agree with those who say \\"forget about the message, deliver the tools for truth--the Internet, education, translation software, information sharing devices--and get out of the way: the people will educate themselves, and in educating themselves, will be inoculated against terrorism.\\"<br /><br />In passing, Peters points out that the US Navy and US Air Force have largely fallen into irrelevance because of their obsession with big expensive systems that are useless most of the time, and he notes that a larger Army, and a sustained Marine Corps, remain the true core of American national power.<br /><br />This book is a \\"tour d'force\\" to use a term of phrase in a language Peters churlishly suggests is used only by waiters and dictators.  I myself find much that is good in France and Germany and the UK, but overall, I agree with Peters when he says that Europe is a failing civilization, following Islam into chaos, and that Africa, Latin America, and South Asia (Indian Ocean) are the future.  Interestingly, Peters sees no conflict with China brewing--they are too dependent on US consumption.oes on to dissect how we fail to listen to foreign cultures, and fail to understand what is in the minds of the very people we are trying to reach.

Each has insights and differing layouts that taken together lead to a better feel for a problem (e.g. menopause, hair loss) and to a personalized approach to using natural cures.<br /><br />Both are excellent books, I am quite happy to have this one.	2005-08-18

Some of his recommended schools are in the middle of no where, with very poor maintenance, sloppy students and inattentive staff, and not at all as advertised.  Others, like Evergreen in Washington State, are clearly top of the line.<br /><br />I have also realized that with the thousands of colleges and universities across America, including community colleges that are now going \\"upscale\\" and expanding their computer and laboratory facilties, that this book is like a placebo--it pupports to offer a life-changing experience with a very narrow selection of schools, when in fact there are plenty of life-changing schools right before our eyes, in every state of the Union.<br /><br />It merits comment that this past week none of the schools in this book that we visited caught my son's attention (he is one of those who thought, until this trip, that he never wanted to go to college), but when we visited Muhlenberg College, my alma mater, not only did he perk up, but the hand of God was visible--a college educated custodian opened the locked rooms in the Arts Center, showing him the music and digital video programming rooms, and that sealed the deal.<br /><br />Read this book for ideas, discard the \\"list\\" as flawed and misrepresentative and open your eyes to all the options.	2005-08-05

"Insider" Speaks Truth, Tars Both Parties	UPDATED 15 Dec 07[[ASIN:0670018201 Broken Government: How Republican Rule Destroyed the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial Branches]]<br /><br />This extraordinary book should be read in tandem with Lewis H. Lapham's [[ASIN:0143035029 Gag Rule: On the Suppression of Dissent and the Stifling of Democracy]] and perhaps also William Greider's [[ASIN:0684862204 The Soul of Capitalism: Opening Paths to a Moral Economy]] as well as Jonathan Schell's [[ASIN:0141016868 The Unconquerable World]].<br /><br />I find it extraordinary to have the Chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, which I have always considered to be an old man's club of established elites, largely out of touch with 80% of the real world (that is to say, the 80% that has almost nothing in the way of wealth, health, or rights), step up to the plate and speak truth.<br /><br />This book addresses the second core issue in America's future, i.e. the twin deficits that are not only going to kill the business of America, but also deprive the children of America of their future. (Lapham addresses the first: restoration of honest democracy). In combination, the $7 trillion deficit in federal spending, and the $500 billion a year trade deficit, with roughly $2 billion in foreign loans being required every single day to keep America afloat, both suggest that we are snorting political cocaine and every one of us is a damn fool for allowing two political parties to get away with selling us down the river.<br /><br />As the author points out in the Preface, when the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cautions its own master, the USA, that it is in danger of becoming an insolvent Third World country, running up bills that \\"would require an immediate and permanent 60 percent hike in the federal income tax, or a 50 percent cut in Social Security and Medicare benefits,\\" we cannot say we have not been warned.<br /><br />The author is balanced, focused, deliberative, and earnest. He carefully explains how both the \\"mainstream\\" political parties have completely abdicated all responsibility, and completely betrayed the public interest in their eagerness to sell legislation to the highest corporate bidders.<br /><br />There is one grievous flaw in the book. In concluding that we can only survive by educating ourselves and then finding our voice, the author neglects to address the fast means of achieving short-term fiscal recovery in tandem with campaign finance and electoral reform: the elimination of subsidies, tax fraud, and tax relief for corporations. We have close to a trillion in unwarranted and unsound subsidies to poor agricultural, fisheries, forestry, and minerals programs where every dollar in subsidy is yielding high long-term costs to the taxpayer citizen; we have over $50 billion a year in documented import-export tax fraud ($25 rocket engines going out, $3000 toothbrushes coming in--advanced money laundering and tax avoidance); finally, the corporate share of federal tax revenue has dropped from 32% to 6% in the past twenty years, with corporations like Halliburton paying $15M in taxes on billions in profit--easy to fix: pay taxes on the profit declared to the stockholders.<br /><br />See also the more recently published book by John Bogle, Wall Street mutual funds giant, [[ASIN:0300119712 The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism]], in which he singled the author of this book out for special praise.  What this means is that Wall Street and the \\"elite\\" now realize, as Dean Garten from Yale tried to tell them in [[ASIN:1578518784 The Politics of Fortune: A New Agenda For Business Leaders]], we are all in this together, government is hosed, labor is vital, morality and integrity are non-negotiable foundations for mutual prosperity.  2008 could be the foundation year of the 2nd American Republic.<br /><br />See also (with reviews):<br />[[ASIN:1400065763 Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency]]<br />[[ASIN:0743271106 The One Percent Doctrine: Deep Inside America's Pursuit of Its Enemies Since 9/11]]<br />[[ASIN:0743270673 State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration]]<br />[[ASIN:140003034X A Pretext for War: 9/11, Iraq, and the  Abuse of America's Intelligence Agencies]]<br />Weapons of Mass Deception: The Uses of Propaganda in Bush's War on Iraq<br />The Broken Branch: How Congress Is Failing America and How to Get It Back on Track (Institutions of American Democracy)<br />Breach of Trust: How Washington Turns Outsiders Into Insidersate of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration]]  [[ASIN:140003034X A Pretext for War: 9/11, Iraq, and the  Abuse of America's Intelligence Agencies]]  Weapons of Mass Deception: The Uses of Propaganda in Bush's War on Iraq  The Broken Branch: How Congress Is Failing America and How to Get It Back on Track (Institutions of American Democracy)  Breach of Trust: How Washington Turns Outsiders Into Insiders	2005-07-25

However, having said that, I have to praise this book as a dated but still valuable primer on budget policy.<br /><br />The bottom line in this book is clear: America can find $500 billion more in revenue if we return corporations to paying 25% of the total revenue (down to 6% now from a high of 32% in the past), eliminate subsidies and import-export pricing fraud; if we eliminate the tax code and all of its special interest provisions, and rely instead of the marketplace to choose winners and losers; and if we shift to a flat fair tax with no deductions except the mortgage and savings not counted as income.  I am over-simplifying, but this book desperate needs distillation.<br /><br />The author is quite clear on the growing threat to America of the double deficit (both debt and trade),<br /><br />On balance I am very impressed by the author's grasp of the nuances of budget policy, and while I do not understand all that he writes about, his book has certainly persuaded me that Bill Bradley and he have a grip on this important subject.<br /><br />It would be quite exciting to see Barack Obama and Ron Paul agree to collaborate on a new coalition government that offers all Americans two things: the restoration of informed engaged democracy where every citizen has access to the information they need, and where every citizen's vote counts; and the elimination of the twin deficits as a national security and competitiveness priority.<br /><br />EDIT of 20 Dec 07: Adding a few links.<br />[[ASIN:159659098X The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism: How the Financial System Underminded Social Ideals, Damaged Trust in the Markets, Robbed Investors of Trillions - and What to Do About It]]<br />[[ASIN:0312424620 Running on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It]]<br />[[ASIN:0470098287 The Global Class War: How America's Bipartisan Elite Lost Our Future - and What It Will Take to Win It Back]]<br />[[ASIN:014311252X War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War onthe American Dream and How to Fight Back]]n Elite Lost Our Future - and What It Will Take to Win It Back]]  [[ASIN:014311252X War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War onthe American Dream and How to Fight Back]]	2005-07-15

This work significantly advances our understanding of terrorism and of the three forms of suicidal terrorism: egotistic, altruistic, and fatalistic.  The author documents his findings that most suicidal terrorists are altruistic, well-educated, nationalistically-motivated, and fully witting and dedicated to their fatal mission as a service to their community.<br /><br />Of the 563 books I have reviewed--all in national security and global issues, and all but four among the best books in the field--this new work by Professor Pape stands out as startlingly original, thoughtful, useful, and directly relevant to the clear and present danger facing America: an epidemic of suicidal terrorism spawned by the \\"virtual colonialism\\" of the US in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and now Iraq as well as other countries.<br /><br />I will not repeat the excellent listing of facts in the Book Description provided by the publisher--certainly that description should be read carefully.  If you are a Jewish zealot, don't bother, you will not get over the cognitive dissonance.  Everyone else, including Muslim, Protestant, and Catholic contributors to Congressional and Presidential campaign funds, absolutely must read this book.<br /><br />There are many other books that support the author's key premises, all well-documented with case studies and the most complete and compelling statistics--known facts.  I am persuaded by the author's big three:<br /><br />1)  Suicidal terrorism correlates best with U.S. military occupation of specific countries that tend to be undemocratic and corrupt, where the U.S. in collusion with dictators and one-party elites are frustrating legitimate national aspirations of the larger underclass and middle class;<br /><br />2)  Virtually all of the suicidal terrorists comes from allies of the U.S. (at least nominally--they actually play the U.S. as \\"useful idiots\\") such as Saudi Arabia, rather than Iran;<br /><br />3) The three premises shared by Hezbollah, Hamas, Al Qaeda, the Tamil Tigers, and now the Iraqi insurgency, are all accurate and will continue to be so if the U.S. does not pull its military out of the Middle East, Pakistan, Indonesia, and other locations:<br /><br />a)  Occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan, and virtual colonialism everywhere else, demand martyrdom operations;<br /><br />b)  Conventional inferiority mandates self-sacrifice (not only suicidal terrorism, but other asymmetric attacks including the death of a thousand cuts against key energy, water, and transportation nodes in the USA; and<br /><br />c)  The US and its European allies are vulnerable to coercive pressure.  The withdrawal of the Americans and the French from Viet-Nam and then Lebanon, of the Israelis from the West Bank, and other concessions itemized by the author, have all made the case for suicidal terrorism.  It works and it will explode.<br /><br />I will mention several other books to support this author, but wish to stress that alone, his work is spectacularly successful in documenting the fallacies of the U.S. national security policy.<br /><br />Among the books that support him are<br />[[ASIN:1574888625 Imperial Hubris: Why the West Is Losing the War on Terror]]<br />[[ASIN:0275968634 The Search for Security: A U.S. Grand Strategy for the Twenty-First Century]]<br />[[ASIN:B000A1ETWO Rogue Nation: American Unilateralism and the Failure of Good Intentions]]<br />[[ASIN:0316164968 The Fifty-Year Wound: How America's Cold War Victory Has Shaped Our World]]<br />[[ASIN:0805077979 The Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire Project)]]<br />[[ASIN:0963869574 Tactics of the Crescent Moon: Militant Muslim Combat Methods]]<br />[[ASIN:0812238087 Understanding Terror Networks]]<br />[[ASIN:0470098287 The GlobalClass War: How America's Bipartisan Elite Lost Our Future - and What It Will Take to Win It Back]]<br />[[ASIN:0805044566 The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People]]<br /><br />This is a core reading for every officer at STRATCOM and SOCOM, and for anyone who wishes to be effective at either Public Diplomacy or Strategic Communication or Information Operations.

Today, as a 53-year old, I finally do, thanks to this brilliant author.<br /><br />This is a moving book with exactly the right amount of white space, easy to read, yet deeply detailed about key personalities and key battles.  For the first time, I understand with awe the degree to which tens of thousands of mixed Americans were able to mobilize, fight, move cannons weighing over a ton along hundreds of miles, construct earthworks (British General Howe on the works at Dorchester Heights: \\"these fellows have done more work in one night than I could make my army do in three months.\\"), survive disease, drink a bottle of rum per day per man, and on balance, make the miracle of the Republic.<br /><br />The author tells the story with a light hand, and among the points I found especially noteworthy were his comparison of the speed with which good ideas from the ranks made their way to General Washington, unencumbered by the bureaucracy of the British military; and Washington's appreciation for intelligence and Washington's constant focus on the mind of his counterpart and what that counterpart might be thinking.<br /><br />It also merits comment that the original revolution sought only to be afforded the rights due an Englishman, not Independence, and it was the heavy-handed actions of King George that led the original American leaders to take the final step of full treason (which, if you win, is not treason, but cause for celebration).<br /><br />The acknowledgements and the notes are themselves worthy of careful study, for the author appears to have meticulously combed through every possible archive, and hence, he not only provides a walk through a year of American history--*the* year--but also a record of where the pages of that history are archived and honored around the world.<br /><br />I started this book yesterday afternoon and finished it this afternoon, at 1600 on the 4th of July 2005.  There is no finer manner in which I could have spent the eve and the day on which we celebrate the ideals that led to Independence.  I only pray that we cast off the immoral capitalism and support for 44 dictators around the world--many of them practicing genocide--and return to the ideals of these great early Patriots.ed and honored around the world. <br /> <br />I started this book yesterday afternoon and finished it this afternoon, at 1600 on the 4th of July 2005.

It is the fault of a long series of US Administrations, and multiple generations of Congress, that have chosen to ignore the real world and to short-change American education to the point that we are literally clueless as a Nation about the real world and how billions of people in the real world hold mixed feelings about America: admiring much of what we represent, while despising our immoral corporate and unilateral government behavior.<br /><br />The U.S. Army, both before the war and in the post-reconstruction period--and the Strategic Studies Institute of the U.S. Army--come out of this book looking very professional.  The Army got it right, both in its pre-war estimates of what would be needed, and in its post-war recommendations.  The author places the blame for the post-war deaths and disasters squarely at the feet of a naive President that empowered a Secretary of Defense inclined to go light, and side-lined a Department of State whose own intelligence estimates on Iraq have been consistently superior to those of either the Central Intelligence Agency or the Department of Defense.<br /><br />I put this book down with a heavy heart, coincident with Secretary Rumsfeld announcing that we will be in Iraq and be taking losses for another twelve years.  The good news is that Iraq will over time achieve its own balance, its own form of democracy.  The bad news is that, as Winston Churchill has said so famously, \\"The Americans always do the right  thing--they just do it last (after making every other possible mistake).\\"<br /><br />See also:<br />[[ASIN:1400030846 The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11 (Vintage)]]<br />[[ASIN:030734682X Hubris: The Inside Story of Spin, Scandal, and the Selling of the Iraq War]]<br />[[ASIN:1574888625 Imperial Hubris: Why the West Is Losing the War on Terror]]<br />[[ASIN:0307277968 Blind Into Baghdad: America's War in Iraq]]<br />[[ASIN:1560255560 Secrets and Lies: Operation \\"Iraqi Freedom\\" and After: A Prelude to the Fall of U.S. Power in the Middle East?]]<br />[[ASIN:0143038915 Fiasco: The American Military Adventure in Iraq]]<br />[[ASIN:0316166286 Blood Money: Wasted Billions, Lost Lives, and Corporate Greed in Iraq]]<br />[[ASIN:1590512383 Web of Deceit: The History of Western Complicity in Iraq, from Churchill to Kennedy to George W.

188106:US	50761804	R37CZ2ALHV5OHW	0385509650	128714281	Radical Evolution: The Promise and Peril of Enhancing Our Minds, Our Bodies -- and What It Means to Be Human	Books	4	30	40	N	Y	Genetics, Robotics,  Information, Nano--Lacks Humanity	I've admired Joel Garreau ever since I read and reviewed his really insightful [[ASIN:0380578859 The Nine Nations of North America]].  I am glad to have bought and read this book, it is certainly worth reading, but it is somewhat unbalanced.  However (this is an edit of the original review), now that I have read Ray Kurzweil's book, [[ASIN:0143037889 The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology]] a techno-geek rendition of the same technologies and their future, I have to give Garreau higher marks--while this book may lack soul, it does come closer to its titular objective than does Kurzweil's.  Both are worth buying and reading together.<br /><br />He focused on four technologies abbeviated as GRIN: Genetics, Robotics, Information, and Nano.  Others have focused on the integration of Nano, Information, Bio-Technology and Cognitive Science (NIBC), and I would have been happier with this book if it focused more on the thinking side of the future rather than the bio-mechanical side.<br /><br />The other area where I felt the book was disappointing was in its almost total acceptance at face value of all that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is doing to elevate soldier-humans, giving them super human strength, acute mental perception almost to the point of telepathy, and so on.  I could not help but feel, over and over as I read this book, that if DARPA were to apply its considerable talents to waging peace and addressing poverty, disease, water scarcity, energy independence, and the urgent need for global education that does not require packing kids like rats into a stiffling anti-creative environment (and making them get up at 0600), that we would all be better off.<br /><br />The author talks about the implications for human transformation in all of this, but missing from his schema is the moral dimension.  This is closer to a comic book super-hero depiction than it is to a renaissance man's moral and cultural enlightenment, and that, in my view, is where this book falls short--it lacks soul.<br /><br />I recommend that readers consider the books by Tom Atlee, [[ASIN:193213347X The Tao of Democracy: Using Co-Intelligence to Create a World That Works for All]] and Margaret Wheatley [[ASIN:1576753441 Leadership and the New Science: Discovering Order in a Chaotic World]] as well as the book [[ASIN:1576752585 The World Cafe: Shaping Our Futures Through Conversations That Matter]] to gain an alternative perspective on what it might mean to be human in the future, despite the over-whelming incursions of technology into our humanity.book falls short--it lacks soul.

There is certainly something to what they say, but as one who studies the entire world for our US Government clients, with a special familiarity with Chinese operations in Africa and South America, and a business familiarity with what is happening in India, I have to say that on balance, the author is more correct his critics will admit, and this is a book that we simply cannot ignore.<br /><br />His most important point is made in one line: America does not have a strategy.  America does not have a strategy for winning the global war on terror, it does not have an energy strategy, it does not have an education strategy, it does not have an economic or competitiveness strategy.  The government is being run on assertion and ideology rather than evidence and thought--a media cartoon has captured the situation perfectly: as the VP tells the President that we are \\"turning the corner\\" the two walls behind them are labeled Incompetence and Fantasy.  As a moderate Republican and a trained intelligence professional with two books on the latter topic, I have to say that this book by this author, a Reaganite businessman and senior appointee in the Department of Commerce is right on target.  We *are* out of touch with reality, and we do not appreciate, at any level from White House to School House, the tsunami that is about to hit us.<br /><br />The author makes two important points early on in the books: first, that information is the currency of this age, replacing money, labor, and physical resources; and second, that the best innovation comes from the right mix of sound education across the board, heavy investment in research & development, and a co-located manufacturing bases that can tinker with R&D and have a back and forth effect.  America lacks all three of the latter, and is not yet serious about investing in global coverage of all languages, 24/7.<br /><br />There is a great deal of commonality between this book and Tom Friedman's [[ASIN:0312425074 The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century]] both written and published in the same time frame.  Both authors agree that the Internet has put an end to time and space constraints, and both agree that American labor is very much at risk because our basic education is flawed and we have no strategy for demanding continuing education from employers.  The author excels at drawing the connection between poor education, \\"it's been twenty years since anyone at Bell Labs received a Nobel Prize,\\" and the massive increase in outsourcing of knowledge work, not just scut work.<br /><br />I do have to say, having called Friedman's latest book a massive Op-Ed in my review of that book, that this author is more thoughtful, provides more historical context, and delves into more basic important detail that Friedman--put bluntly, his book is more serious and more valuable than Friedman's, as in this is the meat, where Friedman is the sauce.  Prestowitz addresses the core issues of the value of the dollar, the central place of energy, the role of demographics, and the fundamental macro-economic and structural imbalances that will weaken America, that are weakening America, over the passage to of a century of time--this is not a \\"snap-shot,\\" this is a *deep* look into the soul of America.<br /><br />Chapter 12, the author's recommendations, is alone worth the price of the book and should be required reading in every comparative economics and national security policy classroom.  I won't list these recommendations but will highlight just a couple that struck me as immediately actionable: declaration of energy independence; DoD as a catalyst for socio-economic recovery by taking the lead in energy, education, and intelligence, learninghow to wage peace; end to subsidies (the author uncharacteristically fails to note that we can increase government revenues by $500B a year if we not only eliminate subsidies, but stop import-export tax fraud and demand that corporations pay taxes on the profits they declare to their shareholders rather than the falsified and manipulated balance sheets they present to the IRS); join Japan and India to NAFTA--this is an outrageously brilliant idea.<br /><br />Clyde Prestowitz is one of the most insightful, balanced, *sane* voices on national competitiveness today.

A few items that jumped out at me:<br /><br />1) Training is a priority and has both return on investment and retention of employee benefits that have been under-estimated.<br /><br />2) All major organizations (he focused on business, I would certainly add government bureaucracies) have \\"legal underpinnings, ..systems of governance, ..management disciplines, ..accounting (that) are based on a model of the corporation that has become irrelevant.\\"<br /><br />3) Although one reviewer objected to his comments on taxation, the author has a deeper point--the government is failing to steer the knowledge economy because it is still taxing as if we had an industrial economy--this has very severe negative effects.<br /><br />4) As I read the author's discussion of four trends he credits to John Hagel of I2, it was clear that \\"intelligence\\" needs to be applied not only to single organizations, but to entire industries. In my view, this author is quite brilliant and needs to be carefully cultivated by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, all of the industry associations, and by governments. There are some extremely powerful \\"macro\\" opportunities here that his ideas could make very profitable for a group acting in the aggregate.<br /><br />5) This is one book that should have had footnotes instead of end-notes, for while the author is careful to credit all ideas borrowed from others, it is difficult in the text to follow his thinking in isolation. One idea that is very pertinent to national intelligence and counterintelligence as well as corporate knowledge management is that of the reversal of the value chain--\\"first sell, then make,\\" i.e. stop pushing pre-conceived products out the door and get into the business of just enough, just in time knowledge or product creation that is precisely tailored to the real time needs of the client.<br /><br />6) The author excells at blasting those corporations (and implicitly, major government bureaucracies such as the spy agencies that spend over $30 billion a year of taxpayer funds) that assume that if they only apply more dollars to the problem, they can solve any challenge. \\"Too often 'dumb power' produces a higher-level stalemate.\\" One could add: and at greater cost!<br /><br />7) The bottom line of this truly inspired and original book comes in the concluding chapters when the author very ably discusses how it is not knowledge per se that creates the value, but rather the leadership, the culture, and infrastructure (one infers a networked infrastructure, not a hard-wired bunker). These are the essential ingredients for fostering both knowledge creation and knowledge sharing, something neither the CIA nor the FBI understood at the management level in the years prior to 9-11.<br /><br />Final note:  I missed the pre-cursor to this book, [[ASIN:0385483813 Intellectual Capital: The New Wealth of Organizations]] (1997) and just read it.  I recommend both books, and in some ways, it is better to read this book first.  I also recommend Robert Buckman's [[ASIN:0071384715 Building a Knowledge-Driven Organization]], and the book, [[ASIN:1578518520 The Innovator's Solution: Creating and Sustaining Successful Growth]] as ideal companions to this path-finding work.<br /><br />Recently published (2006 and on), see also, with reviews:<br />[[ASIN:0300125771 The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom]]<br />[[ASIN:0131877291 The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty Through Profits (Wharton School Publishing Paperbacks)]]ttom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty Through Profits (Wharton School Publishing Paperbacks)]]	2005-06-25

This book has a lot of detail that is well served by the context that can be found in the later book.<br /><br />For those who really wish to get a deep look at the future of building value in the age of distribution information in all languages, I recommend that both of Stewart's books be read in conjunction with the following three Nobel-level books: Margaret Wheatley, [[ASIN:1576753441 Leadership and the New Science: Discovering Order in a Chaotic World]] Robert Buckman, [[ASIN:0071384715 Building a Knowledge-Driven Organization]] and Christensen & Raynor, [[ASIN:0060521996 The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary Book that Will Change the Way You Do Business (Collins Business Essentials)]] My reviews of these books are both evaluative and summative, and could be helpful as short-cut, but they are no substitute for actually buying and reading the books.<br /><br />The most important point in this book is that the value is no longer found in collecting just in case knowledge, but rather in connecting dots to dots, dots to people, and (the highest value) people to people. It's about connecting, not collecting. Based on this book I drew my own value triangle, VALUE appearing in the middle of the triangle, with Context being the lower left corer, Content being the lower right corner, and CONNECTION being the apex of the triangle--further refined as connecting customers, connecting contributing talents, and connecting sub-contracted sources, softwares, and services. No one is doing this today in the manner that meets the emerging needs of the marketplace.<br /><br />Most interesting to me is the author's early emphasis on the Chief Financial Officer being the point of sale, not the CEO, the CTO, or the production divisions. Intellectual capital is a value-creation and profit-building exercise, and it needs to be presented as a financial campaign plan, not a technology plan, not a human resources plan, and not a sales and marketing plan.<br /><br />Although the author focuses on intellectual property, and provides compelling anecdotes and links that suggest that any company in the knowledge business can increase its bottom line earnings by 20-40% if it does a better job of managing its intellectual property, I see two other emerging marketplaces in this book that the author may not have intended but certainly contributes insights to: managing shared access to external sources, to reduce the cost and increase the knowledge that companies can use to increase their competence in a global environment; and managing customer understanding and relationships in the aggregate--it is possible to take cross-selling to new heights if companies in different industries that are not competing with one another, will share customer information in new ways, thus leading to the invention of new3 offerings and new value.<br /><br />A major point in this book that I believe everyone misses is that the management of intellectual property, or knowledge management, or external open source information acquisition and exploitation, is totally and utterly without value in the absence of a strategy. Collection or connecting is of the greatest value when it is done with strategic purpose, operational efficiency, and tactical effect.<br /><br />There is a lot more in this book that will impact on my strategic business planning, and that I choose to not summarize here, but will instead end with three points the author makes that I consider to be important:<br /><br />1) In the information age, only investments in knowledge building are really investments--traditional investments in capital goods are costs, not to be confused with investments intended to generate new value.<br /><br />2) Knowledge value growson a logarithmic scale, while goods value grows arithmetically.<br /><br />3) In today's environment, careers are defined by personal skills and networking, not traditional jobs and corporate positions. The corollary of this is that individuals must self-manage their continuing education and skill acquisition, and any job that fails to provide for continuing upgrading of skills is not worth keeping.<br /><br />I consider this a seminal reference.<br /><br />See also, with reviews:<br />[[ASIN:0131877291 The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty Through Profits (Wharton School Publishing Paperbacks)]]<br />[[ASIN:0300125771 The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom]]<br />[[ASIN:038552207X Revolutionary Wealth: How it will be created and how it will change our lives]]<br />[[ASIN:159659098X The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism: How the Financial System Underminded Social Ideals, Damaged Trust in the Markets, Robbed Investors of Trillions - and What to Do About It]]<br />[[ASIN:1578518784 The Politics of Fortune: A New Agenda For Business Leaders]]3) In today's environment, careers are defined by personal skills and networking, not traditional jobs and corporate positions.

I have absolute and total respect for this officer, his team, his courage, and what he accomplished within weeks of 9-11, setting the stage for a new form of warfare in which CIA opened the door, Special Forces turned on the lights, and conventional Air Force leveled the place.<br /><br />The book provides some extremely useful insights from the field with respect to Washington's failure to understand local politics and ground truth despite frequent detailed field appraisals from the Chief of Station, and the book makes it clear that Pakistan lobbied Washington strategically and ably to \\"sell\\" its plan for taking over Afghanistan with its own allies, against both Russian and US (and for that matter, Chinese) best interests.<br /><br />There are five substantive military insights in this book:<br /><br />1)  Despite their enormous personal courage and high level of training, the US military special forces are handicapped by a joint defense-level policy that will not do deep bombing unless a Search & Rescue (SAR) capability is readily available.  I recall the original Office of Strategic Services dropping people behind enemy lines (the pilots understood they might be shot down as part of the deal) and I just think to myself, shame on DoD, this force protection zero tolerance for casualties has gone too far.  We need a Chairman of the Joint Chiefs with the balls to change the military culture back to one that is mission oriented rather than casualty averse.<br /><br />2)  Partly as a result of Pakistani influence [the author notes that the Pakistanis co-opted the CIA Station in Pakistan, not just the State Department and NSC in Washington] and point one above, the targeting authorities (CENTCOM and the Air Force) were very slow to act professionally on the targets identified by the Northern Alliance and the CIA field teams.  I was enormously impressed by the GPS field surveys that the CIA team carried out, and under-whelmed by the Air Force focus on warehouses near Kabul rather than specified armed forces blocking the Northern Alliance path toward Kabul.  I also noted in the margin, having some experience with provincial and tribal intelligence, that the US decision system is still too focused on state to state Ambassadorial level negotiations, and largely ignorant of and uninterested in the nuances of sub-state tribal views and concerns.  That needs urgent fixing.<br /><br />3) The Special Forces, despite their reputation for fearless operations behind enemy lines, were led by officers who insisted that they wear their proper military uniforms and shave every day.  I have met the two-star general that gave and then enforced this order, and consider him a superb--absolutely top-notch--officer in terms of military skills, but the man is so culturally clueless as to give new meaning to the term oblivious.  As a side note, thinking back to Steve McQueen in the great escape, it occurred to me that we need to establish a protocol under the Geneva Convention in which military personnel and overt intelligence personnel can blend into the local population to avoid cultural dissonance, but wear a small patch, clearly visible to those they see face to face--something like a SOF spear, with miniature rank on one side and miniature service seal on the other side, all within a two-inch wide circle.<br /><br />4)  PAVE LOW missed the Landing Zone (LZ) during the first and most critical Special Operations team insertion.  Now, this could have happened if CIA provided the military with the wrong coordinates (or used Russian coordinates while the Americans were on another system), but this should never have happened.  It also points out that the military and CIA evidently did not have the ability to talk to each other tactically on the final approach, which reminds me of our Marines not being able to talk to the US Embassy in Somalia as they completed their 400 nautical mile run just in time to stop the people from over-running the place.  How is it that something as critical as masked inter-agency tactical communications can still not be achieved?  INTER-4 Tacticomps with S-MINDS and CISCO AONS for all hands ASAP.<br /><br />5)  Air Force blew the first food-drop, dropping the packets from 27,000 feet without parachutes.  What this made clear to me is that we have a peacetime Air Force (see my review of \\"Rules of the Game\\" by Andrew Gordon) that has forgotten how to do nuanced missions, especially those requiring that they do something other than deliver cargo conventionally or drop bombs.<br /><br />The author ends the book more or less on page 363, where he suggests that a combined CIA and SOF campaign circling Waziristan, is needed.  While he underestimates the denied area aspect of this zone, I agree that the Pakistanis are playing the Americans for fools, and I agree that there should be no area of the world where US forces cannot operate if they must.<br /><br />The author loses one star, with some understanding, for failing to provide context and failing to acknowledge that his heroic mission was required because CIA did not take Afghanistan seriously before and after Charlie Wilson.  Three other books, at least, must be read to understand this:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0802141242 Charlie Wilson's War: The Extraordinary Story of How the Wildest Man in Congress and a Rogue CIA Agent Changed the History of Our Times]]<br />[[ASIN:0143034669 Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001]]<br />[[ASIN:0345472500 The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB]]<br /><br />The compansion to this book is [[ASIN:0307351068 Jawbreaker: The Attack on Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda: A Personal Account by the CIA's Key Field Commander]]<br /><br />I had a chance to talk to a CENTCOM officer informally about all this, and welcomed his observation that CIA does not always have the facts when it comes to their perception of military \\"mistakes.\\"  We also talked about the need for a new approach to global intelligence.  It is crystal clear to me that we need to have CIA/SOF bases all over the world that are under non-official cover and that work every major tribe and province.

I bought the book mostly to read about the inspired use of statistics, and the creative thinking that went into looking for the real keys to victory.  I can safely say that while I may not have fallen in love with baseball, I will never find it boring again.  If you have someone you want to turn into a fan, this book a superb gift option.  The amount of detail in this book--for example, just the description of the strike zone and what different pitches and batters do to narrow the zone, what can be known about specific individual propensities and vulnerabilities associated with that little box, are truly inspirational.<br /><br />This is a really excellent book.  If we managed the national security budget the way Billy Bean managed the Oakland A's, we'd have faster better cheaper military hardware, and a lot more plowshares.  I was also impressed by the way in which Billy Bean built a team, in which players who might not have been individual stars excelled at setting up others in a true team effort where the group as a whole is stronger than the sum of the parts.  Others have written better reviews from a baseball fans point of view--as a non-baseball fan, I can attest to this book's being an \\"aha\\" experience.<br /><br />See also:<br />[[ASIN:0307280322 Watching Baseball Smarter: A Professional Fan's Guide for Beginners, Semi-experts, and Deeply Serious Geeks]]	2005-05-24

This is an extraordinary book.  Indeed, if the President has a Science advisor, I have to ask myself, why doesn't he have a Faith advisor?<br /><br />I recommend this book be read together with \\"Faith-Based Diplomacy\\" by Douiglas Johnson, and \\"The Soul of Capitalism\\" by William Greider.  This hard-hitting book is full of both common sense and scholarship.  Over-all it slams both Right and Left--the Right for claiming that Jesus is pro-war, pro-rich, and a selective moralist; the Left for not embracing faith and God as part of the politics of America.<br /><br />Early in the book I am immediately won over by the author's preliminary manifesto in his preface: we who have faith are not single-issue voters; we believe that poverty is a religious issue; that caring for God's earth is a religious issue; that war--and making peace--is a religious issue; that truth-telling is a religious issue; that human rights are a religious issue; that our response to terrorism is a religious issue; and finally, that a consistent ethic of human life is a religious issue.<br /><br />Throughout this book the author returns again and again, to a theme that I am now seeing everywhere: morality matters.  The author is superb at relating the power of faith and the morality of religion (not pretentious morality, but practiced morality) to the real world.  On pages 105-107, if you are glancing through the book in a bookstore, he repeats key points he made a year after 9-11 on how to defeat terrorism--among his  ten points a few simply leap off the page: 4. Let's define terrorism the right way, and allow no double standards.  5.  Attack not only the symptoms, but also the root causes of terrorism.  6.  The solutions to terrorism are not primarily military.  And so on.<br /><br />Poverty, economic justice, and *moral* capitalism are the underlying challenges that confront the author, and he does a really fine job in this book of showing how America will never be safe if we fail to address global as well as homeland poverty.  (In this regard, see my reviews of \\"Working Poor\\" by David K. Shipler, and \\"Nickled and Dimed\\" by Barbara Ehrenreich.)<br /><br />The book ends with an extraordinary list of 50 predictions for the future.  This list, by itself, is worth the price of the book.  #45 is consistent with the eight movements centering around collective intelligence: \\"All our media will be owned by two or three corporate conglomerates unless and effective movement rises up to stop this trend and restore a genuinely democratic public discourse.\\"  I have the strong feeling that the author's faith is being tested by both the Right and the Left--indeed, in the social and economic policy arena, the author, from a religious point of view, is a perfect counter-part to the Chairman of the Council of Foreign Relations, Peter Petersen, whose book, \\"Running on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It,\\" is the practical counterpart to \\"God's Politics.\\"<br /><br />This is a world-class, Nobel-level discourse.<br /><br />See also:<br />[[ASIN:0743284437 American Fascists: The Christian Right and the War On America]]<br />[[ASIN:0143038281 American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury]]<br />[[ASIN:B000NNXX30 The Left Hand of God: Taking Back Our Country from the Religious Right]]<br />[[ASIN:0743287134 Tempting Faith: An Inside Story of Political Seduction]][[ASIN:B000NBKJ4S Religion Gone Bad: The Hidden Dangers of the Christian Right]]<br />[[ASIN:0307347494 Piety & Politics: The Right-Wing Assault on Religious Freedom]]<br />[[ASIN:1400031915 Dogs of God: Columbus, the Inquisition, and the Defeat of the Moors]]<br />[[ASIN:1571782109 Thank God for Evolution!: How the Marriage of Science and Religion Will Transform Your Life and Our World]]<br />[[ASIN:0399153292 The Complete Conversations with God (Boxed Set)]]<br />[[ASIN:0195160894 Faith-Based Diplomacy: Trumping Realpolitik]]	2005-05-04

I agreed with 94% of his propositions.  The issues he has chosen to highlight here are not perfectly reasoned, but they are the best available and worthy of support.<br /><br />In the one area where I have spent a lifetime, that of intelligence, Newt Gingrich is flawed on the one hand--suggesting that we need to triple the amount of money we spend on intelligence is certainly well-intentioned but understandably uninformed about the nuances of national intelligence--more money just makes these people worse [see my book [[ASIN:0971566100 On Intelligence: Spies and Secrecy in an Open World]], with a Foreword by Senator Boren, and [[ASIN:0971566119 The New Craft of Intelligence: Personal, Public, & Political--Citizen's Action Handbook for Fighting Terrorism, Genocide, Disease, Toxic Bombs, & Corruption]] with a Foreword by Senator Roberts]--and brilliant on the other.  When he writes so clearly about how we need to monitor all knowledge being created worldwide, with virtual real-time translations services, a Google for science & technology, and no publication overseas going more than ninety days without being translated into English, I am just blown away.  This is what the national Open Source Agency recommended by the 9-11 Commission is supposed to do, but CIA is trying to \\"capture\\" that mission, which they have consistently screwed over since the end of World War II.  Where it really matters, Newt Gingrich not only gets it, he is leading us.  He also focuses on our lack of participation in global knowledge forums across all domains, and he champions nothing less than a global presence and global monitoring of all knowledge.  This is *powerful* stuff.<br /><br />I miss Ronald Reagan.  No one now running as a Republican candidate, except Ron Paul, comes close. Somewhere in there, Newt Gingrich and Pat Buchanan have important roles to play.

I bought it because it was recommended by Tom Atlee, seer of the Co-Intelligence Institute, and I found it very worthwhile.<br /><br />As I reflect on the book, I appreciate two key points from the book:<br /><br />1)  The evolution of our brains and our ability to sense cataclysmic change that takes place over long periods of time is simply not going fast enough--the only thing that can make a difference is accelerated cultural evolution, which I find quite fascinating, because cultural evolution as the authors describe it harkens to noosphere, World Brain, co-intelligence, and what the Swedes are calling M4 IS: multinational, multiagency, multidisciplinary, multidomain information sharing--what I think of as Open Source Intelligence--personal, public, & political.<br /><br />2)  One of the more compelling points the authors make is that not only are politicians being elected and rewarded on the basis of short-term decisions that are by many measures intellectually, morally, and financially corrupt, but the so-called knowledge workers--the scientists, engineers, and others who should be \\"blowing the whistle,\\" are so specialized that there is a real lack of integrative knowledge.  I realized toward the end of the book, page 248 exactly, that Knowledge Integration & Information Sharing must become the new norm.<br /><br />This is a tremendous book that is loaded with gems of insight.  I have it heavily marked up.  Although it integrates and reminds me of ideas ably explored in other books, such as Health of Nations, Cultural Creatives, Clock of the Long Now, ATTENTION, Limits to Growth, and Forbidden Knowledge, these two authors have integrated their \\"brief\\" in a very readable way--as one person says on the book jacket, they effectively weave together many strands of knowledge.<br /><br />The annotated bibliography is quite good, and causes me to be disappointed that the publishers did not provide for the updating of the bibliography--the ideas being blended are timeless and need no update.<br /><br />Two notes toward the end were quite interesting.  They speculate that Japan may be the first modern nation to collapse, if it is subject to disruption of the global trade and transportation system.  They also have high praise for Global 2000, an integrative work whose predictions for the 2000 period (written in the 1970's, I believe) are turning out to be quite accurate.<br /><br />Finally, woven throughout the book, is the simple fact that we are now burning up our savings--consuming the Earth at a much faster rate than it can replenish itself.  We are very much out of harmony with our sustaining environment, and at grave risk of self-destruction.  Interestingly, they remind of the Durants last word in \\"The Lessons of History:\\"  that the only revolution, the only sustainable revolution, is that which takes place in the human mind.  As these authors would have it, if we do not develop a new collective mind capable of integrating, understanding, and acting sensible, for the long term, on what we can know as a collective mind, then our grandchildren will become prey for the cockroaches of the future.<br /><br />At a time when the new Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Ambassador Negroponte, is seriously contemplating the establishment of a national Open Source (Information) Agency as recommended by the 9-11 Commission, to get a grip on all the historical and current knowledge, both scientific and social, that we have lost touch with, I can think of just three books I would recommend to the DNI as a foundation for his reflections: this one, Buckman's \\"Creating a Knowledge Driven Organization,\\" and Wheatley's \\"Leadership and the New Science.\\"  I would end his tutorial, or perhaps inspire it, by screening Tom Atlee's video, \\"From Group Magic to a Wise Democracy.\\"<br /><br />Strangely, for I tend to be very gloomy about our prospects these days, I find that this book has cheered me somewhat.  I sense the possibility of a break-out through a combination of wise information acquisition and sharing policies, and the application of the new technologies that L-3, CISCO, and IBM, among others, are bringing out, technologies that put intelligence on the edge of the network, and permit the creation of infinitely scalable and shareable synthetic information exactly suited to any need at any level.<br /><br />There *is* an answer to all that ails us, and these two authors discuss it in a very capable manner.<br /><br />See also, with reviews:<br />[[ASIN:1557788677 Integral Consciousness and the Future of Evolution]]<br />[[ASIN:193213347X The Tao of Democracy: Using Co-Intelligence to Create a World That Works for All]]<br />[[ASIN:0609808451 The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People Are Changing the World]]<br />[[ASIN:0465071929 Group Genius: The Creative Power of Collaboration]]<br />[[ASIN:0300125771 The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom]]<br />[[ASIN:0471419192 Global Brain: The Evolution of Mass Mind from the Big Bang to the 21st Century]]<br />[[ASIN:B00086SES6 World brain]]<br />[[ASIN:1576753441 Leadership and the New Science: Discovering Order in a Chaotic World]]<br />[[ASIN:1576752585 The World Cafe: Shaping Our Futures Through Conversations That Matter]]<br />[[ASIN:0971566143 THE SMART NATION ACT: Public Intelligence in the Public Interest]]has cheered me somewhat.

I started with Crescent Moon, got Phantom Soldier next, and now am eagerly awaiting the Last 100 Yards.  Although I do not expect to see combat in my remaining years, I have three boys that almost certainly will if things keep going as they are, and this book is frightening to any parent or voter.<br /><br />His bottom line is clear: all of our expensive high-tech equipment is increasing the soldier's load (shades of SLA Marshall) at the same time that it is reducing the soldier's ability to see (one eye covered by a sensor), smell, move, and communicate.  We are pursuing a very expensive top down command and control model of confrontational fire-power warfare that is rather easily bogged down by stealth adversaries patient enough to crawl for days and dig underground for months in adavance.  I am reminded of the \\"Tunnels of Ch Chi.\\"  The author is totally tuned in with what I think of as 5th Generation or \\"bottom up\\" warfare in which the small units do most of the sensing and thinking, and they are not simply pawns on a giant chessboard.<br /><br />Much of the book is a highly readable and easily understood account of the common sense and complex thinking that allows Eastern units that are very well-trained to defeat or avoid Western units that are very well-provisioned (I am also reminded of MajGen Bob Scales \\"Firepower in Limited War,\\", but not trained in the infantry skills needed to go man on man in stealth mode.<br /><br />There is a very great deal to this author's thinking.  I do not expect him to have the impact necessary on our new brigade Army or expeditionary Marine Corps, but I hope that by the time my three boys are of draft age, there are generals in power that share this author's wisdom.  This is seriously good stuff that every parent and voter should be reading.<br /><br />I would add, however, that there is another side of grand strategy that we are neglecting.  While this author focuses on the tactical excellence that Eastern warriors can achieve, I also worry about American naivete in not understanding that some countries--China and Iran for example--are home to very strategic cultures that know how to \\"set the stage\\" with all of the instruments of national power.

The author has done a brilliant meticulous job of culling through open source references to create a thoughtful, well-structured, and superbly foot-noted document that is nothing less than \\"Ref A\\" for what must become the new \\"American Way of War.\\"<br /><br />Big ideas:<br /><br />1)  One third of the world is Muslim, and if we do not restore morality to our form of democratic capitalism, and they adopt asymmetric warfare techniques, we are toast.<br /><br />2) Iran certainly, and China probably, are fostering global terror as part of their grand strategy--each with different objectives--to end Anerica's status as a super-power.<br /><br />3)  Pakistan, Syria, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia continue to train and support terrorists, with North Korea, Yemen, Sudan and various other countries (e.g. Bangladesh) having diverse roles to play.<br /><br />4)  Hezbollah out of Iran, rather than Al Qaeda out of Saudi Arabia, is the major player in the Iraqi insurgency, and its methods (hostages, suicide bombings, disguised IEDs) are clearly visible across the Iraqi theater of operations and now beginning to appear elsewhere in the world.<br /><br />5)  We cannot win 4th generation asymmetric wars with firepower alone.  The heart of the book is a dissection of the Muslim insurgent's inspired excellence at close and asymmetric combat, and a carefully articulated case for getting back into the business of field light infantry that has the skill to infiltrate, surprise, and defeat enemies \\"mano a mano\\"--as some of us have been saying for some time (my own phrase has been \\"one man, one bullet\\"), but this author does a fantastic job of nailing it in war-fighting terms, modern way must be won by bottom up squad-level observation and skill, not top down command and control wielding firepower that kills 10-100 non-combatants for every US life that it might save (and ultimately--the author is compelling on this point--the deaths of those non-combatants inspire more suicidal terrorists who kill more US fighting men and women than might have died if we had done it right in the first place.<br /><br />6)  The author outlines in detail, with absolutely first-class documentation of his many sources (this is the first book I can remember reading where a single short sentence might contain as many as six different footnotes) the tactical techniques that Muslim radicals have learned to use, to including tunnels and disguises for both themselves and their Improvised Explosive Devices (IED).  I agree with General Zinni--this book is required reading for every member of our Armed Forces, from Private to  General.  If you have a loved one in the Armed Forces, buy them this book and send it to them immediately.<br /><br />7)  Light infantry, acting as a gendarme with superior human intelligence, can nail the terrorists, but unless we want to occupy the world--something impossible to do (see point one)--then we must mobilize all of the instruments of national power and dedicate ourselves to nurturing legitimate effective *indigenous* governments everywhere.  That means we must stop supporting 44 dictators, and we must stop imposing immoral capitalism (carpetbagging) on South America, Asia, and Africa.<br /><br />This book is nothing short of ispirational.  Sadly, it will probably be ignored by the Pentagon because, as the author himself points out, the old outdated and ineffective American Way of War is based predominantly on massive firepower and a heavy contractor presence that is most profitable for our arms merchants (see General Smedley Butler, \\"War is a Raquet\\") and our beltway bandits.  Consequently, I pray that this book will be bought, read, and acted upon by anyone who has every served in the U.S. military, is serving now, or knows someone now serving or likely to serve (I have three boys, the oldest will be of draft age in two years).  What we are paying fornow is not working and time is running out.  We need a fundamental change in direction, and that will not happen absent a national uprising, or at Tom Atlee would say, \\"from group magic to a wise democracy.\\"<br /><br />The author gets special high marks from me for relating morality and our acknowledgement of God to being able to win at war.  He is absolutely right to castigate the Supreme Court for removing God from our national fabric, and points out that the same Supreme Court once declared slaves to be non-humans.  He understands, as Clausewitz did, that the moral is to the material by at least one order of magnitude--in today's information-rich era, I would double it.  Morality matters, and we have lost that high ground by allowing special interests to dictate America's profiteering foreign policy, rather than letting the common sense of the American people enrich America's foreign policy for the common good of all--as the Golden Rule suggests: do unto others as you would have them do unto you.<br /><br />If the public demands that its politicians attend to this author's views, and if our military leaders--both suited and uniformed--attend to this book, it will save hundreds of thousands of lives, tens of billions of dollars, and perhaps the American way of life.<br /><br />See the links at [[ASIN:0963869558 Phantom Soldier: The Enemy's Answer to U.S. Firepower]]ge in direction, and that will not happen absent a national uprising, or at Tom Atlee would say, \\"from group magic to a wise democracy.\\"    The author gets special high marks from me for relating morality and our acknowledgement of God to being able to win at war.

I would have preferred that the editors add as they have, but with less deletion from the past.<br /><br />2)  The book still has the flavor of the Cold War in that the NSC is looked upon as a largely military \\"big stick\\" get our way in the national security arena book, and it does not orient its readers to the full range of national capabilities, all of the instruments of national power including the economic, cultural, and religious.  It does not fully reflect the growing role of non-state actors and the emerging appreciation for national security as a multi-cultural arena in which non-governmental organizations such as Doctors without Borders, and Chambers of Commerce, have at least as much to contribute to stabilization and reconstruction as do the U.S. Armed Forces.<br /><br />In my view, this book is the standard, but I would like to see a third edition that addresses these last two points.<br /><br />See also, with reviews:<br />[[ASIN:0815734093 Bureaucratic Politics And Foreign Policy]]<br />[[ASIN:1574888625 Imperial Hubris: Why the West Is Losing the War on Terror]]<br />[[ASIN:0195161106 The Paradox of American Power: Why the World's Only Superpower Can't Go It Alone]]<br />[[ASIN:0316164968 The Fifty-Year Wound: How America's Cold War Victory Has Shaped Our World]]<br />[[ASIN:0805044566 The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People]]<br />[[ASIN:0922915865 War Is a Racket: The Anti-War Classic by America's Most Decorated General, Two Other Anti=Interventionist Tracts, and Photographs from the Horror of It]]<br />[[ASIN:B000FBH3W2 Why We Fight]]<br />[[ASIN:B0001L3LUE The Fog of War - Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S.

271518:US	50761804	R37PSTCOIM7T0R	0143034669	469542612	Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001	Books	5	246	280	N	Y	Hard Copy Easier to Read, but Substance is Same: Superb	Edit of 20 Dec 07 to add links including books since published.<br /><br />On balance this is a well researched book (albeit with a Langley-Saudi partiality that must be noted), and I give it high marks for substance, story, and notes. It should be read in tandem with several other books, including George Crile's [[ASIN:0802141242 Charlie Wilson's War: The Extraordinary Story of How the Wildest Man in Congress and a Rogue CIA Agent Changed the History of Our Times]] and the Milt Bearden/James Risen tome on [[ASIN:0345472500 The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB]].<br /><br />The most important point in the book is not one the author intended to make. He inadvertently but most helpfully points to the fact that at no time did the U.S. government, in lacking a policy on Afghanistan across several Administrations, think about the strategic implications of \\"big money movements.\\" I refer to Saudi Oil, Afghan Drugs, and CIA Cash.<br /><br />Early on the book shows that Afghanistan was not important to the incumbent Administration, and that the Directorate of Operations, which treats third-world countries as hunting grounds for Soviets rather than targets in their own right, had eliminated Afghanistan as a \\"collection objective\\" in the late 1980's through the early 1990's. It should be no surprise that the CIA consequently failed to predict the fall of Kabul (or in later years, the rise of the Taliban).<br /><br />Iran plays heavily in the book, and that is one of the book's strong points. From the 1979 riots against the U.S. Embassies in Iran and in Pakistan, to the end of the book, the hand of Iran is clearly perceived. As we reflect on Iran's enormous success in 2002-2004 in using Chalabi to deceive the Bush Administration into wiping out Saddam Hussein and opening Iraq for Iranian capture, at a cost to the US taxpayer of over $400 billion dollars, we can only compare Iran to the leadership of North Viet-Nam. Iran has a strategic culture, the US does not. The North Vietnamese beat the US for that reason. Absent the development of a strategic culture within the US, one that is not corrupted by ideological fantasy, Iran will ultimately beat the US and Israel in the Middle East.<br /><br />The greatest failure of the CIA comes across throughout early in the book: the CIA missed the radicalization of Islam and its implications for global destabilization. It did so for three reasons: 1) CIA obsession with hard targets to the detriment of global coverage; 2) CIA obsession with technical secrets rather than human overt and covert information; and 3) CIA laziness and political naivet&eacute; in relying on foreign liaison, and especially on Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.<br /><br />Both Admiral Stansfield Turner and Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski come in for criticism here. Turner for gutting the CIA, Brzezinski for telling Pakistan it could go nuclear (page 51) in return for help against the Soviets in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Although the book does not focus on Bin Laden until he becomes a player in Afghanistan, it does provide much better discussion of Bin Laden's very close relations with Saudi intelligence, including the Chief of Staff of Saudi intelligence at the time, Bin Laden's former teacher and mentor. There appears to be no question, from this and other sources, including Yossef Bodansky's book [[ASIN:0761535810 Bin Laden: The Man Who Declared War on America]] and David Kaplan's US News & World Report on Saudi sponsorship of global terrorism, that Bin Laden has been the primary Saudi intelligence agent of influence for exporting terrorism and Islamic radicalism to South Asia, the Pacific Rim, Africa, Europe, Russia, and the US. CIA and the FBI failed to detect this global threat, and the USG failed to understand that World War III started in 1989. As with other evils, the US obsession about communism led it to sponsor new emerging threats that might not otherwise have become real. However, the book also provides the first documentation I have seen that Bin Laden was \\"noticed\\" by the CIA in 1985 (page 146), and that Bin Laden opened his US office in 1986. It was also about this time that the Russian \\"got it\\" on the radical Islamic threat, told the US, and got blown off. Bob Gates and George Shultz were wrong to doubt the Soviets when they laid out Soviet plans to leave Afghanistan and Soviet concern about both the future of Afghanistan and the emerging threat from Islamic terrorism.<br /><br />The middle of the book can be considered a case study in how Pakistani deception combined with American ignorance led us to make many errors of judgment. Some US experts did see the situation clearly--Ed McWilliams from State (\\"Evil Little Person\\" per Milt Bearden) comes out of this book looking very very smart.<br /><br />The final portions of the book are detailed and balanced. What comes across is both a failure of the US to think strategically, and the incredibly intelligent manner in which Bin Laden does think globally, strategically, and unconventionally. Bin Laden understands the new equation: low-cost terrorism equals very high cost economic dislocation.<br /><br />Side note: CIA provided the Islamic warriors in Afghanistan with enough explosives to blow up half of New York (page 135), and with over 2000 Stinger missiles, 600 of which appear to remain in the hands of anti-US forces today, possibly including a number shipped to Iran for re-purposing (ie London, Dallas, Houston)<br /><br />One final note: morality matters. I am greatly impressed with the author's judgment in focusing on the importance that Bin Laden places on the corruption of US and Saudi Arabian governments and corporations as the justification for his jihad. Will and Ariel Durant, in \\"The Lessons of History,\\" make a special point of discussing the long-term strategic value of morality as a \\"force\\" that impacts on the destiny of nations and peoples. The US has lost that part of the battle, for now, and before we can beat Bin Laden, we must first clean our own house and demand that the Saudi's clean theirs or be abandoned as a US ally. Morality matters. Strategic culture matters.

If you buy only one, buy Neff & Citrin, but I do recommend that you buy both, read Neff & Citrin first, and then cherry pick from Watkins--the cost of these books is trivial in comparison to the return on investment.	2005-04-09

I found this book the most useful, and it quickly and immediately inspired me to prepare a succinct 100 day plan broken down into 10 day blocks, for a new $2 billion a year agency.  Hence, I completely disagree with those that trash this book and recommend \\"The First 90 Days\\" instead of this book.  I do find both books useful--read this one first, then cherry pick from Watkins.<br /><br />Sure, anyone can cook a meal with the same ingredients, and sure, there are a number of books on this topic.  For me, this book has exactly the right combination of white space, font size, lay-out, progressive structure, and inspiring snippets (including the all-important advocacy for having an in-house revolutionary).<br /><br />I recommend this book be read in conjunction with Robert Buckman's \\"Creating a Knowledge-Driven Organization,\\" Margaret Wheatley's \\"Leadership and the New Science\\" (which Buckman told me inspired his own work), and Clayton Christensen's \\"The Innovator's Solution\\" (or you can just read my short summative reviews of those three books).	2005-04-09

I do believe that Amazon is quite right to focus on dissertations as marketable products, as they are generally ten years or more ahead of the normal publishing world, and many good efforts fail to reach the market for various reasons including lazy professors who do not help their students publish especially trenchant works.<br /><br />This was my first serious effort at writing, and suffers from a big of hyperbole, but on balance, as a life-long student of emerging threats and unconventional revolutionary turmoil, I believe it remains relevant.<br /><br />The thesis creates a new original matrix.  Along the top are the dimensions within which revolution can occur: Political-Legal, Soci-Economic, Ideo-Cultural, Techno-Demographic, and Natural-Geographic.<br /><br />Down the side are the psychological aspects of populations as originally examined by Charles Hampden-Turner in his superb book \\"Radical Man.\\"  These are perception, identity, competence, investment, suspension, extroversion, transcendence, synergy, and complexity.<br /><br />Having created an original framework (in 1975, publishing in the Spring of 1976), I then examined the English-language literature on causes of revolution, and filled in roughly a third of the matric--common things like over-concentration of wealth, major catastrophe followed by inept government response, etcetra.  I then created a typpology for qualifying revolutions, large and small, filled in the rest of the matrix with new clarifications previously not well understood, and finally I operationalized the whole thing--established specific measureable indicators for each box in the matrix.<br /><br />A quarter-century later--and over 3,000 additional books and 40 plus countries visited later--I believe this approach remains best in class and useful to strategic communications, and public diplomacy as well as foreign aid.  If the USA had a grand strategy for promoting democracy, legitimacy, stabiilty, and reconstruction, this matrix would be helpful to ensuring that a balanced approach is followed in which all of the instruments of national power are utilized, and a coherent approach to security and prosperity is taken across each of the dimensions within which a revolution can be catalyzed.to strategic communications, and public diplomacy as well as foreign aid.

Edit of 20 Dec 07 to reduce links to ten.<br /><br />This book should be read simultaneously with two others books: David Callahan's [[ASIN:0156030055 The Cheating Culture: Why More Americans Are Doing Wrong to Get Ahead]] and also William Greider's, [[ASIN:0684862204 The Soul of Capitalism: Opening Paths to a Moral Economy]].<br /><br />The alter ego of this book, in this case from Latin America, is Alvaro Vargas Llosa's \\"[[ASIN:0374185743 Liberty for Latin America: How to Undo Five Hundred Years of State Oppression (Independent Studies in Political Economy)]]  As populism sweeps across Latin America, and Western corporations are expelled, as Hugo Chavez in Venezuela works to extend European concepts of Social Democracy and egalitarian distribution of wealth, this book (\\"Confessions\\") can be said to be the equivalent of Martin Luther's posting to the cathedral door--it outlines all the reasons why Americans--US citizens--must heal themselves and retake control over their own economy, ceasing the transfer of its plagues to others.<br /><br />At root, this book is about what we teach in our schools and practice in our daily lives: values, or a lack there-of.  Together with other related books, such as Clyde Prestowitz' [[ASIN:B000A1ETWO Rogue Nation: American Unilateralism and the Failure of Good Intentions]] this book makes crystal clear the fact that we have abandoned our original morality and focus on a Republic offering hope to all mankind, and instead created an Empire, by, of, and for the 1% of the American population that is now in super-sized wealthy elite status.<br /><br />Most upper middle class and wealthy elite Americans will be made uncomfortable by this book.  Having been educated by largely marginal educational systems where cheating is tolerated and rote learning pays lip service to the concept of developing independent intellects, most will find this book shocking to the point of wondering if it is false.  Instead, I would join the author in suggesting that it is we who are living the lie, we who have lost faith with our Founding Fathers.<br /><br />According to the author, there is a clear and present danger to all Americans, and to the rest of the world, of continuing a system of \\"off the books\\" national security practices which revolve around \\"independent\\" corporate activities that seek to subvert and impoverish Third World nations for the enrichment of a narrow elite in America, and a narrower elite within each of the countries being targeted.<br /><br />One cannot help but be impressed by the commonality of themes between this author, and the fatwa's of Bin Laden and the charismatic populism of Hugo Chavez.  Indeed, the author goes so far as to suggest, obliquely but clearly, that Bin Laden and others who oppose US multinational imperialism are closer to the spirit of Tom Paine than those who claim to represent America.  Reading [[ASIN:1400065763 Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency]] and [[ASIN:0312424620 Running on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It]] I must agree.<br /><br />What I see, having specialized in predicting revolutions many years ago, is that we have reached a tipping point.  The author treats 9-11 as his own tipping point, an event that caused him to overcome a vow of silence and bring forth his story for public consumption.  On a larger scale, what I see, both at home, where cheating is epidemic across all the professions and in all walks of life, and abroad, where legalized looting of countries takes place in the guide of \\"free trade\\" rather than \\"fair trade,\\" is an impending spontaneous combustion of populations and economies.<br /><br />Three side notes:<br /><br />First, the author highlights the role of the Department of Treasury as a national security and foreign affairs actor.  Those who have read Sterling and Peggy Seagrave's [[ASIN:1844675319 Gold Warriors: America's Secret Recovery of Yamashita's Gold]] will have an easier time understanding how Treasury might maintain \\"off the books\\" national security funds that can  be used to corrupt foreigners and fund covert action campaigns so secret even the CIA is not privy to them-truly a form of White House influence that needs to be better  understood.<br /><br />Second, the author underscores how little Americans actually know about what is going on overseas, in part because the capital city newspapers overseas, the mainstay of what the US government and US media read, ignore the provincial papers, and in part because we have no truly independent objective Open Source (Information Agency that can collect and integrate \\"ground truth\\" on behalf of the public.  His depiction of the differing perspectives in Latin America-those we call terrorists consider  themselves patriots fighting immoral actions to dam rivers and destroy forests as well as entire tribes-is provocative.<br /><br />Third and finally, the author illuminates the unholy alliance between corporations intend on taking over foreign territory with unexploited gold, oil, or other riches, and certain religious organizations, chief among them the mis-named Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), that use a variety of dirty tricks, including laxative-laden food gifts and duplicitous \\"land grabbing\\" techniques, to move tribes away from the riches and to obtain land grants under false pretenses.<br /><br />As China and India woo Latin America, along with Iran, Pakistan, and Russia, I anticipate a clear and present danger to America: our immoral carpet-bagging is setting the stage for us to be thrown out of the region, with consequences for our economy that are staggering.

As a pre-amble, I would note that a Nobel Prize was given in the late 1990's to a man that demonstrates that trust lowers the cost of doing business.  Morality matters--immorality imposes a pervasive sustained, insidious, long-term, and ultimately fatal cost on any community, any Republic, and that is the core message of this book that most reviewers seem to be missing.<br /><br />Any student of national security can tell you that one of the most important sources of national power is the population, followed by the economy, natural resources, and then the more traditional sources of national power: diplomacy, military, law enforcement, and government policies generally.<br /><br />What this author makes clear is that our population has become a cheating population, one that cheats in school, cheats their employer, and cheats their clients (lawyers, accountants, doctors, all cheating).  Such a population is literally undermining national security by creating false values, and undermining true values.  Some simple examples: an estimated $250 Billion a year in individual tax avoidance; an estimated $600 Billion a year in theft from employers; an estimated $250 Billion a year in legalized corporate tax avoidance and investor fraud; and an additional $250 Billion a year in legalized theft form the individual taxpayers through Congressional support for unnecessary and ill-advised \\"subsidies\\" for agriculture, fishing, and forestry, as well as waivers of environmental standards that ultimately result in long-term external diseconomies...<br /><br />At root, the author observes that pervasive cheating ensues from the perception by the majority that \\"everyone does it\\" and that the rules are not being enforced--that \\"the system\\" lacks legitimacy.  In other countries, illegitimacy might lead to revolution, a revolt of the masses.  In the USA, still a very rich country, the poor are cheating on the margins while the rich are looting the country, and we are not yet at a \\"tipping point\\" such as a new Great Depression might inspire.<br /><br />This is a thoughtful book, and it does not deserve the negative comments from those whom the book most likely is describing all too well.  Cheating diminishes trust and reduces value.  America has become corrupt across all the professions, within Congress, within the media, within the political level of government (the civil service remains a bastion of propriety).<br /><br />What price freedom?  What price the Republic?  You may or may not choose to agree with this author's diagnosis and prescription, but in my view, he gets to the heart of the matter.  It's about integrity.

Wilson [[ASIN:0679768114 The Future of Life]], Martin Rees [[ASIN:B000GH2YWE OUR FINAL HOUR: A Scientist's warning : How Terror, Error, and Environmental Disaster Threaten Humankind's Future in This Century--On Earth and Beyond]], J. F. Rischard [[ASIN:0465070108 High Noon 20 Global Problems, 20 Years to Solve Them]], or the more obvious Club of Rome and that Brown guy.  Indeed, for the general audience, J. F. Rischard remains the best overview and the best value.<br /><br />Having said that, I do not discourage the purchase and absorption of this book.  Much of it can be skipped through if you have read other books that do a better job on any individual item (to his credit, the author provides an excellent bibliographic review in his expanded notes section).  It is largely a kludge of the ideas and investigations of many others, but does--and this is why it gets four stars from me--pull together in one place, in a very interesting manner, a broad variety of investigations and conclusions.<br /><br />Here are the highlights that I found worthy of reflection:<br /><br />1)  Gives useful emphasis to the word \\"ecocide\\" while bringing forward excellent reviews of how \\"creeping normalcy\\" and \\"landscape amnesia\\" can undermine any perception of danger or urgency.<br /><br />2)  Summarizes, but not as elegantly as J. F. Rischard, 12 problems and a 5-point framework of contributing factors.<br /><br />3)  Focuses on big business as the core player that must reform, but also emphasizes that big business will not reform until the public lives up to its responsibility for changing the rules of the game and making green business profitable.<br /><br />4)  Provides an impressive, nuanced, and helpful view of China and non-traditional threats coming out of China, including invasive plant and animal species, and noxious gases leaving China with the winds.<br /><br />5)  Alarms regarding Australia, the English-speaking outpost in Asia, which appears much more fragile and vulnerable to collapse than generally appreciated.<br /><br />6)  Explores the destructive nature of religious values that cause deforestation or over-population or other ills that impact on the commons.<br /><br />7)  Bluntly relates environmental instability to political instability.  Max Manwaring does it better in his edited work \\"Environmental Security,\\" but for the general audience, these few pages are important.<br /><br />8)  Provides a concise and helpful thrashing of the 12 or so most common objections to being prudent about our environment.<br /><br />Deep inside this book, and finally summarized by the author, is a focus on the failure of decision making at all levels of society.  A failure to anticipate, a failure to perceive, a failure to attempt remediation, or even if attempted, a failure to achieve remediation, are all failures of each group and its leadership.<br /><br />The author ends thoughtfully by noting that resolution of our imbalances will come one way or the other.  The only choice we have is between peaceful planned sustainable changes, and catastrophic imposed \\"natural\\" corrections through war, famine, pestilence, and genocide.<br /><br />I am very glad to have purchased this book, and would note that it did not make the cut via online browsing, but when examined in an airport bookstore, was found, once in hand and on direct inspection, to be worth the price of purchase and the time to absorb.<br /><br />Edit of 20 Dec 07.In a larger s trategic context, what I do not see in this book is an emphasis on strategic culture or getting a grip on global reality.

What the author does not do is provide a more documented analysis of why and how Congress has become disconnected from the people it is supposed to represent, or why the Executive does not balance Congress when the latter abuse their powers.  The \\"balance of power\\" is in fact a \\"balance of pork privileges,\\" and it is this inability, as the author describes it, to focus on all the facts, in an objective way, in order to make the best application of the taxpayer dollar, that cripples Congress (and the Executive).<br /><br />I've given the author four stars because I disagree with those who would demean his motives.  What I read here is consistent with the other books I have read--and my own experience talking to generally witless under-educated staff (because I am not important enough to get to the few who are \\"top notch\\").  When the author open his book by pointing out that ***all*** watchdog or balancing elements--the media, the think tanks--have failed to hold Congress accountable, I must agree with him.<br /><br />The most interesting \\"thread\\" within the book has to do with information--what information gets where, who sees it, what do they do with it.  At the end, the author concludes, most Members are not doing their homework, and most staffs are too busy focused on inserting partisan advantage and localized pork to actually serve the people of the United States in an effective manner.<br /><br />The book is unusual in being focused on national security and defense, where the author spent his entire career, and what jumped out at me is that Congress has no grand strategy--Congress, like the Executive, is fragmented into stovepipes and is not able to make thoughtful trade-offs at the big picture level between Diplomacy Information Military Economic (DIME) instruments of national power.<br /><br />The author is severely critical, and rightly so, I believe, in lambasting the Members for abdicating their Constitutional power to declare war.  On page 221 he says that it is clear that Members consider their re-election prospects more important than the need to stand tall and oppose a war they do not support.<br /><br />The author ends by proposing 12 steps for Congressional reform, among the most important of which is exposure of the truth to the public: no more Congressional Record \\"revisions,\\" no more secret back-room meetings, no more fake camera shots showing Senators speaking to an empty room; no more lightweight partisan staff shuttling to jobs in the Executive they are supposed to help oversee; no more stone-walling of the press; and no more lobbyists with direct access--only constituents.  These are all common sense suggestions that are helpful to the public interest.<br /><br />The author's last two sentences of the book are most helpful of all: \\"There is really only one thing that will force members of Congress to perform as best as they are able.  That is for the public to have the information to distinguish the good from the bad and the phonies from the sincere.\\"<br /><br />Public information in the public interest...this is the key.<br /><br />See also, published since then:<br />[[ASIN:0312424620 Running on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It]]<br />[[ASIN:0195174461 The Broken Branch: How Congress Is Failing America and How to Get It Back on Track (Institutions of American Democracy)]]<br />[[ASIN:0785262202 Breach of Trust: How Washington Turns Outsiders Into Insiders]]<br /><br />New Links 10 Oct 08:<br />[[ASIN:0805088156 The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism]]<br />[[ASIN:0316164968 The Fifty-Year Wound: How America's Cold WarVictory Has Shaped Our World]]<br />[[ASIN:0805077979 The Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire Project)]]<br />[[ASIN:0922915865 War is a Racket: The Antiwar Classic by America's Most Decorated Soldier]]<br />[[ASIN:1400065763 Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency]]the Republic (The American Empire Project)]]  [[ASIN:0922915865 War is a Racket: The Antiwar Classic by America's Most Decorated Soldier]]  [[ASIN:1400065763 Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency]]	2005-02-12
352553:US	50761804	R2CCLD872AE4DA	0275981924	508451387	Transformation Under Fire: Revolutionizing How America Fights	Books	4	22	25	N	Y	On target & useful--a master speaks	I hold this author to a higher standard, for he is in the top rank of perhaps 10 people who really know what they are talking about with respect to transformation.  I believe he is the single most important mind behind the Army's recent transition from 10 divisions to 40+ brigades as the basic form of organization.  Where he falls short (and remember, this is a master who in falling short is still light years ahead of the others) is in not going far enough: in not carrying his ideas out to inter-agency collaboration and multi-national inter-agency planning and coalition operations.<br /><br />He also fails to properly put the failings of the US Navy and the US Air Force in context.  The US Navy today is a disgrace, largely incapable of moving anything or getting anywhere at flank speed, and the US Air Force is even worse off--incapable of lifting what needs to be lifted, when it needs to be lifted, in the distances and quantities that need to be lifted.  Without a chapter on this joint \\"sucking chest wound,\\" the author's otherwise brilliant work loses much of its potential at the SecDef level.<br /><br />This is a very serious book, not an essay.  It is packed with substantive information, it is well-documented, and the footnotes are as useful as the main text.<br /><br />The underlying theme in this book is that the Chief of Staff of the Army will not succeed until he breaks the back of the cultural mafia that persists--like the horse cavalry of old--in focusing on big units and expensive platforms.  While the author is among the foremost and earliest proponents of small, fast, and many, it is clear to me that he does not consider the current Army to be moving in the right direction--a direction that he makes clear could lead to our achieving a sufficiency within months rather than years.<br /><br />Perhaps the most revolutionary underlying theme in this book is that of how to deal with information.  The author may well be the most intelligent helpful commentator I have read in this respect.  On page 102 he focuses on the fact that \\"Command centers where information is collected and transmitted should not be information monopolies,\\" and he focuses throughout on the urgent need to use \\"commander's intent\\" (a concept of operations pioneered by Marine Corps Commandant Al Gray) and fluid lateral information sharing to increase situational awareness and agility at the tactical level.<br /><br />Published in 2004 and not doubt polished in 2003, this book gives the US Army a failing grade for the future while noting that it could--with application and innovation, get back to the Honor Roll within months, rather than years.<br /><br />I am a Marine and I discount the \\"hate and discontent\\" from disgruntled Marines writing reviews against this book.  There is a big difference between Marines from the sea carrying out largely amphibious missions, and soldiers (and increasingly in today's army, contractors at a ratio of 1:1) in for the long haul.  We need a 450 ship Navy, a 2 Berlin Airlift Air Force, a 45+ brigade Army, a 3 MEF USMC, a doubled Coast Guard, a tripled State Department, and a whole new focus on inter-agency and multinational armies and related peacekeeping cadres.  It is not enough to fix Army--we need a grand strategy for using all of the instruments of national power over a 100 year timeframe.  In this context, the book gets an A for giving Army the slap in the face it needs right now, and a C+ for missing the larger picture within which the Army, no matter how transformed, will fail because everything else in the USG is failing when it comes to coordinated sustainable inter-agency operations.  Theater commanders and Army ground forces cannot win the war alone, nor can they make peace on their own.<br /><br />One final word of praise: the author is an honorable man of great moral courage who speaks his mind in the public interest.  Within the book he has harsh things to say about ticket-punching careerist officers, and think tank harlots who give their masters what they want, not what they need to hear.  I salute and will follow any man such as this.  We need more like him.t, not what they need to hear.  I salute and will follow any man such as this.  We need more like him.	2005-02-12

His two key points are clear: 4th Generation Wars take decades, not months as the Pentagon likes to fight; and only 4th Generation Wars have defeated super-powers--the US losing three times, Russia in Afghanistan, France in Viet-Nam, etc.<br /><br />The author offers solid critiques of the Pentagon's mediocre strategy (Joint Vision 20XX) and its preference for technology over people, an excellent short list of key players in world affairs, interesting lists and a discussion of insurgent versus coalition force strengths and weaknesses in Iraq, and a brutal--positively brutal--comparison of the pathetic performance of \\"secret\\" imagery taking days or weeks to order up, versus, \\"good enough\\" commercial imagery that can be gotten in hours.<br /><br />There are flashes of brilliance that suggest that the author's next book will be just as good if not better.  He understands the war of ideas and talks about insurgent handbills as a form of ammunition that the US is not seeing, reading, or understanding; he points out that Al Qaeda is like a venture capitalist, franchising and subsidizing or inspiring distributed terrorism; and he is superbly on target, on page 39, when he points out that when Al Qaeda attacks in the US, the only thing that is \\"moving\\" is information or knowledge.  Everything else they pick up locally--hence, US homeland security comes down to intercepting the information, not the players or the things they use to attack us.<br /><br />The author is among those who feel that we must nail Egypt, Syria, and Iran, among others (I would include Pakistan), for exporting support to terrorism.<br /><br />I have a number of underlinings and margin comments throughout this book, so it is by no means a light read.  It is a very fine place to start understanding war in the 21st Century, and an excellent foundation for reading the more nuanced and broader works of GI Wilson, Max Manwaring, Steve Metz, Ralph Peters, and others.<br /><br />Other seminal works in this area, with reviews:<br />[[ASIN:0806137118 Uncomfortable Wars Revisited (International and Security Affairs Series)]]<br />[[ASIN:0275968634 The Search for Security: A U.S. Grand Strategy for the Twenty-First Century]]<br />[[ASIN:0963869574 Tactics of the Crescent Moon: Militant Muslim Combat Methods]]<br />[[ASIN:0963869566 The Tiger's Way: A U.S. Private's Best Chance for Survival]]<br />[[ASIN:1574885553 War of the Flea: The Classic Study of Guerrilla Warfare]]<br />[[ASIN:081170274X Wars of Blood and Faith: The Conflicts That Will Shape the 21st Century]]underlinings and margin comments throughout this book, so it is by no means a light read.

His is the kind of intellect that Harry Truman had in mind when CIA was created, with its motto, from John 8:32, regarding the importance of truth.  Get the facts.  This author is a master of the facts, and I am somewhat ashamed, having fallen prey to \\"facts\\" from others, that I should have to learn these facts from a Frenchman.<br /><br />On every page there is an eye-opener, and what I came to realize is that this author is demonstrating what public diplomacy *should* be in America--on every single page he compares and contrasts what anti-Americans are claiming against America, what the real facts are, and what the facts are for Europe, where it is oh so fashionable to be critical of America when in fact Europe has done far less for the world, and for its own people.<br /><br />Four facts stand out that bear emphasis, for they represent what this author has done so well with this book:<br /><br />1)  Europe provides four times the subsidies for its farmers than does America for American farmers.<br /><br />2)  Africa has received the equivalent of a hundred Marshall Plans since World War II, only to squander them all in corruption.<br /><br />3)  The US Senate rejected the Kyoto Treaty under Clinton, not Bush, and Clinton's executive order leaving Bush holding the bag as a deliberate political gambit.<br /><br />4)  There is a one to one correlation between globalization and the improvement of the lot of the poor in the least developed countries.<br /><br />Now, having \\"accepted\\" some of this author's fact, which correct \\"facts\\" I had previously accepted, what really hit home with me is that we need to get all these facts on the table, subject to the collective intelligence of the people, and we need to do a much better job of communicating the facts to both our own domestic public, and the international audience.  \\"Public diplomacy\\" in America stinks, in part because Otto Reich thinks he can do public diplomacy by assertion rather than by demonstration.  Facts--open source intelligence--is what will work.  The Department of State is not doing its homework, precisely because it refuses to be serious about open sources of information and the process of distilling information into overt intelligence.<br /><br />The book is sometimes tedious but always rewarding.  It is here that I learn that the Algerian terrorists were frustrated in 1994 in their plans to hijack an airplane and fly it into the Eiffel Tower.  It is here that I see, explained in excellent context, the term \\"hyperterrorism.\\"  It is here that I see discussed as some length the \\"myth of Muslim moderation,\\" and where I also see a persuasive condemnation of multi-culturalism and bi-lingual education.<br /><br />I recommend this book be read in conjunction with Lee Harris, [[ASIN:0743257499 Civilization and Its Enemies: The Next Stage of History]].  Jean-Francois Revel helps us see the history of the past as we should: America with warts, but triumphant.  Lee Harris helps us see the history of the future as we should: America at risk, unless it becomes ruthless at the same time that it faces reality.<br /><br />This book has forced me to re-evaluate a great deal of what I took to be \\"scholarship\\" that I now realize needs to be subjected to much closer scrutiny.  We need more facts on the public table.

I have taken one star off for lack of detail and context, but strongly recommend the book to anyone who has served in the clandestine service and wishes to be reminded of the dark years, and to anyone who has not served in the clandestine service, and wishes to have a small glimmering of the down side of it all.<br /><br />Although the book does a good job of weaving a somewhat superficial (that is to say, the highlights, not the irrelevant) history of counter-terrorism with a history of bureaucratic mis-steps by a series of DCIs, and the book does a superb  job of shredding both CIA lawyers and CIA security officers and CIA's complete lack of counterintelligence, this is primarily a book about the failure of the Directorate of Operations as a tribe, not about the failure of the US Government in the global war on terrorism.<br /><br />In retrospect, 1983-1985 are the years when the USG and the IC should have gone to \\"General Quarters,\\" and 1992 was the year when Congress should have risen to its role and passed the Boren-McCurdy National Security Act of 1992.  No one comes out of this book looking better than Senator Dave Boren (today the President of the University of Oklahoma) and Congressman Dave McCurdy, both from Oklahoma, both in charge of the respective committees on intelligence, and both bright men with good hearts who were unable to prevail against their less enlightened colleagues.<br /><br />The author does an excellent job of capturing some of the really low moments in CIA's clandestine history (such as in the 1990's when case officers were advised to take out legal liability insurance, both to protect themselves from CIA witch-hunts and to protect themselves from witch hunts mounted by others against which CIA would not be helpful to them).<br /><br />The author, who got into trouble over some Palestinian relations that led to her being fired, has *not* written a bitter or a revenge book.  This is an excellent and useful book, and for those who wish to study the CIA's clandestine service and its ups and downs in the 1980-2005 timeframe, this is destined to be a core reference.  It captures nuances and insights that are not available to outsiders in any other source.<br /><br />I do, however, want to highlight the author's brief discussion of CIA Security and the shortcomings of CIA security, the excessive reliance by CIA Security on the polygraph (which both Ames and the Cuban agents that blew two of my classmates passed), and the \\"room from hell\\" that is created by CIA Security and CIA management for those who are \\"suspect,\\" more often than not without cause.  I was stunned to learn that in the post-Ames environment 400 case officers (400--that is, by some accounts, at least 10% and perhaps as much as 30% of the entire case officer corps!) failed the polygraph as roughly administered by CIA Security, and were referred to the FBI for full field investigations.  I cannot articulate the depth of my disdain for any CIA manager that would allow that to happen.<br /><br />There is a great deal wrong at CIA, and I give the author top marks on her discussion of CIA's over-all attitude of denial and deception across two decades; and her helpful discussion of the culture of deceitand self-service that has prevented the clandestine service from adjusting to reality and being more effective in protecting America.  However, as the author is careful to point out, CIA's failure take place in the context of the failures of the FBI, of the White House, and of other governments.<br /><br />This is not a book I recommend for applicants to the clandestine service, mostly because I do not want to see them dissuaded from applying.  The clandestine service is the last great adventure left in the U.S. government, outside of special operations, and no matter how screwed up it might yet be, there is no greater honor and no greater life-affirming engagement, than to be a case officer in the service of your country.

I strongly recommend this book for purchase by those with a limited knowledge of the world of intelligence, and for use as an undergraduate text.<br /><br />It fails to satisfy at the professional level for two reasons: a lack of adequate attention to professional-level publications, and a lack of discussion of nuances vital to future success.<br /><br />Despite its being published in 2005 and presumably rounded out in 2004, the author has failed to consult--this is quite an extraordinary lapse--*any* of the intelligence reform books of note, from Allen \\"[[ASIN:1566633877 None So Blind: A Personal Account of the Intelligence Failure in Vietnam]] to Berkowitz' [[ASIN:0300093977 Best Truth: Intelligence in the Information Age]] to Johnson [[ASIN:081474253X Bombs, Bugs, Drugs, and Thugs: Intelligence and America's Quest for Security]] to Odom \\"Fixing Intelligence\\" to Treverton [[ASIN:052153349X Reshaping National Intelligence for an Age of Information (RAND Studies in Policy Analysis)]] to Zeegart [[ASIN:080474131X Flawed by Design: The Evolution of the CIA, JCS, and NSC]]...and many others.  As I carefully reviewed each chapter, I could only lament the fact that each chapter would have been twice as excellent had the author taken the trouble to integrate key observations from the recent literature.<br /><br />I was also struck by the author's excessive reliance on just two journals, \\"Studies in Intelligence\\" (the CIA in-house publication) and \\"International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence,\\" for most of his references that were not largely dated books.  Seymour Hersh of \\"The New Yorker,\\" Jim Fallows of \\"The Atlantic Monthly,\\" even Vernon Loeb, the only really focused Washington Post journalist covering intelligence, these are not cited.<br /><br />Consequently, the professional with over ten years experience, and the academic scholar with over ten years alternative reading, need not spend time with this book.  It is lacking in nuance--for example, the brief section on imagery intelligence does not discuss the findings of the National Imagery and Mapping Agency Report of December 1999, and the section on open source intelligence--while dramatically superior to most publications--is seriously in error when it labels open sources \\"expensive\\" without reference to the $50 billion a year we are spending now on secret sources that fail to satisfy.  The author, speaking from a limited perspective as an analyst who has never managed a major budget, does not seem to realize that open sources cost less than 1% of the total national intelligence budget while producing 40% or more of all useful information.<br /><br />A future edition of the book would benefit from a chapter on different types of threats and what that implies in terms of collection and analysis challenges, and from a focus on sub-state threats, not just other governments.

This book has done so.  Although I have been uneasy for many years with America's loss of its warrior ethic and fit society, and the abdication by many Americans of their civic responsibility to understand foreign events and forces that threaten our way of life, this book for the first time in my somewhat extensive reading, has both crystallized the \\"fire alarm\\" nature of 9/11 in a unique manner, and caused me to hold the neo-conservative and unilateral militarists in somewhat greater regard.  It even caused me to appreciate Zionism is a new light (while still despising corruption, lies, deception of allies, and inherent genocide--but still, a new look)--quite an accomplishment.<br /><br />This is a difficult book to read--I recommend that it be read quickly, for flavor, rather than slowly, for trying to understand each sentence and each page could result in a loss of interest and quitting on the author before reaching the end.  It's easier if you simply plug ahead and mark the high points--the book is full of gems of insight.<br /><br />It is a very intelligent book, the *opposite* of the blind bible-thumping \\"there's only one book that matters\\" true believers that I am accustomed to hearing from, yet this book very elegantly complements the obsessive views of the bible-thumpers.  This awesome book comes down to one question: what are you willing to die for? and one challenge: how many of you (us) are willing to die for anything at all?<br /><br />The most important point that I drew out of this book was its legitimate and here-to-fore unarticulated criticism of intellectuals and liberals for having forgotten that their hard won liberties came at the cost of blood, and that utopian ideals are fantasies that distract one from the harsh truths of the real world.  Others will focus on the author's more publicized point, that Al Qaeda is a ruthless enemy that hates us to the point of wanting to simply die while we die with it, and that is a useful point, but the two go together: we cannot be effective against our external enemy unless we also recognize our internal enemy, those mind-sets that prevent us from being effective in defending our values and our liberties.<br /><br />There are three flaws or missing contexts in this book, and I mention them only to stress that while I hold this book in very high regard and am more accepting or tolerant of the neo-conservative viewpoint as a result, it is a partial view, nothing more.  It does not address the corruption within our own society, where elected presidents, corporate CEOS, the churches, the New York Times, charities, and--today--the Boy Scouts--are all found to lack ethics and be frauds; it does not address the external diseconomies imposed by immoral capitalism; and it does not address the stark realities overseas that are going to wipe us out without any help from terrorists: the 59 plagues, the 18 genocides, the 32 failed states, the loss of potable water, etc.<br /><br />In short, this author is absolutely world class on the fundamentals of recognizing that some people, you simply have to hunt down and kill.  He does not address what I think of as \\"track two\\": we need to stabilize & reconstruct the rest of the world so as to minimize the number of people we have to hunt down and kill.<br /><br />He makes a good and excellent case for acting unilaterally, and for ignoring--even being dismissive of--the fraud of \\"sovereignty\\" that is represented by the United Nations and all these little \\"piss-ant\\" countries that are comprised of an elite that loots the country, and masses of impoverished, illiterate, \\"peasants\\" that represent potential hoards of human locusts carrying disease, crime, and instability wherever they migrate to....<br /><br />He does not, however, satisfy me in addressing the lack of good faith among leaders who correctly choose to defend the nation with unilateral militarism, but also choose to lie to the public and betray the public trust by concocting false claims and by manipulating secret intelligence to their own ends.<br /><br />On balance I find this book to be extremely important--one that liberals as well as conservative must read.  It stresses the role of family as an antidote to gangs (something Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore champions constantly, and the Chinese generally have understood for centuries).  The author also criticizes modern education for presenting \\"finished\\" or ideal concepts, and not providing the students with the life experience to learn the hard way that life is about compromise, trade-offs, partial satisfaction, etcetera.  He ends by celebrating creative destruction and the value of commitment, including blind faith commitment when crunch time comes and one has to be obedient to the leaders we have trusted with our survival.<br /><br />I value what this author has done.  I take from this work three goals for the future:<br /><br />1)  We must reconstitute our society as a fit society with a warrior ethic and an inclination to study the outside world, not simply retreat into drugs/alcohol and sedative soap operas;<br /><br />2)  We must, as a society, agree that ruthlessness and the will to fight to the death matters, when faced by enemies that have no thought of compromise and have demonstrated by suicide that they are more than willing to do so themselves; and<br /><br />3)  We must--this is the part the author does not cover (see my lists for books that do)--formulate a grand strategy, a sustainable grand strategy, for addressing the 20 global problems that J.F. Rischard has identified, so as to prevent those problems from spawning more terrorists and sending our way more plagues, more illegal immigrants, more criminals.<br /><br />This book is easily one of 25 books that I would recommend to every American and to most foreigners.choose to defend the nation with unilateral militarism, but also choose to lie to the public and betray the public trust by concocting false claims and by manipulating secret intelligence to their own ends. <br /> <br />On balance I find this book to be extremely important--one that liberals as well as conservative must read.

Although I was disappointed by finding that only 20% of the book covers spies and lies, while 80% covers bureaucratic bungling and leadership failures with in the FBI, overall I put it down fully satisfied.<br /><br />We all know now that Al Qaeda was never operating in secret, and even today, is not operating in secret.  We are simply incompetent at looking at open sources in foreign languages.  IC Smith conveys this perfectly early on in his book, on page 7, when he repeats something he said that was published in the media, to wit \\"These guys were not superhuman, but they were playing in a system that was more inept than they were.\\"  I share IC's anger over the FBI's failure to translate and exploit the many boxes of documents in Arabic that were captured in the Philippines and after the first World Trade Center attack, the botched car bombing.<br /><br />If there is one word that summarizes this book's message, beyond incompetency, it is \\"corruption.\\"  IC Smith tells it like it is when he discusses Congressional corruption, refusing to fix known problems in the Intelligence Community; Presidential corruption in abusing power and covering up those abuses; state-level corruption across Arkansas; intelligence community management corruption and malfeasance--some would even say treason, although IC avoids this word.<br /><br />On a very practical level, IC Smith is probably the foremost authority to come forward and denounce the practice of having prosecuting attorneys manage investigations.  The book has many examples of where trained investigators were not allowed to do their job, and prosecutors botched or blocked investigations that would have otherwise been timely and successful.<br /><br />In passing, he skewers the staff at the FBI Academy, almost none of whom have actual street experience (nor do most FBI managers at the wood-paneled office level), and it is clear that while America has many dedicated Americans serving within the FBI, they are badly trained and badly led.<br /><br />In addition to this book I recommend Michael Levine's [[ASIN:0595092640 Deep Cover: The Inside Story of How DEA Infighting, Incompetence and Subterfuge Lost Us the Biggest Battle of the Drug War]] (on the Drug Enforcement Agency), and Mark Riebling's [[ASIN:0743245997 Wedge: From Pearl Harbor to 9/11--How the Secret War between the FBI and CIA Has Endangered National Security]] (on the FBI-CIA wars that continue to this day), as well as George Allen's book [[ASIN:1566633877 None So Blind: A Personal Account of the Intelligence Failure in Vietnam]] (on the continuing ability of the White House--regardless of occupation--and the Intelligence Community--to lie to themselves, to Congress, and to the American people).<br /><br />IC is a straight shooter.

While the US continues to support 44 dictators--something that is addressed by Ambassador Mark Palmer is his superb book on \\"The Real Axis of Evil\\" and therefore something we have to stop before we can credibly criticize the United Nations, the author makes a strong case for dumping the UN and moving toward a new form of organization that is comprised of only the democratic nations that are not corrupt and that can pay their bills.<br /><br />The author arouses fury, at least in me, when he points out that Russia and China have manipulated the system and avoided their responsibilities by paying, in 2003, $18.6 million for Russia and $23.7 million for China, this at a time when the US is paying 22% of the entire United Nations system budget.  ENOUGH!!<br /><br />There are over 15 places throughout the book where I have  \\"AGREE!\\" in the margins, and I give the author very high marks for itemizing everything that is wrong with the United Nations and that needs to be fixed in a new organization.  At one point, I could even see the great value of throwing the UN out of the US, of the Rockefeller family repossessing the land they gave to the UN for its HQS.  Enough.  Let them move to Geneva while we create a completely new building and a completely new democratic-capitalist organization that can serve as the political and economic counterpart to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)<br /><br />This brings up another point--the author very wisely points out all that is wrong with the European countries that abuse their NATO membership to get a free ride on regional security, when they are unwilling to invest even minimalist amounts in their own armed forces and in forces that could be use to the coalition.  The author makes important points against both Germany and France that need to be understood by all Americans.<br /><br />I do not normally agree with all that neo-conservatives say, but in this case, I believe the author has rendered a stellar service, and his book is not only worthwhile, it is politically actionable.

It was recommended to me by the author of [[ASIN:0071384715 Building a Knowledge-Driven Organization]] and I now recommend it to everyone I know.  If there are two books that can \\"change the world,\\" these are the ones.<br /><br />Although the Chinese understood all this stuff centuries ago (Yin/Yang, space between the dots, the human web), the author is correct when she notes late in the book that the commoditization of the human worker (Cf. Lionel Tiger, [[ASIN:071452929X Manufacture of Evil: Ethics, Evolution, and the Industrial System]]) and the emphasis on scientific objectivity and scientific manager (Cf. Jean Ralston Saul, [[ASIN:0679748199 Voltaire's Bastards: The Dictatorship of Reason in the West]]) were perhaps the greatest error we might have made in terms of long-run progress.  Coincidentally, as I finished the book, on the Discovery channel in the background they were discussing how the leveeing of the Mississippi blocked the Louisiana watershed from cleansing the Mississippi naturally, as it once used to.<br /><br />It's all about systems--the author does cite Donella Meadows' 1982 article in Stewart Brand's Co-Evolution Quarterly, but does not pay much heed to the large body of literature that thrived in the 1970's around the Club of Rome.<br /><br />There are perhaps three bottom lines in this book that I would recommend to any government leader who hopes to stabilize and reconstruct our world:<br /><br />1)  Information is what defines who we are, what we can become, what we can perceive, what we are capable of achieving.  Blocking or controlling information flows stunts our growth and virtually assures defeat if not death.  It is the optimization of listening--being open to *all* information (and especially all the information the secret world now ignores)--that optimizes our ability to adjust, evolve, and grow.<br /><br />2)  Command & control is history, block and wire diagrams are history.  General Al Gray had it right in the 1990's when he talked about \\"commander's intent\\" as the baseline.  Leaders today need to be disruptive, to look for dissonant views and news, and to empower all individuals at all levels with both information, and the authority to act on that information.<br /><br />3)  Disorder is an *opportunity*.  We have the power to define ourselves, our \\"opponents,\\" and our circumstances in ways that can either inspire protective, constricted, secretive, \\"armed\\" responses, or inclusive, open, sharing \\"pro-active\\" peaceful responses.<br /><br />The author is to be praised for noting early on in the book that \\"Ethical and moral questions are no longer fuzzy religious concepts but key elements in the relationship any organization has with colleagues, stakeholders, and communities.\\"  I would extend that to note that social ethics and foreign policy ethics are the foundation for sustainable life on the planet, and we appear to be a long way from understanding that it is ethics, not guns, that will stabilize and fertilize...Cf Jonathan Schell, [[ASIN:0805044566 The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People]].<br /><br />It also merits comment that the author essentially kills the industry of forecasting, scenarios, modeling, and futures simulations.  I agree with her view (and that of others) that early warning is achieved, not through the theft of secret plans and intentions or the forecasting of behavior, but rather by casting a very wide net, listening carefully to all that is openly available, sharing it very widely (as the LINUX guys say, put enough eyeballs on it, and no bug will be invisible), and then being open to changed relationships.  Trying to maintain the status quo will simply not do.<br /><br />I give the author credit for carrying out an extraordinary survey of the literature on quantum mechanics, and for developing a PhD-level explanation of why old organization theory, based on the linear concepts of Newtonian physics, is bad for us, and how the new emergent organization theory, understood by too few, is let about the things and more about the relationships between and among the things.<br /><br />This is an elegant essay and a heroic personal work of discovery, interpretation, and integration.  While I would have liked to see more credit given to Kuhn, Drucker, Garfield, Brand, Rheingold, and numerous others that I have reviewed here for Amazon, on balance, given the academic narrowness of her Harvard PhD, I think the author has performed at the Olympic level.  This is a radical book, somewhat reminiscent of Charles Hampden-Turner's book, [[ASIN:0385084242 Radical Man: The Process of Psycho-Social Development.]] which as I recall was not accepted by Harvard as a thesis at the time.

397830:US	50761804	R2N5LGMH6UJ12H	0231129130	557815803	Enforcing the Peace: Learning from the Imperial Past	Books	4	8	8	N	Y	Worthwhile but Stops Short	This book came highly recommended to me, but I now believe, after reading it, that is was recommended because it contributes to the tarring of America for being an imperial power in the present, while also documenting the almost certain failure of any imperial power in the present that chooses to a) act unilaterally and b) impose its values and form of governance on an uncooperative indigenous population.<br /><br />On balance, I find the book worthy in so far as it draws parallels between the imperial occupations of the past and those of the present that focus on winning the war but pay no attention to winning the peace.  Unfortunately, the book stops precisely where I was hoping it would start: it fails to address the two biggest aspects of winning the peace: a) inter-agency operations that mobilize *all* sources of national power and b) a deliberate concept, doctrine, manning, funding, and capabilities for stabilization and reconstruction, such as the Defense Science Board has recommended and the US Department of Defense is now implementing.<br /><br />A few notes:<br /><br />1)  The author coins the term \\"complex peace operations\\" where the term is not needed--the author means to discuss peace enforcement missions;<br /><br />2)  The author is completely correct and helpful in pointing out that multilateral operations inspire legitimacy, while unilateral operations inspire counterinsurgency;<br /><br />3)  The author focuses on political will with respect to sustained occupation by military forces (we do not have it), but does not engage in what I regard as the more important discussion, which is the need for political will and wit to understand, as General Tony Zinni understands, that the fastest way to reduce violence and restore legitimacy is to introduce water, food, and medicine to the area;<br /><br />4)  The author very helpfully spends time discussing why the German and Japanese reconstruction models are irrelevant to today's failed states;<br /><br />5)  The author praises the military for being able to do humanitarian and other \\"operations other than war\\" when the military is well-led and carefully monitored, but misses the larger point that most military professionals and historians will gladly point out: one needs both forces--a big war force put into OOTW operations will lose its skill at big war within two years, while also being incompetent at small war/OOTW  for the first two years it is thus engaged;<br /><br />6)  The author suggests, and I believe with good reason based on solid research, that the West is over-reaching when it seeks to impose Western values, Western forms of governance, and even singular governments on ethnic divisions that have stood the test of time--flexibility in accepting multiple forms of self-governance is essential;<br /><br />7)  Finally, and I have seen this myself in Viet-Nam and in El Salvador, and read of it in many other places, the author points out that any time the West intervenes and seeks to select leaders on the basis of its own criteria, it inevitably disregards local realities and ends up creating more friction than it resolves.<br /><br />The author ends with the suggestion that we focus less on instilling liberal democracies, and more in simply assuring sufficient security such that commerce can be practiced and the arts can flourish.<br /><br />This is an ably crafted and documented book, but it stops short.  It urgently needs a companion volume that collects and integrates lessons from successful interventions.  As the book went to press, Haiti was breaking apart for the second time, and I note with interest that the one force that might actually be effective there--the French-speaking French gendarme, is nowhere to be found.<br /><br />Ten other books as good or better:<br />[[ASIN:0316164968 The Fifty-Year Wound: How America's Cold War Victory Has Shaped Our World]]<br />[[ASIN:0805044566 The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People]]<br />[[ASIN:0195161106 The Paradox of American Power: Why the World's Only Superpower Can't Go It Alone]]<br />[[ASIN:1574888625 Imperial Hubris: Why the West Is Losing the War on Terror]]<br />[[ASIN:1574880667 Security Studies for the 21st Century]]<br />[[ASIN:0275968634 The Search for Security: A U.S. Grand Strategy for the Twenty-First Century]]<br />[[ASIN:0198782519 Modern Strategy]]<br />[[ASIN:0670038520 Blessed Unrest: How the Largest Movement in the World Came into Being and Why No One Saw It Coming]]<br />[[ASIN:159659098X The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism: How the Financial System Underminded Social Ideals, Damaged Trust in the Markets, Robbed Investors of Trillions - and What to Do About It]]<br />[[ASIN:0312424620 Running on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It]]]  [[ASIN:1574888625 Imperial Hubris: Why the West Is Losing the War on Terror]]  [[ASIN:1574880667 Security Studies for the 21st Century]]  [[ASIN:0275968634 The Search for Security: A U.S. Grand Strategy for the Twenty-First Century]]  [[ASIN:0198782519 Modern Strategy]]  [[ASIN:0670038520 Blessed Unrest: How the Largest Movement in the World Came into Being and Why No One Saw It Coming]]  [[ASIN:159659098X The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism: How the Financial System Underminded Social Ideals, Damaged Trust in the Markets, Robbed Investors of Trillions - and What to Do About It]]  [[ASIN:0312424620 Running on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It]]	2005-01-06

Some highlights:<br /><br />1)  The big fights, the important fights, take 25 years or more.  The transformative fights, the nation-wide or trans-regional transformations, take 25-50 years.<br /><br />2)  When any government seeks to repress discontent by suspending the due process of law, stand by for a revolution.<br /><br />3)  Fighting this revolution, without a friendly country adjacent to South Africa, and with South African mercenaries and forces all too able to strike at will across Africa, was very very hard.  Bomb-making, communications, all hard.<br /><br />4)  Camaraderie should not be allowed to undermine operational security and counterintelligence.  From day one, misplaced faith and lax checking of backgrounds was very costly, and the ANC was riddled with informers, many of them passed through the US and UK.<br /><br />5)  The Russians, East Germans, and Cubans all provided aid with no strings attached--indeed, the West's excessive propaganda against communism actually inspired interest in communism.  This book is one of the best references I have found, as a US intelligence professional, with respect to the good done by the so-called \\"main enemy\\" in the specific case of South Africa.<br /><br />6)  I  believe the author when he recounts discussions with Russians focusing on the defense nature of their military investments, and their longer-term strategic focus on beating US capitalism in a straight-up economic competition with socialism.  I had to think as I worked through this section: if Ronnie Kasrils could have these discussions, how could CIA get it so wrong all those years?<br /><br />7)  Across the entire book is a full range of clandestine technique.  These guys knew how to use newspaper ads, codes, changes in times and dates, pre-arranged blind meetings, brush passes, dead drops, the whole nine yards.  They lived it--and unlike US spies, who get sent home, if they failed at undercover operations they paid with their lives or spent years--sometimes decades--in prison.<br /><br />8)  The United Kingdom gets high marks for its balanced reception of ANC officers, and Scotland Yard gets the best marks of all.<br /><br />9)  Key elements of the ANC victory, apart for the grotesque self-destructive nature of apartheid, were persistence, propaganda, infrastructure, and training.  Their leadership was clever, strategic, and focused.  The ANC also understood that politics was as important as tactical and technical training--the moral is to the material as 10:1 and all that good stuff.<br /><br />10)  Training as well as solidarity were well balanced with sports, music, and art.<br /><br />11)  The East Germans taught them how to do Vietnamese tunnels (see my review of the \\"Tunnels of Cu Chi.\\")  My first thought was Colombia and drugs--I suspect the Americans have no idea what's under the ground in the Andes.<br /><br />12)  They were not ready for air attacks, especially air attacks streaking in on them from South Africa within other nominally sovereign countries.<br /><br />13)  A major contributor to their eventual success was the over-all trend in the region, with victories in Angola and Zimbabwe chief among the contributing factors.<br /><br />14)  The revolution went through a mutinous and discouraging phase.  I was reminded of Bill Moyer's \\"Doing Democracy\\" where he quotes Tom Atlee in saying that Stage 5 in any long-term movement toward democracy is inevitably the stage where there is a perception of failure.<br /><br />15)  In the final stages before victory, one of their biggest problems was quality control over incoming recruits and over captured informants and traitors.<br /><br />16)  Chapter 16 is a lovely discussion of their use of open sources of intelligence.  He says: \\"The greatest proportion of intelligence comes from published material.  Since South Africa is a modern, industrial country, we were able to acquire information covering almost its entire infrastructure.  This included everything from road, rail and power networks to national key points and strategic objectives.  Pretoria's predilection for propaganda provided rich pickings from a range of military and police literature.\\"<br /><br />17)  These guys ran a marvelous early warning system that got citizen conscripts, when called up, to call in to telephone answering machines.<br /><br />18)  They pioneered the integration of maps, telephone books, index cards, and brain power in charting all the unoccupied farms across the country, ultimately plotting routes from the border all the way to Pretoria.<br /><br />19)  When De Klerk legalized the ANC, they were initially taken in and got sloppy with security.  The author does a fine job of showing that De Klerk, while bowing to the inevitable in the end, was much more duplicitous and hostile to the ANC after starting the reconciliation process, than most in the West realize.<br /><br />20)  The author (who is now the Minister for Intelligence Services after having been the Deputy Minister of Defense) appears to be skilled at understanding the value of the media, and the importance of detecting and fighting disinformation early on.<br /><br />21)  His chapter on his tenure at the Ministry of Defence could teach us something about transformation and how to accelerate it.<br /><br />In the end, and over-all, I am left with four impressions:<br /><br />a)  Morality really does matter, as does mass.  A mass of people with morality is more powerful than an elite with guns.<br /><br />b)  Torture and murder by minions can be forgiven and understood--it is their political masters who must be held accountable.<br /><br />c)  Women are the best. the most steadfast revolutionaries--and their men could not survive decades of hardship without the steadfast commitment of their companions.<br /><br />d)  South Africa is ready (he quotes Thabo Mbeki) to make its own history.<br /><br />For myself, I am quite certain that Ronnie Kasrils is going to lead South Africa's intelligence community in a way that no other national intelligence leader could possibly understand: in the service of the people, harnessing and inspiring their collective intelligence, placing intelligence in the service of the people.<br /><br />This is an exceptional person...the real deal.ives.

Indeed, it is very hard not to put this book down with an altered appreciation for hippies, war protesters and civil rights activists, for the book makes it clear that they are direct intellectual, cultural, and emotional descendants of both Socrates and the Founding Fathers, especially Thomas Paine and Thomas Jefferson.<br /><br />From Socrates to Taoism, Zen, Sufis, Troubadours, the Enlightenment, the Americans, Bohemian Paris, and into the 1950's through the 1970's, the author's broad brush review of the history of counter-culture in all its forms is helpful to anyone interested in how the next twenty years might play out.<br /><br />The bottom line is clear: we need the counter-culture, and it is time for this century's culture hackers--of whom Stewart Brand may be the first--along with the author--to rise from their slumber.<br /><br />Some side notes:<br /><br />1)  An underlying theme, not fully brought out, is that anything in excess or without balance can be harmful.  Absolute dictatorship by religions is as bad as absolute secular dictatorship.  Science without humanity, humanity without science.<br /><br />2)  The Jewish religion is favorably treated in this book as perhaps the most counter-cultural and individualistic of the religions.  I found this intriguing and was quite interested in some of the specific examples.<br /><br />3)  I disagree with the author's attack on Roger Shattuck's &#34;Forbidden Knowledge: From Prometheus to Pornography,&#34; and would go so far as to say that the two books should be read together, along with &#34;Voltaire's Bastards,&#34; &#34;Consilience,&#34; and a few of the other books on my information society list.<br /><br />The author concludes somewhat somberly, not at all sure that there is much good ahead.  He very rationally notes that before we begin the next big counter-cultural movement we should probably focus on fundamentals first: do we have enough water, energy, food, medicine?<br /><br />I agree with that, and I agree with John Gage's prediction in 2000, that DoKoMo phones in the hands of pre-teens, and Sony Playstations at $300 with access to the Internet, are irrevocably changing the balance of power.  Jonathan Schell is on target in &#34;Unconquerable World: Power, Non-Violence, and the Will of the People,&#34; and both Tom Atlee (&#34;The Tao of Democracy&#34;) and Howard Rheingold (&#34;Smart Mobs&#34;) as well as James Surowiecki (&#34;The Wisdom of the Crowds&#34;) all show us clearly that information is going to out the corrupt and restore balance to our lives.

This is such a book.  It is so utterly perfect, sensible, readable, and on target that Monday I am buying copies to give to colleagues I know are interested in making more of our global information accessible and actionable.<br /><br />I am sure this book will alter the perceptions of any management team in any domain.  At a larger level of international information sharing, what the Swedes are calling M4 IS (multi-national, multi-agency, multi-disciplinary, multi-dimensional (or multi-domain) information sharing), this book is the single best and most practical book for turning Industrial era organizations into Information era organizations.<br /><br />There have been other great books that captured some of these ideas early on, from the popular (Alvin and Heidi Toffler's POWERSHIFT, Paul Strassmann's Information PayOff) to the inspired (Thomas Stewart's Wealth of Knowledge, Barry Carter's Infinite Wealth : A New World of Collaboration and Abundance in the Knowledge Era), but this is the one that I think absolutely must be read by every flag officer and every colonel aspiring to be a flag officer, and their counterparts across all industries.<br /><br />Heavily marked up, this book is already a classic.  The author is brilliant in an elegant understandable manner in making several key points in an action-oriented implementation-facilitating fashion:<br /><br />1)  Technology is the easy part--changing the culture is the hard part (from information hoarding to information sharing)<br /><br />2)  Command and control stovepipes are a big part of the problem--we have to nurture trust and responsibility in all levels by giving all levels access to all information (within reason).<br /><br />3)  Communications, computers, and library services as well as external business intelligence services all have to be rolled together under one executive that has \\"direct report\\" relationship with the CEO--it is the networking of humans and their knowledge that has value, not the hardware and software and hard-wired comms lines<br /><br />4)  If you are not rolling over half your software and hardware each year, with nothing in your C4I system more than two years old at any one time, then you are losing capacity, productivity, and profit<br /><br />5)  85% of what you know cannot be captured in structured knowledge archives--only a living network can allow employees to provide just enough, just in time articulation of answers that can be created in real time--this allows a *dramatic* shortening of the business information answer cycle, from months to hours.<br /><br />6)  If the CEO does not get it, live it, and enforce it, it will not happen.<br /><br />The author shares with us practical real-world experience that makes this book a real-world manifestor rather than just a visionary proposal.  His practical suggestions lead directly to the possibilities of global issue networks such as J.F. Rischard recommends in his HIGH NOON: Twenty Global Problems, Twenty Years to Solve Them, but this book by Robert Buckman is the real deal, a true \\"revolution in business affairs.\\"<br /><br />We've reached a tipping point.

Building on her earlier monograph about the UN experience in Haiti with respect to public information--a monograph that is included in this book as a chapter--the author has gone on to look at several other UN operations.<br /><br />The author's conclusions are consistent with but expand upon her findings from the Haiti mission.<br /><br />1)  Information Operations must be in the mandate and must be a major focus of effort from day one.  Although the author has a limited focus, on information as public affairs or public diplomacy, her points are all relevant to the larger appreciation of Information Operations as inclusive of decision-support and tactical-operational Peacekeeping Intelligence, as well as the larger concept of Information Peacekeeping.<br /><br />2)  Secretary General's Special Representative (SGSR), the military force commander, and the police force commander must agree on unified public information operations and an integrated staff with a single coherent message.<br /><br />3)  Standing staffs and normal tour lengths are essential to success.  The somewhat common practice of Member states rotating people in and out in 30-90 day cycles is simply not professional and ultimately undermines the mission.<br /><br />4)  Considerable numbers of language-qualified translators and interpreters are required.<br /><br />5)  In illiterate societies (such as Haiti), radio and music rule.  Strong radio programs can be extremely helpful, but only if hundreds of thousands of portable radios, and the batteries to power them, are given out.  When confronting violence on the street, or seeking to break up gathering mobs, music has extraordinary power to diffuse anger.<br /><br />While the author is most diplomatic in addressing the facts, it is clear from this book that the Department of Public Information (DPI) at the UN has still not matured, and is still a major obstacle to the implementation of the Brahimi Report recommendations on creating strategic, operational, and tactical decision support or intelligence capabilities for all UN operations.  In my personal view, the next head of the DPI needs to be given one simple order: \\"turn DPI into a global grid for information collection and information sharing, or find a new job.\\"  DPI today is 77 one-way streets, and generally immature one-way streets with potholes.  DPI has no understanding of peacekeeping intelligence, information peacekeeping, information metrics, or information as a substitute for money and guns.  In the context of what the Brahimi Report seeks to accomplish--all of it good and urgently needed--DPI appears to be a huge cancer within the UN, one that must be operated on before the larger UN information environment can become effective.<br /><br />The author adds to the literature in articulating six principles for outward communications of message in a peacekeeping operation; in brief, 1) public perceptions are a strategic factor; 2) international and local public opinion impact on the political influence that impacts on tactical effectiveness; 3) external information campaign must be a strategic focus from day one; 4) education campaigns, e.g. on the rule of law, are vital aspects of peacekeeping campaigns; 5) culturally-sensitive messaging is a must; and 6) transparency of policy and objectives is a pre-condition for message success.<br /><br />The notes and references in this book are quite professional.  One wonders if the Brazilians and the Americans are reading the DPKO Mid and Post Mission Assessment Reports from Haiti in 1996, or simply making the same mistakes anew.<br /><br />See also:<br />[[ASIN:0971566127 Peacekeeping Intelligence: Emerging Concepts for the Future]]<br />[[ASIN:0971566135 Information Operations: All Information, All Languages, All the Time]]<br />[[ASIN:0971566119 The New Craft of Intelligence: Personal, Public, & Political--Citizen's Action Handbook for Fighting Terrorism, Genocide, Disease, Toxic Bombs, & Corruption]]<br />[[ASIN:0971566143 THE SMART NATION ACT: Public Intelligence in the Public Interest]]Disease, Toxic Bombs, & Corruption]]  [[ASIN:0971566143 THE SMART NATION ACT: Public Intelligence in the Public Interest]]	2004-12-12

While I have been exposed to many great thinkers and authors, and formed my own views based on three decades in the defense-intelligence complex where America spends $70B a year on the 10% of the information it can steal, and next to nothing on polling, subject matter experts, and open sources of information, this book was an eye-opener for me.<br /><br />I disagree with those reviews that dismiss this as \\"unscientific\\" or lacking in rigor.  This book tells a very important story that could-that should-alter how we made decisions about very important matters with long-term consequences.  While the author appears largely unwitting of the body of literature focused on this matter going back to at least Pierre Tielhard de Chardin and H.G. Wells, his book stands as a very valuable self-contained reference that cannot be ignored.<br /><br />The author examines three broad situations: coordination, aggregation, and cooperation, and in all three concludes, with sufficient and compelling evidence as well as anecdote, that the best answers are from multiple disparate views that have been normalized.  The author is also effective in pointing out that most \\"experts\\" rarely agree with one another, or get it right in the first place.<br /><br />To take the simplest example, guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar, the author examines how \\"experts\\" or \\"closest individual guess\\" get within roughly 20 of the right number, while the crowd of disparate individuals--including biased and illiterate individuals--comes within 2.  That is a huge benchmark.<br /><br />This book is relevant to the application of emerging technologies, for example, application oriented networking systems and intelligent networks where P2P puts most of the knowledge at the edge of the network.  What hit me with great force is that P2P and intelligent networks cannot be fully effective without an aggregation capability, a super-sized federated database system that scales infinitely--hence disqualifying all of the so-called relational databases.<br /><br />I have over 20 notes on how to monetize the information in this book, which I consider to be the single most valuable book I have read in the past couple of years, after Thomas Stewart's \\"The Wealth of Knowledge.\\"  Here is one simple one as citizen blogs and other information including environmental information begins to come on line: why not create a citizen's digital dashboard for cell phones and hand-held devices, so that the barcode on a device creates a full price analysis--not just price in dollars and cents, but price in terms of the greenness of the maker, hidden costs, the human rights and labor relations record of the maker and the seller, etc.  I see the day coming when government cannot fund stupid programs because the people put those corporations that build stupid things into bankruptcy, while the labor union pension funds start using their power to invest only in companies committed to sustainable growth.  Far-fetched today--this book, and my own understanding of where information technology is headed in the next five years--made me smile.<br /><br />This is not a \\"fad\\" book.

It is also included, in a different form, in the author's book, \\"Peacekeeping and Public Information,\\" itself a seminal work, and therefore if you buy the latter, you need not buy this one.  If you are focused largely on Haiti, this is priceless.<br /><br />The author's primary focus is on what some would call \\"public diplomacy\\" or \\"public affairs\\" information, that is, the message that goes out from the United Nations force (civil, military, police) to all concerned--the world at large, the participating governments, the Member governments not participating, all other NGOs and organizational participants, the host government, and the indigenous belligerents and bystanders (many of them refugees).<br /><br />The author's two core points are that information operations must be in the UN mandate or it will be unlikely to be addressed as a coherent unified program by the leaders on the ground; and that the information program *must* be unified--there cannot be separate SGSR, force commander, and police commander messages and programs.<br /><br />Although the author makes passing reference to intelligence and the value of information collected overtly by elements of the total force, both this work and the book specifically avoid any discussion of intelligence in the form of decision support, as the Brahimi Report has stated so forcefully is needed by the UN at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels.<br /><br />The author makes very good points with respect to the need for continuity of operations (too many personnel on short tours make it impossible to succeed), for substantial numbers of language-qualified interpreters and translators, and for an educational program to teach all concerned within the force, the message, and their role in getting the message out.<br /><br />The author touches very lightly on the fact that no amount of message is going to save a completely screwed up mission with the wrong mandate, insufficient forces, insufficient aid, and lousy tactical leadership.<br /><br />In my view, in the age of information, the concepts of peacekeeping intelligence and information peacekeeping, two different concepts, are going to comprise the heart of stabilization operations world-wide.  Emerging technologies including application oriented intelligence networks, semantic web and synthetic information architecture, super-sized federated data systems, and fully funded commercial information support operations, will dramatically alter what we do, when we do it, and how we do it, as we all seek to avoid war and foster prosperity within the lesser developed regions of the world.<br /><br />The author is, in my view, one of the intellectual pioneers whose voice must be heard, and it is my hope that we will see more from her on this topic in the very near future.<br /><br />See also:<br />[[ASIN:0971566127 Peacekeeping Intelligence: Emerging Concepts for the Future]]on with the wrong mandate, insufficient forces, insufficient aid, and lousy tactical leadership.

It can also be scary, because I will wager than in 7 out of 10 cases, the technical experts are not pursuing the enterprise integration fundamentals that this book outlines.<br /><br />Both authors are strong in their own right.  The book bring together Bill Ruh, former MITRE, MITRETEK, and Concepts 5 guru, today the global manager for CISCO AONS, who is updating his 2000 book on the topic, with Beth Gold-Bernstein, who has consulted, lectured, and written on this topic, and has her own book titled \\"Enterprise Integration: A Practical Approach.\\"<br /><br />I regard the book, and the topic, as a watershed between the old days of configuration management and a focus on data that was largely within internal custody, and today, when real-time data integration and exploitation is required across both all internal points (i.e. including the 85% that is in emails and hard drives) and external points--not just the web, but supplier, buyer, regulatory, and other databases.<br /><br />I recommend this book for managers in part because the book itself is quite clear on the fact that information technology by itself, no matter how much money is thrown at it, will not achieve enterprise information integration.  Management mind-sets, management metrics, management enforcement of standards and compliance with the strategic direction implied by enterprise integration, are all required.<br /><br />Early in the book there are important references to both scale and speed, with the key difference between the 1990's and today being that instead of humans accessing the data, there now much more machine to machine communication and sharing, and this requires hyper-speed.  There is also much more focus on event-driven information actions, with Delta Airlines being cited as a very good case study--the system must be able to take many autonomous actions triggered by an event (e.g. an airplane more than 15 minutes late, with repercussions across gate management, luggage management, connections management, catering management, etc.).  Zero latency, real-time enterprise, and event-driven information transactions are among the buzz words.<br /><br />The case study of CISCO on page 6 grabbed me early on--my primary focus is on the Global War on Terror (GWOT), and reading about CISCO's move to real-time metrics (this book is *very* strong on metrics, which I take to be a very good thing) and real-time decision making and course corrections, I was thinking to myself that CISCO is to information as special operations are to terror.  So when CISCO doubled productivity, cut costs by 30%, and made daily reporting the norm, I say to myself: okay, now let's see that in GWOT....this book is Ref A in answering that challenge.  Another case study, on FedEx using hand-held devices as both points of data entry in the field, and end points for data value to the field, also struck me as relevant to GWOT.<br /><br />Throughout the book, one of its own phrases: \\"people are the most expensive part of any system,\\" keeps resonating, because everything in here is about either increasing productivity or reducing the time-cost of information transactions.  This book also has a very healthy focus on information sharing across all boundaries, with appropriate security, privacy, and legal attributes for each transaction.<br /><br />Standards receive heavy emphasis throughout.<br /><br />The book is slightly dated on the topic of automated metastandards and semantic data definitions, but I know the authors to be personally very engaged in the very latest developments surrounding semantic web and synthetic information architectures and other related automated assignments of meaning, so I take this to be primarily an issue of timing--the book had to be put to bed.<br /><br />The chapters on Information Integration Architecture and on Information Integration, the ones I was most looking forward to reading, strike me as the least developed among the many excellent parts of this book.  In part this is because Enterprise Content Management (ECM) is just coming of age, and truly scalable solutions to the challenge of managing global multi-media multi-lingual unstructured information data (Cf. InfoSphere AB in Sweden) are just now coming into being.  This chapter does provide an important itemization of key organizations responsible for metadata standards, and lays out a framework for establishing \\"who needs to know what when\\" as part of the manager's contribution to the over-all enterprise integration planning process.  These two chapters excel in pointing out that information management is about ensuring long-term data value, allowing for reachback over time and space.<br /><br />In its conclusion the book makes reference to turf wars, training, reducing redundancy, reducing reliance on proprietary technologies with lock-in costs, finding a return on assets, and creating a culture of reuse.  The last hundred pages of the book, and the CD-ROM, provide templates that any manager could reasonably demand of their technical advisors.  I opened these up and found them very useful, to the point of being worth at least a week if not more of man-time, and hence easily repaying the price of the book many times over.<br /><br />The bibliography is good and the index has been thoughtfully developed.  I recommend this book to anyone who deals with global information in any form, but especially to managers who might be wondering if their IT people have any clue as to where they are taking the enterprise and its information.  This book also strikes me a superb textbook, both for undergraduates as a primer, and for graduates as a foundation for a more nuanced discussion.  For myself, it was \\"just enough, just in time\\" information, exactly what I wanted and needed in my specific context.o bed. <br /> <br />The chapters on Information Integration Architecture and on Information Integration, the ones I was most looking forward to reading, strike me as the least developed among the many excellent parts of this book.

This makes it irresponsible for any of us to accept a political process that claims to be value neutral while opening the door for extremists.  I have said this, but this excellent book documents it: you get the government you deserve.  Participate, or lose it.	2004-12-12

457388:US	50761804	R1L6FYDM7WOXXD	0743261275	243709653	The Folly of Empire: What George W. Bush Could Learn from Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson	Books	5	17	20	N	N	Balanced Review of Lessons from Roosevet and Wilson	This is a balanced book, well-grounded in history, with an objective air and a very pleasing integration of specific quotes from both the past and the present.  It strips away the false airs of the neo-cons, and with trenchant scholarship shows how deeply ignorant America's neo-conservatives and their leading light are of the lessons of history.<br /><br />The early portion of the book provides an excellent overview, concise, documented, easy to absorb, of the origins of American imperialism in the early century of Christian millennialism followed by civil millennialism.  The chart on page 17 is useful, covering the seven period of various styles of American imperialism or avoidance thereof.<br /><br />The book documents the explicit rejection by the Founding Fathers of empires based on conquest and distance rule, and of foreign political entanglements.<br /><br />I especially liked a 1780 quote from Reverend Samuel Cooper that captures my own personal belief in how America should relate to the world: \\"Conquest is not indeed the aim of these rising states; sound policy must ever forbid it.  We have before us an object more truly great and honorable.  We seem called by heaven to make a large portion of this  globe a seat of knowledge and liberty, of agriculture, commerce, and arts, and what is more important than all, of Christian piety and virtue.\\"<br /><br />I find it relevant that Mark Twain, among many others in our history, was a staunch opponent of American imperialism.<br /><br />The middle portion of the book provides a non-judgmental review of how America was lured into imperialism for largely economic reasons, including a fear of losing access to China as well as coaling stations for a global navy.<br /><br />At the same time, there is a recurring theme throughout the book of the arrogance and ignorance of white Protestants, who believed-as the Spanish did when they began the genocide in the Americas-that the heathen are savages that must be either absorbed or exterminated.<br /><br />Especially interesting to me is the concept discussed in the book regarding the early American view that all land not under direct human cultivation was \\"waste land\\" whose occupants merited removal as a precondition to \\"civilized\\" stewardship [exploitation] of the land.<br /><br />Theodore Roosevelt is discussed in both negative and positive terms-I have the note in the margin here of Roosevelt as the originator of what can easily be called \\"macho shit racism\\"-yet Roosevelt also matured, and ultimately set the stage for a discussion of the League of Nations concept.<br /><br />Woodrow Wilson is the other historical figure in the center of the book, and his ideal of a collective multinational \\"conscience of the world\\" receives a good review.  Critical within this section is Wilson early understanding that the \\"balance of power\\" model for nations was an inherent unstable model.  To this I would add a pointer to my review of Philip Allot, [[ASIN:0521016800 The Health of Nations: Society and Law beyond the State]]  where he documents the absurdity of allowing any crime against humanity to occur within any political boundary as part of the acceptance of sovereign borders.<br /><br />Other specifics include a discussion of morality as an international force, of the importance of trust in mediators who avoid entanglements, of the CIA's early days sponsoring socialist alternatives to communism that now dominate Europe, and of the US failure to respect the North Vietnamese when they first declared independence and publicly stated their respect for the early American model of governance.<br /><br />The final portion of the book is a review of modern history.  Clinton  comes across as disengaged, out-sourcing foreign policy to a very ineffective team, while Bush comes across as provincial and ignorant.  In both cases the author notes that underlying conditions have changed, with various bits suggesting to me that there are three major things than have changed: capitalism has become immoral rather than innovative; democracy has become apathetic rather than engaged, and dictators have become the norm as US partners, rather than loathed.<br /><br />The author links Ahmed Chalibi the thief and Iranian double-agent, with Bernard Lewis the historian fool, in a very compelling manner-both contributed to the debacle of Iraq by deceiving first the neo-conservatives, and then the American people.<br /><br />The book concludes with some thoughtful assertions on the perils of empire, the legitimate historical and current grievances of the Muslims at large, and the urgency of returning to an American foreign policy that relies on collective security, a collective conscience, and a restoration of America's commitment to the rights of individuals to self-determination.<br /><br />See also, with reviews:<br />[[ASIN:0316164968 The Fifty-Year Wound: How America's Cold War Victory Has Shaped Our World]]<br />[[ASIN:0805044566 The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People]]<br />[[ASIN:0805077979 The Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire Project)]]<br />[[ASIN:0805082840 Failed States: The Abuse of Power and the Assault on Democracy]]<br />[[ASIN:0195161106 The Paradox of American Power: Why the World's Only Superpower Can't Go It Alone]]<br />[[ASIN:0912453001 A Foreign Policy of Freedom: Peace, Commerce, and Honest Friendship]]democracy has become apathetic rather than engaged, and dictators have become the norm as US partners, rather than loathed.

Kerry (more so than Edwards) failed the smell test during this past election, and this book documents how he failed on substance.<br /><br />It consists of 123 double-spaced pages of shallow material, 16 pages of photographs that range from the goofy to the staged, and a remaining two thirds of the book reproducing old speeches with little in the way of substance and nothing in the way of math (as in a balanced budget).<br /><br />Kerry's writing committee opens the book by claiming his plan is rooted in values-obviously a majority in America did not buy that, and I do not either.<br /><br />The book is organized in three sections (not counting the old speeches), on Security, on Opportunity, and on Family.  All three consist of so-called \\"policy\\" points that cannot be called anything other than platitudes.  They are completely lacking in coherence and they have no budgetary or documentary basis in fact.<br /><br />Within the security section, the four new \\"imperatives\\" are alliances, modernize an already over-funded military, deploy soft power (diplomacy, intelligence, economic, values and ideas), and free America from its dangerous dependency on Middle Eastern oil.  There is nothing about environmental security and the book displays absolutely zero understanding of the points made by such distinguished commentators as J. F. Rischard in HIGH NOON: 20 Global Problems, 20 Years to Solve Them, or E. O. Wilson in The Future of Life.  The security section is pedestrian and incredibly ignorant.  It fails to mention even the most basic redirection of resources toward peacekeeping and preventive investments in aid.  The section on energy (as a security issue) fails to discuss hybrid cars, solar power for neighborhoods, or meaningful conservation.<br /><br />The section on opportunity focuses on the middle class and is disrespectfully oblivious to the working poor-indeed, I suspect that neither Kerry nor any of his advisors have read Barbara Ehrenreich's \\"Nickle and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America\\" or David Shippler, \\"The Working Poor: Invisible in America.\\"<br /><br />Finally, and this is where I believe the Democratic Party really lost it this year, there is not a word in this book about electoral reform-about measures that are needed in order to make every American's vote count, such that we might one day aspire to having a government where Independents, moderate Republicans, Greens, Reforms, Libertarians, and agnostics all have a \\"fair share\\" of elected representation.

I recommend that the review by Mohamed F. El-Hewie, the New Jersey man with the Islam point of view be read in conjunction with this review.<br /><br />The author opens with an examination of how the \\"story of Israel\\" has gone from core reality (a place so barren it makes the Congo look good, Palestinians kicked off their land after Israeli terrorists expelled the British occupying power) to a \\"land of milk and honey\\" with deserts made prosperous by Israeli industry--he neglects to mention that Israeli agriculture contributes 3% of the GDP while using 50% of the water, and that most of the water is being stolen by Israeli from underneath land outside Israeli territory.<br /><br />From an \\"information operations\\" perspective, this is a really fascinating and well-told story of how Israel created several myths that sold not only in the USA but all over the world.  I write in the margin, \\"Israel is the ultimate Potemkin village.\\"  The author is also good at exploring the early signs that these myths are being exploded, the world is catching on, and US support for Israel may be on the verge (within five to seven years) of being withdrawn.<br /><br />As he is both an American Jew and a Pulitzer-prize winning journalist, I give this author special marks for combining a loyalty to his faith with a loyalty to the truth.  The Islamic-oriented review from New Jersey adds a frame of reference I am not qualified to comment on, but I recognize it as valuable.  Among the most important observations the author makes early on are these:  1) when Israel became an occupying power and got into the business of assassination as a routine method, censorship of Jews by Jews became commonplace--this was the \\"new aspect\\" of the Israeli regime.  2)  At the same time, in America, self-censorship and popular protest of Jewish readers against Jewish writers critical of Israel, became more marked.  The Jews of America--at least the vocal ones cited by the author--simply do not want to hear the truth--they are blindly bonded to the myths.<br /><br />Sharon is slammed in this book many times over.  The author credits Sharon with being the original Israeli army sponsor for assignations, and the several pages on Israeli assassination history and policy are alone worth the price of the book (pages 39-51).  Sharon is recalled in the book by General Pundak as \\"a disgraceful officer--a liar, cheater, a swindler and suck-up, a killer and a coward.\\"  I believe this--sounds like Chalabi and Arafat--the three were made for each other and disgrace us all.<br /><br />The author explores a second crime against humanity characteristic of the Israeli bureaucracy: collective punishment.  He builds a bridge from this--a policy that is explicitly forbidden by the Geneva Convention--to Israel's collective loss of shame and loss of emotional commitment to the \\"all for one and one for all\\" attitude that marked the early years.  Now it is everyone for themselves, never mind what the authorities do \\"in our name.\\"<br /><br />The chapter on why Palestinians do not have a state is full of interesting observations, including the author's view that the US audience simply does not know the Palestinian side of the story; that the occupation is costing 18% of Israel's GDP (just 1% over the 17% of the Israeli government budget that we provide them out of the US taxpayer's pocket--two different stacks of money, but the comparison needs to be made); and that the isolation of Gaza, and the honeycomb nature of the walls and barriers, are so grotesque as to be both Kafkaesque and Warsaw ghettoish--the victim has indeed become the perpetrator, and Israel cannot be seen, in its treatment of the Palestinians, as anything other than fascist and abusive.<br /><br />Having torn apart the Israeli side, the author then moves to the Palestinian side, and two major ideas stay with me: first, the concept of honor so deeply rooted in Arab culture, an honor that the Israeli's are attacking with every humility they can impose; and second, the utter contemptible corruption of Arafat and the Palestinian security authorities.<br /><br />The book moves to a conclusion with a retrospective look at the bargain with the devil made by the Israeli security authorities very early on, when they accepted a dictatorship of the government from the zealot orthodox rabbis.  He also explores the various \\"tribes\\" now within Israel, concluding that two thirds of the \\"new Jews\\" are not Jews at all, but simply Russian and other opportunists who have succumbed to the global covert and overt action operations of the Jewish state seeking to bring in more bodies as part of a demographic campaign plan.<br /><br />The author can be shocking.

He also explores the various \\"tribes\\" now within Israel, concluding that two thirds of the \\"new Jews\\" are not Jews at all, but simply Russian and other opportunists who have succumbed to the global covert and overt action operations of the Jewish state seeking to bring in more bodies as part of a demographic campaign plan. <br /> <br />The author can be shocking.

It reads more like \\"how I spent my summer vacation\\" (and like all school essays, avoids the negatives), and it also reads as if the author is either oblivious to or unaccepting of the investigative journalism reporting.  I use Tora Bora as a litmus test.  For this author to fail to mention that Secretary Rumsfeld authorized a Pakistani airlift that ultimately took 3,000 Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters out of the Tora Bora trap, tells me all I need to know about the over-all balance in this account.  It is a glossy rose-colored view more suited for Fox viewers than for any military or intelligence professional who is actually well-read across global issues literature.  A great deal of important detail is left out of this 140-page double-spaced book (the additional 80 pages are largely useless appendices used to bulk up the book).<br /><br />In no way does this diminish the personal accomplishments of the author.  He was clearly a great general and a loyal hard-working individual within the military chain of command.  The book does however trouble me in that it has a very tight narrow focus on military operations \\"as ordered,\\" and does not reflect the kind of geo-political awareness and nuanced appreciation of non-military factors--diplomatic, cultural, economic, demographic--that I want to see at the flag level.  His treatment of Sudan in passing is representative: astonished delight that they are \\"helping\\" in the war on terrorism, and no sense at all of the massive genocide of the Sudanese government against its own people.<br /><br />On the intelligence aspect, this book smells a bit.  The general has not been close enough to CIA to know that agents commit treason, case officers handle them--calling a CIA officer an \\"agent\\" is a sure sign of ignorance about what CIA does and how it does it.  He also claims, contrary to many open source reports as well as government investigations, that Guantanamo produced \\"reams of intelligence.\\"  In my own experience, tactical combatants have very little to offer in the way of strategic third-country intelligence leads, and on balance, I believe that while the general may have been led to believe that Guantanamo was a gold mine, in fact it was a tar pit and a blemish on the US Armed Forces.  The author continues to be a believer in the now long-discredited Chalabi-DIA-CIA views on the presence of weapons of mass destruction, to the point of still being in the past on the issue of the aluminum tubes.<br /><br />There are exactly two gems in this book.  The first deals with the problems we had in supporting our Special Forces in Afghanistan above the 12,000 foot level (actually, anything above 6,000 feet challenges our aviation).  I ask myself in the margin, \\"why on earth don't we have at least one squadron of helicopters optimized for high-altitude combat operations?\\"  The Special Air Force may claim they do, but I don't believe it.  We need a high-altitude unit capable of sustained long-haul operations at the 12,000 foot level, not just a few modified Chinooks and brave Chief Warrant Officers that \\"made do.\\"<br /><br />The second gem in the book is a recounted discussion on the concept of Arab honor and how US troops in Iraq should have a special liaison unit that approached the families of each person killed \\"inadvertently\\" to offer a profound and sincere apology and an \\"accidental killing fee.\\"  This resonates with me, and I was disappointed to see no further discussion--evidently the general heard and remembered this good idea, but did nothing to implement it.<br /><br />I have ordered a copy of the Koran and will read it, because I respect this officer's account of how much good it did him in understanding his mission and the context for the mission (aided by a regular discussion of the contents with an Islamic practitioner).<br /><br />Bottom line: great officer within his scope, moderate author within his mandate, the book is at about 60%of where I would expect to be given this officer's extraordinary access.r's extraordinary access.	2004-11-11

The first and most important point: this is not a \\"do gooder feel good\\" book--it is a compelling, absorbing book that lays out some good insights and provides an antidote to paralysis and dispair.  It is, in short, a book that inspires many small actions that in the aggregate could lead to revolutionary improvements in democracy and our quality of life.<br /><br />It took a lot of work to put this book together, including getting all the copyright permissions, and if I had one complaint, it is that I have already read many of these older items (e.g. Mandela, Havel, Martin Luther King) and it was too difficult to find the original pieces commissioned just for this book.  Having said that--as a 52 year old that reads a great deal--I would quickly say that if you want to introduce younger people to great thinkers in the democratic tradition, it would be hard to do better than this book as a \\"reader.\\"<br /><br />The book is also complemented by the online aids for further study and for reading group discussion.<br /><br />I thought of my teen-ager as I read the book, and wrote his name in several places on the margin--this book is relevant to parents dealing with very smart young people who may tend to say \\"I'm never having children\\" because the world is going to hell.<br /><br />At a tactical level, this book complements Bill Moyer's \\"Doing Democracy,\\" and is a personal counterpart to Jonathan Schell's work, \\"The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People.\\"<br /><br />I put the book down with one big thought ably communicated by this book: The problem among us is not that we lack power, but that we lack the will and perspective to use the power that we do have in small ways that add up to big power in the aggregate.<br /><br />See also, with reviews:<br />[[ASIN:0872864758 A Power Governments Cannot Suppress]]<br />[[ASIN:0977098303 Escaping the Matrix: How We the People can change the world]]<br />[[ASIN:0759691681 Society's Breakthrough!: Releasing Essential Wisdom and Virtue in All the People]]<br />[[ASIN:193213347X The Tao of Democracy: Using Co-Intelligence to Create a World That Works for All]]<br />[[ASIN:1576752585 The World Cafe: Shaping Our Futures Through Conversations That Matter]]<br />[[ASIN:0609808451 The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People Are Changing the World]]<br />[[ASIN:0465071929 Group Genius: The Creative Power of Collaboration]]<br />[[ASIN:1576753328 One from Many: VISA and the Rise of Chaordic Organization]]<br />[[ASIN:1576753859 All Rise: Somebodies, Nobodies, and the Politics of Dignity (BK Currents)]]<br />[[ASIN:158648270X The Average American: The Extraordinary Search for the Nation's Most Ordinary Citizen]]We the People can change the world]]  [[ASIN:0759691681 Society's Breakthrough!: Releasing Essential Wisdom and Virtue in All the People]]  [[ASIN:193213347X The Tao of Democracy: Using Co-Intelligence to Create a World That Works for All]]  [[ASIN:1576752585 The World Cafe: Shaping Our Futures Through Conversations That Matter]]  [[ASIN:0609808451 The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People Are Changing the World]]  [[ASIN:0465071929 Group Genius: The Creative Power of Collaboration]]  [[ASIN:1576753328 One from Many: VISA and the Rise of Chaordic Organization]]  [[ASIN:1576753859 All Rise: Somebodies, Nobodies, and the Politics of Dignity (BK Currents)]]  [[ASIN:158648270X The Average American: The Extraordinary Search for the Nation's Most Ordinary Citizen]]	2004-11-05

It is not only an elegant presentation, easy to read, with good notes and a fine seven-page listing of cool web sites, but it also provides a useful survey of past writings on this topic--with due credit to Alvin Toffler's first perception of the trend toward mass customization and the elimination of intermediaries, together with original thoughts from the author.<br /><br />This book could become a standard undergraduate reference on non-standard news sources and the blurring of the lines between producers and consumers of information (or in the government world, of intelligence).<br /><br />Resistance to change by established media; the incredible emotional and intellectual growth that comes from having a \\"media\\" of, by, and for the people that is ***open*** to new facts and context and constantly being ***refreshed***, and the undeniable ability of the people in the aggregate to triumph in their assembled expertise, over niche experts spouting biases funded by specific institutions, all come across early in the book.<br /><br />The book is provocative, exploring what it means when more and more information is available to the citizen, to include information embedded in foods or objects that communicates, in effect, \\"if you eat me I will kill you,\\" the author's most memorable turn of phase that really makes the point.<br /><br />While respecting privacy, the author notes that this may, as David Brin has suggested, be a relic of a pre-technological time.  Indeed, I was reminded of the scene in Sho-Gun, where a person had to pause to defecate along the side of the trail, and everyone else simply stood around and did not pay attention--a very old form of privacy that we may be going back to.<br /><br />Feedster gets some good advertising, and it bears mention that Trippi is still at the Google/email stage, while Gillmor is at the Feedster/RSS/Wiki stage.<br /><br />Between Trippi and Gillmor, the term \\"open source politics\\" can now be said to be established.  The line between open source software, open source intelligence or information, and open spectrum can be expected to blur further as public demands for openness and transparency are backed up with the financial power that only an aroused and engaged public can bring to bear.<br /><br />Gilmor is riveting and 100% on target when he explores the meaning of all this for Homeland Security.  He points out that not only is localized observation going to be the critical factor in preventing another 9-11, but that the existing budget and program for homeland security does not provide one iota of attention to the challenge of soliciting information from citizens, and ensuring that the \\"dots\\" from citizens get processed and made sense of.<br /><br />The book slows in the middle with some case studies I could have done without, and then picks up for a strong conclusion by reviewing the basic laws (Moore, Metcalfe, Reed) in order to make the point, as John Gage noted in 2000, that once you have playstations wired for Internet access, and DoKoMo mobile phones that pre-teens can afford, the people ***own*** the world of information.<br /><br />Spies and others concerned about deception and mischief on the Internet will appreciate the chapter on trolls, spin, and the boundaries of trust.  Bottom line: there are public solutions to private misbehavior.<br /><br />The chapter on lawyers and the grotesque manner in which copyright law is being extended and perverted, allowing a few to steal from our common heritage while hindering innovation (the author's words), should outrage.  Lawrence Lessin and Cass Sunstein are still the top minds on this topic, but Gillmore does a fine job of articulating some of the key points.<br /><br />The book ends on a great note: for the first time in history, a global, continuous feedback loop among a considerable number of the people in possible.  This may not overthrow everything, as Trippi suggests, but it most assuredly does ***change*** everything.<br /><br />I have taken one star away because of really rotten binding--the book, elegant in both substance and presentation, started falling apart in my hands within an hour of my cracking it open.<br /><br />New books, with reviews, since this was published:<br />[[ASIN:0300125771 The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom]]<br />[[ASIN:0738202614 Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace]]<br />[[ASIN:0471419192 Global Brain: The Evolution of Mass Mind from the Big Bang to the 21st Century]]<br />[[ASIN:0977098303 Escaping the Matrix: How We the People can change the world]]<br />[[ASIN:0759691681 Society's Breakthrough!: Releasing Essential Wisdom and Virtue in All the People]]<br />[[ASIN:1576753328 One from Many: VISA and the Rise of Chaordic Organization]]<br />[[ASIN:0872864758 A Power Governments Cannot Suppress]]to private misbehavior.

He describes Dean's campaign as the first really committed \\"open source\\" campaign, and this is at the heart of the book (pages 98-99).  One reason I have come to believe in open source software, open source intelligence, and open spectrum is that I see all three as essential to the dismantling of the Maginot line of politics, institutional dominance of money and votes on the Hill.<br /><br />--  Media will miss the message.  He has bitter words for the media spin and aggression that helped bring Dean down, but his more thoughtful remarks really emphasize the mediocrity of the entertainment media and its inability to think for itself.<br /><br />--  TIRED: transactional politics.  WIRED:  transformational politics<br /><br />--  Democratic fratricide killed Dean--Gephardt on his own, and Clark with backing from Clinton, killed the insurgency<br /><br />--  Cumulative Intelligence is a term that Trippi uses, and he puts in a strong advertisement for Google's gmail that I found off-putting.  Googling on the term \\"collective intelligence\\" will get one to the real revolutionaries.  When he quotes Google as saying it will \\"harness the cumulative intelligence of its customers\\" this reminds me of my own phrase from the early 1990's, one Mike Nelson put in one of Al Gore's speeches, about the need to harness the distributed intelligence of the Whole Earth.  My point: we don't need Google to get there--collective intelligence is already happening, and Google is a side show.<br /><br />Tripi's final chapter has \\"seven rules\\":  1)  Be first; 2) Keep it moving; 3) Usean authentic voice; 4) Tell the truth; 5) Build a community; 6) Cede control; 7) Believe again.<br /><br />There are a rather lame few pages at the end on Change for America.  Forget it.  Change for America is going to be bottom-up, from the county level.<br /><br />I want to end by noting that at one point, on page 156, I wrote in the margin, \\"this is a moving book,\\" but also express my frustration at how unwilling Dean and Trippi were to listening to those of us (Jock Gill, Michael Cudahay, myself), who tried very hard to propose a 24/7 team of retired Marine Corps watchstanders with structured staff processes; a massive outreach to non-Democratic voters including the 20$ of the moderate Republican wing ready to switch.  On page 161 Trippi writes \\"The truth is that we never really fixed the inherent problems in the organization that I saw that first day....\\"  I could not help but write in the margin, \\"We told them so.\\"<br /><br />The problem with Dean and Trippi is they became enchanted with the blogs and the newness of its all--as well as the fund-raising--and lost sight of the fundamentals.  The winner in 2008 or 2012 will have to strike a better balance.  One other note:  the revolution that Trippi  talks about is sweeping through Latin America, with active Chinese, Korean, and Japanese interest.

It is assuredly a destructive mean-spirited, politically-motivated revenge sort of book, and one is tempted to put it in the fire bin with the grossest sort of pornography, satanic writings, and other forms of trash without which we can do quite nicely (see my review of \\"Forbidden Knowledge\\").<br /><br />However, as a retired Marine, as a crusader for Dean (one of the 20% of the moderate Republicans ready to jump ship), and as a proponent for public intelligence as a means of keeping honest both the secret intelligence producers and their White House masters, I have to come down in favor of this book for two simple reasons:<br /><br />1)  If just 5% of this book is true, and I think at least 50% is, then Kerry--whatever his merits--took conniving and mis-representation to levels never before achieved, and is, as the book suggests, unfit for command.  When I look at the genuine bleedling and pain that goes with most purple hearts (Zinni and Franks, for example), the blatant gamesmanship that this book documents, against the medal created by George Washington for the heroes of Valley Forge and other key battles, just makes my blood boil.<br /><br />2)  This book--and the many books dissecting Bush and Cheney--should also serve as a wake-up call for wanna-be Presidents.  Hilary will never be President--the Secret Service retirees will surely publish what they know.<br /><br />There are two bottom lines here: morality matters as a fundamental aspect of character and consistency; and there are no secrets anymore whenever more than one person is engaged in acts that are ultimately not in the public interest.<br /><br />As we go into the election, we have more than one evil to contend with.  Kerry is unfit to command; Bush picked or got hijacked by some truly dangerous neo-conservatives and inherently dishonest corporate cronies; and the Republican and Democratic party leaderships have both conspired to keep the best men (John McCain and Howard Dean) away from the candidacy, while illegally blocking the Green and Reform Presidential candidates from sharing the debate forum on television (see my reviews of three books: Running on Empty, Doing Democracy, and Gag Rule).<br /><br />This book is a form of \\"capstone\\" that represents rock-bottom in American politics.  It makes it clear that we are all voting for the least of all weevils (pun intended), and that this is one little weevil that should not make it to the White House.  It makes me angry that this great Nation should come down to this.  It makes me angry that we get the government we deserve, and the books we deserve, and this book captures all of that, America at its most base--this book *is* America, consequently every American should be ashamed that we have allowed it to get to this abyssmal point.illegally blocking the Green and Reform Presidential candidates from sharing the debate forum on television (see my reviews of three books: Running on Empty, Doing Democracy, and Gag Rule).

Wow!  Looking at the companies I know and admire, it all became clear.  Innovation *is* disruptive; the most promising marketplace is the opposite of their existing defense and intelligence clients--the people that do not get adequate intelligence support from the existing cash cow; and all of the middle and senior managers (Washington-based) are incrementalists who had succeeded at building bodies-for-hire accounts over decades.<br /><br />For those who feel an intuitive faith in disruptive endeavors, this book is inspiring and also instructional.  It specifically suggests that entrants will beat incumbents when the objective is to substitute lower-cost good-enough solutions for client needs that are not satisfied by high end production.  However, it also makes clear that the *last* place you want to sell disruptive solutions in to is the existing high end client base.  Go for new customers and new contexts.<br /><br />In government intelligence terms: stop trying to teach the spies that they need to do a better job on open sources of information in 33+ languages.  Instead, go after the Departments of State, Commerce, Treasury, Agriculture, Homeland Security, and the elements of the Department of Defense that do not get adequate classified intelligence support.  Establish Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) as a viable endeavor there, and in ten years come back and crush the spies in head on competition.<br /><br />Three \\"litmus tests\\" that the authors put forward are very helpful to those seeking to monetize disruptive new ideas:<br /><br />1)  Is there a population of clients that has historically been under-funded, under-staffed, and have as a result *gone without*?<br />2)  Is this group likely to appreciate lower cost \\"good enough\\" solutions?<br />3)  Is it possible to be profitable while providing these clients lower cost good enough solutions (e.g. monitoring risk around the world, at the sub-state level, something the spies simply cannot do effectively despite their $50 billion a year budget)?<br /><br />Another major lesson I drew from this book is that alternative channels can be phenomenally successful.  One example the book uses: instead of selling low-cost throw away cameras through photography shops oriented to high-end perfectionists, move them into grocery stores and discount stores for the low-end market that could not afford a traditional camera.  This *makes sense.*  Hence, instead of trying to sell low-cost open source services to the people who think they have the most to lose from promoting them (the mandarins of the high-cost secrets), go instead to the least well-served end-users, the logisticians, acquisition managers, diplomats, etcetera, and get them to test localized rather than centralized solutions that then \\"explode\\" as other end-users see the low-cost success and emulate through decentralized adoption of new best practices.<br /><br />The last half of the book is loaded with stuff useful to how I am going to structure my relationship with any major corporation--it focuses on a number of key factors including scale, profitability over growth, proprietary end to end solutions in the beginning, transitioning rapidly to open distributed solutions at the right moment, and ensuring that the team members are *not* (NOT) incrementalist line managers that succeeded by going along within a status quo system.<br /><br />The following quote captures my perception of the imperfection of the guys at the top that don't get it:  \\"In many ways, the managers that corporate executives have come to trust the most because they have consistently delivered the needed results in core businesses cannot be trusted to shepherd the creation of new growth.\\"  (Page 183).<br /><br />The book goes on to discuss the conflict between the traditional processes of managing traditional businesses, the conflict between traditional business values versus those of disruptive innovators (who can tend to alienate and aggravate executives used to having life just so), and between the \\"pace\\" of big organizations that need 12 months to think about an opportunity, and small \\"fleet of foot\\" innovators that can evaluate, act, write a proposal, and win million-dollar jobs over a week-end.<br /><br />The authors are generally negative about business unit consolidation, and make the point that the bigger the business gets, the more process takes precedence over people.  They specifically caution against a strategy of acquisition as a means of growth, documenting the terrible toll this can take as a cash flow drain, in essence saying that really big growth cannot come from incrementalist approaches.  I put the book down with the feeling that the really big companies need to think seriously about launching spin-offs, as Charles Schwab did, and the really small companies, like mine, have a fighting shot at beating the hell out of the established beltway bandits who are too slow, too arrogant, and too rich to be serious about innovation for the future.<br /><br />This book made me smile, and it made me think.  Super piece of work.<br /><br />Here are some recently published books that can be combined with this one to reintegrate and re-energize our economy:<br />[[ASIN:159659098X The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism: How the Financial System Underminded Social Ideals, Damaged Trust in the Markets, Robbed Investors of Trillions - and What to Do About It]]<br />[[ASIN:0670038520 Blessed Unrest: How the Largest Movement in the World Came into Being and Why No One Saw It Coming]]<br />[[ASIN:0316353000 Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]]<br />[[ASIN:0131877291 The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty Through Profits (Wharton School Publishing Paperbacks)]]<br />[[ASIN:0887307043 The Ecology of Commerce]]<br />[[ASIN:0865475873 Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things]]<br />[[ASIN:1576753328 One from Many: VISA and the Rise of Chaordic Organization]]sses, the conflict between traditional business values versus those of disruptive innovators (who can tend to alienate and aggravate executives used to having life just so), and between the \\"pace\\" of big organizations that need 12 months to think about an opportunity, and small \\"fleet of foot\\" innovators that can evaluate, act, write a proposal, and win million-dollar jobs over a week-end.

517685:US	50761804	R1PVD3L48CH436	0971865957	882651851	War, Evil, and the End of History	Books	4	27	36	N	Y	Connects 9/11 to Long Era of Imperial Deceit & Predatory Looting	Edit of 20 Dec 07 to connect to more recent books.<br /><br />There are some gems in this book, but it is *not* anywhere near the kind of blindingly brilliant, deeply philosophical work that the publicists would have you believe.  He is a talented and very wealthy (inherited wealth) Frenchman of the Jewish faith who could be called the Bill Gates of French philosophy, fwith irst-rate marketing.<br /><br />The author is clearly a courageous and inquisitive individual, and I would rank him third, after Robert Young Pelton and Robert Kaplan, in the \\"journalist-philosopher-adventurer\\" category.  He has been to all of these places, he has seen with his own eyes, and he writes thoughtfully, if often tediously, about what he has seen.<br /><br />The real gem in the book is the connection he makes between 9-11 and our deliberate ignorance of the many wars, genocides, crimes against women and children, torture, corruption, etcetera that we in the West have manifested.  He writes with conviction and insight about the \\"meaningless war\\" across Africa, South Asia, around the globe, where entire regions have descended into a chaotic hell of kill and be killed, work and die, slavery or death, rape then death.  His point, which I like very much, is that history does not end, it recycles, and in 9-11 and the global war on terrorism what we have is a \\"homecoming\\" of all these wars to America and its Western allies.<br /><br />This is not, however, completely original, in the sense that the \\"Map of World Conflict & Human Rights\\" that I have been handing out to my adult students (thanks to Berto Jongman in The Netherlands for creating it, and to the European Centre for Conflict Prevention and Goals for Americans Foundation, among others, for funding its creation) ably documents all of this is a single compelling document, and many books in the 490+ that I have reviewed cover all aspects of these \\"ungovernable regions\\" in great detail.<br /><br />The author is half absurd and half correct when he condemns the United Nations for its zealous pursuit of Israel as a racist and terrorist state, while the United Nations largely ignores the many genocides taking place from Russia and China to Indonesia and Brazil and Central America and onwards.  He is absurd on the first count, correct on the second.<br /><br />The book is fully worth four stars, definitely worth purchasing, for its articulation of a European view on \\"the heart of darkness\\" as it exists today.  I was especially taken with his discussion of Buddhist versus Hindu terrorism and extremism and the use of child soldiers in Sri Lanka, since it makes the point that other religions, not just Islam and Christianity, spawn cycles of terrorism and ethnic violence.<br /><br />The book concludes on a note worthy of the greatest philosophers, a reflection on the death of memory within Western civilization, the death of *moral* memory.  Having just returned from Denver, where I was privileged to observe a two-week Office of Personnel Management course on National Security, a first-class endeavor, I was struck by the recurring theme, across virtually all of the world-class lecturers: \\"morality matters.\\"  Morality has a tangible value in helping nations, organizations, and individuals \\"get it right.\\"  The last two pages of the book are the best, and conjure up clear and frightening pictures of billions of dispossessed swarming over the European and US cities, bringing the despair we have ignored to our doorstep.  Ignore history, ignore evil, and it will eventually, inevitably, come to your doorstep.  We--or perhaps even more sadly, our children and grandchildren--will pay for our moral cowardice and our historical blindness.  In these final reflections, the author does demonstrate a brilliance that requires us to attend to his future reflections.<br /><br />More recent books supportive of this author's insights:<br />[[ASIN:038551445X Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA]]<br />[[ASIN:1590512383 Web of Deceit: The History of Western Complicity in Iraq, from Churchill to Kennedy to George W.

I am comfortable, on the basis of my career in intelligence, my three published books on intelligence (two with forewords by Senators, one Democratic, one Republican), and my 1100+ reviews on non-fiction about national security issues, is saying that this book is easily one of the top five books on the topic that most Americans should consider reading.  The other four are the Webster Tarpley's book [[ASIN:0930852370 9/11 Synthetic Terror: Made in USA, Fourth Edition]] which displaced the utterly imcompetent and unethical 9-11 Commission Report, the Aspin-Brown Commission Report (1996), Jim Bamford's book, [[ASIN:140003034X A Pretext for War: 9/11, Iraq, and the  Abuse of America's Intelligence Agencies]] and George Allen's book on the failure of intelligence in Viet-Nam, [[ASIN:1566633877 None So Blind: A Personal Account of the Intelligence Failure in Vietnam]] There are many others, but for 9-11 and the urgently needed reforms to intelligence after 9-11 (three years ago, still no reforms of note), these are the five.<br /><br />The book is most important as an unclassified record of what can be known about our failures--in both intelligence and in policy--as understood by the then serving Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI).  It does have gaps--it is much less detailed than the 9-11 Commission Report, harder to read than Jim Bamford's book, and suffers from considerable gaps in both what went wrong and what needs to be fixed, as covered by my own books as well as the many other intelligence reform books that I have reviewed in their own Amazon spaces.  That does not diminish its relative value as a \\"touchstone\\" for all Americans.<br /><br />There are, in my view, three compelling bottom lines in this book that cannot be ignored:<br /><br />1)  Senator Graham recognizes better than most that in the absence of public pressure for reform, there is little incentive for Congress or the Executive to take action.  As one Member is reported to have told Amy Zegart \\"America still does not get it--it will take another 5,000 body bags.\\"  It is my view that the combination of intelligence community leadership misrepresentation (\\"its all better now, no need to make major changes\\" and the White House denial that there was an intelligence failure at all, which defies understanding, have led the country to fall asleep again--a point that \\"Anonymous\\" makes in [[ASIN:1574888625 Imperial Hubris: Why the West Is Losing the War on Terror]].<br /><br />2)  Page 243 covers both of the other two points.  The first is that the Department of State has become a neglected orphan in US intelligence and US policy making about global threats, and this needs to change.  It is worthy of note that the Department of State got it right on Iraq despite its small numbers and tiny budget, and I agree completely with Senator Graham--State has to get back in the business of being America's *primary* foreign and national security policy strategist.  I put together [[ASIN:0971566143 THE SMART NATION ACT: Public Intelligence in the Public Interest]] but State leadership at this time is intellectually and morally challenged (2007).<br /><br />3)  Although disappointing in its brevity, especially since both the Aspin-Brown Commission and the 9-11 Commission found cause to note the importance of open sources of information, Senator Graham also notes on page 243 that a primary corrective measure to the failure of the intelligence community to \\"connect the dots\\" and related \\"incestuous amplification\\" lies in combining a renewed primary by the Department of State with greatly increased investments in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) such as Congressman Rob Simmons (R-CT-02) is planning to put into the House Armed Services Committee legislation addressing 9-11 deficiencies.<br /><br />Senator Graham joins Dick Clarke (whose book, [[ASIN:0743260457 Against All Enemies: Inside America's War on Terror]] I strongly recommend) in condemning both Saudi Arabian sponsorship of terrorism, and the bi-partisan Clinton-Bush pandering to the Saudi's, accepting despicable sustained actions by the government of Saudi Arabia against the government and people of the United States of America, for the sake of cheap oil (see also the book by Michael Klare, and by Robert Baer).  While I distinguish to an extent between Saudi intelligence, which sponsors terrorism, and Saudi royalty, which tried to deny its roots in Arabia, the bottom line is that both governments knew that Bin Laden was being nurtured by Saudi intelligence, and both chose to ignore the danger.<br /><br />Senator Graham ends his book by lamenting the lack of accountability in both intelligence and policy.  He is completely correct.  George Tenet failed to resurrect the clandestine service in the seven years he served as Director of Central Intelligence, and then had the audacity to tell the 9-11 Commission that he needed seven more years to do this, now that he realized it was broken.  No way, Jose.  It is time to fire all the losers that have been testifying to Congress on how they would do things differently, and bring in the people who resigned their commissions in order to go public from 1985-2001.  It is noteworthy that both the House and the Senate have failed to ask the latter to testify--virtually all of the witnesses on 9-11 are from the crowd that allowed 9-11 to happen in the first place.<br /><br />Intelligence matters, indeed.  It is clear from this book that the public does not yet grasp this, and it is not clear from this book that Congress ever will.  The current legislative proposals are still in lip-service, cosmetic mode.  The Members are still too reliant on ignorant staff and still too prone to substitute press conferences for deep discussions with the top 15 practitioner-authors who know what is needed.<br /><br />There *will* be another 9-11, and there *will* be a \\"nuclear hell-storm\\" in America, courtesy of Al Qaeda.

Edit of 20 Dec 07 to add links.<br /><br />The most shocking aspect of this book, in a positive \\"eye-opening\\" sense, is that Pat Buchanan seems to be more in touch with what I as a moderate Republican believe, than anyone associated with the current Bush-Cheney Administration.  Although he has some extremist views that I do not agree with, notably a desire to set back attempts to achieve racial equality, on balance his focus on avoiding elective wars, on eliminating the deficit, on reducing the size of government, on restoring state rights, and on putting the Supreme Court back in its place, all strike me as more \\"representative\\" than the views of the neo-conservatives, whom he attacks with eloquence and force.<br /><br />There are some gems in the book that most people will enjoy because they are not being discussed.  Chief among these is that the 2004 election is about the Supreme Court, and who gets to nominate as many as five new Justices.  Fully enjoyable is the author's blistering critique of the Court, and the moral cowardice of the Congress in allowing the Court to take on powers of legislative review never envisioned by the founders.  The author's quote of Lincoln is especially compelling on this point.<br /><br />The author is also compelling in his discussion of the role that a common faith must play in keeping democracy alive.  As the US foolishly strives to demand \\"secular democracy\\" in Iraq, something of an impossibility, the author is moving and thoughtful in showing that the decline of faith (and of the family) has harmed US democracy and its prospects.<br /><br />Over-all the book is a litany of ills associated with an extremist Republican party run amok, funding Chinese weapons development at the same time that it exports jobs, funds the debt of loser nations while running up our own debt, etc.  The author provides several lists of poor policy decisions that provide food for thought.  Most troubling is the degree to which the USA is hostage to others for 72% of its medicines, 70% of its computer equipment, etc.<br /><br />This is one of the few books I have encountered that covers both economic issues--the author is blistering on how \\"free\\" trade is not free, with fullsome detail on how we need *fair* trade--and national security issues.  The author clearly understands that we are not winning the war on terrorism, only minor battles, and--in a phrase that especially moved me--that you cannot defeat a faith without a faith of your own.  \\"To defeat a faith you need a faith.\\"  I would refer the readers to Doug Johnston's [[ASIN:0195160894 Faith-Based Diplomacy: Trumping Realpolitik]] as well as Jonathan Schell's [[ASIN:0805044566 The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People]].<br /><br />Over-all, this book caused me to reflect on the reality that the two so-called \\"mainstream\\" political parties are no longer representative of America.  Pat Buchanan is right--the moderate Republican Party with conservative values that I thought I was a member of has been hijacked and corrupted.  At the same time, the same can be said for the Democratic Party, whose traditional values are now more ably represented by Ralph Nader.  In brief, Americans are in limbo, lacking collective associations that truly represent their needs and concerns, and America is in need of a realignment of its grass-roots political organizations.<br /><br />Super book, essential reading for anyone concerned about why the 2004 election is not a choice at all, only a pretense.<br /><br />Estranged moderate Republican that I am, I grow more and more respectful of Patrick Buchanan.

In many ways, his books complements the one by Thomas Barnett, [[ASIN:0425202399 The Pentagon's New Map: War and Peace in the Twenty-first Century]] except that whereas Barnett says that the military must go to war to make unstable areas safe for America, Klare points out that a) we don't have enough guns or blood to stabilize a world that we antagonize every time we deploy into an \\"occupation\\" mode, and b) cheap oil is going to be very very expensive in terms of American blood on the floor.<br /><br />Although I have reviewed many books about both the problems within America and its policies, as well as books optimistic about the future of America and the world, I give credit to Klare and this book for finally forcing me to realize that our federal budget and federal policies, in relation to protecting America, are \\"inside out and upside down.\\"  There is, and Klare documents this beautifully in relation to petroleum, a very pathological cycle that could be easily stopped.  We insist on cheap oil, this leads to bloodshed and high oil prices; this comes back to lower quality of life for the workers, etc.<br /><br />As Klare points out, the pipelines (and I would add the pipe to ship portals) cannot be protected.  American policy makers are deceiving the public when they suggest they can stabilize the Middle East and protect cheap oil.  Not only can the pipelines not be protected, but on America's current consumption path, according to Klare, the Gulf States would have to DOUBLE production to keep up with American demand.<br /><br />Klare is also intellectually powerful in painting a future picture when China, Russia, and Europe are in armed competition with the USA for energy from Central Asia, Latin America, under the Spratley Islands, etcetera.  As I read Klare's book, I was just shaking my head.  Our policies on energy are delusional and destructive, and Klare is among the few that is providing an objective report to the public on this reality.<br /><br />Klare is actually kind to the current Administration (Bush-Cheney), pointing out that they are no more or less corrupt than previous administrations going back to World War II.  Cheap oil has become a mantra, and military power has become the unquestioned means of achieving that--along with supporting 44 dictators, genocide, state-sponsored terrorism (as long as we like them and we get the Jewish vote to boot).<br /><br />I especially liked Klare's observation that cheap oil for the US is a major contributor to unemployment and destabilization within Arabia.  Buying oil from Saudi Arabia subsidizes terrorism.  Buying cheap oil from Saudi Arabia increases the number of unemployed who might be inspired to become terrorism.  Hmmmm...  At what real cost shall we continue to demand cheap oil?<br /><br />Klare is also very effective in objectively criticizing the manner in which the US Administrations have integrated anti-terrorism initiatives with energy-protection initiatives.  Bin Laden is still at large, but by golly, we have 200,000 Americans sitting on top of the Iraqi oil fields.<br /><br />Klare joins Jim Bamford [[ASIN:0385499086 Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency]], Chalmers Johnson [[ASIN:0805077979 The Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire Project)]], Derek Leebaert [[ASIN:0316164968 The Fifty-Year Wound: How America's Cold War Victory Has Shaped Our World]] and a score of other authors who have in one way or another alluded to the fact that we are now doing to China what we did to Russia after the Cold War: needlessly confronting them, scaring them, and pushing them to arm themselves.

This certainly applies to the reviews inspired by this provocative book by Lou Dobbs, and I give both the book, and the reviews, high marks when taken together.<br /><br />It is clear that Lou Dobbs is both an intelligent patriot, and somewhat simplistic in his presentation.  This does not diminish the value of what he has offered us, but we have to frame it in the right way: this is a one hour read, from Boston to DC, and needs to seen in the context of my other 1000+ reviews of national security non-fiction.<br /><br />Dobbs does take on added importance, together with Stephen Flynn's book, [[ASIN:0060571292 America the Vulnerable: How Our Government Is Failing to Protect Us from Terrorism]], because Dobbs helps us understand that we do not have a proper trade strategy nor a related demographic and employment strategy.  To those who would say \\"let the free market do its work\\" I would point out that the free market would not raise national armies, collect taxes, or provide social security.  Some things have to be done by the Nation and its State governments, and one of those \\"duties\\" is to conserve and enhance national power from \\"the bottom up\\", meaning the population's ability to produce and to fight.<br /><br />There is a related concern: when goods are created by foreign workers earning $1 per hour, instead of US workers earning $15 per hour (as discussed on page 11), two bad things happen: the first is that the goods tend to be less lasting in nature--more throw-away products that thus consume precious metal, plastic, etc (this is less applicable in IT, where Indian programmers cost 1/10th and are as good or better than US programmers); and second, they have to be transported, using tons of oil and other fuels.  These are called \\"trade-offs.\\"  I'm not an economist, but I do believe that in a limited growth natural environment, and in an unstable world, it makes sense to localize or regionalize as much of your agricultural, light manufacturing, and energy production as possible.  Sustainable environments range from local to global, but they start with the local.<br /><br />The author spends some time identifying and negating twelve \\"myths\\" associated with outsourcing jobs, and I for one find these valuable, and would consider any politician unable to address the points that Dobbs makes to be unqualified to be President (I am mindful of the possibility that no one qualified to be President might actually be able to earn the nomination).<br /><br />Finally, and this is a criticism of Dobbs, I think he misses the main point, and it is one that is made very ably by Peter Peterson in \\"[[ASIN:0312424620 Running on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It]] as well as others writing about democracy: there is no single issue or challenge facing America that could not be more ably addressed if the people were informed and engaged and actually had the power to vote on the matter.  Although Dobbs notes, as does Peterson (who is Chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, and hence no liberal), that corporate America, and the two \\"main parties\\", no longer represent America or American labor or the American voter, he does not focus on this as the core issue.  This in my view *is* the key issue.  When Dobbs asks America to vote on CNN, as he did last night, and the only issues he presents are a few foreign/defense versus economic/health issues, I ask myself: what doesn't he understand?  These are dog on dog issues.  The \\"dog-catcher\\" issue in America is this: does our vote count, not only in politics, but in the workplace?  The answer is NO, and around that answer, we should be building a popular revolution that demands a Constitutional Convention and a completely open election in 2006.  We need to churn Congress, join labor unions, and take back the power.<br /><br />Newer books by Lou Dobbs, with reviews:<br />[[ASIN:0670018368 Independents Day: Awakening the American Spirit]]<br />[[ASIN:014311252X War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War onthe American Dream and How to Fight Back]]<br /><br />Other books that complement his earnest populist investigative journalist campaign to be an advocate for We the People:<br />[[ASIN:0312376960 Day of Reckoning: How Hubris, Ideology, and Greed Are Tearing America Apart]]<br />[[ASIN:0312374364 State of Emergency: The Third World Invasion and Conquest of America]]<br />[[ASIN:1400065763 Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency]]<br />[[ASIN:0470098287 The Global Class War: How America's Bipartisan Elite Lost Our Future - and What It Will Take to Win It Back]]<br />[[ASIN:159659098X The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism: How the Financial System Underminded Social Ideals, Damaged Trust in the Markets, Robbed Investors of Trillions - and What to Do About It]]rn Congress, join labor unions, and take back the power.

I happen to agree with the author's core point, as Thomas Jefferson would agree: politicians will continue to ignore these vulnerabilities and lie to the public until the public achieves its own appreciation of the threat.<br /><br />This is a double-spaced book, an easy read from Tampa to Dulles (2.5 hours), and well-worth any thinking person's attention.  For those who disparage this book as \\"gloom and doom\\": go back to your vodka martinis.<br /><br />THE fundamental point of this book, and one that I happily endorse on the basis of my other 493 reviews of national security non-fiction, is that how we spend the federal tax dollar is completely out of balance.  We are spending $500 billion on a \\"hard power\\" military that can barely contain terrorism, crime, genocide, revolution, and war between states, while we are letting our states and cities go begging, and refuse to fund just 16,000 Customs inspectors, among other vital initiatives.<br /><br />This is the single best book I have found that points out that in the era of asymmetric warfare, where non-state actors have both explosive and nuclear-biological-chemical power at their disposal, it is the \\"soft targets\\", the non-military infrastructure targets, which will be most attractive to the \\"sleeper\\" agents of Al Qaeda and others.  Washington continues to deceive America about its vulnerability, and about Washington's feckless irresponsibility in failing to redirect funds from hard power only relevant to fighting major states, to a combination of homeland defense of soft targets, which is this book's focus, and soft power projection such as Joe Nye recommends in his various books, but especially [[ASIN:0195161106 The Paradox of American Power: Why the World's Only Superpower Can't Go It Alone]],<br /><br />The author's first line is a block-buster: \\"If September 11, 2001 was a wake-up call, clearly America has fallen back asleep.\\"  He is right.  I deal with those responsible for the \\"Global War on Terror\\" and most of them are working 9-5, spending half their day gossiping or browsing the Web.  [This is still true as of 20 Dec 07, besides which, terrorism is a tactic, you cannot make war on a tactic].<br /><br />In my view, the author, a former Coast Guard commander and also a National Security Council staff member, is right on target when he says that the Pentagon is guilty of an \\"escapist\\" perspective in thinking they can defeat terrorism \\"over there.\\"  It was this point that caused me to both buy this book in an airport, and to review it concurrently with General Tommy Franks' book [[ASIN:0060731583 American Soldier]]  General Franks is both a superb officer, and a naive escapist, and reading this book drives that point home in a way that would make any intelligent person pleased to have spent time with the author.<br /><br />There is a \\"seam\\" between our homeland security and our overseas capabilities, and there is no one in charge of any coherent program to decide how best to protect BOTH our neighborhoods AND our overseas investments.<br /><br />This is a nuanced book, one that makes the point that security must become as embedded as safety has been, and the further point that security properly embedded is actually PROFITABLE!  He's right.  Green lanes for containers that have proper GPS and content authentications will SAVE dollars by saving time.  Bio-chemical detection across all herds and food supplies will detect \\"natural\\" threats such as we have seen with SARS, monkey pox, bird flu, West Nile virus, etc.<br /><br />Finally, security and openness can help reduce fraud, especially import/expert tax fraud, where containers loaded with priceless equipment are mis-labeled as low-cost machinery, or vice versa, an advanced form of money laundering that is costing the U.S. taxpayer over $50 billion a year in lost tax revenues.<br /><br />Of the 1000+ books or so that I have reviewed here at Amazon, this book easily makes it into my top ten list of books relevant to getting national security right in the near term.

If you read this book in conjunction with Stephen Flynn's book on \\"America the Vulnerable,\\" where he cries out for 16,000 more Customs inspectors, you can see US national security is \\"inside out & upside down\\"--in the 21st Century we need half the uniformed military troops and half the military \\"hard power\\" acquisition, but we have failed to understand that we need ten times the manpower and ten times the acquisition within homeland security--we are still lying to America about this contradiction, one reason why I chose to tie these two books together with complementary reviews--Flynn is nothing short of brilliant as a counterpart to Franks.<br /><br />Among the little gems in this book:<br /><br />Franks got purple hearts in Viet-Nam only for the wounds that sent him to the hospital--minor wounds not requiring evacuation were ignored. What a contrast with Kerry! Page 114.<br /><br />In the 1970's, when the information revolution was just started, artillery units did not have their own communications. Franks rightly earned a reputation as an innovator by buying CB radios such that his artillery pieces moved as if they could read the mind of the operators they were supporting. Today, not only has the information revolution largely passed by the intelligence community, but the \\"rest of government\\" including state and local law enforcement, and private sector partners vital to national security, are in precisely the same position, in the year 2004, as was military artillery 30 years ago. Page 125.<br /><br />When General Franks was selected in the early 1990's to lead the creation of the 21st Century force, I find it absolutely riveting and fundamental that intelligence was not one of the domains or building blocks of the Army (one reason why the Stryker fraud was so easily perpetuated on Congress and the public). Page 173.<br /><br />As of 2002-2003, Service \\"parochialism\\", Service chiefs and staffs out only for themselves and their service, and completely unwilling to work jointly or even worse, procure systems and capabilities that worked jointly, remained the single largest cancer within DoD. Page 207, page 288, and passim.<br /><br />Bin Laden's attack on the Cole \\"had the force of a cruise missile.\\" Page 220. See my review of Paul Williams, \\"Osama's Revenge\\", where the bottom line is that individuals now have the power to deliver both nuclear and cruise missile effects inside of America, but our national security investments and priorities remain \\"upside down\\" and fail to protect us from an \\"inside out\\" perspective.<br /><br />Both defense department and U.S. intelligence community counterintelligence and intelligence relevant to force protection failed miserably in the closing years of the 20th century. We were blind in part because we relied on Yemen to tell us about threats, rather than being able to penetrate groups in Yemen directly--hence the \\"surprise\\" of the USS Cole attack being so successful and so unconventional. Page 224.<br /><br />Throughout the book there are references to capabilities that avoid discussing time lag issues--cruise missiles that take 2-6 hours to get to the target, B-2 bombers that take 40 hours to get to the target, all easily detectible. In my view, General Franks paints an overly positive picture of our \\"hard\\" capabilities, in part because he glosses over or ignores time-space-detection-avoidance issues that are vital. Pages 245, 259, and passim. This also applies to the movement of Special Operations Forces into denied areas. Page 296.<br /><br />Rumsfeld evidently believed that invading Afghanistan would \\"finish\\" Bin Laden. How wrong was he? Page 285.<br /><br />Franks and the U.S. leadership evidently believe that Special Operations Forces are \\"hidden\\" at K-2 Air Base in Uzbekistan. I personally think they will be rolled over and massacred at some point in the near term (2-4 years). Page 286.<br /><br />Franks is brilliant in his creation of a Lines of Operations versus Target Slices conceptualization, this is the single best page in the book, a real keeper. Page 339, illustrated 340.<br /><br />Franks fell for the myth that money will buy loyalty and action among the tribes of both Afghanistan and Iraq, a completely erroneous view. Page 332. He also fails to mention that Rumsfeld allowed 3,000 Taliban and Al Qaeda to be evacuated from the Tora Bora trap by Pakistan, with Rumsfeld's active permission (out of naivet&eacute;). Page 377.<br /><br />Troubling to me is Franks' blindness to the cost, both in dollars and in opportunity cost (time, space, pol-econ, etc.) of using very expensive and very ineffective hardware to achieve marginal results. His approach to warfare is almost mechanical in nature, eager to send waves of aircraft against Stone Age tribal positions, without regard to cost and effect. Pages 379-381.<br /><br />Regional commanders-in-chief need to manage U.S. Intelligence Collection requirements, priorities, and capabilities. This one hit me with \\"wow\\" force. I actually agree, provided that the regional CINCs become inter-agency in nature. We are at war forever, and placing clandestine and technical collection as well as open source intelligence collection assets under CINC operational control makes sense to me, especially if DoD finally steps up to the plate and creates an intelligence component commander [this does NOT undermine the need to move NRO, NSA, and NGA out of DoD and into the DCI's management authority.] Page 234. Later on he alludes to the need for CINC budgets, and I agree--we need to change Title 10, and strike a better balance between acquisition and budget authority for type and regional commanders.

The first two, in order of priority, are Mahmood Mamdani's [[ASIN:0385515375 Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror]] and CIA Anonymous Executive Analyst, [[ASIN:1574888625 Imperial Hubris: Why the West Is Losing the War on Terror]].  I should add that terror is a tactic, not an enemy, it is impossible to win a war against a tactic.<br /><br />What this book does is piece together all of the English-language reports over the past ten years or so regarding the probabilities and specifics of Bin Laden and Al Qaeda's having acquired several forms or portable nuclear devices.  Although some reviewers have slammed this book for being fictional, they do not know what they are talking about.  The FACTS are that the Soviet general officer responsible for the 100 suitcase nuclear bombs designed for Spetznatz use, some pre-positioned in the USA, has said publicly, in writing, and on more than one occasion that 66 of those are unaccounted for.<br /><br />I took one star off for excessive reliance on two secondary sources, both excellent but never-the-less cited too often, and the commensurate lack of attention to foreign language materials that could have deepened this study considerably, especially when one takes into account the CIA executive analyst's comments in IMPERIAL HUBRIS regarding the straight truth-telling that can be found in Bin Laden's Arabic-language postings.  \\"Nuclear hell storm\\" is out there (the author does cite this), and we had better take this more seriously than our government has.<br /><br />The author opens with a notional \\"letter to America\\" from Bin Laden that is based on Bin Laden's actual statements (as itemized in IMPERIAL HUBRIS) and is alone worth the price of the book.  If we don't take a long hard look at ourselves and correct the misbehavior that is radicalizing over a billion Muslims, we will not (not!) win this war.<br /><br />The author does a really fine job, not just of amassing and stringing together a coherent story of Bin Laden's likely possession of nuclear capabilities, but also of showing the inter-relationship between the Afghanistan drug fields that the U.S. Government has stupidly allowed to flourish, the Pakistani production facilities that take the opium to a \\"Number 4\\" level of quality, and criminal organizations as well as corrupt governments everywhere that facilitate Bin Laden's operations.  The roles of Russia, Iran, North Korea, and Pakistan (especially Pakistan) in facilitating the storage, refurbishment, and technical maintenance of the purchased nuclear elements are covered in a manner that persuades me--this is a very real threat.<br /><br />The book is a useful compilation of both mistakes by the US, and events taking place from 2002-2004, and it ends with full translated copies of the 23 Aug 96 Fatwa and the related 23 Feb 98 World Islamic Statement.  Within the book are some extracts from Al Qaeda training manuals, one portion of which make it clear that the \\"sleepers\\" now in the US are specifically forbidden to go to mosques or appear Islamic in any way.<br /><br />Bottom line, totally consistent with the other two books I recommend: the US needs to meet Bin Laden's reasonable demands, and redirect its focus from occupying Islamic countries toward cleaning up its own homeland.  [I realize that calling Bin Laden's demands \\"reasonable\\" in going to infuriate many people, but I have to say, based on all three books taken as a whole, that all three authors agree on this point, and they have persuaded me.

This is the second of three \\"must read\\" books I am reviewing today.  The first, which sets the stage for this book  by providing a truly inspired, informed, extraordinary, and nuanced review of the \\"just causes\\" for Muslim radicalization against the USA, is by Mahmood Mamdani, [[ASIN:0385515375 Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror]]  The third, best read last, is Paul L. Williams' [[ASIN:1591022525 Osama's Revenge: THE NEXT 9/11 : What the Media and the Government Haven't Told You]]  The latter books paints a compelling portrait, using only open sources of information, on how likely it is that Bin Laden not only has a number--perhaps 20 or more--nuclear devices of one sort or another--but is also receiving technical assistance from Pakistan, Iran, North Korea, and certain Russians in refreshing and maintaining those devices for use within the US homeland to create a \\"nuclear hellstorm\\" (Al Qaeda's words).<br /><br />This book, the second of two by the same person, but easily the most relevant to the salvation of the American dream and homeland, is a tour d'force.  It is an incredibly thoughtful, well-ordered accounting of both our mistakes and both the rationality and inevitability of Bin Laden's victory over the US.  The endnotes are world-class.<br /><br />As Congress prepares to confirm a new Director of Central Intelligence, the author's frequent and articulate damning of the U.S. Intelligence Community leadership for its moral cowardice (specifically slamming George Tenet and also Richard Clarke, who is labeled \\"blusterer in chief\\") must, in my view, require that the nominee for the position of DCI promise to clean house as a condition of his confirmation.  Above the rank of GS-15, every Senior Intelligence Service officer should be put on probation by the incoming DCI, and half of them should be retired within 2-3 years.  The author of this book knows what he is talking about.<br /><br />The author very usefully slams (on page 175) Michael O'Hanlon from the Brookings Institute, William Hawkins from the Army War College, and Anthony Davis of Jane's Intelligence Review for their absolute misreading of the situation in Afghanistan.  it is helpful to emphasize that these and other so-called experts that Congress tends to rely on, are absolutely superb when they do their homework (O'Hanlon is top notch on the non-revolution in military affairs, for example), and very dangerous when trying to milk the issue of the day without doing their homework (on intelligence reform, for example).<br /><br />I do not want to conclude without highlighting the author's praise for the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS).  They appear, in this one instance, to have excelled at finding and translating every word uttered by Bin Laden and his key aides, in public and in Arabic, and the author--whom I respect completely--is profuse in his detailed thanks to FBIS.  Although I and my leading military colleagues consider the FBIS model to be rotten at the core (marginal remote collection, not doing tribal languages or in-country gray literature, broadcasting generic reports largely useless in operational decision making) I do affirm that FBIS can and should be saved, if it can be re-oriented to do for all of its clients what it did for the Bin Laden task force.<br /><br />In conclusion, I want to focus on what I believe is a misreading by many of the author's recommendation of a \\"scorched earth\\" campaign against Al Qaeda as a global insurgency (rather than a law enforcement challenge).  Although the author is correct to suggest that such an approach is necessary if we wish to continue doing the six things that Bin Laden wants us to stop, I believe that most readers of this book go into instant denial and fail to see the author's logic, especially when he points out (page 17) that Bin Laden has explicitly stated that he does not desire to expand Islamic dominance beyond existing Muslim countries, and that he will follow us in DE-escalation just as quickly as he is following us in escalation.<br /><br />What we need to do, according to Bin Laden:<br /><br />1)  End US aid to Israel and support a Palestinian state<br />2)  Withdraw US/Western military forces (not business) from the Arabian Peninsula and all Muslim countries worldwide<br />3)  End US engagement in Afghanistan and Iraq<br />4)  End US support for oppression of Muslims by Chinese, Russian, Indian, and other governments (e.g. Philippines)<br />5)  End US manipulation of oil prices through corrupt dictators<br />6)  End US support for corr[[ASIN:B000A1ETWO Rogue Nation: American Unilateralism and the Failure of Good Intentions]]upt Muslim regimes<br /><br />I think this all makes sense, especially when you add the insights from the other 479+ books that I have reviewed, books such as Clyde Prestowitz's , Jonathan Schell's [[ASIN:0805044566 The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People]] Derek Leebaert's \\"The Fifty Year Wound\\" and on and on and on.  If our policy makers were willing to read and think for themselves, and not spend endless hours trying to leverage their perks and manipulate their more honest constituencies, it seems to me that we could a) get ourselves out of this mess; b) redirect half the national security budget toward global stabilization instead of selective occupation; and c) restore morality to both our global business practices and our global foreign policy.<br /><br />Probably will not happen until two nuclear devices go off in America--one will be in a shipping container, the other in a Central Park.

The other two books are &#34;IMPERIAL HUBRIS\\" and &#34;OSAMA'S REVENGE.\\"<br /><br />The main weakness of this book is the author's lack of strong criticism of Pakistan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, and of other states that are corrupt, repressive, and therefore a huge part of the problem.  Having said that, here are some of the key points:<br /><br />-  &#34;West&#34; pioneered genocide, expulsions, and religious wars, with Spanish genocide of Indians in Americas, and Spanish expulsion of first the Jews and then the Muslims as critical starting points in understanding Muslim rage today<br /><br />-  America adopted terrorism as a preferred means of fighting proxy wars in both Central America and Africa, when Reagan began &#34;rollback&#34; with the same neo-conservative advisors that guide Bush II today.<br /><br />-  West has four dogmas as summed up by Edward Said (who is admired by the author): 1) that Orient is aberrant, undeveloped and inferior; 2) that Orient is inflexibly tied to old religions texts, unable to adapt; 3) that Orient is inflexibly uniform and unable to do nuances; and 4) Orient is either to be feared (Green or Yellow or Brown Peril) or controlled.<br /><br />-  Fundamentalism actually started in the US among the Christians seeking to insert religion into the state's business and ultimately demanding faith and loyalty as the litmus tests for acceptance.<br /><br />-  Earlier generations of Islamic reformists disavowed violence, but ended up adopting violence after being in state prisons (e.g. Egypt).<br /><br />-  Earlier incarnations of a Muslim revival were in the open literature in the 1920's and then in the 1960's, and lastly in the 1980's to date--our national &#34;intelligence&#34; agencies appear to have missed the importance of all three<br /><br />-  Viet-Nam, Africa, and Central America all fostered extremely unhealthy connections between CIA covert operations and the drug trade, with CIA routinely condoning and often actively enabling massive drug operations and related money laundering, as the &#34;price&#34; of moving forward on covert operations.<br /><br />-  The obsession with winning the Cold War at all costs essentially destroyed U.S. foreign policy and set U.S. up as the enemy of the Third World [see Derek Leebaert's &#34;The Fifty-Year Wound\\"].<br /><br />-  Morality in the US has been perverted, as the extreme right, joining with extreme Zionists, has &#34;captured&#34; the U.S. government in both Congressional and Executive terms.  Orwellian &#34;spin&#34; together with the labeling of all dissent, made possible by media corporations &#34;going along&#34;, has destroyed any possibility of informed, objective, or actually moral dialog.<br /><br />-  The Central American campaign pioneered the privatization of terrorism and proxy war by the US, with secrecy and deception of the US public being the principal role of the US government.<br /><br />-  The US Government is explicitly accountable for introducing bio-chemical weapons into the Iraqi arsenal, and thus accountable for the genocide and war crimes attendant to their use.<br /><br />-  US (AID) sponsored textbooks, such as those created by the University of Nebraska, routinely used terrorism against Russians as examples in the mathematic and other textbooks being distributed in Afghanistan.<br /><br />-  CIA's main contribution to the destabilization of the world has been in its Afghan-related privatization of information about how to produce and spread violence, and its training of tens of thousands of jihad warriors from all over the world who have now returned home and are teaching and leading others.<br /><br />-  Under US leadership, Afghanistan has gone from providing 5% of the global opium production in 1980, to 71% in 1990, and even more today--much of which comes to the US.<br /><br />-  America not only accepts massive drug activities as part of the &#34;cost of doing business&#34;, but also ignores human rights in its rush to cozy up to corrupt dictators.<br /><br />-  From an Iraqi point of view, the 1.5 million or so children that died in Iraq due to the sanctions, must be seen as a major war crime and a form of terrorism, together with the air war with its indiscriminate murder of thousands if not tens of thousands civilians including women and children.  The US has killed more civilians in Iraq than it did in Japan with two atomic bombs.  Napalm and depleted uranium are disabling US troops as well as Iraqi civilians long after their use in the field.<br /><br />-  Economic sanctions, when they have the impact they did in Iraq, must be considered weapons of mass destruction, their application terrorism, and their results war crimes.<br /><br />-  The US Government's general disdain for the rule of law, but the incumbent Administration's particular focus on ignoring treaties and refusing accountability (e.g. for war crimes) sets a new low standard for immoral behavior by nation-states.<br /><br />-  The UN Secretary-General was forced by the US to ignore the Rwandan genocide because of a US desire to keep everyone focused on Sarajevo, and continues to us its veto power to prevent UN from being effective against racist Zionism, which is routinely committing crimes against humanity with its Palestinian campaign.<br /><br />The author concludes, without sounding inflammatory, that America was built on two monumental crimes: the genocide of the Native Americans, and the enslavement of African Americans.  His point: the US is in denial over this reality, while the rest of the world is completely aware of it.  He agrees with Jonathan Schell, concluding as Schell does in &#34;Unconquerable World,&#34; that the challenge of our times is in &#34;how to subdue and hold accountable the awesome power that the United States built up during the Cold War.&#34;  The last sentence is quite powerful: &#34;America cannot occupy the world.

After reading it, I think the Cliff Notes version would be useful to any President, and I have marked a number of pages for my teenager.<br /><br />Sadly, the precursor to this book, written in 1984, was largely ignored by mainstream managers, just as proposals for intelligence reform were defeated in 1992 because the Pentagon was unwilling to give up budget authority for the good of the Nation.  My point: better late than never.  Grab this book and go with it.<br /><br />I get two core points out of this reading: first, strive to balance opposites rather than going to one extreme or the other; and second, don't focus on resistance, but rather on opportunities.  In the military this known as &#34;going for the gap&#34;--instead of pouring your reserve forces into the weakest point in *your* line, that is at risk of collapsing, you focus instead on finding the &#34;gap&#34; in the enemy line, you pour through that, and whip their ass from behind.<br /><br />Much of this book is critical of both our current educational and our current managerial systems---both spend too much time teaching people what NOT to do, and very little time empowering people to think for themselves and create new &#34;impossible&#34; dreams.<br /><br />The book has direct application to today's national security environment, when it points out that &#34;pre-emptive strikes&#34; are a form of avoiding reality and being reactive in advance rather than proactive and integrative, or transformative.<br /><br />The emphasis on starting with the current reality (what my world would call &#34;commercial intelligence&#34;) may not be fully understood by most middle managers.  When I started my company to do global commercial intelligence, our evaluation of the &#34;competition&#34; produced a surprising result: fully *half* of our competition came from our clients themselves, middle managers who thought they knew everything there was to know about their business, and were absolutely oblivious to the out-sourcing, privatization, plastic for steel substitution and the myriad of other threats that the Internet, Federal Express, tax laws, and Dutch and Chinese investment represented.  Any manager reading this book who does not have a corporate &#34;intelligence&#34; capability (visit the Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals for a fast read in), should be shocked into starting one immediately.<br /><br />Visualization of perfection is in direct competition with rote performance and old metrics.  Managers today are still largely &#34;Cold War&#34; managers focused on the traditional metrics of cash flow, cost reduction, short-term profit margins, and so on.  Imagine what a difference it might make if the metrics could change, to include a focus on the health and knowledge of the individual employees, the health and knowledge of the community being supported and supporting the company, on changing the industry with standards and shared best practices, etc.  In order words, managers need to move from a bunker mentality, where there is only one winner, to a network mentality, where multiple winners actually increase the totality of the profit over all and across previously unrelated communities of interest.<br /><br />The last point that really struck me was the emphasis on transcendence (alluded to above) but interpreted by me, at least, as &#34;born anew.&#34;  Whatever cost cutting measures we may have condoned in the past, whatever unethical practices including reductions in employee health benefits, etc. there is nothing standing in the way of any company's rebirth or any manager's resurrection and &#34;rebirth&#34; as a decent human being who can factor in human and ecological economics values (see my reviews of Herman Daly's various books).<br /><br />We're killing America by killing our workers, and we are killing the world with predatory and immoral capitalism.  This book is a valuable wake-up call for all managers, both in business and in government.nd we are killing the world with predatory and immoral capitalism.

Having said that, I give the book a solid four stars on three planes:<br /><br /> 1) Believe it or not, this book is in vogue within Army training circles and has even been recommended to the Commanding General of the Special Operations Command.<br /><br /> 2) As a parent of three boys, 15, 12, 9, this book helped me appreciate the &quot;new&quot; knowledge that they have which offsets my annoyance at their being online too much. Every parent of young teens who have at least one computer in their home should read this book or one of the alternative recommended books--it will increase your appreciation for them. On page 117 the book makes it clear that kids have *better* judgment than their parents in evaluating high-tech as well as in navigating cyber-space, because they have different metrics, different patterns that they apply.<br /><br /> 3) For my young teen himself, I marked pages 94-97, 102, 105, 109, 118, 123-124, and 129-130. He read those, liked them, and agreed that he would like to read the book. Super!<br /><br /> The book's opening is packed with insights--we're entering third generation of kids, six generation of videogaming, 50 million adults have now been &quot;programmed&quot; by earlier gaming, it is moving us from passive watching to interactive manipulation, and--well before Microsoft got this--it is creating an adult generation (at least in the US and Japan) that is juggling sixteen different information streams at once, with a result that most adults--including US general officers--are in what is called &quot;constant partial attention&quot; mode all of the time.<br /><br /> The author touches upon but does not discuss the offsets of millions (more like billions) in lost-time cost to those who play at work, versus how it changes our productivity. A very nice timeline of game evolution from 1962 to 1996 is provided early on. Somewhat interesting to me is the author's observations that the games and the new computer power have not changed the &quot;basic plots&quot; which tend to pursue the same enduring patterns that Shakespeare and others did...<br /><br /> Relevant to Department of Defense and Homeland Security: on page 35 there is a discussion that confirms my long-held belief that while DoD investments in very expensive earlier generations of computers helped spawn the consumer industry, the time has come for DoD to get out of the unilateral C4I business, and concentrate on improving security and functionality for the generic whole. We must depart from secret unilateral expensive C4I systems, toward open (but secure) generic inexpensive systems that can be thrown away easily while the data is ported over. This merits emphasis--on page 77 the author emphasizes that as hardware and software get fancier, they actually make it *harder and more expensive* to port data forward, and the author suggests that the true test of a new system should be FIRST, its ease of &quot;reach back&quot; to old data, and ONLY then, its ability to excel with new data. This is an extremely important point that I am fairly certain neither CIA nor DoD nor JFCOM take seriously.<br /><br /> Page 41 is helpful in discussing the &quot;wife/whore&quot; mindset that prevents the US in particular from merging tools--one complete set for &quot;work&quot;, one complete different set for &quot;play&quot;, leading to the obvious point that lots of money could be saved, and functionality cross-migrated, if we could break out of this mindset trap.<br /><br /> Page 89 sums up some really excellent coverage of how the earlier games rocketed in both sales and sophistication because of their commitment to giving out free simplified samples and the open source code. If we are ever to stabilize the world, we need to learn from this: generic open source software, open source intelligence, and open spectrum are the heart of 21st Century peacekeeping and capitalism, and anyone that does not get this is part of the problem. Open source (3) is the key to harnessing COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE (great Google search).<br /><br /> Unexpectedly for me, the author covers the &quot;model Prisoner of War&quot; or gulag/sweatshop of the modern videogame industry, and for those aspiring to working in this field, absolutely worth the price of the book.<br /><br /> Three final points that many will miss:<br /><br /> 1) The book does a good job of noting that most games represent a form of cultural imperialism, value-free games that promote dominance through violence, and are not nuanced at all.<br /><br /> 2) Boy games and girl games are different because boys and girls are different--boy games focus on violence and take-over, girl games focus on problem solving and peacekeeping. Obvious thought to me: use them to cross train boys and girls with one another's strengths.<br /><br /> 3) Games are limited in both possible outcomes, and in terms of who is able to create them. THEY DO NOT PROVIDE FOR THE FOG OF WAR--while useful in terms of improving *technical* skills, they are NOT a substitute for real-world training with respect to *judgment*, *nuance*, and *situational awareness*. These games are lacking INTELLIGENCE in the combat sense. I was reminded by this section of an old Isaac Asimov short story, in which the world evolved to where everyone had to qualify to run an &quot;expert system&quot; and those that did not were &quot;executed.&quot; In the conclusion we learn that the ones executed were actually exported to a moon where they WROTE the expert systems, keeping the fiction alive that everything was okay with the machines back home. DoD is in that trap right now.<br /><br /> I liked this book--of the 10 or so recommended to the Special Operations leadership, this book and Marc Sageman's book on Understanding Terrorism are the only two that have been really worth my while.learn from this: generic open source software, open source intelligence, and open spectrum are the heart of 21st Century peacekeeping and capitalism, and anyone that does not get this is part of the problem.

Edit of 20 Dec 07 to add links and a comment.<br /><br />I picked this book up at Hackers on Planet Earth, and got Kevin Mitnick to sign a poster at the same time.  The book is a hoot.  I've done the spy stuff, it's boring compared to the persistent intelligence shown by these cyber-spooks, a couple of whom I am pleased to know.<br /><br />I suppose the disclaimer is necessary: this is a novel, for educational and entertainment purposes only.  If you want to be cyber-spy, this book strikes me as a great way to start getting hooked.  If you are a security manager, be afraid, very afraid...you need to read this book.<br /><br />20 Dec 07 Comment: The US Government does not want you to know that all of the SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems are totally open to the Internet.

Normally it would only have gotten three stars, for recycling three articles, only one of which was really of interest to me (on piracy), but the author is gifted, and his articulation of detail lifts the book to four stars and caused me to appreciate his final story on the poisonous deadly exportation of ship \\"break-up\\" by hand. It is a double-spaced book, stretched a bit, and not a research book per se.<br /><br /> Two high points for came early on. The author does a superb job of describing the vast expanse of the ungovernable ocean, three quarters of the globes surface, carrying 40,000 wandering merchant ships on any given day, and completely beyond the reach of sovereign states. The author does a fine job of demonstrating how most regulations and documentation are a complete facade, to the point of being both authentic, and irrelevant.<br /><br /> The author's second big point for me came early on as he explored the utility of the large ocean to both pirates and terrorists seeking to rest within its bosom, and I am quite convinced, based on this book, that one of the next several 9-11's will be a large merchant ship exploding toxically in a close in port situation--on page 43 he describes a French munitions ship colliding with a Norwegian freighter in Halifax. \\"Witnesses say that the sky erupted in a cubic mile of flame, and for the blink of an eye the harbor bottom went dry. More than 1,630 buildings were completely destroyed, another 12,000 were damaged, and more than 1,900 people died.\\"<br /><br /> There is no question but that the maritime industry is much more threatening to Western ports than is the aviation industry in the aftermath of 9-11, and we appear to be substituting paperwork instead of profound changes in how we track ships--instead of another secret satellite, for example, we should redirect funds to a maritime security satellite, and demand that ships have both transponders and an easy to understand chain of ownership. There is no question that we are caught in a trap: on the one hand, a major maritime disaster will make 9-11 look like a tea party; on the other the costs--in all forms--of actually securing the oceans is formidable.<br /><br /> Having previously written about the urgent need for a 450-ship Navy that includes brown water and deep water intercept ships (at the Defense Daily site, under Reports, GONAVY), I secure the fourth star for the author, despite my disappointment over the middle of the book, by giving him credit for doing a tremendous job of defining the challenges that we face in the combination of a vast sea and ruthless individual stateless terrorists, pirates, and crime gangs collaborating without regard to any sovereign state.<br /><br /> I do have to say, as a reader of Atlantic Monthly, I am getting a little tired of finding their stuff recycled into books without any warning as to the origin. Certainly I am happy to buy Jim Fallows and Robert Kaplan, to name just two that I admire, but it may be that books which consist of articles thrown together, without any additional research or cohesive elements added (such as a bibliography or index), should come with a warning. I for one will be more alert to this prospect in the future.<br /><br /> Having said that, I will end with the third reason I went up to four stars: the third and final story, on the poisonous manner in which we export our dead ships to be taken apart by hand in South Asia, with hundreds of deaths and truly gruesome working conditions for all concerned, is not one of the stories I have seen in article form before, it is a very valuable story, and for this unanticipated benefit, I put the book down a happy reader, well satisfied with the over-all afternoon.<br /><br />See also, with reviews:<br />[[ASIN:1400078849 Illicit: How Smugglers, Traffickers, and Copycats are Hijacking the Global Economy]]<br />[[ASIN:0618127445 Water: The Fate of Our Most Precious Resource]]<br />[[ASIN:1578051576 Blue Frontier: Dispatches from America's Ocean Wilderness]]ean Wilderness]]	2004-07-28

What I see here is a unique combination of Senatorial seniority (seen it all), an acumen with regard to Constitutional history, a deep burning angst over the failure of the Senate to honor its heritage in the run up to the unjust and unjustified war on Iraq, and a relatively careful documentation of specific lies and misdeeds carried out by the Executive in its evidently unprecedented campaign to rob Congress of both the power of the purse and the power to declare war.<br /><br /> The book offers up some real gems, including a devastating \\"character\\" analysis of George W. Bush (p. 19, p. 107, p. 146), a useful comparison between Herbert Hoover who helped bring on the Great Depression, and George W. Bush (pp. 30-31), a helpful comparison of how Congress tries to balance the Executive while having only 31,033 employees versus 2,673,100), a brutally accurate comparison of how John Ashcroft chose to spend his time, avoiding testimony, substituting news conferences calling on Congress to pass the law without review (p. 47), the return of the multi-billion dollar Presidential slush fund (p. 68), the importance of independent information to Congress in confronting deceitful Executive officers (p. 70), a troubling catalog of the billions in funding for homeland security that the Executive has refused, seemingly wanting to \\"starve the beast.\\" (pp. 10-114); special reference to Eisenhower, his warnings of the military-industrial complex, and a very troubling page of what the trade-offs are, such as buying a single destroyer versus building new homes for 8,000 people (pp. 141-142), an examination of Don Rumsfeld's prevarication when being questioned about the bio-chemical weapons that Rumsfeld helped supply to Iraq during the Reagan Administration (p. 149), and an absolutely BRUTAL, RIVETING comparison of the billions the current Administration has asked to spend in Iraq, where Halliburton can steal it, versus in the US for the same kinds of things: $4.6 billion for Iraqi water and sanitation, only $3.1 billion for the USA--the list goes on and it is DAMNING (p. 202).<br /><br /> Despite the author's clear fury over the misbehavior of the Executive, he gives George W. Bush credit where credit is due, and particularly in relation to the inaugural and the national appearances in the immediate aftermath of 9-11.<br /><br /> The end of the book offers several speeches from the eighty that were delivered on the floor of the Senate, and I remember watching them on C-SPAN and thinking to myself that this was one of the only real men left in the Senate--truly a man of integrity and gravitas.<br /><br /> The book is well put together, and integrates in a very important fashion a deep understanding of the separation of powers and how the Constitution relates to our liberty; a deep understanding and ability to articulate and document the \\"shell game\\" that has been placed by the Administration with its tax cuts for the rich, deficits for the poor and unborn, and \\"transfer authorities\\" for stealing money approved for one thing in order to do another, and finally, a devastating dissection of the naked boy that would be Emperor yet in comparison with ten other Presidents known to the author, the senior Senator from West Virginia, is but \\"ineptitude supreme\\" (p. 107).<br /><br />Senator Byrd saw the future.  The other Senators were cowards and fools.<br /><br />See also, with reviews:<br />[[ASIN:1400065763 Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency]]<br />[[ASIN:0316166286 Blood Money: Wasted Billions, Lost Lives, and Corporate Greed in Iraq]]<br />[[ASIN:1585422762 Weapons of Mass Deception: The Uses of Propaganda in Bush's War on Iraq]]<br />[[ASIN:0865715408 Crossing the Rubicon: The Decline of the American Empire at the End of the Age of Oil]]<br />[[ASIN:0471790184 Twilight in the Desert: The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy]]<br />[[ASIN:0805079386 Blood and Oil: The Dangers and Consequences of America's Growing Dependency on Imported Petroleum]]<br />[[ASIN:0316166286 Blood Money: Wasted Billions, Lost Lives, and Corporate Greed in Iraq]]f America's Growing Dependency on Imported Petroleum]]  [[ASIN:0316166286 Blood Money: Wasted Billions, Lost Lives, and Corporate Greed in Iraq]]	2004-07-28

"Insider" Speaks Truth, Tars Both Parties	Edit of 9 Jan 15 to elevate to 6 stars. In the context of the hundreds of books I have reviewed (see my master list easily found, Worth a Look:  Democracy Lost & Found Essay, Book Review Blurbs and Links, this book stands out as one of the earliest and most thoughtful -- still a classic, still relevant.  SIX STARS.<br /><br />Edit of 16 Apr 08 to add more links on the bad and the good.<br /><br />Edit of 17 Jan 07 to add links.<br /><br />This extraordinary book should be read in tandem with Lewis H. Lapham's [[ASIN:B000H2ME3M Gag Rule: On the Suppression of Dissent and the Stifling of Democracy]] and perhaps also William Greider's [[ASIN:0300119712 The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism]] as well as Jonathan Schell's [[ASIN:0141016868 The Unconquerable World]].<br /><br />I find it extraordinary to have the Chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, which I have always considered to be an old man's club of established elites, largely out of touch with 80% of the real world (that is to say, the 80% that has almost nothing in the way of wealth, health, or rights), step up to the plate and speak truth.<br /><br />This book addresses the second core issue in America's future, i.e. the twin deficits that are not only going to kill the business of America, but also deprive the children of America of their future. (Lapham addresses the first: restoration of honest democracy).  In combination, the $7 trillion deficit in federal spending, and the $500 billion a year trade deficit, with roughly $2 billion in foreign loans being required every single day to keep America afloat, both suggest that we are snorting political cocaine and every one of us is a damn fool for allowing two political parties to get away with selling us down the river.<br /><br />As the author points out in the Preface, when the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cautions its own master, the USA, that it is in danger of becoming an insolvent Third World country, running up bills that \\"would require an immediate and permanent 60 percent hike in the federal income tax, or a 50 percent cut in Social Security and Medicare benefits,\\" we cannot say we have not been warned.<br /><br />The author is balanced, focused, deliberative, and earnest.  He carefully explains how both the \\"mainstream\\" political parties have completely abdicated all responsibility, and completely betrayed the public interest in their eagerness to sell legislation to the highest corporate bidders.<br /><br />There is one grievous flaw in the book.  In concluding that we can only survive by educating ourselves and then finding our voice, the author neglects to address the fast means of achieving short-term fiscal recovery in tandem with campaign finance and electoral reform: the elimination of subsidies, tax fraud, and tax relief for corporations.  We have close to a trillion in unwarranted and unsound subsidies to poor agricultural, fisheries, forestry, and minerals programs where every dollar in subsidy is yielding high long-term costs to the taxpayer citizen; we have over $50 billion a year in documented import-export tax fraud ($25 rocket engines going out, $3000 toothbrushes coming in--advanced money laundering and tax avoidance); finally, the corporate share of federal tax revenue has dropped from 32% to 6% in the past twenty years, with corporations like Halliburton paying $15M in taxes on billions in profit--easy to fix: pay taxes on the profit declared to the stockholders.<br /><br />This is a serious and important book, and it also helps explain why the election of 2004 does not really offer America any choices.  Both candidates are from Yale's Skull and Bones, and neither of them is likely to confront the Wall Street elite and betray their secret society.  As the author points out, both Democrats and Republicans have betrayed the people of America--the individual voter-constituents, and absent a popular revolt that demands a coalition government committed to electoral and campaign financereform, I see nothing but trouble ahead as the America Republic continues to fail, and the American charade grows in its dangerous totalitarian and elitist manifestation.<br /><br />See also on the bad:<br />[[ASIN:B000JMKVAS Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency]]<br />[[ASIN:0195174461 The Broken Branch: How Congress Is Failing America and How to Get It Back on Track (Institutions of American Democracy)]]<br />[[ASIN:B000685KPG Breach of Trust: How Washington Turns Outsiders Into Insiders]]<br /><br />See also on the good:<br />[[ASIN:0759691681 Society's Breakthrough!: Releasing Essential Wisdom and Virtue in All the People]]<br />[[ASIN:0872864758 A Power Governments Cannot Suppress]]<br />[[ASIN:097156616X Collective Intelligence: Creating a Prosperous World at Peace]]s to fail, and the American charade grows in its dangerous totalitarian and elitist manifestation.

He has finally distilled and refined his ideas into a world-class presentation that is a fantastic stage-setter for more substantive and detailed presenations (see second URL in comment).  His current (2007) brain is beyond five stars.  I am so very pleased to see this brilliant development.<br /><br />Old Review (Still Valid on the Book Itself)<br /><br />This is another of those books that started as an article and should have stayed there.  The author, who appears to be either unfamiliar with or unwilling to credit works from earlier decades as well as more recently that present ideas similar to and often superior to his, has essentially three good ideas that can be summed up as follows:<br /><br />Idea #1:  World can be divided into a Functioning Core and a Non-Integrating Gap.  The disconnected gap is bad for business (risky) and the US military can protect its budget by getting into the business of exporting security so that Wall Street can do more business safely.<br /><br />Idea #2: Connectivity or disconnectedness are the essential means of defining and influencing which countries are able to move into the Functioning Core and which remain in the Non-Integrating Gap [too state-centric for my taste, but a good point--my 1990's call for Digital Marshal Plan remains valid.]<br /><br />Idea #3:  Economic relationships have replaced military power as the essential attribute of relations among nations--for example, we cannot deal with China as a military power without first having a comprehensive economic strategy and economic tools with which to influence them.<br /><br />There are many points where I agree with the author, and I give him credit for thinking of all of this on his own, without much attention to decade's worth of scholarship and informed professional opinion in the military journals.  He is absolutely correct to note that we cannot fence the Gap, we must stabilize it.  Of course, Joe Nye and Max Manwaring and Mark Palmer and Bob Oakley and Jonathan Schell, to name just 5 of the 470+ national security authors have made important points along these lines, but their work is not integrated here.  This is one massive Op-Ed that should have remained an article.<br /><br />The author has irritated me with his low-key but obvious assumption that he is the first to break out of the box and \\"get it.\\"  On page 63 he goes on at length with the view that America has lacked visionaries, and the implication that he is the first to come forward.  Not true.  From John Boyd to Chuck Spinney to Bill Lind to GI Wilson to Mike Wylie we have had many visionaries, but the military-industrial complex has always seen them as threats.  We tend to dismiss and shoot our visionaries, and I am truly glad that the author's personal relations with Cebrowski and a few others--as well as his fortunate association with a couple of naval think-forward endeavors--has given him some running room.<br /><br />There is actually little of substance in this book.  The article has been expanded, not with substance, but rather with very long descriptions of this young man's engagement in the process of the Pentagon and the process of strategic reflection.  His discussions of the many forums that he found boring if not hostile to free thinking are excellent, and that aspect of the book takes it to four stars where it might normally have only received three.<br /><br />Two weaknesses of the book, perhaps associated with the author's urgent need to \\"stay inside the wire\\" in order to keep his job:<br /><br />1)  All his brilliance leads to just two forces being recommended: the \\"big stick\\" force and the \\"baton-stick\\" (constabulary) force.  In fact, were he more familiar with the literature, he would have understood that from diverse points we are all converging on four forces after next: Big War, Small War including White Hat/Police Ops, Peace War, and Cyber-Economic War.  Inter-agency strategy, inter-agency budgeting, and inter-agency operations, with a joint inter-agency C4I corps under military direction, are the urgently needed next step.<br /><br />2)  The author is delusional when describing and praising our operational excellence in defeating well-armed enemies.  Were he more familiar with the after action reports from Iraq, particularly those done by the Army War College (clearly on a different planet from the Navel War College), he would understand that Iraqi incompetence was the foremost factor in our success, especially when Rumsfeld insisted on throwing out the sequence of force plans and sending us in light and out of balance.  He also ignores the vulnerability of complex systems and relies much too heavily on University of Maryland and CIA unclassified publications that are completely out of step with European conflict studies and other arduously collected ground truths about the extent of state and sub-state war and violence.<br /><br />I disagree with his concluding recommendations that place Africa last on the list of those areas to be saved.  His overall recommendations are simplistic, focusing on the standard litany for Pentagon go-alongs: Iraq, Korea, Iran, Colombia, Middle East, China, Asian NATO, Latin American NATO, Africa.<br /><br />I note with interest his use of the term, \\"the military-market link.\\"  I believe this refers to an assumption, matured by the author in the course of his Wall Street wargames, and certainly acceptable to the neo-conservatives, to wit, that the U.S. military exists to export security so America can do business.  I would draw the reader's attention to Marine Corps General Butler's book, \\"War as a Racket\\", and his strong objection to having spent his career as an \\"enforcer\\" for US corporations.<br /><br />I do want to end with a note of deep sympathy for the author.  On the one hand, he overcame a period of time when his sanity was questioned by ignorant Admirals and other \\"lesser included\\" Captains of limited intellect.  On other he is trapped in a system that does not like iconoclasts but rewards those who innovate on the margins.  His book is most useful in describing this environment, where people who rely on secrets are completely out of touch with reality, and service chiefs focus on protecting their budgets rather than accomplishing (or even defining) their mission.  He appears to have discovered the Catholic mafia within the naval services, and his several references throughout the book lend weight to my belief that we need to do religious counter-intelligence within the government.budgeting, and inter-agency operations, with a joint inter-agency C4I corps under military direction, are the urgently needed next step.    2)  The author is delusional when describing and praising our operational excellence in defeating well-armed enemies.

However, it is being touted in Special Operations circles, and in the interest of ensuring that I respect and understand what my uniformed colleagues are reading, I made the effort.<br />First off, the book is *mostly* about how terrorism or scorched earth tactics are not a good idea for states.  I agree.  However, the book completely misses the point on how effective terrorist attacks are as a means of causing great economic and social pain to industrial era states that persist in pursuing unilateralist Christian crusades as well as immoral capitalism that enriches micro-elites while disenfranchising the bulk of foreign populations.  Do the math: for $500 *thousand*, Bin Laden got roughly $500 *billion* in costs to the U.S. taxpayer.  He (and his thousands of successors) can keep this up forever, we cannot.<br />There is major aspect of this book that I applaud, and it takes it from 3 to 4 stars: it is the single most effective statement I have seen that denounces U.S. &quot;precision&quot; warfare as not so precision afterall, because of the pre-planned (i.e. pre-meditated and culpable) deaths of tens of thousands of civilians as acceptable &quot;collateral damage.&quot;  Although &quot;total war&quot; certainly applies to state on state warfare, the author correctly notes that killing civilians is neither beneficial nor acceptable when making war on dictators or terrorists.  That has to be &quot;man on man&quot; and America is simply not capable of doing that--the military-industrial complex would cease to exist as we know it if we actually focused on funding ground truth intelligence at the neighborhood level, and the ability to send invisible snake-eater in and out to do justice on the basis of &quot;one man, one bullet,&quot; something I have long advocated.<br />The author is conventionally leftist and in harmony with Chalmer Johnson's and other critiques of the misadventures of the Central Intelligence Agency, but I find his critiques uninformed and sophomoric.  Although I certainly agree with the author's short listing of CIA's analytical and operational failures over time, as someone who actually understands CIA and the US military better than the author, I have to wave the &quot;CRAP&quot; flag on several of this author's pages as they pertain to intelligence, pages 204 and 260 in particular.<br />The book ends with the observation that terrorism is like slavery, piracy, and genocide in that sufficient action must be taken to stop individual behavior along those lines, and the sensible suggestion that &quot;evangelical Western capitalism must learn greater restraint and respect for other cultures&quot; and that Western governments must eschew &quot;gunboat diplomacy as self-defeating.  Golly.  The author may understand but does not demonstrate substantive understanding of the degree to which slavery, piracy, and genocide (18 active campaigns right now, a great deal more than the author's &quot;still attempted in some corners of the world&quot;) continue to be tolerated by Western governments.<br />There is nothing in this book helpful to crafting a new grand strategy balancing military, diplomatic, intelligence, cultural, and economic initiatives to &quot;close the gap&quot; (see my review of Thomas Barnett on &quot;The Pentagon's New Map.&quot;<br />Overall this double-spaced essay with no footnotes strikes me as gross misrepresentation.  The bibliography is marginal, especially with respect to both modern terrorism and U.S. intelligence.  The author took something he knows about--the history of conventional state military warfare--and dressed it up as being relevant to the Global War on Terror.  Yes, but it could have been done in one page. This is a very labor intensive way to get to the obvious point, made much more intelligently by Jonathan Schell in &quot;Unconquerable World&quot;: there are not enough guns in the world to quell instability stemming from abusive government rule and immoral capitalism.  Tony Zinni sums it up in one line: the faster you introduce food into an area, the more quickly the violence ends.ns in the world to quell instability stemming from abusive government rule and immoral capitalism.

It absolutely must be read in conjunction with Peter G. Peterson's &quot;Running on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can do About It&quot; as well as Tom Atlee's &quot;The Tao of Democracy&quot; and Bill Moyers' &quot;Doing Democracy.&quot;<br />Steeped in history and the relationship of dissent to democracy, the author provides a down-to-earth yet erudite condemnation of the ease with which America was led to war on Iraq by a small group of individual who were able to silence Congress, the media, and all other public interest organizations.  From the first chapter to the last, the author follows the Will and Ariel Durant method of balancing easy to read general comments with equally easy to read detailed footnotes.  Early on he singles out Nancy Pelosi and Robert Byrd as being among the few that stood up to the falsehoods and were grounded in reality, speaking out with integrity and courage.<br />Two comparisons are drawn by the author between the Bush Administration's abuse of the law and their control, and the past: the American past, when the Sedition Act was used to jail dissenters and subvert new immigrant voters; and the German past, when Hitler and Goering pulled off a gradual castration of free voice and vote with incremental steps, all done gradually, incrementally, inconspicuously, until suddenly a state of totalitarian rule existed.  As the White House officially considered postponing the Presidential election of 2004, perhaps canceling it all together, one's bones can only feel the chill of these two examples, both discussed calmly and carefully by the author.<br />There is a solid strain of economic thinking woven throughout the book, and one can only conclude that the concentration of wealth and the crimes against the working poor now being perpetuated, can only lead to a Great Depression as the labor economy collapses and the technology economy is attacked by the combined ills of overdue break-down, deliberate sabotage, and a withdrawal of foreign credit.  The author makes the point on page 85 that America has elevated capital above humans--capital votes in America, humans do not, in the one place where it really matters: the crafting of legislation that transfers wealth from the individual working poor to the privilege elite that own the military-industrial-prison complex.<br />Gifted ideas and turns of phrase abound.  The author is consistent with others I have read in lamenting the continuing decline of our educational system, designed to create conformist factory workers, and goes beyond the norm in suggesting that perhaps 70% of our national potential intellectual capacity is being &quot;killed&quot; by the mediocrity of our existing educational institutions.

The author makes the point on page 85 that America has elevated capital above humans--capital votes in America, humans do not, in the one place where it really matters: the crafting of legislation that transfers wealth from the individual working poor to the privilege elite that own the military-industrial-prison complex.<br />Gifted ideas and turns of phrase abound.  The author is consistent with others I have read in lamenting the continuing decline of our educational system, designed to create conformist factory workers, and goes beyond the norm in suggesting that perhaps 70% of our national potential intellectual capacity is being &quot;killed&quot; by the mediocrity of our existing educational institutions.

610098:US	50761804	RQG8V9RP40OO6	0679311718	961150783	Shake Hands With The Devil The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda	Books	5	230	253	N	Y	Genocide is SYMPTOM--Lack of Public Intelligence is CAUSE	I read this book with the eye and mind of a professional intelligence officer long frustrated with the myopia of national policy constituencies, and the stupidity of the United Nations Headquarters culture.  General Dallaire has written a superb book on the reality of massive genocide in the Burundi and Rwanda region in 1994, and his sub-title, \\"The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda\\" is where most people end up in reading this book.<br /><br />I see things a little differently.  I see this book as a massive indictment of the United Nations culture of \\"go along gently\\", as a compelling documentary of how ignorant the United Nations is about impending disasters because of its persistent refusal to establish a UN intelligence secretariat as recommended by the Brahimi Report, and as a case study in how the Western nations have failed to establish coherent global strategies--and the intelligence-policy dialogues necessary to keep such strategies updated and relevant.<br /><br />According to the author, 15 UN peacekeepers died--over 800,000 Rwandans died.  The number 15 is not larger because Belgium, Canada, and the US explicitly stated that Rwanda was \\"irrelevant\\" in any sense of the word, and not worth the death of a single additional Western (mostly white) soldier.<br /><br />Although there has been slight improvement in the UN since LtGen Patrick Cammaert, NL RM became the Military Advisor to the Secretary General (see General Cammaert and other views in [[ASIN:0971566127 Peacekeeping Intelligence: Emerging Concepts for the Future]], the reality is that the UN is still unintelligent and unable to muster the strategic intelligence necessary to get the mandate right; the operational intelligence necessary to get the force structure right; and the tactical intelligence necessary to achieve the mission on the ground.  Just about everything General Dallaire writes about in this book with respect to UN culture and UN lack of intelligence remains valid today: they still cannot get decent maps with which to plan a campaign or execute the mission; UN administrators are still anal-retentive bureaucrats that will not issue paper and pencils, much less soft drinks for diplomatic encounters; UN \\"seniors\\" still like the first class lifestyle on the road (they pretend to be austere only in NY); UN civilian mission leaders still misrepresent military reporting, as Booh-Booh did to Dallaire; and the UN is still ineffective in creating public intelligence with which to communicate directly to national publics the reasons why humanitarian operations must take place early and in force.<br /><br />General Dallaire concludes his excruciatingly detailed book, a book with enormous credibility stemming from the meticulous manner in which he documents what happened, when it happened, and what everyone knew when (including advance warning of the genocide from the \\"third force\\" that the UN leadership refused to take seriously), with two thoughts, one running throughout the book, the second in the conclusion only:<br /><br />First, and perhaps because of the mental toll he himself paid for this mission, there are frequent references throughout the book to the urgency of understanding the psychology of groups, tribes, and cultures.  This is not something any Western intelligence agency is capable of today.  The closest I have seen to this is Dr. Marc Sageman's book on [[ASIN:0812238087 Understanding Terror Networks]]  We urgently need a global \\"survey\\", with specific reference to the countries plagued by ethnic conflict and other sources of instability, and we need to start taking \\"psychological intelligence\\" very seriously.  We need to UNDERSTAND.<br /><br />Second, he concludes the book by emphasizing the urgency of understanding and then correcting the sources of the utter RAGE that characterizes hundreds of thousands if not millions of young men around the world, all of whom he says have access to guns and many of whom he says will ultimately and unavoidablyhave access to weapons of mass destruction.<br /><br />As I contemplate the six-front hundred-year war that America has started by attacking Iraq instead of addressing the social networks and sources of terrorism, I cannot help but think that this great solider and statesman has hit the nail on the head: Rwanda is coming to your neighborhood, and nothing your policy makers and military leaders are doing today is relevant to avoiding that visitation.  Remember the kindergarten class in Scotland?  The Columbine shootings and Oklahoma disasters?  Now magnify that by 1000X, aggravated by a mix of angry domestic militants, alienated immigrant gangs, hysterical working poor fathers pushed into insanity--and the free availability of small arms, toxins, and simple means for collapsing the public infrastructure....<br /><br />The complexity of society, which has lost its humanity, is leading to unpredictable and difficult to diagnose and correct collapses of all the basic mechanisms of survival.  General Dallaire's book is not about Rwanda--it is about us and what will happen to us if we persist in being unintelligent about our world and the forces that could--if we were wise--permit billions to survive in peace.<br /><br />In addition to this book I recommend the PKI book mentioned above, Jonathan Schell's book on [[ASIN:B000HOMU0M The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People]] Bill Moyer's on [[ASIN:0865714185 Doing Democracy]], and Tom Atlee on [[ASIN:193213347X The Tao of Democracy: Using Co-Intelligence to Create a World That Works for All]].

His deep personal relationships across the U.S. Intelligence Community make him the best possible reporter.<br />For those of us steeped in the literature, that routinely read both the daily reporting and the regular books, much of what Jim has put together here will be repetitive.  This is, however, the very best book to read if you only have the time for one book on the topic of 9-11, the failure of U.S. intelligence, and the corruption of U.S. policy in using 9-11 as a pretext for invading Iraq and giving Bin Laden the best possible (i.e. most stupid) strategic response to 9-11.<br />This is the ideal book for any citizen who wants a professional &quot;once over&quot; tour of the various intelligence and policy pieces that broke down and allowed 9-11 to happen, and then allowed the entire &quot;balance of powers&quot; construct from our Founding Fathers to fly out the window.  If you want to go deeper, see my thirteen Lists and 479+ other reviews of national security non-fiction.<br />The book is especially strong on the Rendon Group being used to illegally propagandize American citizens with U.S. taxpayer funds, on the abject failure of George Tenet in revitalizing U.S. clandestine operations, on the failure (treated more kindly) of Mike Hayden to bring the National Security Agency into the 21st Century, and on the very unhealthy merger of the U.S. neoconservatives that captured the White House, and well-funded Zionists in both America and Israel who essentially bought themselves an invasion of Iraq--a remarkable coincidence of interests: Jews paying to invade Iraq, Iranians using Chalabi to feed lies to the neo-cons so they would be deceived into thinking Iraq would be a cake-walk, and Bin Laden never daring to dream the entire U.S. population and all arms of government--including a passive media--would &quot;sleep walk&quot; into what this book suggests is one of the dumbest and most costly strategic errors in the national security history of the USA.<br />This book is not, despite some of the ideologically-motivated reviews below, an attack of George Bush Junior, as much as it is an appalled and informed review of how a complex government collapsed in the face of 9-11, and a handful of ostensibly patriotic and very myopic individuals were able to abuse their personal power because all of the professional counter-forces: the diplomats, the spies, the military professionals, the Congress, the media--every single one was not sufficiently competent nor sufficiently motivated to mandate a more balanced policy process that could understand the many global threats (terrorism and Iraq are actually two of the lesser ones), devise a comprehensive long-term strategy, and execute that strategy using *all* of the instruments of national power, including strong global alliances that lead all governments to fight all gangs in the most effective fashion possible.<br />We let kids play with matches, and they burned down the house.quot;sleep walk&quot; into what this book suggests is one of the dumbest and most costly strategic errors in the national security history of the USA.<br />This book is not, despite some of the ideologically-motivated reviews below, an attack of George Bush Junior, as much as it is an appalled and informed review of how a complex government collapsed in the face of 9-11, and a handful of ostensibly patriotic and very myopic individuals were able to abuse their personal power because all of the professional counter-forces: the diplomats, the spies, the military professionals, the Congress, the media--every single one was not sufficiently competent nor sufficiently motivated to mandate a more balanced policy process that could understand the many global threats (terrorism and Iraq are actually two of the lesser ones), devise a comprehensive long-term strategy, and execute that strategy using *all* of the instruments of national power, including strong global alliances that lead all governments to fight all gangs in the most effective fashion possible.<br />We let kids play with matches, and they burned down the house.	2004-06-27

From my own role as a former spy and now global proponent for improved use of open sources of information to product open source intelligence, I regard the author's methodical review of sources and their dangers to be among the very best I have ever seen.  His details on press misinformation and the laziness of journalists, and his understanding of how many &quot;leads&quot; about terrorists are actually more sinister and selfish efforts to settle personal scores by fabricating the leads to destroy others using American power, are clear signs that this author is a top-notch professional.<br />In general the book and the original research by the author confirm what earlier scholars of revolution (Chalmers Johnson, Ted Gurr, Eckstein, among others) have documented in the past, to wit that most top-notch terrorists are middle-class, smart, educated beyond the norm, and grow into their motivation.  They are *not* crazy and suicide is a rational choice for them, not an aberrant behavior.<br />I found the author's observation that recruitment is a bottom-up self-selected process rather than a top-down &quot;seek out and recruit&quot; process, quite fascinating, especially when the author makes the point that these people are NOT brainwashed.  This is about a conflict of ideas, of ideals, of perception, and of context, and America is clearly not able to field the &quot;idea army&quot; and is not able to be competitive with Bin Laden in the war for the hearts and minds of these hundreds of thousands of prospective terrorists.<br />Most importantly, the author documents that Bin Laden is not your typical terrorist, is not seeking a controlled network, and is perhaps most brilliant for letting thousands of cells blossom with a little financial nurturing and a lot of social liberty.<br />The author documents the return of kinship as a source of power--kinship and social networking as means of organizing, as means of providing security, as means of radicalizing supporters.<br />The book is disappointing in two respects--a cursory conclusion as to how to marshal global resources against their severe threat, and no reference to the Pakistani and Hamas variants of terrorism, nor to the overlapping networking of ethnic criminal, corrupt government, and motivated terrorist networks.<br />For those interested in understanding the terrorist threat at the individual level of detail, I recommend this book together with Yossef Bodansky's classic on &quot;Bin Laden: the Man Who Declared War on America&quot; and Steve Emerson's more recent &quot;American Jihad.&quot;  However, for a broader strategic understanding of the emerging threats and the reasons why billions are increasingly against America, I suggest the Amazon customer consider the several books in my Emerging Threats List and my Blowback List (&quot;see more about me&quot; should really say &quot;see my other reviews and specific lists&quot;).<br />I believe this author has more to offer, and would be interested in a second book from him, one that answers the specific question: &quot;How must America behave, what pathologies of American corporate and government action must be corrected, if we are to live in peace with billions of faithful Muslims?&quot;  The author has helped us understand the core of the terrorist networks that are capable of bringing down America.

For the serious, this book absolutely merits a careful reading, together with Dana Priest's &quot;The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military,&quot; and--for a fuller and free overview--my varioius reviews on emerging threats, strategy and force structure, and why our current &quot;military only&quot; approach to foreign policy is ineffective.<br />There are some tremendous gems in this book, some of which I summarize here.<br />1)  Zinni is mpressive in his grasp of grand strategy, of the urgency of understanding the threat, devising a full approach that mixes and matches *all* instruments of national strategy, and that focuses--as Zinni learned to focus in Viet-Nam, on the hearts and minds of the people rather than the force on force battles (a means to an end, not an end in themselves).<br />2)  Zinni's understanding of war comes across very early in the book when he describes the six completely different wars that took place in South Viet-Nam, each with its own lessons, tactics, and sometimes equipment differences--nuances that conventional military policy, doctine, and acquisition managers back in the US still do not understand: a) Swamp War, b) Paddy War, c) Jungle War, d) Plains War, e) Saigon War, and f) DMZ War.<br />3)  Zinni has read SLA Marshall on &quot;The Soldier's Load&quot;, and he notes that the equipment that the South Vietnamese carried was lighter and better for their needs--the US military-industrial complex burdens our Armed Forces with overly heavy things, too many of them, that actually impair our ability to fight.  Perhaps even more fascinating, Zinni sees that buying equipment for our troops locally cuts the cost by 4/5th.  Not what your average US contractor wants to hear, but precisely what I as a taxpayer am looking for--with the added advantage that this puts money into the local economy and helps stabilize it.<br />4)  Within the center of the book, there are rich lessons about war-fighting and peace-making that will stand the test of time.  Most impressive is Zinni's focus on pre-emptive relationship building across the region.<br />a) Relationships matter, and relationships forged in advance go a very long way in avoiding misunderstanding and defusing crises.  If you have to fight, relationships are the single best means of reducing the fog of war and assuring good integration of effort across cultures, nations, and armies.<br />b) Speed and mixed forces matter.  Zinni was the master, in four different timeframes, of using speed and properly mixed forces to achieve effects not possible with larger forces arriving late.  In Viet-Nam he worked with &quot;the Pacifiers&quot;, especially reinforced company-size units that had been specially augmented with flamethrowers, extra machine guns and mortars, and their own engineers and scouts, all trained for instant deployment. At Camp Hansen, during the times of race riots, he learned the value of a fast, big guard force *combined with* constant and open dialog with the troops in distress. In humanitarian operations, he learned that rapid delivery of food tended to rapidly reduce the violence--get the food flowing fast, and reap the peace benefits.  And finally, in developing the Marine Corps variant of special operations capable forces (not to be confused with the uniquely qualified Special Operations Forces), he developed the original capabilities of doing special things &quot;from the sea.&quot;<br />c)  Non-state entities, both tribal threats and non-governmental organizations, are the heart of the new battle.  Repeatedly Zinni comments on how poorly we do in terms of thinking about strategy, operations, and tactics for the sub-state war, and how badly we do at intelligence about tribes, and at coordinating with non-governmental organizations.  Zinni finally discovered the true value of Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations as a flag officer, and ended up nurturing the creation of Civil Military Operations Centers, and anew language, such as &quot;Humanitarian Relief Sectors&quot; instead of &quot;kill zone.&quot;<br />5)  Zinni makes some other observations throughout the book that are relevant now.<br />a)  His respects Clinton as a quick study.  Without disparagement, he makes it clear that Sandy Berger and Bill Cohen were mediocrities.  He admired James Baker, who tried to do Marshall Plan kinds of things and could not get the beltway crowd to see the light.  He is cautionary on General Wayne Downing (who went on with the Rendon Group to sponsor Chalabi--Zinni, on page 343, makes it clear he knew Chalabi was a thief and liar as early as 1998).  He is admiring of Ambassador Bob Oakley.<br />b)  With respect for foreign capabilities, among the insights are the integrity and capability of Pakistani and Bangladeshi troops, who maintained and then returned US complex equipment in better condition than it was received, with every single tool in every single kit present and accounted for; Italian military field hospitals; African troop tactical fighting discipline and capability.<br />6)  The book wraps up with Zinni's recommendations for change, all of which are on target: use retired Service and theater chiefs to constitute the Joint Chiefs of Staff, rather than the Service Chiefs with their parochial interests; earmark budgets for the theater commanders--inter-agency budgets; create an inter-agency strategy and operations center to make the government, not just the military, &quot;joint.&quot;<br />Zinni's final observations deal with ethics and the obligation to avoid spin and always speak the truth.  Zinni is smarter than the current crop of military leaders, who mistake loyalty to specific individuals with loyalty to the Constitution.  He also differs from them in understanding that Operations Other than War (OOTW) is where it is at and will be for the foreseeable future.<br />Missing from the book is any reference to national and military intelligence, other than one small section where he notes it simply was not reliable and not available at the tribal level.  Also missing from this book are any references to John Boyd, Mike Wylie, Bill Lind, or G.I. Wilson, all four of whom were, in my opinion, the legs of the intellectual stool that Zinni constructed for himself over time.<br />This is a serious book., and a new language, such as &quot;Humanitarian Relief Sectors&quot; instead of &quot;kill zone.&quot;<br />5)  Zinni makes some other observations throughout the book that are relevant now.  <br />a)  His respects Clinton as a quick study.

It should be read in tandem with several other books, including George Crile's &quot;Charlie Wilson's War: The Extraordinary Story of the Largest Covert Operation in History&quot; and the Milt Bearden/James Risen tome on &quot;The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB.&quot;<br />The most important point in the book is not one the author intended to make.  He inadvertently but most helpfully points to the fact that at no time did the U.S. government, in lacking a policy on Afghanistan across several Administrations, think about the strategic implications of &quot;big money movements.&quot;  I refer to Saudi Oil, Afghan Drugs, and CIA Cash.<br />Early on the book shows that Afghanistan was not important to the incumbent Administration, and that the Directorate of Operations, which treats third-world countries as hunting grounds for Soviets rather than targets in their own right, had eliminated Afghanistan as a &quot;collection objective&quot; in the late 1980's through the early 1990's.  It should be no surprise that the CIA consequently failed to predict the fall of Kabul (or in later years, the rise of the Taliban).<br />Iran plays heavily in the book, and that is one of the book's strong points.  From the 1979 riots against the U.S. Embassies in Iran and in Pakistan, to the end of the book, the hand of Iran is clearly perceived.  As we reflect on Iran's enormous success in 2002-2004 in using Chalabi to deceive the Bush Administration into wiping out Saddam Hussein and opening Iraq for Iranian capture, at a cost to the US taxpayer of over $400 billion dollars, we can only compare Iran to the leadership of North Viet-Nam.  Iran has a strategic culture, the US does not.  The North Vietnamese beat the US for that reason.  Absent the development of a strategic culture within the US, one that is not corrupted by ideological fantasy, Iran will ultimately beat the US and Israel in the Middle East.<br />The greatest failure of the CIA comes across throughout early in the book: the CIA missed the radicalization of Islam and its implications for global destabilization.  It did so for three reasons: 1) CIA obsession with hard targets to the detriment of global coverage; 2) CIA obsession with technical secrets rather than human overt and covert information; and 3) CIA laziness and political naivet&eacute; in relying on foreign liaison, and especially on Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.<br />Both Admiral Stansfield Turner and Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski come in for criticism here.  Turner for gutting the CIA, Brzezinski for telling Pakistan it could go nuclear (page 51) in return for help against the Soviets in Afghanistan.<br />Although the book does not focus on Bin Laden until he becomes a player in Afghanistan, it does provide much better discussion of Bin Laden's very close relations with Saudi intelligence, including the Chief of Staff of Saudi intelligence at the time, Bin Laden's former teacher and mentor.  There appears to be no question, from this and other sources, including Yossef Bodansky's book on Bin Laden and David Kaplan's US News &amp; World Report on Saudi sponsorship of global terrorism, that Bin Laden has been the primary Saudi intelligence agent of influence for exporting terrorism and Islamic radicalism to South Asia, the Pacific Rim, Africa, Europe, Russia, and the US.  CIA and the FBI failed to detect this global threat, and the USG failed to understand that World War III started in 1989.  As with other evils, the US obsession about communism led it to sponsor new emerging threats that might not otherwise have become real.  However, the book also provides the first documentation I have seen that Bin Laden was &quot;noticed&quot; by the CIA in 1985 (page 146), and that Bin Laden opened his US office in 1986.  It was also about this time that the Russian &quot;got it&quot; on the radical Islamic threat, told the US, and got blown off.  Bob Gates and George Shultz were wrong to doubt the Soviets when they laid out Soviet plans to leave Afghanistan and Soviet concern about both the future of Afghanistan and the emerging threat from Islamic terrorism.<br />The middle of the book can be considered a case study in how Pakistani deception combined with American ignorance led us to make many errors of judgment.  Some US experts did see the situation clearly--Ed McWilliams from State (&quot;Evil Little Person&quot; per Milt Bearden) comes out of this book looking very very smart.<br />The final portions of the book are detailed and balanced.  What comes across is both a failure of the US to think strategically, and the incredibly intelligent manner in which Bin Laden does think globally, strategically, and unconventionally.  Bin Laden understands the new equation: low-cost terrorism equals very high cost economic dislocation.<br />Side note: CIA provided the Islamic warriors in Afghanistan with enough explosives to blow up half of New York (page 135), and with over 2000 Stinger missiles, 600 of which appear to remain in the hands of anti-US forces today, possibly including a number shipped to Iran for re-purposing (ie London, Dallas, Houston)<br />One final note: morality matters.  I am greatly impressed with the author's judgment in focusing on the importance that Bin Laden places on the corruption of US and Saudi Arabian governments and corporations as the justification for his jihad.  Will and Ariel Durant, in &quot;The Lessons of History,&quot; make a special point of discussing the long-term strategic value of morality as a &quot;force&quot; that impacts on the destiny of nations and peoples.  The US has lost that part of the battle, for now, and before we can beat Bin Laden, we must first clean our own house and demand that the Saudi's clean theirs or be abandoned as a US ally.  Morality matters.  Strategic culture matters.  On these two counts, Bin Laden is winning for now.this time that the Russian &quot;got it&quot; on the radical Islamic threat, told the US, and got blown off.  Bob Gates and George Shultz were wrong to doubt the Soviets when they laid out Soviet plans to leave Afghanistan and Soviet concern about both the future of Afghanistan and the emerging threat from Islamic terrorism.<br />The middle of the book can be considered a case study in how Pakistani deception combined with American ignorance led us to make many errors of judgment.  Some US experts did see the situation clearly--Ed McWilliams from State (&quot;Evil Little Person&quot; per Milt Bearden) comes out of this book looking very very smart.<br />The final portions of the book are detailed and balanced.  What comes across is both a failure of the US to think strategically, and the incredibly intelligent manner in which Bin Laden does think globally, strategically, and unconventionally.  Bin Laden understands the new equation: low-cost terrorism equals very high cost economic dislocation.<br />Side note: CIA provided the Islamic warriors in Afghanistan with enough explosives to blow up half of New York (page 135), and with over 2000 Stinger missiles, 600 of which appear to remain in the hands of anti-US forces today, possibly including a number shipped to Iran for re-purposing (ie London, Dallas, Houston)<br />One final note: morality matters.  I am greatly impressed with the author's judgment in focusing on the importance that Bin Laden places on the corruption of US and Saudi Arabian governments and corporations as the justification for his jihad.  Will and Ariel Durant, in &quot;The Lessons of History,&quot; make a special point of discussing the long-term strategic value of morality as a &quot;force&quot; that impacts on the destiny of nations and peoples.  The US has lost that part of the battle, for now, and before we can beat Bin Laden, we must first clean our own house and demand that the Saudi's clean theirs or be abandoned as a US ally.  Morality matters.  Strategic culture matters.  On these two counts, Bin Laden is winning for now.	2004-06-10

FOX News is, as we speak, leading a massive campaign to deceive Americans into thinking that we must attack Iran.  Iran is Persian.  They are running circles around us as our Army hollows out and our four carriers steam within range of Iranian Sunburn missiles.  Adding two images and several hot links to books that make it quite clear that this book is by, of, and for idiots.<br /><br />Edited after over a year to reflect the deep impression that \\"Civilization and Its Enemies\\" by Lee Harris has made on me.  Amazon does not allow edited reviews to increase the star level, so I will say that after Harris, I would raise this book to two stars with the following obervation: having the right instincts--wanting to go after Iran in particular, and Syria--does not justify lying to the public or failing to do your homework.<br /><br />Of the 3,000 or so volumes in my current library, I have only reviewed 950.  I do not write negative reviews as a rule.  This is my third exception to the latter rule.  The most ignorant book was one on predicting revolution, the second most ignorant book was one on sources of conflict, and this is the third.<br /><br />The authors, who demonstrate how far one could get in the Cold War military without reading or thinking, call this a military assessment.  It is not.  It is a one-track discourse on why we need to use our heavy metal military to wipe out Syria and Iran and intimidate Libya and Pakistan.  It avoids discussing Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Central Asia, Muslim Africa, and Muslim Pacifica.  This is not analysis, this is flim-flam.<br /><br />By way of context in my specific criticism of this book, let me just note that the bibliography does not reflect any appreciation for strategy, e.g. Colin Gray's \\"Modern Strategy\\", or Col Dr. Max Manwaring and Ambassadors Corr and Dorff's \\"The Search for Security\\", or Willard Matthias \\"America's Strategic Blunders\\" or Adda Bozeman's \\"Strategic Intelligence & Statecraft\\" or Jonathan Schell's \\"Unconquerable World.\\"  I looked in vain for any sign the authors might comprehend the strategic context in which their specific beliefs and recommendations can only be seen as ill-advised.  For example, a reference to Shultz, Godson, and Quester (at least one of whom is a neo-conservative), \\"Security Studies for the 21st Century\\", or Robert McNamara and James Blight \\"Wilson's Ghost\\", or Dean Jeffrey Garten's \\"The Politics of Fortune\\", or Republican and conservative Clyde Prestowitz's \\"Rogue Nation\\", or Ambassador Mark Palmer's \\"Breaking the Real Axis of Evil\\".  No cognizance of Kissinger, even.<br /><br />Never mind all those *democratic* thought leaders, like Senator David Boren et al (and including Bob Gates), \\"Preparing America's Foreign Policy for the21st Century\\", or Joesph Nye on \\"The Paradox of American Power\\" or William Shawcross (a Brit) on \\"Deliver Us From Evil: Peacekeepers, Warlords and a World of Endless Conflict\\", or Paul Krugman's \\"The Great Unraveling.\\"<br /><br />I did not expect to find, but mention as a final setting of the stage for a very critical review, just a sampling of books relevant to getting the war on terror right: books like Chalmer's Johnson, \\"The Sorrors of Empire\\" or Derek Leebaert's \\"The Fifty Year Wound: The True Price of America's Cold War Victory\\" or Ziauddin Sardar and Merry Wyn Davies on \\"Why Do People Hate America\\" (which could be sub-titled, most relevantly for the authors under review, \\"and why doesn't America understand the real world\\"), or any of the last 100 non-fiction books on national security that I have reviewed here, generally to very favorable judgements by Amazon visitors.<br /><br />Finally, I contrast this book with Richard Clarke's book \\"Against All Enemies: Inside America's War on Terror\\" which I recommend very highly.  Clarke is real, these people are not.<br /><br />I finally figured it out.  This is a puff piece of, by, and for FOX Cable News viewers.<br /><br />There are no footnotes in this book.  It is a rambling opinion piece.  Let us not confuse rank with brains, or opinions with thought.  This is a double-spaced book that could probably be distilled to 30 pages of core reading, all summed up as \\"we're always right, no matter the cost.\\"  This book also adopts the Richard Perle neoconservative game plan of using terrorism as a pretext to invade Syria and Iran.  I assure each and every one of you, a universal draft is planned for after the election.  Your sons and daughters will be sacrificed to the lack of strategic thinking that this book represents.<br /><br />The book ends on two false notes.  Although the authors demonstrate a semblance of balance in calling for better public diplomacy and especially the restoration of the US Information Agency, they continue to emphasize money for guns and the early use of the military in expeditionary mode, rather that a truly transformative strategy that begins with understanding the full range of threats facing us (bacteria are more dangerous than terrorists), devising a strategy for dealing with those threats by using *all* of the instruments of national power, and then a balanced budget that achieves all of that without sacrificing the earning potential of future generations.<br /><br />Finally, we have thirteen pages of photographs where the authors proudly display their field trip photos, and what leaps out to the veteran's eye is that they were always in air-conditioned rooms and cars and never broke a sweat.  As my good friend Robert Young Pelton likes to say (he is author of \\"The World's Most Dangerous Places\\"--you should all read it), these guys live and think in a bubble--they don't get into the gutter, they don't smell the shit, and they have no idea how close their fantasy world is to destruction from forces that are beyond their comprehension.<br /><br />Iraq, and the planned war on Syria and Iran, are indeed a recurrence of Vietnam in the sense that ignorance and arrogance among the elite in power, and apathy among the public and within Congress, are creating a most costly global quagmire that will shortly explode in Australia, Thailand, Central Asia, Latin America, and Africa.  The authors have learned nothing from history nor from the many non-partisan American strategists and scholars available to advise them.<br /><br />I don't think this book is worth the purchase price, except as an example of the kinds of books, and kinds of people, that place loyalty to ideology above and apart from the public interest.<br /><br />The authors have one thing right: this is a battle of wills.  They do not appear to realize that there are not enough guns on the planet to execute their strategy, and that legitimacy is an intangible value that was lost to America from 2001to date.  This book is a blueprint for a nuclear winter in which America self-immolates.  An Israeli tactical nuclear attack on Iran will kick off the end of the American Empire, and that may well be the best thing that could happen, to awaken the somolent Republic.  We must indict and impeach Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Rudy Gulliani, and we must indict and sentence to death Larry Silverstein for his role in the controlled demotion of the World Trade Center including WTC 7 which was not hit by anything, it was also brought down to destroy evidence and complete the highly profitable elimination of asbestor at the cost of thousands of NYC lives.

Absolutely recommended as a readings book for all university classes, both graduate and undergraduate, focusing on intelligence.<br />I was pleasantly surprised to see one of my very old articles on open source intelligence (from about 1995) in the book.  It was sufficient for the book's purposes, but suffered from not having been sent to me for review--for example, on page 115 the practical example that was attributed to a Marine Corps wargame on Somalia is a repeat of an editorial error at the International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence.  This performance was actually for the Aspin-Brown Commission, where 6 telephone calls, on an overnight basis, produced vastly more than the US Intelligence Community was able to find with its billions of dollars in capability.  I hope and suspect that the other chapters do not have the same problem as OSINT is the most vibrant and newest aspect of intelligence, and the other articles and authors have a richer past and more stable story.  To update on OSINT, Google for &lt;Open Source Intelligence OSINT&gt; without quotes or the brackets.<br />The book is weak in failing to properly criticize the US clandestine service, in failing to examine the complete lack of multi-disciplinary processing and lack of analytic toolkits and trade-craft (Jack Davis should have been in this book, Google for &quot;analytic tradecraft&quot;), and in failing to both examine other nations such as China and Israel and The Netherlands, as well as other intelligence tribes and the prospects for collaboration among national, military, law enforcement, business, academic, NGO-media, and citizen-labor-religious intelligence.<br />The book would have benefited from a tenth section focusing on intelligence challenges of the future, including special chapters on peacekeeping intelligence, medical intelligence, environmental intelligence, corporate and common crime intelligence, and religious or cultural intelligence.<br />The bibliography is weak and appears to have been thrown together, failing to list most of the top 25 books on intelligence that I have listed as essential reading for Amazon (see more about me should really say see my other reviews and lists--follow it for the lists on information society, intelligence, emerging threats, strategy &amp; force structure, etc.).<br />The publisher should immediately correct the deficiencies in this book's listing here at Amazon, because this is a superb book that merits the respect of every professional and every professor teaching intelligence.  It should be a standard reference in the military and law enforcement schoolhouses.  However, the publisher should immediately begin planning a second edition with an improved bibliography, an index of relevant web sites, and the new Part X suggested above.<br />Kudos to Johnson and Wirtz for a job well done.  The intellect and time that went into selecting each contributor is not to be underestimated.  This is a magnificent effort and will be very valuable to all students in all seven tribes (all of whom are now using MeetUp to link up in cities around the world).  I want the second edition, improved as noted above, out within the year.d as noted above, out within the year.	2004-05-15

Clarke confirms that as of January 2001, despite a decade or more of Al Qaeda activism, &quot;most senior officials in the administration did not know the term.&quot;<br />The historical review, going back to the Iranian revolution of 1979 (which overturned a CIA coup much earlier) and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (which mobilized global jihad), is quite helpful.  The failure of the White House to kill the Republican Guard in the first Gulf War, and the post-Gulf War decision to put thousands and thousands of US contractors into Saudi Arabia, thus further inflaming Saudi dissidents, and the related misadventures in Lebanon as well as over-tolerance for Israeli aggression on the Palestinians, are all put into useful context.  The book begins with a solid meticulous review unlike any other I have found.<br />CIA and FBI both take substantive and deserved beatings.  The CIA Directorate of Operations--with the full backing of the DCI-- cannot be considered to be anything other than &quot;chickenshit&quot; in the manner in which it blocked just about every proposed initiative including the arming of the Predators and the insertion of language-qualified personnel into Afghanistan.<br />Clarke lists four strategic mistakes: 1) CIA becoming overly dependent on the Pakistani intelligence service; 2) CIA importation to the Afghanistan jihad of Arab extremists it did not understand; 3) USG's quick pull-out from Afghanistan without flooding them with water, food, medicine, and security first; and 4) US ignorance of and failure to help Pakistan stabilize itself and survive the deadly mix of millions of Afghan refugees and thousands of radicalized Arab Muslims.<br />The Saudi government's sponsorship of Bin Laden as a religious revolutionary with a global mission beginning in 1989 cannot be denied.  The book documents what we knew and when we knew it, and how we chose to ignore it.<br />1993-1994 were clearly turning point years--both the 1993 World Trade Center car bombing, and the discovery of a network of suicidal terrorists based in the US and tied to the blind Muslim preacher in Brooklyn, should have but did not lead to a nation-wide cleansing and appropriate border controls and foreign intelligence measures.  Al Qaeda was formed in 1990.  It would be five years before CIA and the FBI would realize this.<br />On page 84, Clarke makes my day by providing the ultimate OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) story.  After ordering a strike on Iraqi intelligence headquarters, Clinton refused to go on TV until it was confirmed.  The $35 billion a year intelligence community could not confirm it--no spies or agents on the ground, satellites out of position, etcetera.  Bill Clinton, without telling anyone, called CNN, CNN called its Jordan bureau, whose cameraman had a cousin who lived near the intelligence headquarters, who confirmed the strike.&quot;  Got to love it--all money, no eyes.  When will Congress get it!?<br />Clarke confirms the many ugly stories about CIA's operational incompetence in Somalia (professionals will recall we sent old dogs without language skills, two of whom went nuts, literally, afterwards).  The following quote should be hung in CIA's entryway until we get a serious clandestine service: &quot;They had nobody in the country when the Marines landed.  Then they sent in a few guys who had never been there before.  They swapped people out every few weeks and they stayed holed up in the U.S. compound on the beach, in comfy trailer homes that they had flown in by the Air Force.&quot;  Sure, there have been some improvements, but as CIA operations super-star Reuel Gerecht says, until diarrhea is accepted as part of the job description, the DO will never be real.<br />Clarke sums up the Clinton era by saying that policy was good, and intelligence bad.  The bureaucracy was not willing to take terrorism seriously nor to work as a team.  He sums up the Bush the Second era by saying that both were bad.  Clarke slams George Tenet repeatedly, identifying 1994 as the year in which he blew the chance to nail Bin Laden and the Saudis early on.<br />Clarke fails Congress for failing America in 1995, when its oversight should have identified the failures of the past two years, and moved to correct them.<br />The Atlanta Olympics stand out as a major success story, and I emphasize this to note that there were successes, and there were extraordinary new means developed of planning, of inter-agency coordination, of rapid response.  The Secret Service emerges from Clarke's book with its reputation much enhanced.<br />Saudi mendacity and Canadian complacency (the latter fixed since 9-11, the former not) get special mention.  Prince Bandar is labeled a liar on more than one occasion.<br />There are many other important points raised by this book, including specific recommendations for addressing our global vulnerability to terrorism, and they will not be listed here.  Buy the book.<br />One final comment: this is a very intelligent man who has actually read books and done some cross-cultural historical thinking.  He laments the fact that politicians with power tend to view visionaries with knowledge as nuts (page 131).  This is a brilliant book that should be read in detail, not--as Rich Armitage confessed to the 9-11 Commission on C-SPAN--the way Washington reads: checking the index for one's name.

667578:US	50761804	R3M4ABNA4XEQT1	0520215621	351140215	Yakuza: Japan's Criminal Underworld, Expanded Edition	Books	5	51	57	N	N	Solid Reference Work--Need Same for US	This is a solid reference work, and expands and updates on the earlier work that was itself a classic.  It examines structured corruption in which organized crime, organized politics, and secretive corporate conglomerates, all help one another become wealthy at the expense of the public.<br />There are a number of fine points across the book that merit emphasis here, and one of the earliest is that of how the CIA and the Army G-2 deliberately nurtured Japanese criminal organizations during the occupation, because they were &quot;anti-communist.&quot;<br />There is an excellent section of the book that focuses on how the US government fostering of political corruption in Japan in turn led to US corporate corruption, to include the funding of separate US corporate foreign policies anti-thetical to those Congress was trying to foster in the days before Congress abdicated its responsibilities.<br />Lee Kuan Yew would like this book.  He says the only antidote to organized crime is strong extended families--natural families whose kinship equates to ethics.  The book documents the spread of crime in Japan to every aspect of life, and one can only be saddened to see how the concepts of samurai honor and loyalty have been turned upside down.<br />Three ideas keep running through my mind as I read the book, two of them from the author and the third my own.  First, the authors focused on the importance of following the money.  He knew and wrote about this in the mid-1980's, but today the US Government is still marginally able to follow money, especially informal money that the FBI only discovered in the late 1990's with help from Dick Clarke (see my review of &quot;Against All Enemies&quot;).  Following the money is *the* intelligence challenge of the 21st Century, and it is not something CIA can do--we have to find means of integrating all seven tribes, and especially business and banks as well as law enforcement at every level.  Second, the author documents the weakness of Japanese law enforcement in a manner that highlights the weakness of US law enforcement at the state and local levels.  Think of this book as traveling back in time to Japan, and then forward in time to the US, where we are now suffering many of the same problems.  Finally, being a fan of Special Operations properly done, I realized that 21st Century warfare is going to be about man-hunts.  It is going to be about tribal and criminal orders of battle, and about decapitating terrorist and criminal gangs without mercy.<br />The book spends some time on how US forces overseas are in fact a major stimulant and catalyst for crime, especially drugs and trade in women and children.  By sending our forces and their money into austere conditions, we have actually created 750 &quot;crime magnets&quot; all over the world.  And if you think our secret bases overseas are secret from anyone other than the US public, think again--one has only to ask the prostitutes.  There is another important aspect of GI (Government Issue) life overseas: too many of our naive GI's get sucked into crime, first from small loans, then being asked to smuggle small things, then big things, to pay off the loan, and then being tracked down, after returning home, to be brought into international crime within the USA.  I realized from this that DoD needs a crime counterintelligence and amnesty program, and we need to out-brief every GI on how to handle criminal blackmail when they encounter it, both overseas, at home, and post-service.<br />The book ends with a fascinating and thoughtfully-selected series of vignettes on the spread of Yakuza crime to 21 countries.  The study of their passports is especially interesting, and makes us wonder why the US Treasury is still spending most of its time, two years after 9-11, trying to harass those trading with Cuba, instead of going after terrorist and criminal money.<br />Toward the end of the book there is a useful professional discussion of how inept governments are at identifying correct names and name variants when trying to spot and monitor criminals.  This is a real problem.  Within the US Intelligence Community, there is no standard for international names, each agency doing its own thing, with the result that even if we were to connect all the databases, the decades of unstandardized data entry across the archipelago makes many of our records too hard to use--almost as if we have to start from scratch.<br />One final point that really jumped out at me: the authors do a great job of identifying the real experts on Yakuza, across many countries, and what struck me was that they exist but no one has figured out how to create a virtual community of interest with the Internet such that all of them are security in touch with one another, sharing name databases, libraries, photograph archives, etcetera.

A classic relevant to any country, any business, any government, at any level.inept governments are at identifying correct names and name variants when trying to spot and monitor criminals.  This is a real problem.  Within the US Intelligence Community, there is no standard for international names, each agency doing its own thing, with the result that even if we were to connect all the databases, the decades of unstandardized data entry across the archipelago makes many of our records too hard to use--almost as if we have to start from scratch.<br />One final point that really jumped out at me: the authors do a great job of identifying the real experts on Yakuza, across many countries, and what struck me was that they exist but no one has figured out how to create a virtual community of interest with the Internet such that all of them are security in touch with one another, sharing name databases, libraries, photograph archives, etcetera.

Disclosure: I knew and served with Janine Brookner as a case officer overseas.  I liked her then and I like her now even through I have not heard from her since we ran into one another in the halls near SOG Maritime in the late 1980's.  She deserved to win her case against the white-boy wanna-be-preppy bubbas that are destroying the Directorate of Operations today, and now, with the modest sum she got after paying her lawyer, she has--after law school and substantive experience taking on US Intelligence Community lawyers--*nailed it* with a book that is both a lawyer's dream and every intelligence professional's awakening.<br /><br />I have myself had experience with security morons (these are the guys that got to their high ranks after twenty years of checking safes at night), and I have also had experience with the very high quality people that CIA has in the Office of the General Counsel and in some positions in security.  Interestingly, when I had my problem with morons, the Deputy Director of Security was a woman, she got it, and she fixed it.  On balance, from experience, I give CIA as a whole and the US Intelligence Community over-all, very very high marks for being good to its people and bending over backwards to avoid harassment.  If anything, as the Ames case showed, the Agency has been too tolerant of aberrant behavior (alcoholism, adultery, divorce, and suicide are too high in the DO, although this has improved in the past ten years).  I also have to give the Agency's publications review process an A+.  Tough love critic of the CIA/IC that I am, I have *never* felt abused by the righteous and correct process that I signed a lifetime deal on.<br /><br />There are, however, with the above as context, two major problems that this book addresses, and Janine Brookner has earned my \\"beyond five stars\\" for the service she renders with her methodical and documented endeavor.  This book is an instant classic and reference manual in two ways:<br /><br />1)  When \\"management\\" decides to railroad someone, they have unlimited power to do so, and most people cannot fight back.  I was myself rail-roaded by a man named Ted Price, a real mediocrity, a small man with a Napoleon complex, and it took me years to get the system to clean up the mess he made.  I was not smart enough to fight back legally.  This book empowers the many people who have been set to \\"Fitness for Duty\\" physicals (emphasis on showing them to be nuts, or scaring them into resigning for fear of being officially classified as nuts and barred from further federal employment).  I know several such people, both analysts and operators, and in every single case it was management that was nuts or derelict in its duty, not the officers.  The officers were all out-spoken, deeply in love with their profession and proud of their work, and loath to see the system break down as it has (and as we all knew it would from about 1985 onwards).  Had the \\"nuts\\" been listened to in the 1980's and 1990's, 9-11 would not have happened and George Tenet would not be making excuses for having faired to unscrew the Directorate of Operations in the past seven years.  Now he needs another five years, with the same fools in charge?  Please.<br /><br />2) The other area where this book is vital is in outlining in terms that any Senator or Representative (most of them lawyers) can understand--there needs to be a legal section in the National Security Act that is inevitably making its way toward passage.  I used to think that a FISA Court Ombudsman--someone we all trust, like Ken Bass, one of the twelve masters of the court, or Janine Brookner herself, was the solution.  What this book had demonstrated to me is that there are both too many problems (and more remedies than I realized), and someone has to codify a body of law that remediates the dysfunctionality of personnel protections within an archipelago of secret fiefdoms.<br /><br />This book is relevant to both the lawyers and the serving professionals in each of the seven tribes of intelligent work: national, military, law enforcement, business, academia, NGO-investigative journalism, and citizen-labor-religions, because all organizations in the last ten years have been moving toward what one early critic of the CIA called \\"the cult of secrecy.\\"  Credit card companies and other vendors are including binding arbitration on their terms as a condition of the sale, and those not reading the fine print are trapped into giving up all of their existing rights under due process law, including rights to a jury trial.  Secrecy goes hand in hand with corruption and bad practices that desires concealment, so this book is relevant as a guide to what happens when secrecy and corruption are taken to their nth degree.ibes of intelligent work: national, military, law enforcement, business, academia, NGO-investigative journalism, and citizen-labor-religions, because all organizations in the last ten years have been moving toward what one early critic of the CIA called \\"the cult of secrecy.\\"  Credit card companies and other vendors are including binding arbitration on their terms as a condition of the sale, and those not reading the fine print are trapped into giving up all of their existing rights under due process law, including rights to a jury trial.

Any sales effort that attempts to stress features and capabilities, as 99% of all of us have been doing, is destined to be lethargic and hit or miss.<br />The author and his team have a formula and it is a formula that is already working for me: listen instead of talk, solve instead of sell, and a few others that are only offered in the course not the book.<br />The author is devastating in critiquing what he calls &quot;puffery&quot;, all those now meaningless phrases about &quot;best in class&quot; and so on.<br />Finally, the author is extremely effective in helping truly good executive sales people do a cost analysis that at its most brutal, makes it clear to the client that what they are buying or not buying now is costing them a great deal more than what you are offering as a solution to *their* problem, which in turn justifies your getting top dollar because the return on investment in your more expensive capability, with no hidden costs, is greater than the return on the cheaper or partial solutions.<br />I strongly recommend the book for a taste of how to do soft selling in a client-friendly manner, and I strongly recommend the three-day course which is where they walk you through the entire process of creating mission statements, benefits to the client, listening probes, and closing statements that pull it all together.<br />It will take more than one course to overcome 20 years of coming at it the wrong way, but if you are seriously interested in dramatically changing your tone, your approach, and your relationship with your best clients, start with this book and then go on to one of the courses.<br />This was, incidentally, as an executive, my first formal training since 1986--20 years ago, and as I finished it up, I could only wish someone had shown me this path ten years ago or before.nterested in dramatically changing your tone, your approach, and your relationship with your best clients, start with this book and then go on to one of the courses.<br />This was, incidentally, as an executive, my first formal training since 1986--20 years ago, and as I finished it up, I could only wish someone had shown me this path ten years ago or before.	2004-04-29

I try to read and review everything he writes.<br />I take one star off because he is not putting his money where his books says it needs to be.  I begin with this comment, actually my last observation, to set the stage for the other comments below, all of which revolve around the point he makes in the beginning, but a point that he is doing nothing to fund the correction of: &quot;The gap in perceptions between America and the rest of the world has never been wider.&quot;  This is correct, but the $15M plus that he has donated to ACT and other minor organizations is not funding the re-education of America, it is funding minor-league politicization and mobilization likely to fail given the 20 year neglect of the Democratic precincts, and the fact that neither the Republican nor the Democratic parties are capable of assembling a true informed majority.<br />His early analysis in the book, on the dangers of supremacist ideologies and the curious alliance between religious fundamentalists (zealots who know nothing of the real world) and market fundamentalists (immoral capitalists who care nothing of the real world) is spot on.  He is articulate and effective in writing about the manner in which this extremist ideology, &quot;we are always right, they are always wrong&quot;, in endangering not just American ideals, but American survival.<br />He touches on but fails to capitalize on the urgency of splitting the moderate Republicans (I am one of them) from the extremist base, perhaps by funding the foundation of a new party, the Fiscal Conservatives (moderate Republicans and Southern conservative Democrats).<br />His chapter on the &quot;war&quot; on terror and his condemnation of treating terrorism as a war, with the wrong tools, wrong approach, and wrong effects from our well-intentioned but uninformed behavior is also powerful in its common sense.  He notes that this &quot;war&quot; (I have called it a six-front hundred-year war that *we* started in reaction to 9-11, without thinking strategically) has killed more civilian bystanders than the attack on the World Trade Center, and simultaneously super-charged anti-American sentiment around the world--including among the British!<br />He is subtly but scathingly critical of Congress for abdicating its responsibility to balance the power of the Executive, and documents the careless manner in which the Patriot Act was brought about (Bush can also confiscate pleasure boats with Cuban charts on thsm).<br />The middle of the book examines, with a capitalist's critical eye, the wasted hundreds of billions on Iraq, and how that money might have been better used to address the complex emergencies in Africa, Central Asia, and South Asia (one might also add the tri-border region in Latin America, which is about to explode).<br />Soros is, I believe, in error, when he concludes that the forthcoming election provides an opportunity to deflate the bubble of American supremacy.  First off, the Republicans are taking the election seriously, the Democrats are not.  Second off, the Kerry team has proven completely incapable of devising a shadow government, a coalition cabinet, and a balanced budget within which to make policy deals with moderate Republicans and others such as Independents and Greens.<br />In the next section Soros illuminates with a mix of previously state ideas, i.e. the political institutions needed to protect the common good have not kept up with the marketplace (Kissinger agrees), and new thoughts, among which I found the emphasis on restoring the definition of sovereignty to mean sovereignty of the people, not the state, to be the most compelling and also themost consistent with the many other books I have reviewed for Amazon, among which Jonathan Schell's book, &quot;Unconquerable World&quot; stands out.<br />Soros' other remarkable idea, which I think he should seek with $10M if he can spare the change, is that there is an urgent need for a D6 of developing countries to counter the G8 of First World industrial powers.  He identifies Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria, and South Africa.  I would add China and Argentina and make it D8 instead.<br />Finally, he concludes with a strong indictment of how foreign aid is administered today, less than 45% of it actual reaching needy recipients (versus 85% for his own programs), he touches on the importance of ensuring that the people, not the corrupt elite, get the benefits of any nation's natural resources, and that only an open society, in which citizens can and *must* (are *required to*) think for themselves, is a potentially prosperous and secure society.<br />So, concluding this review, I have to say, Bravo, Soros, but why isn't your money where your book suggests it should be?  Let's Talk, America, for example, or the National Budget Simulation Project, or the Co-Intelligence Institute, or any of hundreds of bottom-up efforts to shed light on public policy, to create public intelligence that can both inform citizens and hold officials accountable for betraying the public trust--why are they not being noticed by Soros?<br />American has been radicalized by the Bush Administration, which will probably win in 2004 and further radicalize both America and the world.  There will be multiple variations of 9-11, including at least one hijacked Pakistani submarine firing a missile into Australia.  We don't need mobilization, we need education.  We need a National Intelligence Council in the &quot;seven tribes, seven standards, seven issues&quot; sense, one that relies on open sources of information to ensure that every American understands what is at stake here, and how their ignorance not only feeds terrorism, it feeds the supremacist ideology of neo-conservativism that is terrorism's best friend.<br />Soros has come full circle, and now stands with Thomas Jefferson, who said &quot;A Nation's best defense is an informed citizenry.&quot;  So, when does school start?d also the most consistent with the many other books I have reviewed for Amazon, among which Jonathan Schell's book, &quot;Unconquerable World&quot; stands out.<br />Soros' other remarkable idea, which I think he should seek with $10M if he can spare the change, is that there is an urgent need for a D6 of developing countries to counter the G8 of First World industrial powers.

I was so impressed with this book that it received one of the ten Golden Candle Awards for most constructive and innovative work in the Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) field.  It represents the second book in a body of work that may eventually be worthy of a Nobel Peace Prize.  The citation reads:<br />To Dr. Douglas M. Johnston, president and founder of the International Center for Religion and Diplomacy, for his path-finding efforts with regard to Preventive Diplomacy as well as Religion and Conflict Resolution.  Among his many works, two stand out for defining a critical missing element in modern diplomacy: Religion, the Missing Dimension of Statecraft (Oxford University Press, 1994), and Faith-based Diplomacy:  Trumping Realpolitik (Oxford University Press, 2003).  He has restored the proper meaning of faith qua earnestness instead of faith qua zealotry, and this is a contribution of great importance.<br />With a foreword by no less than The Honorable Lee H. Hamilton, today a leader of the 9-11 Commission, the book drives a stake in the heart of secular &quot;objective&quot; negotiation and focuses on how faith (not zealotry, but earnest faith) can alter the spiral of violence in such places as Sudan, Kashmir, and the Middle East.<br />The editor and contributing author has assembled a multi-national and multi-religion cast of experts whose work in the aggregate completely supports the premise of the book: that the 21st Century will be about religion instead of ideology, and that what hopes we might have for reconciling &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot; lie in the balanced integration of religious dialog and conflict prevention, rather than in pre-emptive military action and unilateralist bullying.<br />I found two core concepts especially relevant to national security: the first is that we need an Office of Religious and Cultural Intelligence within the Central Intelligence Agency, and we need, as the authors suggest, to put religious attaches into every Embassy.  The second, and this is a truly core concept, is &quot;The price of freedom is cultural engagement--taking the time to learn how others view the world, to understand what is important to them, and to determine what can realistically be done to help them realize their legitimate aspirations.&quot;<br />This is a brilliant, scholarly, practical, world-changing book.  It joins Max Manwaring's various books, but especially &quot;The Search for Security,&quot; Joe Nye's earlier books on understanding the world and engaging the world with soft power, and George Soros as well as the several other books on my standard national security reading list.  The conclusion of the book lists a number of means by which religion can impact on diplomacy and state-craft, and I for one have become a believer--this book completely altered my perspective on the role of religion as a peacemaker of substance and day-to-day practicality., to put religious attaches into every Embassy.

This is a dumbed down inexplicit version of his more carefully documented ideas from the earlier books, and especially the second one.<br />I do want to emphasize that this book is worth reading if you only have time for one book (or you could read all my reviews instead--they are free), because I am going to be severely critical of the book in a professional sense.<br />First, this book does not focus at all on the most important soft power of all, that of a strategic culture.  Others have documented how North Vietnam whipped the United States, not with firepower, but with political will deeply rooted in a strategic culture that was superior to that of the United States of America.<br />Second, despite the author's earlier service as Chairman of the National Intelligence Council, the book gives cursory attention to intelligence reform, and does not mention, at all, open source intelligence (disclosure: my pet rock).  It is especially weak in failing to point out that the Department of State's one chance to be effective within US politics and the US policy arena lies with its potential dominance of legally and ethically available information in 29+ languages.  The Department of State has chosen to be ineffective and ignorant in this area of collecting, translating, and interpreting to the American public all that we need to know about the real world, and if and when Colin Powell goes to the World Bank, which has transformed itself into a knowledge organization (see Stephen Denning, World Bank KM manager before he became world-famous story-teller, &quot;The Springboard: How Storytelling Ignites Action in Knowledge-Era Organizations&quot;, he is going to rue the day he failed to kick off a $125M budget for OSINT under State control.<br />Third, the book lacks substance in the sense of effective examples.  A simple illustration: $100M can buy a Navy ship of war or an Army brigade with tanks and artillery (two forms of hard power) or it can buy 1,000 diplomats or 10,000 Peace Corps volunteers or a water desalination plant capable of distilling 100M cubic meters of fresh water a year (three forms of soft power), or it can buy one day of war over water (the typical failure cost of hard power).<br />The book has exactly one paragraph on corporate misbehavior, which as William Greider has documented in &quot;The Soul of Capitalism: Opening Paths to a Moral Economy&quot;, is the most evil and destructive form of &quot;soft power.&quot;  This is a severe oversight.<br />The book neglects foreign aid in a strategic context, and shows no appreciation for open spectrum, open source software, and open source intelligence, the triad of the new global open society.  There is no hint of how a Digital Marshall Plan might be the most powerful &quot;soft power&quot; device every conceived.<br />The book neglects non-governmental organizations, with no mention of the organizations that are  giving soft power a whole new dimension today (the European Centre for Conflict Prevention or ECCP, for example) and the book makes no mention of the &quot;good&quot; side of religious activism, the soft power so ably articulated by Dr. Doug Johnson in his two seminal works on faith-based diplomacy and religion as the missing dimension in statecraft.<br />Finally, while the book makes useful reference to some Pew polls on global attitudes, they struck me more as space fillers than core reference material--four pages where one would do--and do not reflect the more valued-based and multi-dimensional near-real-time direct citizen surveying such as characterizes the next generation of surveying instruments (e.g. Zarca Interactive, whose DC area chief describes it as a tool for real time democracy).<br />This leads to my last comment: this book,perhaps deliberately so, but I suspect not, is out of touch with mainstream scholarship such as the last 50 books I have reviewed for Amazon.  It is one massive &quot;Op-Ed&quot;, and its sources are virtually all &quot;Op-Eds&quot; (a number of them not written by the purported authors), with the result that this book gets an A for a good idea and a C-, at best, for scholarship.  One simple example: the sum total of the author's references on &quot;virtual communities&quot;, one of the most important ideas of this century, is one Op-Ed from the Baltimore Sun.  There is no mention of the book by the same title written by Howard Rheingold, arguably the most talented chronicler in America if not the world of how this non-state communitas is changing the world.<br />Joe Nye has my vote as the new voice of reason within the Democratic circles, but he needs to be balanced by the Jonathan Schell, William Greider, Herman Daly, Paul Ray, and other European and Asian scholars.  The world has gotten too complicated to be addressed by Op-Eds out of Harvard.  It is time we got serious about harnessing the distributed intelligence of the Whole Earth, and we can start right here at Amazon, where most of the books not cited by this book have been reviewed by many people whose views, in the aggregate, are vastly more informed than the views of either the White House or its intelligence purveyors.this book, perhaps deliberately so, but I suspect not, is out of touch with mainstream scholarship such as the last 50 books I have reviewed for Amazon.

Zbigniew Brzezinski is considered by the Chinese to be one of America's top strategists (along with Steve Metz from the Army War College), and that is entirely his due.  He is brilliant when it comes to state-centric strategy, but falls short with respect to emerging threats, sub-state threats, intelligence reform, and the roles of non-governmental organizations including religions, and civil networks instead of government-driven &quot;command and control.&quot;<br />While it used to be fashionable, when confronted with a choice between, say, market economies and controlled economies, to cleverly say &quot;some of each&quot; and earn the top grade, today things have changed and the answer is more often than not, &quot;none of the above.&quot;  This estimable author, whose wisdom must certainly be taken into account at all times, does not actually present a choice, only an opinion as to how a state-centric system--largely irrelevant in the 21st Century--might best be managed.<br />Especially troubling to me was the almost complete lack of attention to substantive books published in the last ten years, including those, most recently, of George Soros (abusive capitalism), William Greider (immoral capitalism), Herman Daly (ecological economics), Jonathan Schell (unconquerable world), Howard Rheingold (Smart Mobs), Thomas Stewart (the wealth of knowledge as an alternative to violence), and so on.  The author is not alone in this oversight--Joseph Nye, whose book on Soft Power I am also reviewing today, bases his work on Op-Eds, many of them not written by the people signing them, and has almost no substantive references either.  The think tank culture has lost touch with true scholarship.<br />The author's claim that Washington, D.C. is the center of the earth (pages 131-132) reflect in my view the last gasp of the Reagan-Smart Bush-Clinton era.  While the author alludes to New York as the &quot;other center&quot;, I and my colleagues think instead of a loose network on &quot;nodes&quot;, some financial (Tokyo, London, Kuala Lumpur), some religious (Jerusalem, Rome, Salt Lake City, points in India), and so on.  The author's emphasis on the Trilateral Commission and the now-dying World Economic Forum (Davos) as the bastions of a global elite that is in agreement struck me as being astonishing insular and inaccurate.  The author says that &quot;This elite is fostering the emergence of a global community of shared interest in stability, prosperity, and perhaps eventually democracy.&quot;  I do not think so.  All the other books I have reviewed for Amazon suggest that this elite is doing all it can to plunder the world by enriching micro-elites through corruption, while disenfranchising the broader publics (e.g. Canadian companies displacing villages in Peru to loot the gold, French companies buying up the water in Brazil to increase charges to the public for the water they used to own, etc.).<br />The author is to be commended for at least recognizing that America is losing its moral standing in the world, and this is an intangible value that cannot be easily purchased nor replaced.<br />In passing, footnote 4 on page 38 is inadvertently incorrect.  There are 175 violent internal political conflicts, not 38.

The author's emphasis on the Trilateral Commission and the now-dying World Economic Forum (Davos) as the bastions of a global elite that is in agreement struck me as being astonishing insular and inaccurate.  The author says that &quot;This elite is fostering the emergence of a global community of shared interest in stability, prosperity, and perhaps eventually democracy.&quot;  I do not think so.  All the other books I have reviewed for Amazon suggest that this elite is doing all it can to plunder the world by enriching micro-elites through corruption, while disenfranchising the broader publics (e.g. Canadian companies displacing villages in Peru to loot the gold, French companies buying up the water in Brazil to increase charges to the public for the water they used to own, etc.).<br />The author is to be commended for at least recognizing that America is losing its moral standing in the world, and this is an intangible value that cannot be easily purchased nor replaced.<br />In passing, footnote 4 on page 38 is inadvertently incorrect.  There are 175 violent internal political conflicts, not 38.  There are also 32 countries engaged in complex emergencies, 66 with millions of displaced refugees, 59 with plagues and epidemics, 33 with massive starvation, and 18 genocides now on-going.<br />The book ends somewhat quietly, suggesting a transatlantic convention and what one other reviewer very appropriately called &quot;baby steps.&quot;  My bottom line: Brzezinski is a solid citizen with a big mind and an old framework.

(Mis)leads America	Books	4	38	55	N	Y	Good Detail, Bad Writing, Worse Design	I have read virtually all of the books on extreme rightist and Bush deception (from the serious &quot;Weapons of Mass Deception&quot; and &quot;Secrets and Lies&quot; to the satirical and polemical by Hightower, Moore, Franken, Conason, and Carville), and I was hoping that this book would finally be &quot;the&quot; book, a systematic issue by issue outline of what Bush Administration officials have said, when--and then the truth of the matter, well documents.<br />I find this book disappointing.  It is written as if the authors have packed together a whole bunch of Op-Eds, it is hard to read, and it is not coherent.  The publisher and editor should be spanked for allowing such an undisciplined work out the door.<br />Although the book excels at detail and focus from issue to issue, the authors fail to do the side-by-side presentation in a manner that satisfies.  This book could have been glorious if they had taken the US budget, done down the 30 agencies with discretionary funds, the relevant program lines, and then had three columns: what Bush (and his aides, most of whom do the talking and thinking) said, what they did, and what science and intelligence and real-world experts recommend be done.<br />The index stinks (names, not issues), and there is no bibliography.  The footnotes are acceptable, but even more interesting would have been profiles with related bibliographies of how the right-wing think tanks and key personalities like Bill Kristol have shaped the debate, from the early days when Dick Cheney was saying Kristol was a moron (he is not) who could be ignored, to the later days when Cheney discovered that there are a lot of wealthy patrons who put their money where Kristol's mouth is....<br />In brief, then, the authors appear to have tried, and failed, to deliver the definitive book cataloging, on an issue by issue basis in a manner easily used by a Challenger for the Presidency, the many specific ways in which this Administration is lying, switching and baiting, saying one thing and doing the other, or allowing destruction through malicious neglect.<br />If I were guiding an opposition research team today, I would tell them to take this book, and all the others I have cited above, cut the spines off, digitize everything, index everything, create a visualization link-chart using any one of several automated programs, and from that, create 100 one-page memos that consist of a nuclear sound-bit, a one-paragraph executive summary of Bush versus reality versus the opposing proposition, and a half page of detail and references.  Neither the Democratic Leadership Council nor the leading challengers for the Democratic nomination appear to be doing their homework.  Kerry's math does not add up, Edward's issues are simplistic, and both Sharpton and Kucinich are absolutely right: the Democrats are not talking substance yet.<br />This book is as close as I have seen to an issue-by-issue review, but if this is the best we can do, the Democrats will lose in 2004, not least because issue discussion is the non-negotiable first step toward outreach and creating a coalition of moderate Republicans, Independents, and Green-Reform-Libertarian allies without whom no one can beat Bush.witching and baiting, saying one thing and doing the other, or allowing destruction through malicious neglect.<br />If I were guiding an opposition research team today, I would tell them to take this book, and all the others I have cited above, cut the spines off, digitize everything, index everything, create a visualization link-chart using any one of several automated programs, and from that, create 100 one-page memos that consist of a nuclear sound-bit, a one-paragraph executive summary of Bush versus reality versus the opposing proposition, and a half page of detail and references.

My 14-year old found it absorbing, and I myself was glad to have such an elegant piece of work, with the scripture text, available for review in a time and place of my choosing, in quiet.<br />The movie is very disturbing and for many will be shocking in the extreme.  The book is a &quot;soft&quot; alternative to the movie, more likely to provoke thought without disturbing, but by no means a substitute for full immersion in the overwhelming power of the movie.  The book is also a fanstastic keepsake.  I look forward to the release of the video, which I will surely buy, for this movie is likely to replace all other movies that in the past have been the staple of the Easter broadcast schedule.<br />One note of concern: I am sick and tired of having &quot;anti-semitic&quot; accusations hurled by defenders of Jewish sanctity.  &quot;Anti-semitic&quot; has become a censorship phrase.  I myself was disinvited from National Public Radio (NPR) in Chicago because I spoke in a balanced and fair fashion about the Palestinian casualities that the US media never covers, and the need to both guarantee a Palestinian state alongside a Jewish state, and the need to provide US foreign aid to both sides equally while we build two new generations from kindergarten up, generations that know how to live in peace from birth.  Neither the movie nor the book merit this Stalinist-like censorship, and I hope that non-Catholics will keep in open mind and not be scared away--as the Jews intend--from seeing the movie or buying the book.  [I was most moved when Arab callers made the point that I was the first person on NPR Chicago to have been fair and balanced.]<br />To end on a fair and balanced note: the Catholic Church is guilty of great crimes--the crusades against Islam, the murder of millions of women unfairly cursed as witches, the Inquisition, the abuse of hundreds of thousands of children, and finally, aid to the Nazis during the Holocaust and in the aftermath of the war as some escaped through Church auspices.  We would be fortunate indeed if there were movies and books that explored these historical aspects of Catholism, as well as the growing body of literature on Jesus having been married and having had children whose offspring survive today.  Open mindedness, not censorship, is the path to understanding.  This applies to Catholics as well as Jews and others of any faith.sed as witches, the Inquisition, the abuse of hundreds of thousands of children, and finally, aid to the Nazis during the Holocaust and in the aftermath of the war as some escaped through Church auspices.

Where this book excels is in the details that in turn lead to policy solutions.  I will go so far as to say that if John Kerry and John Edwards do not get hold of an executive summary of this book, and integrate its findings into their campaign as a means of mobilizing the working poor in the forthcoming election, then they will have failed to both excite and serve what the author, David Shipler, calls the \\"invisible.\\"<br /><br />Invisible indeed.  How America treats its working poor--people working *very* hard and being kept in conditions that border on genocidal labor camps, is our greatest shame.<br /><br />The most important point made in this book, a point made over and over in relation to a wide variety of \\"case studies\\", is that one cannot break out of poverty unless the **entire** system works flawlessly.  To hard work one must add public transportation, safe public housing, adequate schooling and child care, effective parenting, effective job training, fundamental budgeting and arithmetic skills, and honest banks, credit card companies and tax preparation brokers, as well as sympathetic or at least observant employers.  The author is coherent and compelling in making the point that a break or flaw in any one of these key links in the chain can break a family.<br /><br />I am personally appalled at the manner in which H&R Block, to name the largest within an industry, and Western Union, to name another, are ripping off the working poor with a wide variety of \\"surcharges\\" such that they end up paying 25% of their tax return or their funds transfer back to Mexico.  This is both usury and treason if you want to look at it in the largest sense.  They are sabotaging the American economy in a time of war.<br /><br />It surprised me to learn that while hospitals are forced to treat the poor in an emergency, they are also allowed to bill them, and these bills, for an ambulance ride or emergency treatment, often are the straw that breaks a family into destitution.  This is outrageous and should not be permitted.  Then the author tells us that it costs as much as $900 for a working poor family to declare bankruptcy and obtain the protection of the law from creditors, many of whom are cheats in the larger sense of the world.  How can this be?!?!<br /><br />It did not surprise me, but continues to distress me, to learn that the laws are not enforced.  Although laws exist about minimum wage, humane working conditions (and humane living conditions for migrant workers), they are not enforced.  The working poor are treated as less than slaves, for they are \\"used up and thrown out\\" with no defense against unfair firing.  They are forced to work \\"off the books\\", to do piece rate work at below minimum wage, this list goes on.  In essence, our politicians have passed laws that make us feel good, and then failed to enforce them so as to achieve the desired effects.<br /><br />The author documents both the jobs leaving the US, and the fact that new jobs pay less.  As Paul O'Neil, former Secretary of the Treasury has noted, we have two economies in America: one embraces automation (and kills jobs), the other requires expert labor (not the working poor).  We have a double-whammy here that is totally against the lower half of the economic spectrum, and it is being aggravated by an incoherent immigration policy that feeds the beast.<br /><br />On page 139  the author just blew me away with documentation to the effect that 37 percent of American adults cannot figure a 10% discount on a price, even with a calculator, nor can this same percentage read a bus schedule or write a letter about a credit card error.  He goes on, citing the NationalAdult Literacy Survey from the Department of Education, to note that 14% of adult Americans cannot total a deposit slip, locate an intersection on a map, understand an appliance warranty, or determine the correct dosage of a medicine.  I had no idea!!!  This reality comprises a \\"sucking chest wound\\" in the economic body of America, and it is not a chest wound that can be healed as things now stand.<br /><br />There are many other daunting \\"facts of life\\" in this book about the working poor, and they all add up to a complete failure of both the national and state leaderships to be serious about long-term sustainable economic prosperity.<br /><br />The author concludes with some suggestions for reform, and here I wish he had actually gone to the trouble of creating a one-page policy paper summing it all up.  His most obvious suggestion is wage reform, not just at the bottom, but also at the top.  As I read and hear about executives making $5 million to $80 million a year, the norm seeming to be around $20 million, I have to ask myself, have we gone nuts?  Are stockholders so stupid as to overlook the fact that capping executive compensation at 100X the pay of the lowest employee ($20,000 low end, $2,000,000 high end) would do *huge* good at the bottom and in the lower middle ranks?  The extreme wealthy in America are playing a short-term game that must be brought to an abrupt halt  because it is killing the people, the seed corn of the future.<br /><br />The Earned Income Tax Credit *works* but most of the working poor are afraid to file income tax returns.<br /><br />The author ends, quite correctly, by pointing out that the ideological debate, removed from the facts, will not alleviate nor eliminate the suffering of the working poor.  Right on.  It's time for the facts, for a public debate about the facts, and for public policy (and enforcement) based on the facts.

It has a germ of a good idea and is worth the price of the book for that alone--the book can be absorbed in a day or rapidly scanned in an hour.<br />The core idea is that America swings from left to right and back again--from a pro-business risk-taking conservative right position to a pro-people risk-reducing social concern left position.<br />The author, who is evidently a very well-respected businessman and trader who is skilled at seeing business cycles, applies his skill to politics.  Of the 43 presidents America has had to date, he identifies nine that were &quot;paradigm movers&quot;: George Washington (Federalists), Jefferson (Jeffersonian Democracy), Madison (New Nationalism), Jackson (New Democrats) Lincoln-McKinley (Transition), Roosevelt (New Progressives), Harding (New Era) and Reagan (New Economy).<br />I view the book somewhat skeptically.  It is certainly worthwhile, and I do not regret buying it nor absorbing the &quot;nine political paradigms&quot; that the author puts forward, but on balance I find it somewhat simplistic and out of touch with today's realities.  Indeed, as an admirer of all that Dr. Paul Ray has written (he is co-author of The Cultural Creatives), I would sum up my modest criticism of this book by saying that America, if it is to survive, must be neither left nor right, but in front--as Dr. Ray labels them, &quot;the new progressives.&quot;  The two mainstream political parties have lost touch with reality and become much too subordinated to political campaign contributions and lobbyists, and hence, if there is a tenth paradigm that will emerge--and I credit this book with framing the question very well--then it will be one that emulates the Internet and creates a political system that restores ethics to both the left and the right, restores the individual to primacy in the democracy, and reintegrates government, business, and citizen associations including unions as equal respectful partners rather than constant antagonists.ates government, business, and citizen associations including unions as equal respectful partners rather than constant antagonists.	2004-02-15

However, at the recommendation of a retired Army Special Forces Colonel, I finally did buy it, and I am glad I did.<br />Unlike the articles, which focused on the questionable use of Special Forces to train forces within repressive regimes around the world, from Colombia to Indonesia to Central Asia, the book more properly focuses on the complete lack of a US inter-agency planning process, the complete lack of a US means of coordinating actions and spending by all US agencies, and consequently, the complete lack of a US national security and global engagement strategy that is so vital to protecting America from attack and protecting American interests in a coherent and sensible fashion.<br />While many critics read the book as if it were a glorification of the theater Commanders-in-Chief (CINC), and complain about the militarization of US foreign policy, a proper reading of this book clearly documents that the militarization occurs by default, as a consequence of the abject failure of the White House and the Department of State, neither of which, under either Clinton or Bush, are serious about global engagement.<br />The military *works* (when it's not being frittered away by elective wars and occupations).  What I see in this superb book is a solid foundation for thinking about three essential reforms to American national security: 1) the creation of a Presidential level inter-agency strategic planning and operational coordination process--no, the National Security Council is *not* capable of doing that; 2) the redirection of theater commands and staffs to become truly inter-agency, with men of the caliber of Bob Oakley and Mark Palmer serving as Peace CINCs with military four-star deputies; and 3) the doubling of the Special Operations Forces through the creation of a &quot;white hat&quot; &quot;armed peace corps&quot; that can deliver sewing machines, water purification, and the myriad of other things, including law enforcement under combat conditions.<br />The book also does for Marine Corps General Tony Zinni what Ron Suskind's book &quot;The Price of Loyalty&quot; does for Secretary of the Treasury Paul O'Neil--it gives us some deep insights into Tony Zinni as one of the most extraordinary men to ever serve the American people, and a man who is clearly well-qualified to be one of the top five to ten people in any future Administration.  Although I am a former Marine and know Zinni's reputation among Marines as both a warrior's warrior and a thinking general (there are very few of those, even in the Marine Corps), I had not realized the depth and breadth of his brilliance until I read this book.  In particular I was moved by his intuitive demand for tribal-level intelligence, his focus on nuances and context at all times, and his insistence that a major aspect of US national security policy must be on the delivery of water, electricity, and the kinds of basics that can rescue failed states, legitimize governments, and create future democracies.<br />I recommend that this book be read together with Kissinger's book on &quot;Does America Need a Foreign Policy&quot;, Boren's edited book on &quot;Preparing American Foreign Policy for the 21st Century&quot;, and Halperin's 1980's but still relevant book on &quot;Bureaucratic Politics &amp; Foreign Policy.&quot; Bob Oakley's edited work on &quot;Policing the New World Disorder&quot; and Mark Palmer's recent book on &quot;Breaking the Real Axis of Evil&quot; (44 dictators), and Joe Nye's two most recent books, will round out any intelligent person's feel for what needs to be done. This is a very high quality book, fully meriting five stars, because it explains both the harsh world we must engage, and the failure of our national policy process--regardless of who is President--in this regard.ent--in this regard.	2004-02-14

Books	4	29	36	N	Y	Most Scholarly Documentation of Bush-Blair Deceit	In some ways, this book is a great deal more distressing than the various pundit books slamming Bush (Moore, Hightower, Frankel, Krugman, Carville, etc.) because there is not a single caustic turn of phrase, not a single line of satire, not a single double entendre in the entire work.  This is a brutally straight-forward, earnestly researched, ably footnoted, totally credible review of all of the secrets and lies that led to the war in Iraq.<br />It did not quite bring me to tears, it did very nearly make me want to throw a chair through the garden window.<br />According to this book, and its incontrovertible documentation, we were lied to.  We were deceived.  Untold fighting men and women, not just from the US but also from other countries, have died and been wounded and according to this book the number of wounded is CLASSIFIED.  It is a secret, an official secret from the American public, how many of their sons and daughters have died to support this ideological conquest, this extremist religious crusade.  We must also acknowledge the thousands of dead Iraqis and the hundreds of thousands of displaced and impoverished Iraqis.<br />Another official secret from the American public are the results of the open survey by the Department of State of how the Iraqis feels about the US invasion and occupation--classified AFTER we discovered that Chalabi had lied to Cheney and there were no hearts and flowers, only hostility.<br />Yet another official secret from the American public is the estimate of the damage done by US forces to the Iraqi infrastructure, and how much it will cost the US taxpayer to pay for this mindless destruction in the heart of the Middle East.<br />Not discussed by the author, but very much on my mind, is the jungle drum word from the retired veterans with access to Bethesda and other military hospitals---on the basis of the 250,000 disabled veterans from Gulf 1, and the &quot;word&quot; filtering out from the wards, we are looking at upwards of 25,000, perhaps as many as 100,000 disabled veterans from this war--all from depleted uranium, a killer of our own making.  Worse, this disability is multi-generational and will lead to blind and maimed children among those veterans who are able to have children.<br />This book is a cold-hearted look--so cold-hearted it ignites a flame of righteous anger in any careful reader--at how America has destroyed its credibility and its ability to have a positive influence in the Middle East.<br />If I have one small criticism, it is that the author, a stellar authority with solid sources to call upon, did not do an appendix that laid out an entire timeline of what Bush and Blair said that was false, and then the counter-vailing truth.  Although the author makes a number of these points clear throughout the book, for example, the UN never passed a resolution calling for the removal of Saddam Hussein from power, an opportunity has been lost here.<br />Truth matters.  Paul O'Neil is correct to speculate that we will heal ourselves, and equally correct to point out that this will happen only if we speak and hear the truth about these grievous circumstances in which great evil was done &quot;in our name.&quot;  This book, more so than the others that I cited above, is perhaps the first serious building block  toward righting our ship of state.rds of 25,000, perhaps as many as 100,000 disabled veterans from this war--all from depleted uranium, a killer of our own making.

This book is a classic, and the moderate Republican counter-part to Morton Halperin's similarly revelatory \\"Bureaucratic Politics & Foreign Affairs.\\"<br /><br />Although much has been made of how O'Neil is disparaging of the incumbent president, that is a minor aspect.  The heart of this book is about the competition between two forms of governance: the one that is overseen by Dick Cheney, in which ideological assumptions create policy without regard to the facts and in favor of the wealthy few that contribute to the incumbent's political coffers; and the one that was characteristic of wiser Republican presidents, including Nixon, Ford, Reagan and papa Bush, in which a philosophy of governance seeks to find a balanced middle ground based on an interplay of facts and political preferences.<br /><br />Summing the book up in two sentences: Bush-Cheney are about ideological victory at any cost, making policy in favor of their corporate crony base, without regard to the facts or the merits of any policy.  O'Neil, and the winning candidate in 2008, are about a reasoned process for arriving at sound policy in the context of fiscal discipline.<br /><br />This is an exciting book, and one that every moderate Republican will want to read as they contemplate joining with conservative Southern Democrats like Sam Nunn to create a new Fiscal Conservative Party.  An early quote from O'Neil talking to Greenspan sums up the problem: \\"Our political system needs fixing.  It needs to be based on reality.  Not games.\\"<br /><br />The book rewards anyone who actually reads it word for word with a number of gems.<br /><br />1) The American economy is actually two economies.  One embraces automation and is very productive as a result; the other relies on expert labor and having difficulty making gains.<br /><br />2) Corporate tax contributions to national revenue have been halved from 1967 to 2000 [not addressed by O'Neil, but as the book \\"Perfectly Legal\\" documents, the tax code has become so corrupt that despite the enormous growth of the economy and the enormous profits being made by Halliburton et al, corporations are now escaping virtually all taxes, and this is a big part of why the US Government cannot cover its future obligations and growing debt.]<br /><br />3) Iraq was the Bush-Cheney regime's top priority from day one.  The very first National Security Council meeting was scripted to put Iraq in play, and the Director of Central Intelligence was a full collaborator in this endeavor, coming to the meeting with a variety of images (all subsequently called into question) that purported to make the case for Iraq being a threat requiring action.  As O'Neil recollects in the book: \\"Ten days in, and it was about Iraq.\\"<br /><br />4) The unilateralist character of the regime is also addressed.  As this review is being written, the Administration is posturing about going after nuclear proliferators, which makes the O'Neil critique of the Rumsfeld approach to proliferation control all the more meaningful: \\"A traditional counterpoint, that international organizations and a web of economic and cultural interdependencies--aswell as protective alliances--could help to control such deadly proliferation, is not mentioned in the six-page memo.  The neoconservative view places little faith in such arrangements, or, for that matter, in diplomacy.\\"  There it is again.  The Bush Administration is about a big military stick motivated by ideology and not at all informed by any kind of inter-agency policy review process.<br /><br />5) The book provides a very clear understanding of the pathologies of the Bush White House.  The degree to which Rove literally shuts the Cabinet officers out and manipulates policy to appeal to \\"the base\\" of cash contributors is quite extraordinary.  The degree to which Cheney manipulates letters from the Hill and other matters warrants its own chapter, titled \\"No Fingerprints.\\"  The degree to which Lindsey, a loosely-educated ideological wonk in way over his head, leaks to the press to undermine the Secretary of the Treasury, is noteworthy.<br /><br />6) Rove's conspiratorial manipulation of Presidential policymaking led, in Bush's *first* State of the Union message, to the first known instance in which the president \\"said something that knowledgeable people in the U.S. government knew to be false\\", this with respect to a $1.2 trillion calculation that was knowably false and enormously important to the bond market.  This was nothing less than a precursor to future false statements by the president that can be attributed to an unprofessional policy process dominated by a few ideologues.<br /><br />7)  There is a very fine section on clean water and reliable electricity as the heart of saving the Third World, and we are treated to the contrast between a beltway bandit costing out a water network for one country at $2 billion, and O'Neil saying it could be done for $25 million.  This vignette captured everything that is wrong with both Washington and the military-industrial complex.<br /><br />This book is packed with gems, all of them useful to anyone seeking to document why Bush and Cheney are unfit to lead America.  They broke most if not all of their promises to \\"the center\\", and they are twice removed from reality: once on tax cuts and a second time on the doctrine of preemption in foreign affairs.<br /><br />See also, with reviews:<br />[[ASIN:0393059421 Losing America: Confronting a Reckless and Arrogant Presidency]]<br />[[ASIN:1400065763 Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency]]<br />[[ASIN:0743284437 American Fascists: The Christian Right and the War On America]]<br />[[ASIN:0143038281 American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury]]<br />[[ASIN:0312424620 Running on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It]]<br />[[ASIN:0316166286 Blood Money: Wasted Billions, Lost Lives, and Corporate Greed in Iraq]]<br />[[ASIN:B000B5XP2E Bush's Brain]]<br /><br />'Nuff said.

See the movie, then read the book.  The movie captures the idiocy of US Government funding war but not peace, and the sophmoric manner in which CIA bureaucrats play at war (but see JAWBREAKER and First In for \\"done right,\\" but it does not capture the war between the US diplomats and the spies, nor does it capture the extraordinary complexity of Pakistan, its own spy service, and the unconquerable Waziristan region (which could, however, be useful nuked).  Links at end of review.<br /><br />I was wrong to dismiss this book when it first came out, and I stress this because the hype about a hard-drinking womanizing \\"loose cannon\\" of a Congressman is precisely what the Washington bluebloods want us to think.  This is one of my \\"top five\\" for understanding Washington.  In alphabetical order, here are the key points.<br /><br />Admin:  Constant reference to case officers as \\"agents\\" is irritating.<br /><br />Agency for International Development:  featured as \\"the other Agency\\" whose feats on the humanitarian front are vital.<br /><br />Analysis:  CIA analysis was constantly flawed because of its reliance on technical collection or foreign liaison reporting.  Examples of actual human observation of Egyptian arms failures made the point that there is no substitute for the human case officer in the field.<br /><br />Bureaucracy: CIA bluebloods were timid--\\"bureaucratic cowardice\\" is a term seen several times--and so were the AID leaders, the Pentagon, the State Department, and even the White House.  CIA did not want more money for Afghanistan, was at war with the State Department, did what it could to slander and undermine Congressman Wilson, was slow in every respect (\\"what we did with Charlie in one month would have taken us nine years to accomplish [through normal channels].\\"<br /><br />Central America.  Although not the main thrust of the book, the comparisons between the secret success in Afghanistan and the public failure of the CIA in Central America are useful.<br /><br />Congress.  The book is a case study of how Congressional power really works, where less than 25 Members on the House side actually matter when it comes to defense appropriations.  Pages 79-80, on the various Congressional fraternities, are quite useful.<br /><br />Corruption.  The main character in the book other than Charlie Wilson, Gust Avrakotos, gets high marks for cutting the cost of arms and ammo in half by out-smarting the black market, and for devising clever ways to monitor for corruption, such as technical beacons in the arms shipments that can be monitored from satellites.<br /><br />Cost of War.  $165 for an AK-47, $1,050 per man per year for ammunition, cost of keeping 100,000 holy warriors firing for one year comes to $100 million.  That is without providing for all other costs such as anti-air weapons, anti-tank weapons, food, communications, medical, and logistics.  At least $1.5 billion in US funds was being spent at the height of the war, with Saudis matching this amount.<br /><br />Covert Action:  The US did not really get credit from the warriors being armed, because it was all done through Pakistan.  Assassination and other dirty tricks are indeed a part of CIA's repertoire, they just get the British and Egyptians and Pakistanis to do the work for them, thus circumventing US laws and internal regulations.<br /><br />Education.  The role that Congressman Wilson played in educating other Members cannot be under-estimated.  The bureaucracy cannot be trusted to properly educate Members, and that in the absence of a strong and sustained educational endeavor, Members will continue to be oblivious to reality overseas.<br /><br />Foreign Countries.  China, Egypt, India, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom are featured players, apart from Pakistan.  The impoverishment of the British secret service, begging the Americans for a few mine-detectors, is of note.<br /><br />Israel.  Israel is in a class by itself.  American Jews funded Charlie Wilson's survival and Israel empowered him in multiple ways.  It is a real irony of this book that Israel was the key factor in creating the armed Islamic jihad movement, with consequences no one anticipated.<br /><br />Lawyers.  Page 165 and throughout the book document the essential castration of the CIA by its own lawyers.  As Avrakotos is quoted in the book: \\"If I asked them they would have jerked off for three months trying to figure out why we couldn't do it.\\"<br /><br />Liberals.  Paul Tsongas and Charlie Wilson, both liberals, supported the Afghanistan effort long before any conservatives were willing to step up to the plate.<br /><br />Lobbying.  The book is a handbook on both domestic lobbying through Texas socialites associated with the extreme right, and foreign lobbying of Members by both foreign governments and very rich extreme rightists who use Parisian aristocracy and others to push through programs that go against all the bureaucratic instincts of CIA, the Pentagon, and the State Department.<br /><br />Operations.  The book documents some severe shortfalls in CIA's operational capabilities, including a great quote: \\"Out of twenty-five hundred [case officers]...maybe five percent are super, twenty percent good, and five percent shot.\\"  [Note: this leaves 70% in a dead zone.]  The incompetence of the CIA's covert procurement process is of special concern.<br /><br />People.  Book damns the Ivy League bluebloods, Stansfield Turner (who not only killed operations, but fired mostly the blue collar ethnics that were actually good on the street).  It honors the CIA \\"untouchables\\", the worker bees, mostly people of color with high school educations, that keep the place going.  It documents how Mike Vickers, a GS-11 that masterminded the victory, gave up on CIA and left for the Wharton school because there was no future for him at the agency.<br /><br />Trade-Offs.  The book explicitly documents how the White House gave Pakistan its blessing on continuing with an Islamic nuclear bomb, as the quid pro quo for supporting the jihad against the Soviets.<br /><br />Tribal Knowledge.  The book documents the CIA's abysmal lack of understanding, which continues today, of tribal personalities and power relationships, history, and context.<br /><br />Variables.  Training and communications made a huge difference, and together with anti-aircraft weapons, took the war against the Soviets from a \\"fool's errand\\" level (CIA providing Enfield rifles and limited ammunition) to a \\"real war\\" level.<br /><br />White House.  The book provides a reminder of how easily the White House neophytes fall for thieves and liars.  The discussion of the damage done by Manucher Ghorbanifar is so like that done by Chalabi's access to Cheney that the comparison is chilling.  CIA blacklisted both for very good reasons, and the White House still embraced them.<br /><br />This is gripping non-fiction, better than any spy novel.<br /><br />CIA Done Right:<br />[[ASIN:0891418725 First In: An Insider's Account of How the CIA Spearheaded the War on Terror in Afghanistan]]<br />[[ASIN:B000Y8D5JQ Jawbreaker: The Attack on Bin Laden and Al Qaeda: A Personal Account by the CIA's Key Field Commander]]<br /><br />CIA Normal:<br />[[ASIN:038551445X Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA]]<br />[[ASIN:0385663684 Web of Deceit: The History of Western complicity in Iraq, from Churchill to Kennedy to George W.

This is a world-class contribution to our understanding in three areas:  1) what can be known about terrorism and militant Islam from open sources of information (but is being largely ignored by the so-called professional intelligence agencies that are obsessing on secret sources and methods; 2) what governments in Southeast Asia are and are not doing about it (in many cases, abusing American naivet&eacute; or being put off by American arrogance; and 3) where militant Islam is going in this area--be afraid, be very afraid.<br />If all academics were this good, we would not need spies.  This book and this author represent the very best scholarship that one could ask for.  The author is the Program Director for East Asian Studies and associate professor of international politics at Simmons College.

As one who has previously recommended such books as Lionel Tiger's &quot;The Manufacture of Evil: Ethics, Evolution, and the Industrial System&quot;, Norman Cousins &quot;The Pathology of Power&quot;, and many other books on the pathologies of treating man as a &quot;good&quot;, of scientific objectivity as &quot;value neutral&quot; and therefore bad, of secrecy as counter-productive to &quot;precautionary principle&quot; decision-making, I immediately recognized this book as an integrative work, possibly supplanting all those other books by bringing the various arguments together in one place.<br />This is indeed a brilliant product by a towering intellect, and it has the bibliography and index that one would expect from a world-class endeavor.  I recommend it together with Philip Alott's &quot;The Health of Nations: Society and Law beyond the State&quot;, Stewart Brand's &quot;Clock of the Long Now&quot;, and John Lewis Gaddis &quot;The Landscape of History&quot;.<br />The author's bottom line: not only must we come to grips with how power is managed in every nation and organization, but also we must manage at the *global* level if we are to succeed in optimizing fulfillment at the *individual* level.	2004-01-25

I was mistaken in thinking that the book was so detailed as to be boring or difficult to grasp.<br />On the contrary, the author has done a superb job, in partnership with the publisher, in presenting a great deal of important information in a readable font size and form.<br />For me, the book is important in two ways.  First, it tells me there is a person out there who really understands all this stuff in detail, and can help me rethink our national policy when the time comes that we have a sane White House willing to be serious about this vital long-term matter.<br />Second, it lists up front the various areas that impact on population policy (drawing on the Commission on Population Growth and the American Future) and is worth the price of the book for this superb list (each with a paragraph about the sub-policy area):  Population Education; Sex Education; Child Care; Children Born Out of Wedlock; Adoption; Equal Rights for Women; Contraception and the Law; Contraception and Minors; Voluntary Sterilization; Abortion; Methods of Fertility Control; Fertility-Related Health Services; Personnel Training and Delivery of Services; Family Planning Services; Services for Teenagers; Population Stabilization; Illegal Aliens; Immigration; National Distribution and Migration Policies; Guiding Urban Expansion; Racial Minorities and the Poor; Depressed Rural Areas; Institutional Responses; Population Statistics and Research; Vital Statistical Data; Enumeration of Special Groups; International Migration; Current Population Survey; Statistical Reporting of Family Planning Services; National Survey of Family Growth; Distribution of Government Data; Mid-Decade Census; Statistical Use of Administrative Records; Intercensal Population Estimates; Social and Behavioral Research; Research Program in Population Distribution; Federal Government Population Research; Support for Professional Training; Organizational Changes; Office of Population Affairs in the Department of Health, National Institute of Population Sciences; Department of Community Development; Office of Population Growth and Distribution; Council of Social Advisors; Joint Committee on Population; State Population Agencies and Commissions; Private Efforts and Population Policy.<br />The author makes a very strong case for how, as his subtitle suggests, US population policy has been doomed by a lack of political will and the inappropriate influence of the Catholic Church and Mexico, in addition to strong private sector interests seeking low-wage workers while avoiding any associated social costs that are put on to the taxpayer.<br />I consider this book a primary reference that will be needed soon as America becomes more thoughtful and participatory democracy is restored.  Population policy is fundamental.

It loses one star to a lack of structure and sufficient references to a broader range of supporting literature, and to the author's tendency to go &quot;a bridge too far&quot; in blaming the CIA for everything and in assuming that our troops and their families are somehow enjoying their &quot;luxurious&quot; overseas deployments.<br />It may be best to begin the review where the author ends, by agreeing with the case he makes for the potential collapse of America if the people fail to take back the power and restore integrity and participatory democracy to the Congress.  Absent a radical reverse, four really bad things will happen to America: 1) it will be in a state of perpetual war, inspiring more terrorism than it can defeat in passing; 2) there will be a loss of democracy and constitutional rights; 3) truthfulness in public discourse will be replaced by propaganda and disinformation; and 4) we will be bankrupt.<br />It merits comment that today, as I read and reviewed the book, which documents over 725 US bases around the world, many of them secret, there is a public discussion in which the Pentagon is acknowledging only 400 or so bases to exist.<br />There is a considerable amount of short-hand history in the book that can be skimmed rapidly--from the roots of American militarism in the Spanish-American war, to the non-partisan efforts of both Clinton and Bush fils to establish a military base structure in Arabia and in Central Asia.<br />The author provides a number of worth-while commentaries on war crimes and associations with genocidal acts and repressive dictators on the part of Henry Kissinger, Wes Clark, James Baker, Dick Cheney, and other mostly Republican &quot;wise men&quot; associated with the oil companies of America.<br />On pages 100-101 he draws on a number of authoritative sources to note that the casualty rate for the first Gulf War was close to 31% (THIRTY-ONE PERCENT) due to the exposure of the 696,778 veterans serving there being exposed to depleted uranium rounds and other toxic conditions *of our own making*, with 262,586 of these consequently falling ill and being *officially* declared to be disabled by the Veteran's Administration.  I have no doubt that there will be an additional 100,000 or more disabled veteran's coming out of Gulf War II.  These disabilities are multi-generational.  Veterans disabled in the Gulf have higher possibilities of spawning children with deformities &quot;including missing eyes, blood infections, respiratory problems, and fused fingers.&quot;<br />The author excels, I believe, in bringing together in one book the combined costs and threats to the American Republic of a military that on the one hand is creating a global empire that is very costly to the US taxpayer and very threatening to everyone else; and on the other hand, is creating anti-democratic conditions within the United States, to include frequent and expensive preparations for dealing with &quot;civilian disorder conditions&quot; here at home.<br />The author also excels in discussing both the collapse of US diplomacy (today the Pentagon manages 93% of the international relations budget, the Department of State just 7%), and the rise of private military companies that he carefully lists on page 140--Halliburton, Kellogg Brown and Root, Vinnell, Military Professional Resources, DynCorp, Science Applications Corporation, BDM (now TRW), Armor Holdings, Cubic, DFI, International Charter.  There are more--they are all &quot;out of control&quot; in terms of not being subject to Congressional oversight, military justice and discipline, or taxpayer loyalty.<br />In the middle of the book the author examines the change in the roles of the military from its World War II and post-Cold War missions to five new missions that have not been cleared with the American people: 1) imperial policing; 2) global eavesdropping; 3) control of petroleum fields and channels; 4) enrichment of the military-industrial complex; and 5) comfortable maintenance of the legionnaires in subsidized compounds around the world, such that numbers could be justified that could never be maintained in garrison within the USA.<br />On page 164 the author notes most interestingly that China is among the greatest purchasers of fiber-optic cable in the world (thus negating much of NSA's 1970's capabilities), and on page 165 he discusses, with appropriate footnotes, how the US, UK, Canada, and Australia are circumventing the prohibitions against monitoring their own people by trading off--the Canadians monitoring British politicians for the British, the British monitoring US politicians, etcetera.<br />Among the strongest sections of the book is the detailed discussion of America's love affair with ruthless dictators (and Muslim dictators at that) in Central Asia, all in pursuit of cheap oil our privilege elite think they can control.  Of special interest to me is the author's delicate dissection of the vulnerability of any Central Asian energy strategy, and his enumeration of all the vulnerabilities that our elite are glossing over or ignoring.<br />Summing it all up, the author attributes US militarism and the Bush fils &quot;doctrine&quot; to &quot;oil, Israel, and domestic politics&quot;, and he bluntly condemns it all as &quot;irrational in terms of any cost-benefit analysis.&quot;  Quoting Stanley Hoffmann, an acclaimed international relations theorist, he condemns Bush's &quot;strategy&quot; (as do I) as &quot;breathtakingly unrealistic&quot;, as &quot;morally reckless&quot;, and as &quot;eerily reminiscent of the disastrously wishful thinking of the Vietnam War.&quot;<br />This is a fine book.  Read widely enough, it has the potential for constructively informing the popular debate that is emerging despite all efforts by the Administration and its corporate cronies to suppress discussion [e.g. MoveOn.org's $2M in cash for a Superbowl ad has been rejected by CBS on the grounds of being too controversial].  Despite a few rough edges, I believe the author represents a body of informed scholarly and practical opinion such as I have tried to honor with my many non-fiction reviews, and I hope that everyone who reads this review decides to buy the book.icing; 2) global eavesdropping; 3) control of petroleum fields and channels; 4) enrichment of the military-industrial complex; and 5) comfortable maintenance of the legionnaires in subsidized compounds around the world, such that numbers could be justified that could never be maintained in garrison within the USA.<br />On page 164 the author notes most interestingly that China is among the greatest purchasers of fiber-optic cable in the world (thus negating much of NSA's 1970's capabilities), and on page 165 he discusses, with appropriate footnotes, how the US, UK, Canada, and Australia are circumventing the prohibitions against monitoring their own people by trading off--the Canadians monitoring British politicians for the British, the British monitoring US politicians, etcetera.<br />Among the strongest sections of the book is the detailed discussion of America's love affair with ruthless dictators (and Muslim dictators at that) in Central Asia, all in pursuit of cheap oil our privilege elite think they can control.

818404:US	50761804	R2QCIVMROFTDRC	0865714185	867705160	Doing Democracy: The MAP Model for Organizing Social Movements	Books	5	66	69	N	Y	Extraordinary Strategic/Tactical Guide for People Power	This book is both a strategic orientation to, and a tactical primer on, how to develop and manage non-violent social movements at the grassroots or &quot;people power&quot; level.<br />The reason this book is important is because it solves the most important problem or gap facing all social movements:  the lack of strategic models and methods that help activists understand, plan, conduct, and evaluate their social movements.  I have read this book from cover to cover and it fulfills the objective.  Had Howard Dean and Joe Trippi read this book six months ago, they would not have blown the lead and come in a sorry fourth (less than half of what Kerry had, less than a quarter Kerry and Edwards combined), to guys that did *not* figure out MoveOn.org and the Internet as a collective consciousness tool.<br />This is among the most heavily marked up books I have read in the past four years, and instead of summarizing it in detail, which may cause some of you to avoid buying it, I will simply endorse the primary author's view that social movements are needed now more than ever, for the simple reason that the powerholders are making life on the planet unsustainable--everything they do (think Dick Cheney here) to increase profits, control, and power, is also &quot;increasing unemployment, the gap between rich and poor, violence, ecological collapse, and unsustainability&quot;.<br />There are four aspects of the book that are especially valuable as we all find ourselves in a &quot;world war&quot; between fundamentalist groups (both Islamic and extremist Americans of the religious right falling prey to neo-conservative doctrine) and progressive individuals seeking the common good:<br />1) the author's focus on sub-movements, on creating a strategic campaign that specifically embraces each sub-movement as a distinct but coordinated element, is the &quot;aha&quot; factor in leaping forward.<br />2) the author's specific discussion of negative rebels and how much harm they can do to the larger movement is compelling, to the point of actually suggesting that we need to create a counterintelligence service within social movements to address this.  The few violent protesters in Seattle got all the media coverage, and the non-violent mass lost a great deal of credit.<br />3) the eight-stages of social movements are extremely detailed and the case studies help to explain why the &quot;slump&quot; must be overcome in the fifth stage, when success has been achieved but there is a perception of failure.<br />4) the importance of having an economic strategy for where the social movement's vision needs to go, is not understood by most presidential candidates.  This book is valuable to anyone who would be president, or senator,  for it explains not only how to organize and lead a social movement, but how to govern resources to its desired ends after the fact of victory.  Real world budgeting is a neglected aspect of leadership during the electoral process.<br />I would say that this book (together with Tom Atlee's &quot;The Tao of Democracy: Using CO-INTELLIGENCE to create a world that works for all&quot;), is core reading for anyone interested in saving his or her neighborhood, his or her country, or the world at large.  The primary and secondary authors are also to be commended for making the point that it is possible to be effective *regardless of who is President or what party is in charge in the capitol*--they emphasize local grass-roots effectiveness that is non-partisan.<br />Juliette Beck and Nancy Gregory make contributions that should have been acknowledged on the cover.  Juliette Beck especially, with her focus on globalization and the sub-movements and stages of the aggregate movement, provides a most satisfactory case study that concludes the book.they can do to the larger movement is compelling, to the point of actually suggesting that we need to create a counterintelligence service within social movements to address this.

This book falls into the latter category.<br />As one who has both read much of what Le Carre has written, and also had the privilege of being a clandestine case officer (spy under official cover), I was initially taken with the concept of the book, despite its obvious intent to resurrect the genre in the aftermath of 9-11, but soon found myself bored beyond belief.  It is closer to &quot;The Naive and Sentimental Lover&quot; side of Le Carre, than to the more deservedly riveting Tinker, Tailor, Drummer Girl, or Smiley's People, Looking Glass War side of Le Carre.<br />There was a time, absent good non-fiction on the spy world, when Le Carre's work, his George Smiley work especially, not only delighted but informed.  Now, with so many truly top-notch non-fiction books about intelligence (for instance, those by Milt Bearden, Robert Baer) one is really much better off reading non-fiction  for fun.  See my short and long lists of intelligence books (as well as emerging threats and blowback/dissent in foroeign affairs) for a sense of what non-fiction can deliver these days in the way of compelling and disturbing real-world spy reading.	2004-01-20

The authors:<br />1)  Document the split between the hard-line neo-conservatives who have captured the mind of 43, and their growing (and increasingly public) disrespect for 41 and for General Brent Scowcroft and Secretary of State and former General Colin Powell.<br />2)  Are correct in their condemnation of the Clinton national security team for being weak and incompetent.  Any Democratic candidate foolish enough to appoint such individuals as their advisors is not smart enough to beat 43.<br />3)  Make it clear that the top priority for neo-conservatives in the war on terrorism is not overseas action, but the implementation of a national identification card system here at home.<br />4)  Are correct in their condemnation of US-based Muslim charities and clerics (and FBI agents of the Muslim faith) unwilling to speak out against Islamic radicalization and those who recommend jihad in America, abusing our freedom of speech.  They are also correct when they propose to end all tax exemptions and breaks for those that fail to condemn terrorism and fatwas against Americans.<br />5)  Are correct when they point out that the trillions of dollars we have spent on national intelligence have resulted in a vacuum on both Iraq and weapons of mass destruction, and a lack of knowledge about terrorist financing.<br />6)  They are correct when they emphasize the importance of funding the education and elevation of women into power within Islamic societies.<br />7)  Are correct when they point out that with the exception of Jordan, no Arab country has been willing to give Palestinians a break--no access to schools, ownership of land, or passports.  Lebanon, they say,  forbids Palestinians from 72 professions.<br />8)  Are correct when they point out that we are \\"fighting the war on terror with the same people and the same bureaucracies that so conspicuously failed us on 9/11.\\"  They are especially powerful when they criticize the CIA for failing to collect, read, translate, or understand the openly published writings of Khomeini during the Carter years--CIA is operating on perhaps 2% of the available global knowledge because it obsesses on spying and disrespects open sources of information in 29 languages--something Herb Meyer understood when he was Special Assistant to then DCI Bill Casey.<br />8)  Are correct when they characterize the US Army specifically, and the entire US military generally, as \\"forces of the past, built to counter threats that no longer exist.\\"<br />9)  Are correct to emphasize how the U.S. Government as a whole is completely fragmented and lacking in an inter-agency management and coordination structure that both Kissinger and Rubin have suggested is urgently required to keep pace with the threats and demands of the modern world.<br />10)  Are correct to slam the FBI for being incompetent at counter-intelligence, and to call for a new national homeland security agency reporting to the secretary for homeland security.  They do however overlook the equal importance of funding state and local intelligence centers and counterintelligence personnel.<br />11)  Are correct to emphasize that US free trade agreements with various nations should demand that the nations sign the same agreement with one another (e.g. in South Asia).<br />12)  Are correct to point out that the United Nations and its focus on \\"armed attack\\" is completely out-dated, and that America should increase and sustain its support to the UN only on condition that the UN modernize both its by-laws and its operating procedures.<br />13)  Are correct to propose that national security funding should rise to 5% of the national budget, up from 3%, but they fail to understand that modern warfare requires co-equal funding for non-military sources of power including massive preventive *peace* operations.<br />There is, then, a great deal of good in this book.  It is, however, also full of a great deal of crap.  It has no footnotes, no bibliography, no index, and a great deal of either badly researched material or plain disinformation.  They misrepresent or ignore a number of very important facts.  On page 24, for example, they discuss the debriefing of Hussein's son-in-law, defector Hussein Kamel, and fail to mention that he told us all the stocks had been destroyed, and only the cookbooks remained.  Throughout the book, while lambasting CIA for not knowing (half true), they decline to discuss the unethical and unprofessional manner in which the neo-cons not only shut out the professionals from the Iraq war deliberations, but cherry-picked and fabricated information to mislead the president as well as the American people.  On page 32 and again on page 35 they lie when they say that Iraq was \\"one of the leading sponsors of terrorism in the region.\\"  On various pages they gloss over the fact that Chalabi was both a thief and a liar, fired by CIA for stealing millions from covert funds, and ultimately found by CIA to be fabricating translations to deceive the US military intelligence people.  On pages 45-46 they repeat the long proven lie about Mohammed Atta meeting an Iraqi intelligence officer in Prague.  Not only has the FBI determined that Atta was in Florida at the time, but Vaclav Havel, former President of Czechoslovakia, recently honored by President Bush, has repeatedly stated this did not happen.  On page 155, they deliberately avoid mentioning that it was Rumsfeld who allowed 3000 Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders to escape by approving a Pakistani air evacuation operation that went on all night.  Rumsfeld's naivet&eacute; and ignorance cost us the chance to nail Bin Laden early on.  There are many other points where the facts differ from their representations.<br />The book does *not* offer a true strategy for the future of American security or even the near-term war on terrorism.  It is largely a baloney justification for the war on Iraq.  It fails to acknowledge that unilateralist American behavior is spawning more terrorists than we are catching.

On balance, the author comes out as the only Presidential candidate who actually has deep experience in modern war, in managing very large complex coalition operations, and in handling the nuances (Bush has said he does not do nuances) of complex European relationships such as characterized his tenure as commander-in-chief of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, during which time NATO dramatically expanded to embrace the Eastern European (Partnership for Peace) nations and the Mediterranean Dialog nations.<br />A few key points on the author's perspectives that satisfied me:<br />1)  He understands that reconstruction cannot be successful unless internal security, stability, and legitimacy are established first.<br />2)  He emphasizes the urgency of operating with other nations in strong alliances, not only to be successful in unilateral operations, but in avoiding competing crises elsewhere.<br />3)  He is very critical of the manner in which the Bush Administration represses participatory democratic discussion of the threat and the new strategy.  America was \\"shut out\\" from both the facts and the discussion in the path to war on Iraq.<br />4)  He is sensitive to the enormous damage that America's arrogance (as reflected in the actions being done \\"in our name\\") is doing to our interests abroad.  He notes, interestingly, that there is a huge difference between the messages carried by the US versus the international media (and implicitly, in our public's unawareness of that difference).<br />5)  He is accurate and insightful in expressing concern about two simultaneous failures of the Bush Administration: first, failing to prosecute the war on terror instead of the sideshow in Iraq, and second, failing to actually make America any safer here at home.<br />6)  He helps explain how the Bush Administration got off track by reminding us that missile defense, energy, and the Chinese incident with the US naval reconnaissance airplane all consumed the early months of the new Administration.<br />7)  He provides useful perspective on the *considerable* challenges of terrorism that faced Germany (Baader-Meinhof), Italy (Red Brigades), Spain (ETA), England (IRA), Greece (November 17th group), Turkey (PKK), and other nations including Israel.  He notes that these were defeated by constructive law enforcement campaigns, not unilateral military invasions.  I found this section of the book to be extraordinarily mature, worldly, and sensible.<br />8)  His account of the early planning process for the war against Iraq (never mind the policy process that misled America) slams Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld for being disruptive and unprofessional, resulting in \\"an irregularly timed patchwork process that interspersed early-deploying units with those needed later, delayed mobilization, hampered training, and slowed overall deployments considerably.\\"  One example: 4th Infantry Division spent 45 days at sea *after* they arrived.<br />9)  He provides incisive commentary on the failure of both Turkey and Saudi Arabia to provide much needed ports and airheads for the war.  [Although General Clark refrains from making this point, the best minds at the Army War College's Strategic Studies Institute have publicly noted that we won more as a result of Iraqi incompetence than US effectiveness.]<br />10)  There are many small signs throughout the book that General Clark is a strategist.  As one who feels that John Boyd is a hero whose work must be honored in our future deliberations, I was glad to see the author emphasize the value of leadership and training over technology.<br />11)  The author corrects existing doctrine and advances the thinking by pointing out that the air supremacists were correct but not in the way they expected.  Air versus C4I was not the decisive factor in the Iraq war, but rather air in support of ground forces, something the Air Force hates to do but the Marine Corps has always understood.<br />12)  On page 79 he discusses how a B-1 bomber was dispatched to attack a reported place where Saddam Hussein might be, unleashing two 2,000 lb. bombs.  This is so sadly a repeat of the Afghan story, where a B-2 bomber was called in against 18 men in a cave, that we want to highlight it.  We have a heavy metal military unsuited for manhunts or gang warfare.<br />13)  If there is one weakness in this book, it is that it glosses over the many information and intelligence deficiencies that characterized the planning process, the operational campaign, and the post-war peace and reconstruction endeavor.<br />The author does not fail to give the current Administration and its operational arms (including intelligence) credit for successes against terrorism in 2002 (incidents fell by half, key people killed and captured).  This is appropriate, and provides a good lead-in to his very detailed critique of how we are failing in the war on terrorism, the second half of his book.  This can be generally summed up, in his words, with \\"We needed new thinking, and we needed to retarget our intelligence and adjust our means...\\"  What I find most fascinating about the second half of the book is that the author is clearly charting a sensible course that is equi-distant from the incompetent neglect of the Clinton Administration, and the lunatic militarism of the Bush Administration.  He makes specific reference to the now-public plans of Rumsfeld and his aids to follow up the attack on Iraq with attacks on Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Iran, Somalia, and Sudan.  This is what we have to look forward to if there is a second Bush Administration.<br />The author provides enough in the way of specifics (buying in, for example, with an explicit reference) to Joe Nye's views on the importance of using soft power in the context of multinational strategies for peace) to be very reassuring that his national security strategy, once fully developed, would be summed up with one word: balanced.ing by pointing out that the air supremacists were correct but not in the way they expected.

The United States and the rest of the world are, for example, completely unprepared for no-notice asymmetric and tribal warfare in Africa, where the United Nations is trying to deal with five complex emergencies as this is written (Burundi, Congo, Ivory Coast, Liberia, and Sudan).<br /><br />If you can get a copy used, go for it.

Since then a number of extremely  thoughtful works have documented the links between failed states (where human security is non-existent) and direct threats to the homelands of the advanced Western states.  See my various lists, especially the list on Stategy &amp; Force Structure.<br />This book, by an extraordinary duo including the man who may well be Canada's foremost authority in this arena, provides the first and as best I can tell only comprehensive discussion of why human security in every clime and place matters locally, that is, to the future of your children.<br />It places special emphasis on the importance of multi-cultural (i.e. not bully boy unilateral &quot;we are the light and might makes right) approaches and large investments (commensurate with what we waste now on B2 bombers and nuclear carriers) in peacekeeping and stabilization operations which provide a vastly greater return on investment than funds wasted lining the pockets of military-industrial complex managers.	2004-01-14

Although I chose \\"For the Common Good\\" and I recommend \\"Ecological Economics\\" as the one book to buy if you buy only one (see my reviews of those books at their own pages), this book is a treasure chest of original and current thinking that should certainly be in your hands if you can afford all three books.  As another reviewer has noted, it finally re-publishes some of the hard to get original thinkers from the steady-state economics era of the 1970's.  However, it does so with an ample leavening of 1990's authorship, and hence could reasonably be regarded as a first-class \\"readings\\" complement to the text book (\\"Ecological Economics\\").<br /><br />There is a chart on page 20 of this book that is quite extraordinary.  Titled \\"The ends-means spectrum\\", it brilliantly runs down from the top: Religion and Ethics as guidelines to ultimate and intermediate ends of humanity; to the middle Political Economy as a means of managing the factors of production to specific political ends; to the bottom: Technics and Physics as the \\"ultimate\\" foundation or \\"ground truth\\" of flow-entropy-matter-energy that must constrain political and religious ends.<br /><br />This book, in which Kenneth N. Townsend is the second contributing editor-author, blends practical, political, economic, and theological writings, over several decades, in a most pleasing manner.  E. F. Schumacher's \\"Buddhist Economics\\" jumped out at me, reminding me that our predominantly Protestant corporate capitalist ethos is very far removed from the realities that guide and repress billions around the Earth, all of whom have fewer options than we do.  With that thought in mind, I strongly recommend William Greider's \\"The Soul of Capitalism: Opening Paths to a Moral Economy\\" as a very current complement to any of the books that Dr. Daly has helped bring into the marketplace of ideas.<br /><br />See also, with reviews:<br />[[ASIN:159659098X The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism: How the Financial System Underminded Social Ideals, Damaged Trust in the Markets, Robbed Investors of Trillions - and What to Do About It]]<br />[[ASIN:0316353000 Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]]<br />[[ASIN:0300119976 Green to Gold: How Smart Companies Use Environmental Strategy to Innovate, Create Value, and Build Competitive Advantage]]lped bring into the marketplace of ideas.

Robert B. Reich's \\"The Work of Nations: Preparing Ourselves for 21st Century Capitalism\\" can be read with renewed appreciation and respect if one if also now reading William Greider's [[ASIN:0684862204 The Soul of Capitalism: Opening Paths to a Moral Economy]] or any of the books by Herman E. Daly (e.g. [[ASIN:1559633123 Ecological Economics: Principles And Applications]]).<br /><br />I read Reich's [[ASIN:0375700617 Locked in the Cabinet]], but this book remains a better gauge of his value to America, and I do hope we get a chance to hear from him again.

Daly may well be a future Nobel Prize winner ...he is especially well-regarded in Norway and Sweden, where he has received prizes one step short of the Nobel.  He is the author, co-author, or primary contributing editor of many books that fully integrate the disciplines of economics and ecology.  I bought the three most recent for the purpose of selecting one to give out at my annual Global Information Forum.  I ended up choosing this book to give away to hundreds, in part because it is available in paperback and is not a more expensive \\"trade\\" publication; and in part because it is strong in laying out specific ecological policy areas in the context of a strong theological or ethical perspective.<br /><br />Of the three books I reviewed, (the newest [[ASIN:1559633123 Ecological Economics: Principles And Applications]], the oldest, updated, [[ASIN:0262540681 Valuing the Earth: Economics, Ecology, Ethics]]) the first, the text-book, is assuredly the most up-to-date and the most detailed.  If you are buying only one book for yourself, that is the one that I recommend, because these are important issues and a detailed understanding is required with the level of detail that this book provided.  It should, ideally, be read with \\"Valuing the Earth\\" first (see my separate review of that book, from the 1970's updated with 1990's material and new contributions), then this book (\\"For the Common Good\\"), and finally the text book as a capstone.  But if you buy only one, buy the text book.<br /><br />This is a second-edition work, updated from the 1984 first edition.  I like it very much in part because it comes across as less academic and more common-sense in nature.  Part One does a lovely job of tearing apart the fallacy of misplaced concreteness with respect to economics, the market, measuring economic success, the reduction of the human to a \\"good\\" that can be traded without regard to humanity and ethics and community, and land.  Part Two gently introduces the reader to the many distinguished thought-leaders and practitioners who have gradually matured the discipline of economics to embrace humanity, community, and sustainability as non-negotiable realities that cannot be ignored.<br /><br />Part Three, a major factor in my choosing this book over the others for broad pro-bono distribution, addresses the specifics of policies one element at a time: free trade versus community; population; land use; agriculture; industry; labor; income policies and taxes; from world domination to national security as an objective.  Finally, Part Four, without being corny or preachy, describes the religious or ethical vision (I still think the Golden Rule works as a one-sentence definition of common interest).<br /><br />An afterword on debt in relation to money and wealth is particularly timely as the American public foolishly allows the White House carpetbaggers to run up a $7 trillion deficit that our great-grandchilden will never be able to pay off if we continue is these evil and irresponsible directions, all in sharp opposition to the sensible and ethical constructs in this book.<br /><br />Of the three books, none of which really duplicate one another in any negative way, albeit with overlaps, this is the second that I recommend for purchase, after the textbook.<br /><br />See also, with reviews, published since then:<br />[[ASIN:159659098X The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism: How the Financial System Underminded Social Ideals, Damaged Trust in the Markets, Robbed Investors of Trillions - and What to Do About It]]<br />[[ASIN:0316353000 Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]]<br />[[ASIN:0300119976 Green to Gold: How Smart Companies Use Environmental Strategy to Innovate, Create Value, and Build Competitive Advantage]]<br />[[ASIN:0865475873 Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things]]ently introduces the reader to the many distinguished thought-leaders and practitioners who have gradually matured the discipline of economics to embrace humanity, community, and sustainability as non-negotiable realities that cannot be ignored.

But if you buy only one, buy this one.<br /><br />Tables of contents rarely do justice to the contents but in this case, they excel.  This is one of the most intelligent, structured, useful outlines it has been my privilege to examine.  Read the Table of Contents information provided by the publisher to satisfy yourself.  From Part I with three chapters (An Introduction to Ecological Economics) to Part II with 4 chapters (The Containing and Sustaining Ecosystem: The Whole) to Parts III and IV (Microeconomics and Macroeconomics, respectively, five and four chapters each) to Part V with four chapters (International Trade), and finally to Part VI (Policy) with chapters on General Policy Design Principles, on Sustainable Scale, on Just Distribution, and on Efficient Allocation, the content of the book is elegantly organized and accurately described.<br /><br />Readings and other references make this a true textbook suitable for policy adults, graduate students, and undergraduates.  It is the perfect single book in this field, not least because of its appreciation for religious vision and ethics as a foundation for making decisions that favor sustainable community over corporate greed and government fiat.<br /><br />Dr. Joshua Farley as co-author appears to have brought a rich background as first an understudy and then an original contributor in his own right. God willing, America will one day have a President that uses the co-authors as primary advisors, along with E. O. Wilson, Brian Czech, and J. F. Rischard, among a handful I particularly respect.  I feel a real sense of privilege in having discovered these three books and the work of Dr. Daly.  At the age of 52, as I see America and the world inflamed by ideologues and crooks betraying the public trust, I cannot help but feel that those of us old enough and experienced enough to think for ourselves have a 20-year intellectual and moral battle ahead of us, one that will determine the future of the Earth.  Anyone old enough to drive needs to read at least one of his books, but those of us old enough to feel fully equal to the task of confronting our sell-out Senators and sell-out Representatives need to arm ourselves with the specifics that Drs. Daly and Farley offer us, and join the battle for managing the commonwealth in favor of all of us.<br /><br />See also, with reviews:<br />[[ASIN:0679768114 The Future of Life]]<br />[[ASIN:0520225147 Shoveling Fuel for a Runaway Train: Errant Economists, Shameful Spenders, and a Plan to Stop them All]]<br />[[ASIN:0465070108 High Noon 20 Global Problems, 20 Years to Solve Them]]<br />[[ASIN:0060533226 Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature]]<br />[[ASIN:0974952249 Green Chemistry and the Ten Commandments of Sustainability, 2nd ed]]<br />[[ASIN:0316353000 Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]]<br />[[ASIN:0300119976 Green to Gold: How Smart Companies Use Environmental Strategy to Innovate, Create Value, and Build Competitive Advantage]]to Stop them All]]  [[ASIN:0465070108 High Noon 20 Global Problems, 20 Years to Solve Them]]  [[ASIN:0060533226 Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature]]  [[ASIN:0974952249 Green Chemistry and the Ten Commandments of Sustainability, 2nd ed]]  [[ASIN:0316353000 Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]]  [[ASIN:0300119976 Green to Gold: How Smart Companies Use Environmental Strategy to Innovate, Create Value, and Build Competitive Advantage]]	2004-01-01

He is vastly more elegant and politically focused than Al Franken, Jim Hightower, or Michael Moore, and dramatically easier to read than Paul Krugman, Matthew Crenson & Benjamin Ginsberg, or the cultural creative/new progressive/radical center readings (see Steele's List on Democracy & the Republic).<br /><br />[[ASIN:0525947647 Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right]]<br />[[ASIN:0452285658 Thieves in High Places: They've Stolen Our Country and It's Time to Take It Back]]<br />[[ASIN:0446693790 Dude, Where's My Country?]]<br />[[ASIN:0393312925 Peddling Prosperity: Economic Sense and Nonsense in an Age of Diminished Expectations]]<br />[[ASIN:0801878861 Downsizing Democracy: How America Sidelined Its Citizens and Privatized Its Public]]<br />[[ASIN:0393929566 We the People: An Introduction to American Politics, Sixth Shorter Edition]]<br /><br />This is a double-spaced book with big print and small pages, but it does the job.  James Carville may be a ragin' Cajun with a smart mouth and a weak bladder (read the book) but he clearly has three things going for him: a brain that is in gear before he talks or writes; good friends strong on both policy and research; and a gift for cutting to the chase.  Where I would want to have five of my author-advisors putting together a 1 page summary and 5 page detailed review for each of the key policy areas, Carville manages to do in one book what none of the Democratic candidates--not Dean, not Gephardt--have done: he breaks George W. Bush's back with six strokes of the rod: 1) provide for the common defense (homeland insecurity, screwed up military and foreign policy); 2) provide for the general welfare (deficits and debts matter a lot, tax cuts are a huge lie); 3) secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and posterity (education, environment and energy, health care--and notice the emphasis in the Constitution on *posterity*, which is the opposite of carpet-bagging); 4) Establish justice (campaign finance reform, corporate governance, myth of tort reform); 5) insure domestic tranquility (why entitlements matter, notes on lying, the religious right, and friends); and finally, 6) form a more perfect union.<br /><br />This is a quickie book, clearly tapping a multi-million person market for books that contain truth and oppose the impeachable activities of the extremists now looting America through their control of US government policy.  It is a simplistic and imperfect book, but sufficient to persuade me that anyone who can muster 1000 brilliant experts covering the 250 critical policy and budget topics that must be mastered to win the general election, must, of necessity, have James Carville as the moderator and facilitator.<br /><br />The book has several useful graphics, and among them two stand out: one on the changes in the opinion of billions of people around the world from before 9-11 to after three years of Bush in power; the other on the $980 billion--almost one trillion--in uncollected annual tax revenue from corporations that tell their stockholders one thing and the IRS another.  I absolutely agree with this author that among our highest priorities must be our restoration of America as good neighbor and global friend to legitimate governments (that cuts out the 44 dictators still operating as looting pals of the Cheney-Bush-Perle regime); and the capture of the lost corporate revenue that could, with other savings, fully fund the most important national security investments: in our people, their health and education, and the restoration of legitimate democracy in America.<br /><br />Perhaps most interestingly, Carville has avoided the rush to Deanthat characterized myself and others who thought Dean would mature quickly and move from Amway parties to structured policy and outreach to all parties including moderate Republicans like myself.  Carville cites George McGovern and Nancy Pelosi as special people, and I agree with the first.  Pelosi has had her moments, but she has been a doormat in the anchor leg and I will never forgive her for taking impeachment off the table).  He also highlights the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Citizens for Tax Justice as meriting special attention, and I only wish that George Soros has earmarked funds for these rather than for organizations that have been too quick to support Howard Dean and abandon a centrist non-partisan policy development position.<br /><br />Buy this book.

See links below for why.<br /><br />Black Commentator noted in November that Al Sharpton has assumed the mantle of leadership for black America, and that it is highly likely that he will receive a majority of the black votes, at least in the South.  For that reason alone, this book is *must reading* for every Democratic and non-Republican voter.<br /><br />Below I summarize a few highlights from this rich book that took an afternoon to absorb:<br /><br />1) Reverend Sharpton is strongest in his articulation of the hypocrisy of America, its lip service to slogans.  I take him at face value when he speaks of the need to unite the country again around its values, and when he speaks of the emerging black/Latino coalition that resonates on the street level.<br /><br />2) He lists some of his role models, and it merits comment that three of the four are pioneers of non-violence: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, and Mahatma Ghandi.  Later on the in book Reverend Sharpton discusses James Brown and Adam Clayton Powell as length, and I found his account of their merits and his lessons drawn from them to be compelling and credible.<br /><br />3) Fidel Castro comes in for special mention, as do Ronald Reagan and Minister Louis Frarakhan, and I have to give Reverend Sharpton very high marks for directness and accuracy.  Others, those with less integrity, might have left Fidel Castro out for fear of the kind of unethical attacks it might unleash against him from the extremist Republicans.  I for one agree with Reverend Sharpton, as I agree with his view that the embargo against Cuba should be ended immediately.<br /><br />4) He is powerful and convincing when he addresses the prison-industrial complex, a complex as threatening to America's long-term security and prosperity as the more well known military-industrial complex.  As he points out, prisons are big business, and politicians on pay-offs have every incentive to keep pumping out contracts for major construction and related services including guard employment.<br /><br />5)  Reverend Sharpton is intellectual and emotional dynamite when he describes the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) as an anti-Rainbow Coalition organization, and Bill Clinton (and by extension, Joe Lieberman) as rich boys eager to stay to the right and reap the benefits, rather than true Democrats committed to delivering people from poverty.  In brief, Al Sharpton has to run for President precisely because neither the DLC nor Dean are unwilling to reach out to and represent black America in the truest sense of the word.  On this basis, I see Ralph Nader's 2000 campaign in a different light--Nader was campaigning for those that the DLC had shut out of the Democratic Process, and Al Gore was too slow to understand that he was leaving a very big crowd out of the big tent.<br /><br />6)  Reverend Sharpton impresses me on the foreign policy front.  Although his experience is limited to foreign travels and specific interviews, his intellect and his gut instincts are totally consistent with the 430+ books I have reviewed on national security and international relations.  Reverend Sharpton gets it: America has made many deals with the devil, with dictators like Saddam Hussein, with terrorists like bin Laden, and the American people do not realize that 9-11 is in fact the beginning of payback for decades of official US hypocrisy in its international relations.<br /><br />7)  Although very short on the topic, in my special area of interest, intelligence qua spies and secrecy, I  give Reverend Sharpton the highest marks.  He is the only Democratic candidate to really understand that we need \\"an intelligence unit that would allow us to reallyknow what's going on out there in the world.\\"  Reverend Sharpton is also committed to allies, investments in nation-building, and strong relationships nurtured over time.  He also understands that you cannot threaten those who are not afraid to die suicidally, and that whipping out a bigger gun against them is precisely the wrong thing to do.<br /><br />8)  He focuses correctly on the internal dynamics of America as its greatest area of vulnerability, as the area most in need of attention if America is to be strong and prosperous.  He correctly notes that the 30 percent increase in the US military budget in 2002 was *not* about making America safer, but about buying all the things that could not be rationalized before, and at the expense of domestic priorities such as health and education.<br /><br />9) There are several chapters that offer up specific lists of initiatives that he would support, across many policy areas, and I find them all sensible.  This is a man I could work for and follow.<br /><br />10) I am satisfied that he puts the Tawana Brawley matter to rest with a chapter.<br /><br />11) His chapters on black leadership, Jessie Jackson, why anti-Semitism is strongest in the Billy Graham-Richard Nixon crowd, and how the hip-hop movement is both wrong to be obscene and yet a major power in waiting, a power that can mobilize youth toward a more Christian vision, are quite fascinating, words that are not to be found anywhere else.<br /><br />Bottom line, and I say this with the utmost respect, being scornful of most beltway politicians and bandits: Al Sharpton may have baggage and be a spendthrift in some ways, but when all is said and done, his voice absolutely must be fully and consistently heard as America charts its course into the future.  Like Pat Buchanan, Sam Nunn, and a few others great voices that may never be President, Rev Sharpton has a depth of intuition, understanding, and experience that he has ably articulated in this book.  We need to read it and we need to ask for his views in all major future decisions bearing on the security and prosperity of American's core black community and constituency, a community and constituency that too often in the past has been over-shadowed by new immigrant communities--Asians and Hispanics, for example.  America cannot be great if its black community is not itself great.

More recently, I have taken an interest in religious subversion of national governments and policies, and strongly recommend Stephen Mumford's &quot;The Life &amp; Death of NSSM 200: How the Destruction of Political Will Doomed a U. S. Population Policy&quot;, which is still available from Amazon via the used book channels.<br />The Da Vinci Code is most interesting, not because of its bashing of Opus Dei, but because it addresses what may be the core injustice in Catholicism (I was raised a Jesuit Catholic in Colombia, with roots in Spain): the concealment of the normal sexuality of Jesus, his marriage, and the fact that until the mid-1800's, the Church did not dare to claim that the Pope was infallible, and that all that preceded that claim was based merely on a man's prophecies.  Jesus, in other words, can not lay any greater claim to our faith than Mohammed.<br />Most relevant to me, as I consider the need for elevating women to positions of power because they are more intuitive, more integrative, and less confrontational than men, was the book's discussion of the origins of paganism (not satanic at all, but rather worshiping Mother Earth and specifically the human female mothers from whom life obviously emerged) and the manner in which the Catholic Church deliberately set out to slander Mary Magdalene, making her out to be a whore rather than the spouse of Jesus (from whom issue came), and murdering five million women in a witch-hunt and global psychological operations against women that has been mirrored by Islam in many ways, and that must, if we are to survive, be reversed by thoughtful people willing to think for themselves.<br />This book, riveting in every way, suggested to me that we the people need to doubt the integrity and intentions of all our institutions, but especially the Catholic Church; and that we need to reverse the centuries of discrimination against women, restore the matriarchal roots of society, and again begin to respect the natural relationship between ourselves and the Earth that we have defiled precisely because we have allowed men to abuse women, and corporations to assume legal manly personalities abusive of governments and the tax-payer.<br />This is a revolutionary book.  If it causes you to question authority and re-think your relationships, you cannot have made a better purchase.rsed by thoughtful people willing to think for themselves.<br />This book, riveting in every way, suggested to me that we the people need to doubt the integrity and intentions of all our institutions, but especially the Catholic Church; and that we need to reverse the centuries of discrimination against women, restore the matriarchal roots of society, and again begin to respect the natural relationship between ourselves and the Earth that we have defiled precisely because we have allowed men to abuse women, and corporations to assume legal manly personalities abusive of governments and the tax-payer.<br />This is a revolutionary book.

These pigs have destroyed the nation--see my new book, free online from 24 Sep, ELECTION 2008: Lipstick on the Pig.<br /><br />Edit of 21 Dec 07 to recommend update and reissuance in collaboration with John Bogle, author of [[ASIN:159659098X The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism: How the Financial System Underminded Social Ideals, Damaged Trust in the Markets, Robbed Investors of Trillions - and What to Do About It]] and a few others whose books are linked below.<br /><br />Rubin is self-effacing and not at all, in any way, claiming personal credit for how well it went as America experienced one of its greatest economic booms, despite some rather scary international threats to our economic security.  I believe this will be a classic reference for years to come.<br /><br />1) Early on, and then throughout the book, Rubin does a fine job of documenting and explaining why markets, which are relatively autonomous beasts, and at least as important as governments and government policies, in setting the economic security environment.<br /><br />2) A corollary to the above, but all the more important because it dovetails precisely with Henry Kissinger's caution (\\"Does America Need a Foreign Policy\\"), is Rubin's detailed articulation of how U.S. politics and US policy mechanisms are not now well-suited to coping with the new risks of the global economy.  The speed and reach of the marketplace is now such that the industrial-era government bureaucracies and 1970's information technology stovepipes are completely inadequate--however well-intentioned a President might be, the current structure and current approaches to establishing economic strategies and policies are NOT OKAY.<br /><br />3) Rubin is quite excellent in explaining in a very understandable manner how specific fiscal policies toward other states (e.g. Mexico) can be directly related to consequences in terms of illegal immigration (surging if Mexico is allowed to collapse), illegal drugs and crime, and trade.<br /><br />4) Especially helpful in this book is its emphasis on the importance of educating the American public as a pre-requisite to the politics of making the right economic decisions for America.  Rubin quotes Clinton as saying that one of his (President Clinton's) greatest lessons learned from his two-term Presidency was the need to do the public education (political strategy) before the public politics and deal-making.  Senator David Boren (today President of the University of Oklahoma) and Mr. David Gergen have made this point earlier (\\"Preparing America's Foreign Policy for the 21st Century\\"), but Rubin's focus merits strong emphasis, because in combination, our mediocre policy structure and our mediocre public understanding combine to create not one but two devastating Achilles' heels for US economic security policy-making.<br /><br />5) Rubin excels at documenting the direct relationship between poverty and inner-city distress and poor education of important segments of America's population, and its economic well-being.  He extends this analysis internationally, focusing on how vital it is to extend the fruits of prosperity across all nations and peoples, if the US is itself to have sustainable economic stability and prosperity.<br /><br />6) The book is a case study in decision-making, a manual of how to and how not to approach problems for which, as he notes with frequency, there are no certain outcomes.  I was very impressed by his acute sensitivity to the fact that most subordinates are incapable of speaking utter truth to their bosses--they pull their punches.  Thisis equally true, as he explicitly notes, of Chief Executive Officers invited to meet with the President.  Rubin appears gifted in his ability to draw out the concerns and negatives from all subordinates, with a special kindness extended by him to the most junior or front-line subordinates, a kindness that is repaid in full with honest opinion.<br /><br />7) I noticed some very strong observations from Rubin on the inability of the Department of State and of the Central Intelligence Agency to provide him with core information that he needed on Indonesia, among other fiscal hot spots.  Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore turned out to be much more useful to him in understanding the context and possibilities.  From this Rubin draws the lesson that the Department of State needs to get smarter about economics, and that a new kind of Foreign Service Officer is needed, one that is not just following political matters, but economic matters.  Indeed, I would go so far as to say that State needs to migrate from the old POL-MIL mind-set, to a new POL-ECON mindset.  CIA must of course get much better at understanding demography, public health, economics, and infrastructure issues down to the province and township letters, something that will require them to finally take Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) much more seriously, and to become competent in 29+ languages.<br /><br />8)  \\"Rubin's Rules\\", actually prepared by his staff as a going-away gift when he departed Treasury, are listed on page 251, with an 11th rule on page 252, and are alone worth the price of the book.  They will not be repeated here, they are precious.<br /><br />9) Rubin is critical of the private sector for having over-invested in Third World ventures without doing the due diligence related to risk assessment, and he ventures into some discussion of the importance of defining and communicating best practices, codes and standards for debt management, bankruptcy, deposit insurance, and bank supervision.  I could not help but reflect on how much more important the ISO might become if it also becomes central to economic security and stability by contributing a standards process that helps reduce and mitigate risk for all.<br /><br />10) There are many other gems in this book, from his review of \\"deficit economics\\" (and why it is an idiot idea writ large), to how Monica Lewinsky cost the US taxpayer much more than the cost of the impeachment proceedings, to the need to always review old assumptions, to the dangerous reliance by Wall Street on models (as with Long-Term Capital Management failure), to the need to redefine GDP calculations (in addition to deducting negative investments like prisons and health care that others have recommended, Rubin suggests that the presence or absence of positive investments related to environmental sustainability need to be included).<br /><br />This is a solid serious book about core economic security issues.  I venture to say that no one could run for President, or be an effective President, without absorbing all that Robert E. Rubin has to teach us.

I would say that this book, together with Yale business author Jeffrey Garten's book, [[ASIN:1578518784 The Politics of Fortune: A New Agenda For Business Leaders]] are \\"must reads\\" for the senior executive who desires to not just survive but to excel in the 21st Century.<br /><br />The author, who has a solid understanding of the history of surprise in military or national security circles, makes the point that surprise does not occur for lack of signs that can be detected, but for lack of a culture and mind-set open to seeing and understanding those signals.<br /><br />The book combines survey results from professionals attending the Academy of Competitive Intelligence (the single best offering in the world) with real-world accounts, \\"gray box\\" supplementals, and \\"manager's checklists\\" at the end of each chapter that are in essence an executive summary of the chapter.<br /><br />This is a 2-3 hour read, and well-worth anyone's time, but especially well-worth the time of the executive who is willing to consider the possibility that they are grossly unaware of real-world external threats to their future bonuses, and that there might be some relatively simple low-cost solutions to dealing with the threat that require, rather than vast sums of money, a change in mind-set.<br /><br />Other recommended works on my short list (with reviews):<br />[[ASIN:0962124125 Measuring the Effectiveness of Competitive Intelligence: Assessing & Communicating CI's Value to Your Organization]]<br />[[ASIN:1574770187 Keeping Abreast of Science and Technology: Technical Intelligence for Business]]<br />[[ASIN:0471585092 The New Competitor Intelligence: The Complete Resource for Finding, Analyzing, and Using Information about Your Competitors]]<br />[[ASIN:0971566119 The New Craft of Intelligence: Personal, Public, & Political--Citizen's Action Handbook for Fighting Terrorism, Genocide, Disease, Toxic Bombs, & Corruption]]<br />[[ASIN:0971566143 THE SMART NATION ACT: Public Intelligence in the Public Interest]]hapter that are in essence an executive summary of the chapter.

Unfortunately, it reflects zero understanding of the real world (see my 400+ reviews of non-fiction national security books at Amazon) and it reflects zero understanding of the core issues that need to be dealt with in the US economy (see my review posted today of Robert Rubin's \\"In An Uncertain World\\").<br /><br />I still believe in Dean, but if he does not get his policy and outreach acts together at the substantive level, but Dean and his campaign manager gave policy substance short-shrift, and this is important *not* because of the details, but because it must be the foundation for creating a coalition government that integrates Independents, moderate Republicans, Greens, Reforms, Libertarians, and \\"Drop-Outs\\" (where Barack Obama is making great gains in 2007) into a united electorate that will a) work together in the open and modified primaries to overcome the Democratic Leadership Council bias in favor of beltway \\"suits\\" and b) work together in the general election to defeat the well-fended and often illegal endeavors of the Republican extremists, who are *not* playing by the rules and who believe they have a God-given right to steal the 2004 election just as they stole the 2000 election.<br /><br />This is a fine book for those who want a quick \\"read\\" on Dean as a man and potential leader.  It does *not* fill the bill for a serious book about integrated policy issues and an executable sustainable budget that addresses the needs of the vast majority of Americans who are not represented by the incumbent President, nor for that matter by the incumbent Democratic and Republican Senators and Representatives that have chosen to give the incumbent President a blank check for over-turning 50 years progress in multilateral global security, environmental and labor protection, public health and education, and civil rights.<br /><br />Dean has his heart in the right place, and this book documents that.

It is also very misleadingly titled.  In brief, this is the book Tom Clancy would write if a) he worked for RAND and b) did not care about making money.<br /><br />It is not completely superficial--what is there is valid, documented, and for someone that does not read in this field, satisfactory.  But to take just one example where my own work is dominant, that of open source intelligence: the author, who knows better, covers the topic with a trashy vignette of his visit to Margot Williams at the Washington Post and the result is, to me at least, quite annoying in its glibness and ignorance of all else that is going on in the open source world.<br /><br />This book is also not about the future of war, unless one is a prisoner of (or funded sycophant to) the morons in the Pentagon that think that \\"information superiority\\" is still about expensive secret intelligence satellites, expensive unilateral secret communications links, and using very very expensive B-2 bombers to go after guys in caves.  There are four future wars that will be fought over 100 years on six fronts: big wars with conventional armies (e.g. between India and Pakistan), small wars and criminal man-hunts around the world; nature wars including the wars against disease, water scarcity, mass migration, and trade in women and children as well as piracy and ethnic crime; and electronic wars, where states, corporations, and individuals will all vie for some form of advantage in the electronic environment that we have created and that is, because of Microsoft, a national catastrophe waiting to happen.<br /><br />On the latter, the author gets 4 stars.  On the former, zero.  I hold the author blameless for the lousy title.  This is about not how war is going to be fought in the 21st Century--it is about what the beltway bureaucracy is trying to sell to the Pentagon, at taxpayer expense, and it covers just 10% of the future needs and capabilities.<br /><br />Recommended, with reviews:<br />[[ASIN:0805044566 The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People]]<br />[[ASIN:0316164968 The Fifty-Year Wound: How America's Cold War Victory Has Shaped Our World]]<br />[[ASIN:0922915865 War Is a Racket: The Anti-War Classic by America's Most Decorated General, Two Other Anti=Interventionist Tracts, and Photographs from the Horror of It]]<br />[[ASIN:0195161106 The Paradox of American Power: Why the World's Only Superpower Can't Go It Alone]]<br />[[ASIN:0080311709 Race to the Swift: Thoughts on Twenty-First Century Warfare (International Series on Materials Science and Technology)]]<br />[[ASIN:B0000C4JBT Wilson's Ghost: Reducing the Risk of Conflict, Killing, and Catastrophe in the 21st Century]]<br />[[ASIN:B000FBH3W2 Why We Fight]]<br />[[ASIN:B0001L3LUE The Fog of War - Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S.

On that basis, I give the book a solid four stars.<br /><br />Although Peter Drucker and I have both written about \\"work as a calling\\" and the importance of finding joy in what you do, and that could serve as a one-sentence summary of the book, there is more to this book than that.

I note with concern that under Bush-Cheney \\"Failed States\\" have increased from 75 in 2005 to 177 in 2007.  We've lost our mind, and our morals,  as a Nation.<br /><br />Ambassador Mark Palmer puts to rest all those generally unfair stereotypes of Foreign Service Officers as \\"cookie pushing\\" softies who fall in love with their host countries and blame America for any flaws in the bi-lateral relationship.  With this book he provides an inspiring model for precisely what every Foreign Service Officer should aspire: to understand, to articulate, and then to implement very great goals that serve democracy and help extend the bounty of the American way of life--moral capitalism and shared wealth--to every corner of the world.<br /><br />This is a detailed and practical book, not just visionary.  It is useful and inspiring, not just a personal view.  It is also a damning indictment of fifty years of US White House and Congressional politics, where in the name of anti-communism and cheap oil America--regardless of which party has been in power, has been willing to consort with the most despotic, ruthless, murderous regimes in the history of mankind.  Still alive today and still very much \\"friends\\" of the U.S. Government are dictators that think nothing of murdering millions.<br /><br />There has been some improvement, offset by an increase in partly free countries.  From 69 countries not free at all in 1972 we now have 47.  From 38 countries partly free in 1972 we now have 56, many of those remnants of the former Soviet Union.  Free countries have nearly doubled from 43 to 89, but free and poor is quite a different thing from free and prosperous.<br /><br />The level of detail and also of brevity in this book is quite satisfying.  On the one hand, Ambassador Palmer provides ample and well-documented discussion of the state of the world, on the other he does not belabor the matter--his one to two-paragraph summative descriptions of each of the dictatorships is just enough, just right.<br /><br />He distinguishes between Personalistic Dictatorships (20, now less Hussein in Iraq); Monarch Dictators (7, with Saudi Arabia being the first in class); Military Dictators (5, with US allies Sudan and Pakistan and 1 and 2 respectively); Communist Dictators (5); Dominant-Party Dictators (7); and lastly, Theocratic Dictators (1, Iran).<br /><br />Ambassador Palmer makes several important points with this book, and I summarize them here: 1) conventional wisdom of the past has been flawed--we should not have sacrificed our ideals for convenience; 2) dictatorships produce inordinate amounts of collateral damage that threatens the West, from genocide and mass migrations to disease, famine, and crime; 3) there is a business case to be made for ending U.S. support for dictatorships, in that business can profit more from stable democratic regimes over the long-term; and lastly, 4) that the U.S. should sanction dictators, not their peoples, and we can begin by denying them and all their cronies visas for shopping expeditions in the US.<br /><br />The book has an action agenda that is worthy, but much more important is the clear and present policy that Ambassador Palmer advocates, one that is consistent with American ideals as well as universal recognition of human rights.  Ambassador Palmer's work, on the one hand, shows how hypocritical and unethical past Administrations have been--both Democratic and Republican--and on the other, he provides a clear basis for getting us back on track.<br /><br />I agree with his proposition that we should have a new Undersecretary for Democracy, with two Assistant Secretaries, one responsible for voluntary democratic transitions, the other for dealing with recalcitrant dictators.  Such an expansion of the Department of State would work well with a similar change in the Pentagon, with a new Undersecretary for Peacekeeping Operations and Complex Emergencies, my own idea.<br /><br />This is a very fine book, and if it helps future Foreign Service Officers to understand that diplomacy is not just about \\"getting along\\" but about making very significant changes in the world at large, then Ambassador Palmer's work will be of lasting value to us all.<br /><br />Also recommended, with reviews:<br />[[ASIN:0872864758 A Power Governments Cannot Suppress]]<br />[[ASIN:0805044566 The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People]]<br />[[ASIN:0316166286 Blood Money: Wasted Billions, Lost Lives, and Corporate Greed in Iraq]]<br />[[ASIN:0805077979 The Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire Project)]]<br />[[ASIN:0316164968 The Fifty-Year Wound: How America's Cold War Victory Has Shaped Our World]]<br />[[ASIN:0922915865 War Is a Racket: The Anti-War Classic by America's Most Decorated General, Two Other Anti=Interventionist Tracts, and Photographs from the Horror of It]]<br />[[ASIN:0195161106 The Paradox of American Power: Why the World's Only Superpower Can't Go It Alone]]<br />[[ASIN:193213347X The Tao of Democracy: Using Co-Intelligence to Create a World That Works for All]]<br />[[ASIN:1576752585 The World Cafe: Shaping Our Futures Through Conversations That Matter]]<br />[[ASIN:0195160894 Faith-Based Diplomacy: Trumping Realpolitik]]<br /><br />Forthcoming on Amazon in February and also free at OSS.Net/CIB:<br />COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE: Creating a Prosperous World at Peace, edited by Mark Tovey with a Foreword by Yochai Benkler and an Afterword by the Rt.

However, Steele says, \\"As a long-time admirer of Sir John's prowess in understanding warfare, I must respectfully say that in this instance, he stands with the American Colonel who plaintively observed to the North Vietnamese Colonel that America won all the battles in Viet-Nam-to which the man replied, as recounted by Harry Summers, with (and I paraphrase), `So what?  That is irrelevant to the outcome.'\\"<br /><br />Steele goes on, \\"Where Sir John misses the point is with respect to the distinct role of intelligence at the strategic level.  As Sun Tsu (and perhaps even Colin Gray) would no doubt observe to Sir John, `If you've gotten yourself into a war at all, then you have failed to win by other means, and it is this that is the larger intelligence failure.'\\"<br /><br />Steele concludes, \\"It is my own experience that 80% of the American national security budget is wastefully expended on a heavy metal military that is useless 90% of the time.  Indeed, of the $500 billion a year we spend today, we should reduce the amount spent on conventional and nuclear forces by half, while re-directing the savings toward special operations, gendarme, peace, and homeland security intelligence and counterintelligence.  America has begun a hundred-year war on six different fronts precisely because the President lacked intelligence in every sense of the word, and because he and his ideologically-motivated handlers also lacked the kind of long-term diverse strategy for securing a sustainable long-term peace that can only come from a full understanding of diverse threats and circumstances.  Yes, soldiers win wars.  Intelligence professionals prevent wars by being prescient, clever, and covertly effective.\\"<br /><br />Mr. Steele is the author of [[ASIN:0971566100 On Intelligence: Spies and Secrecy in an Open World]] (2001); [[ASIN:0971566119 The New Craft of Intelligence: Personal, Public, & Political--Citizen's Action Handbook for Fighting Terrorism, Genocide, Disease, Toxic Bombs, & Corruption]] (2002); [[ASIN:0971566135 Information Operations: All Information, All Languages, All the Time]]; and [[ASIN:0971566143 THE SMART NATION ACT: Public Intelligence in the Public Interest]]; and a contributing editor of [[ASIN:0971566127 Peacekeeping Intelligence: Emerging Concepts for the Future]] (2003).

It was his careful and reasoned discussion of how specific capabilities and policies might not make sense at one level of analysis, but do when combined with others, that helped me understand why US (and other) intelligence communities continue to get so much wrong.<br /><br />First to credit Luttwak:  anti-tank weapons make no sense in isolation (tactical level), but if they slow the tank down enough to allow artillery and close air support to have an impact (operational level), they might close gaps and win victories (strategic level).  Bottom line: nothing in war can be considered in isolation (including, one might add, the post-war needs that enable an exit strategy).<br /><br />It was from Luttwak's work that the Marine Corps Intelligence Center (today the Marine Corps Intelligence Command) developed the new model for analysis that distinguished between the four levels of analysis (strategic, operational, tactical, and technical), combined that with the three major domains (military, geographic, and civil), and then cross-walked that against every single mission area (infantry, artillery, tanks, aviation, etcetera).<br /><br />One simple example of the importance of Luttwak's work to intelligence:  at the time (1990) the Libyan T-72 tank was considered by the US Intelligence Community to be a very high threat because it was the best tank that money could then buy--but on reflection, we found this was true only at the technical level of optimal lethality.  At the tactical level the tank was being stored in the open, poorly maintained by poorly trained crews, parts cannibalization occurring regularly, this dropped the  threat to low.  At the operational level there were a significant number of the tanks scattered around and available, this raised it to a medium threat at that level.  At the strategic level, the tanks could not be sustained in battle for more than two weeks, and dropped again to low.<br /><br />Edward Luttwak, in company with Colin Gray, Martin van Creveld, Ralph Peters, and Steve Metz, is one of the most brilliant and clear-spoken of the strategists writing in English, and this book will remain--for years to come--a fundamental building block in the learning and maturation of national security strategy.<br /><br />Other recommended books at this level:<br />[[ASIN:0198782519 Modern Strategy]]<br />[[ASIN:0029331552 Transformation of War]]<br />[[ASIN:0891419012 The Changing Face of War: Lessons of Combat, from the Marne to Iraq]]<br />[[ASIN:081170274X Wars of Blood and Faith: The Conflicts That Will Shape the 21st Century]]<br />[[ASIN:1574880667 Security Studies for the 21st Century]]<br />[[ASIN:0324282710 Strategy: Process, Content, Context--An International Perspective]]<br />[[ASIN:0275968634 The Search for Security: A U.S. Grand Strategy for the Twenty-First Century]]<br />[[ASIN:B000QRMSWK The Sword and The Pen - Selections From The World's Greatest Military Writings]]<br />[[ASIN:0452288193 War and Peace and War: The Rise and Fall of Empires]]el, the tanks could not be sustained in battle for more than two weeks, and dropped again to low.

It is noteworthy that not a single member of the General Assembly disagreed with their harsh assessments of the Bush-Cheney regime.  I reviewed this book before it was made popular by Chavez, and I will say just two things: 1) order it now, it is worth the wait; and 2) Bush-Cheney may not be interested in reality, but reality is assuredly interested in us.  It's time the public realized that Chomsky, not Bush, is the real deal.<br /><br />Yes, Chomsky tends to be repetitive and to rehash old stuff, so take away one-star.  However, and I say this as the #1 Amazon reviewer of non-fiction about national security, to suggest that Chomsky is ever anything less than four stars is to betray one's ignorance and bias.  He adds new material in this book, and perhaps even more importantly, he delivers this book at a time when America is faced with what may well be its sixth most important turning point in history (after independence, the civil war, two world wars, and the cold war).  How America behaves in the 2004 election is going to determine whether the Republic deteriorates into a quasi-totalitarian and bunkered society with a lost middle class and a gated elite, or whether we restore the world's faith in American goodness, moral capitalism, and inclusive democracy.<br /><br />Chomsky brilliantly brings forth a theme first articulated in recent times by Jonathan Schell ([[ASIN:0805044566 The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People]]) by pointing out that the *only* \\"superpower\\" capable of containing the neo-conservative, neo-totalitarian, neo-Nazi militarism and unilateralism of the current Bush Administration is \\"the planet's public.\\"<br /><br />Chomsky updates his work with both excellent and well-balanced footnotes and an orderly itemization of the arrogance, militarism, contempt for international law, arbitrary aggression, and--Bible thumpers take note--proven track record for supporting dictators, Israeli genocide against Palestinians, and US troop participation in--directly as well as indirectly--what will inevitably be judged by history to be a continuing pattern of war crimes.<br /><br />Chomsky, past master of the topic of \\"manufacturing consent\\" now turns his attention to the manner in which the Bush Administration is attempting to establish \\"new norms\\" that, if permitted to stand, will reverse 50 years of human progress in seeking the legitimization of governance, respect for human rights, and collective decision-making and security.<br /><br />He is especially strong on documenting the manner in which US aid grows in direct relation to the degree to which the recipient country is guilty of genocidal atrocities, with Colombia and Turkey being prime examples.  The case can be made, and Chomsky makes it, that the US arms industry, and US policies on the selling and granting of arms world-wide, are in fact a direct US commitment to repression, genocide, and terrorism sponsored by one big state: the US.  He is most interesting when he discusses the new US approach to repression, the privatization of actions against the underclasses of the world.<br /><br />Morality plays big with Chomsky, who brings new ideas in with his discussion of moral asymmetry and the lack of moral integrity in US decision-making.  Sadly, the US public is too busy trying to survive the abuses of the Bush-Cheney regime, and do not realize the crass immorality of all that is being done \\"in their name.\\"<br /><br />Chomsky reminds us that George Bush the Second pardoned a known international terrorist,  Luis Posada Carriles, because of his ties to the extremist Cuban-American community that his brother Jeb Bush is so dependent upon for support.<br /><br />Over the course of the middle of the book Chomsky addresses the competing models for national development, with Cuba prominent as an alternative model that the US has sought to destroy, as the US worked very hard to destroy Catholic \\"liberation theology\\" because of its temerity in believing that the poor should be protected against repressive governments and their American corporate paymasters.  Chomsky is correct, I believe, when he states and documents that the US model of capitalism has pathologically high rates of inequality and poverty (even CNN has noticed--as I waited for an airplane in Salt Lake City, a bastion of common sense, the lead story was the collapse of the US middle class).<br /><br />Chomsky moves from his discussion of exceptions to US capitalism to a discussion of the importance of regional differentiation, and this is of course in direct competition with the US view that the world should be a homogenized generic variation of the US culture, with one big difference: 80% of the benefits for the US, while the rest of the world shares the left-overs.<br /><br />Chomsky agrees with Dr. Col Max Manwaring and other mainstream strategists (see my review of [[ASIN:0275968634 The Search for Security: A U.S. Grand Strategy for the Twenty-First Century]] when he identifies the legitimacy of governments, and the sanctity of human and civil rights, as the two litmus tests for determining if balance and fairness exist in a society.  By this measure, the US is now failing.<br /><br />The book begins to conclude with a semantic discussion of terrorism, what is terror, who sponsors terror, and here Chomsky draws on both his linguistic and historical background to make the case that the US is the primary sponsor of terrorism in the world (something both the Indonesian and Malaysian leadership would tend to agree with), and he notes that the US, in a bi-partisan manner among the elite, has consistently been hypocritical about terrorism.  Nelson Mandela, and his resistance party, were labeled terrorists by the US for many years.<br /><br />Are we in a passing nightmare, or the beginning of a renaissance?  The jury is still out.  I personally believe that John McCain would have been a vastly superior president that this lightweight bully that we have now, with his out-of-control neo-conservatives, none of whom ever served in uniform and some of whom--as with Dick Cheney--were active draft dodgers.  However, I also believe that both John McCain, and Dick Gephardt if he were to be elected, are too close to the \\"business as usual\\" crowd of beltway politicians capitalized by beltway bandits.  In other words, Howard Dean would not have been possible without the excesses of George Bush Junior.

Although the book very specifically addresses the politics of each group (predominant ideology, 1996 presidential vote, key issues), it lacks the transformation analysis that might be helpful in understanding the political economy dynamics of each group, and what might be required to craft a new national progressive consensus that reduces materialism, corruption, waste, and restores democracy, community, and sustainable national security and prosperity.<br /><br />Regardless of this modest shortfall, this is an extraordinary book, as was the first that I also own ([[ASIN:0060157909 The Clustering of America]]).

It outlines a tale of both corruption and ideological mendacity within the White House, and of ignorance and unprofessionalism with the Directorate of Operations in the Central Intelligence Agency.  As one who served on the Central American Task Force at the time, and as a clandestine case officer focused on these matters, I find it especially fascinating that I, from the inside, was truly unaware of the degree to which we were engaged in direct support to a band of contras characterized by drug-running, money-laundering, corruption, rape, torture, routine murders, and perhaps worse of all, total incompetence and ineffectiveness.<br /><br />There are two aspects of this book that truly stand out for anyone who is committed, as I and most CIA employees are, to the concept that \\"the truth shall make you free.\\"<br /><br />First, as the title suggests, there is a \\"lost history\\" that is unavailable to the American people.  The author is not alone in making this charge.  The editors of the history of the Department of State have on several occasions complained, both publicly and privately, that an accurate history of the foreign relations of the United States of America cannot be written without more complete disclosure of our various covert operations.  Indeed, Derek Leebaert's book [[ASIN:0316164968 The Fifty-Year Wound: How America's Cold War Victory Has Shaped Our World]], Jim Bamford's book [[ASIN:0385499086 Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency]], and Sterling and Peggy Sterling's book [[ASIN:1844675319 Gold Warriors: America's Secret Recovery of Yamashita's Gold]], among a number of others books but these three reviewed by me on Amazon and being the most recent and best documentary efforts, all show that America has paid a *huge* cost, a cost running to trillions of dollars in deceitfully mis-spent dollars and lives, for clandestine and covert activities that have inspired enmity, often nurtured environments of genocide and war crimes (Sudan today, for example, given a \\"bye\\" for its nominal counter-terrorism support), and spawned vast war profiteering enterprises at the same time that we nurture and encourage dictatorships such as those in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, both of which are protecting Bin Laden, his family (which we allowed to escape from the US rather than taking them hostage--a White House accommodation to its Saudi paymasters), and other terrorists.  America needs to understand the truth about such matters, and this book helps.<br /><br />The other major value of this book is its examination of how the White House, first under Reagan and now under Bush junior, and personified in the activities of one Otto Reich (Reich and Rove are exemplar representatives of the neo-Nazi and neo-conservative aspects of the Cheney-Bush regime), has violated various US laws and values by running psychological operations and media campaigns against its own public.  Especially distressing has been the manner in which the National Public Radio (NPR) has been \\"brought to heel\\" by threats to cut off its federal subsidies if it fails to accept the lies of the Administration and actually reports truthfully to the public.  The Associated Press (AP) is also shown in this book to have subverted the truth and conformed to the falsehoods and propaganda line being purveyed by the Reagan Administration against the American people.  The New York Times is specifically cited, on several occasions, and publishing false and misleading information, not because its employees lack ethics (as has recently been the case) but because the NYT is part of the \\"establishment\\" and all too eager to betray its readers by publishing the party line from a corrupt White House.<br /><br />Usefully, the author documents a General Account Office decision on 30 September 1987 that the \\"white propaganda\\" of Otto Reich and the Public Diplomacy Office in the Department of State amounted to \\"prohibited covert propaganda activities\\" against the US media and the US public.  Under Bush Junior the Administration has added blatant lies and manipulated intelligence to its repetoir, and continues to manage covert propaganda against the American people.<br /><br />Among the most interesting sub-themes the author documents are how Richard Nixon undermined the Vietnam peace talks in order to prevent Johnson from successful resolution, and how Reagan's team undermined the Iran hostage negotiations to prevent Jimmy Carter's ability to resolve that in time for the election.  In both cases the Republicans violated the law and engaged in actions that amount to treason--to a betrayal of the public trust.  Now fast forward to the recent stories about how Richard Perle was a principal in the Bush Administration's refusal to accept an offer from Saddam Hussein to help in the war on terrorism, allow full US inspection teams, and otherwise give us everything we wanted except his head and the right to loot Iraq.  American soldiers are dying today--and a bill we cannot pay is being run up--in Iraq because of Republican treason and Republican lies and Republican propaganda against the American people.<br /><br />Another important point that this book documents is the sorry reality that CIA analysts cannot trust the CIA clandestine operators to tell them the full truth, and that the US public cannot trust the White House to tell it the full truth (apart from blatant propaganda).  The truth in America has been subverted, distorted, and *buried*.  As others have documented (see my review of Sheldon Rampton & John Stauber, [[ASIN:1585422762 Weapons of Mass Deception: The Uses of Propaganda in Bush's War on Iraq]]), the American people are, if they are avid searchers for the truth, able to see only 10% of the facts and undistorted information available to Europeans and Asians.<br /><br />The book has some flaws--a rotten index, some repetition caused by integrating old and new material--but I rank it as essential reading for anyone who would like to understand how we got ourselves into an unjust war with Iraq, how an extremist Republican Administration was able to do Goering proud by manipulating the American Congress and the American people and the United Nations with a \\"platform of lies.\\"  We have lost history, we have lost ethics, and we are on the verge of losing America and that for which it stands.<br /><br />Other recommended books, with reviews:<br />[[ASIN:038551445X Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA]]<br />[[ASIN:1888363932 Dark Alliance: The CIA, the Contras, and the Crack Cocaine Explosion]]<br />[[ASIN:0671666371 The Crimes of Patriots: A True Tale of Dope, Dirty Money, and the CIA (Touchstone Books (Paperback))]]<br />[[ASIN:1400065763 Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency]]<br />[[ASIN:140003034X A Pretext for War: 9/11, Iraq, and the  Abuse of America's Intelligence Agencies]]<br />[[ASIN:0930852370 9/11 Synthetic Terror: Made in USA, Fourth Edition]]aganda activities\\" against the US media and the US public.

There are many good people working counter-terrorism at CIA, but they are trapped in a grostesquely malformed enterprise with bad management, bad mindsets, and bad methods.  As one of the first case officers assigned the terrorist target in the 1980's, I recently came across a letter I wrote to the NIO for terrorism (unclassified), and as I went down all the things I said we were doing wrong in the 1980's, what struck me with great sadness was how many of them are still extant today.  While the Director of Central Intelligence may get some satisfaction from sponsoring a silly TV series about a female spy (hint: the most important skill in spying is typing of encounter reports, operational reports, intelligence reports, and expense accounts) and this book, I think his time would be better spent being candid with the American people about all that is wrong with the larger community across all its functions.  This book is a borderline \\"PSYOP\\" on the American people, something CIA is not supposed to be doing.  My bottom line: John Le Carre's fiction is better than this stuff.<br /><br />Better more current books (the first two very positive):<br />[[ASIN:0307351068 Jawbreaker: The Attack on Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda: A Personal Account by the CIA's Key Field Commander]]<br />[[ASIN:0345496612 First In: An Insider's Account of How the CIA Spearheaded the War on Terror in Afghanistan]]<br />[[ASIN:038551445X Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA]]<br />[[ASIN:140004684X See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIA's War on Terrorism]]<br />[[ASIN:1400052688 Sleeping with the Devil: How Washington Sold Our Soul for Saudi Crude]]<br />[[ASIN:0812973380 Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism]]<br />[[ASIN:0930852370 9/11 Synthetic Terror: Made in USA, Fourth Edition]]ry of a Ground Soldier in the CIA's War on Terrorism]]  [[ASIN:1400052688 Sleeping with the Devil: How Washington Sold Our Soul for Saudi Crude]]  [[ASIN:0812973380 Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism]]  [[ASIN:0930852370 9/11 Synthetic Terror: Made in USA, Fourth Edition]]	2003-10-30

Three others that come instantly to mind are those by Jonathan Schell, [[ASIN:0805044566 The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People]], William Greider, [[ASIN:0684862204 The Soul of Capitalism: Opening Paths to a Moral Economy]], and E.O. Wilson, [[ASIN:0679768114 The Future of Life]].<br /><br />This book is not an easy read.  The author, a Professor of Law in the University of Cambridge, wrote an earlier work, [[ASIN:0198255993 Eunomia: New Order for a New World]], that has remained similar obscure, and that is a pity, for what I see here is a truly brilliant mind able to suggest that the Congress of Vienna, the current law of nations, and the de-humanization of state to state relations, isolating the internal affairs and inhumanities of state from global public morality and indignation, are the greatest travesty in human history.<br /><br />The author joins William Greider in suggesting that the state as a corporate personality is as immoral (and irrational in terms of natural law) as is the corporate personality that allows corporations to treat humans as \\"goods.\\"  In this book the author sets out to do nothing less than logically overturn centuries of absolutist amoral power institutionalized by elites in the form of state governments with sovereign rights divorced from and with eminent domain over their subjects (vice citizens), and to propose a new form of globalized human society that restores the human aspect to relations among peoples and among nations of peoples.<br /><br />This is a book that requires patience. It must be slowly and methodically absorbed.  The footnotes are quite extraordinary, as is the summative and explicatory survey of many different literatures over many different historical periods.<br /><br />The author is critical of universities for failing to develop the public mind, and offers a lovely exposition of how sanity, insanity, and public consciousness are all subject to the mythology of capitalism and the manipulation of the elites--in this he would find fellow travelers (smile) in Chomsky and Vidal.  He concludes that diplomacy (and statecraft) as an articulation of the public mind and public interest have *failed*, and looks instead to some sort of social re-ordering from the bottom up.<br /><br />This book, apart from offering an enlightened vision of the law as a living thing able to encapsulate changes morality and changing interests among parties, does nothing less than reconceptualize international relations.  This author is to the law of nations what Vaclav Havel was to communism.<br /><br />He touches on a point Henry Kissinger makes in the last of his books I reviewed ([[ASIN:0684855682 Does America Need a Foreign Policy? : Toward a Diplomacy for the 21st Century]]), and specifically that \\"The risk now facing humanity is the globalizing of the all-powerful, all-consuming social systems, without the moral, legal, political and cultural aspirations and constraints, such as they are, which moderate social action at the national level.\\"  The world, in essence, has become much too complex and much too volatile and much too dangerous for archaic state-level forms of mandarin governance.<br /><br />In the middle of the book, the author's review of how Germany previously collapsed into a patchwork of insignificant nations sounds all too much like the United States of America, where citizenship is losing its value, tyrannical minorities are in isolation from one another (and from reality), and the sense of national identity is too easily captured by a handful of neo-conservatives (modern Nazis).  Interestingly, as with Havel, he notes the importance of art and culture as a means of synthesizing national identity, and would probably agree with E.O. Wilson (\\"Consilience\\") asto the humanities being vital to the context and conduct of the sciences.  His list of national \\"diseases\\" is both disturbing and timely.<br /><br />He joins Jefferson and the founding fathers in focusing on the health and happiness of the people as the ultimate organizing principle (some would translate \\"happiness\\" as \\"fulfillment\\", a more accomplished and less frivolous objective).<br /><br />On page 137 he is quite clear in suggesting that capitalism as it is practiced today, is nothing less than a form of totalitarianism, and he goes on to say on page 139 that social evil is the greatest challenge facing humanity today.  Instead of socializing individuals into the reduced status of \\"goods\\" we should be socializing the state into a representative and general democracy by rehumanizing humanity and rehumanizing the organizations that are supposed to provide collective voice to the people.<br /><br />In following pages the author provides a brilliant catalog of the ills of democracy, reconceptualizes democracy as being based on the rule of law (for all) rather than on who rules (for the benefit of the few), and he explicitly condemns the largely unaccountable forms of concentrated power (by which we take to mean the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, and other devices for perpetuating immoral capitalism irrespective of local needs).<br /><br />The full force of the author's thinking comes into full stride in the concluding portions of the book as he integrates new concepts of international law, history, social relations, and new forms of intergovernmental relations truly representative of the species as a whole and the people as a moral force.  He laments the manner in which an extraordinarily global elite has been able to \\"separate\\" people from morality and from one another, leading to a common acceptance of five intolerable things: 1) unequal social development; 2) war and armaments; 3) governmental oppression; 4) physical degradation; and 5) spiritual degradation.<br /><br />The author concludes by proposing a new view of the human world, and his remarks must be read in the original.  He ends, as do Will and Ariel Durant in their summative \\"The Lessons of History,\\" by noting that the necessary revolution is that which must take place in our minds, not on the streets.\\"<br /><br />This is an utterly brilliant book that has been badly marketed and is grossly under-appreciated, even by the so-called intelligencia.  I recommend it to anyone who wishes to cast off their slave clothes, stop being a drone, and live free.<br /><br />More recent books that fully validate this superb work, with reviews:<br />[[ASIN:0805082840 Failed States: The Abuse of Power and the Assault on Democracy]]<br />[[ASIN:159659098X The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism: How the Financial System Underminded Social Ideals, Damaged Trust in the Markets, Robbed Investors of Trillions - and What to Do About It]]<br />[[ASIN:0312424620 Running on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It]]<br />[[ASIN:1405123583 Global Assemblages: Technology, Politics, and Ethics as Anthropological Problems]]<br />[[ASIN:0872864758 A Power Governments Cannot Suppress]]sciences.

It is the equal of Franken's and Moore's books, but lacks any sort of footnotes or bibliography while helpfully including an index for looking up specifics.  In combination with the first two books mentioned, and William Greider's earlier and most serious &quot;Who Will Tell the People&quot; as well as his most recent block-buster, &quot;The Soul of Capitalism&quot; (about immoral capitalism and why this leads the rest of the world to fear and hate us), as well as &quot;Weapons of Mass Deception,&quot; this book rounds out a very satisfactory public case for sending the current Administration back to the holes they crawled out of.	2003-10-28

This is a major theme within Jonathan Schell's utterly brilliant and comprehensive book, \\"The Unconquerable World\\" and one that any future Director of Central Intelligence must be held accountable for: warning in the *non-violent* stage.<br /><br />Fourth, the author's, who between them have considerable expertise in defense analysis, indict the Clinton Administration for over-selling the peace negotiation efforts of Ambassador Holbrook, and the very bad campaign planning of General Clark.<br /><br />Fifth, the author's document the pattern of Madame Secretary Albright, whose own book I recently reviewed along these lines, of rhetoric rather than reality--or words rather than actions with consequences.  NATO bluffed while Madeline talked.  Milosevic, no fool, understood all this.  Albright is, however, credited with understanding that ultimately force would be needed to achieve the policy objectives.<br /><br />Sixth, and this is something I learned the hard way in El Salvador, the author's very correctly make the point that such conflicts cannot be controlled with pressure on only one of the belligerents.  *Both* parties to the conflict must be challenged and contained.<br /><br />Seventh, the author's are helpful in pointing out that the Administration erred in failing to consider partition and independence as an option for the conflicted parties, and they emphasize that one must never under-estimate the will of any one party to achieve independence.<br /><br />Eighth, and on the head of the Republicans we place this one, the authors point out thatthe impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton because of his personal relations with Monica Lewinsky severely distracted and handicapped the Administration.  Indeed, I recall that in all our Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) reports at the time, we had to modify all of our search strategies to include \\"and not Monica\\", so over-whelming was the trash that would come up on Bosnia and other places we were looking at, all \\"hits\\" corrupted unless we excluded the Monica factor from US foreign policy.  The lesson we take from this is that impeachment, especially frivolous impeachment, has major national security consequences, and is not merely a matter for domestic consumption or impact assessment.<br /><br />The book is flawed, but not grievously, for failing to have any serious treatment of intelligence.  There are just four over-lapping references to CIA, and to intelligence reports, in the entire book.  In as much as this book is up to the norm for beltway policy books, we conclude that until such books have the deeper coverage and understanding of intelligence shortfalls as a matter of routine, intelligence and policy in Washington DC will continue to co-exist without reform and with a deliberate choice being made by policy experts to ignore intelligence and what intelligence, properly done, can bring to the process of peacemaking.<br /><br />The author's final policy recommendation merit listing, and their elaboration is a highlight of the book:<br />1) Interventions should occur as early as possible<br />2) Coercive diplomacy requires a credible threat of force<br />3) When force is used, military means must relate to political ends<br />4) Airpower alone usually cannot stop the killing in civil wars<br />5) The Powell Doctrine for the use of force remains valid<br />6) Humanitarian interventions need realistic goals<br />7) Exit strategies are desirable but not always essential<br />8) Other countries need better, more deployable militaries<br />9) UN authorization for intervention is highly desirable, even if it is not required<br />10) Russia's support is valuable in these types of operations<br />11) NATO works well in peace and in war but only if US leads<br />12) An effective foreign policy requires that the president lead with confidence.<br />13) The US is not a hyperpower, but rather a superpower prone to *underachievement* instead of imperial ambition (this was pre-Bush and pre-neocon)<br /><br />This book stands as the core reference on NATO and Kosovo, and as one of the more helpful references on principles of intervention and foreign policy that all future presidents and their staff can learn from.<br /><br />Other more recent books I recommend, with reviews:<br />[[ASIN:0805044566 The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People]]<br />[[ASIN:0805077979 The Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire Project)]]<br />[[ASIN:0805082840 Failed States: The Abuse of Power and the Assault on Democracy]]<br />[[ASIN:0742532550 Breaking the Real Axis of Evil: How to Oust the World's Last Dictators by 2025]]<br />[[ASIN:0195160894 Faith-Based Diplomacy: Trumping Realpolitik]]<br />[[ASIN:0922915865 War Is a Racket: The Anti-War Classic by America's Most Decorated General, Two Other Anti=Interventionist Tracts, and Photographs from the Horror of It]]l relations with Monica Lewinsky severely distracted and handicapped the Administration.

Madame Secretary will never be confused with Henry Kissinger or Zbigniew Brzezinski.  It merits comment that Hillary appears to have had a great deal to do with Albright getting the job.  If you want a read that covers the years superficially, and glosses over a great deal of what actually did or did not transpire, this is the book for you.  If you want serious reading about international relations, or grand strategy, or how to deal with the twenty big problems facing the world, see the other books I have reviewed for Amazon, including Joe Nye, Kissinger, Boren et al, Jonathan Schell, Shultz et al, E.O. Wilson, J. F. Rischard, and so on.  Half the book is about the personal path to power, the other half is about very narrow slices of what the Clinton Administration chose to focus on--an administration where foreign policy and national security were largely on automatic pilot and very much in a back seat compared to domestic matters.<br />Most troubling to me is the chapter on terrorism, chapter 22, titled \\"A Special Kind of Evil.\\"  In exactly 17 pages (.03 of 512 text pages), Albright manages to gloss over the fact that she deliberately and repeatedly sided with Sandy Burger in constantly suppressing intelligence that warned suicidal terrorism was on the rise, and took a back seat--or no seat--on the subject of devising a national grand strategy for counter-terrorism.  She is proudest of getting $1 billion for turning our Embassies into bunkers, something 9-11 demonstrated to be inconsequential.<br />She says \\"The response by the Clinton administration to the Africa embassy bombings and other attacks on our watch resulted in the apprehension of many terrorist suspects and established a strong precedent for international cooperation in fighting terror.\\"  This is absolute and utter baloney.  The reality is that neither the CIA nor the FBI or any foreign governments were actually put on a war footing, because the Clinton's did not want to dim the lights and bear down.<br />I find it quite noteworthy that \\"intelligence\\" does not appear in the index as a term.  This is a book about travel and personal meetings, which is how Clinton's national security team spent its time.  We have gone from that extreme to the other, of neo-conservatives who never served in uniform throwing military force around unilaterally and indiscriminately.<br />The next president must find a middle ground, an informed middle ground where intelligence, strategy, policy and spending (\\"it's not policy until it's in the budget\\") are fully integrated, and America is able to devise a sustainable, strong, smart foreign policy that includes a robust homeland defense with homeland counterintelligence, a massive peace force, a considerable global constabulary force, and a big war force sufficient for two major regional conflicts at once.  We cannot cut the national security budget by one penny, but by golly, we can do a *lot\\" better than either the passive Clintonians or the psychopathic Bushies.n a war footing, because the Clinton's did not want to dim the lights and bear down.<br />I find it quite noteworthy that \\"intelligence\\" does not appear in the index as a term.

He is America's Lawrence of Arabia and a brilliant intelligence analyst, especially on non-conventional threats.  In this book (actually, a collection of clippings, most from the New York Post, which says something right off), he goes a bridge too far--on the one hand, he and his mentor, General McCaffrey) go several bridges too far in their praise for the \\"courageous\\" strategy of the Bush Administration (it's not a strategy, it's a mindless vendetta bought and paid for by Zionists), and on the other, he applies his superb mind to the realities of our global conflict with radicalized Islam.<br /><br />The book is full of gems.  I've said he is a soldier-poet before, and this book continues that tradition.  The flashes of brilliance demand the purchase and reading of this book.<br /><br />His most important point, one that merits its own book, is that America has misplaced its priorities in attacking radical Islam through Iraq (and passivity toward Saudi Arabia's sponsorship of terrorism, a neglect that will cost vastly more than the Iraq misadventure), and that it is the Muslim \\"outlands\\" from Central Asia to Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and India (with the second largest Muslim population in the world after Indonesia) where America would be elevating women, nurturing secular states, and spreading the gospel of peace and prosperity.<br /><br />The author takes the long-view, at least a 50-year view, and this is in sharp contrast to the \\"quick win at any cost (to the future)\\" of the current Administration.  Indeed, when the author describes bin Laden as \\"ultimately a blasphemer against his own religion, having appointed himself God's instrument upon earth, assuming the license to kill by the tens or tens of thousands those who do not share his vision, to purge, to punish, to sanctify,\\" the author is in fact describing George W. Bush, not just bin Laden.<br /><br />The author overcomes the limitation of New York Post hyperbole in many of his pieces.  Among the most interesting is one on the five socio-psychological pools from which terrorists draw their membership: underclass, \\"course of conflict\\" joiners, opportunists, hardcore believers, and mercenaries.  Also helpful is his coverage of monotheist cultures, including a subtle reference to neo-conservatism aligned with Zionism as a rising monotheist culture potentially capable of undermining American democracy and religious tolerance.<br /><br />Deep in the middle of the book we find his discussion of a world divided into three strategic zones, apart from North America: the monotheist zone centered in the eastern Mediterranean; the Sino-Verdic(Indian) zone; and the postcolonial zone of Africa and Latin America.  His discussion cannot be summarized and contains many brilliant insights, including a conclusion that China is not a regional threat, and China's greatest variable is not its external ambition but rather its potential for internal implosion.  He is provocative in envisioning a huge \\"Afro-Latino-American\\" triangle of power emerging, with Brazil, South Africa, and the USA as the potential engines for this renaissance of the Southern Hemisphere.<br /><br />The author joins Robert Baer, whose book [[ASIN:1400052688 Sleeping with the Devil: How Washington Sold Our Soul for Saudi Crude]] in calling for a complete withdrawal of US support for the despotic and sleazy Saudi regime that blatantly continues to support global terrorism and the radicalization of Muslim youth.<br /><br />Where Ralph Peters falls short, I believe, and I say this with the utmost respect for this warrior-scholar who has placed his life on the line more than once, is in allowing his ultra-patriotism to shut out the discordant and sometimes dissenting view of other patriots who are perhaps more willing than he to acknowledge that we ourselves are part of the problem.  This book is a one-man opinion piece with no reference to other works, such as those by Jonathan Schell [[ASIN:0805044574 The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People]],  Mark Hertsgaard [[ASIN:0312422504 The Eagle's Shadow: Why America Fascinates and Infuriates the World]], or Michael Hirsh [[ASIN:0195176022 At War with Ourselves: Why America Is Squandering Its Chance to Build a Better World]], among the many other national security books I have reviewed here at Amazon.  It falls prey, therefore, to the over-powering tuba effect, and loses some of its gloss in being so strident and so unabashedly \\"grind the bastards down, we are the light\\"--but then, we acknowledge that he was writing originally for the New York Post.<br /><br />The author gets some big things right: Bill Clinton, Madeline Albright, and Sandy Berger have much to answer for in their deliberate avoidance of the reality of terrorism and their failure to go to a war-footing as both Dick Clarke and George Tenet, among others, advised.  He also gets some things wrong.  He is wrong, for example, when he speaks on page 166 of Islam's failure to generate a single healthy state, to that we answer: Malaysia.  He is half-right when he half-bakes the French, who welcome different dictators to their bosoms for different reasons, while opposing American unilateralism, and he is half-right when he dismisses all of the anti-war voices as ill-considered and cowardly.  He is largely wrong in dismissing \\"Old Europe\\" as a voice of reason, and he is mostly wrong in assuming that all is right with U.S. intelligence and that everything U.S. intelligence produces is reliable.  I realize he is writing hyperbole for the public and knows better, but the book must be judged on its substance.<br /><br />To end on a most positive note, Ralph Peters is completely utterly correct when he points out that America has, in the past 20 years, surrendered the battlefield to our non-state enemies in advance, for lack of attention and insight and will.  Ralph is one of perhaps ten people I listen to with rapt attention--his voice, when integrated with the voices of others with different perspectives, is a lifeline to reality, a voice we ignore at our peril.<br /><br />See also:<br />[[ASIN:0307277968 Blind Into Baghdad: America's War in Iraq (Vintage)]]<br />[[ASIN:140003034X A Pretext for War: 9/11, Iraq, and the  Abuse of America's Intelligence Agencies]]<br />[[ASIN:0743234359 American Jihad: The Terrorists Living Among Us]]<br />[[ASIN:0385514727 While Europe Slept: How Radical Islam is Destroying the West from Within]]<br />[[ASIN:074325029X How Israel Lost: The Four Questions]]<br />[[ASIN:0805077979 The Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire Project)]]se by Jonathan Schell [[ASIN:0805044574 The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People]],  Mark Hertsgaard [[ASIN:0312422504 The Eagle's Shadow: Why America Fascinates and Infuriates the World]], or Michael Hirsh [[ASIN:0195176022 At War with Ourselves: Why America Is Squandering Its Chance to Build a Better World]], among the many other national security books I have reviewed here at Amazon.

So controversial and potentially explosive are the findings of this book, to wit, that the White House recovered most of the Nazi and Japanese loot and created a secret slush fund for covert political operations world-wide, that the authors go the extra mile and offer, at a nominal price, two CD-ROMS containing 60,000 pages of supporting documentation including the Japanese treasure maps used by the US to recover the gold and other valuables.<br />Major players include Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, and Nixon, both Allen and John Foster Dulles, Douglas MacArthur, John McCloy, and the famous unconventional warrior Edward Lansdale.  What we learn from this book is that those writing about \\"blowback\\" (the consequences of unwise US actions) have barely scratched the surface.  What we learn is that rather than truly seeking to help the Japanese, Chinese, and other looted nations recover in the aftermath of WWII, the most senior leaders of the US government, no doubt with the best of intentions, actually conspired with Nazi bankers and the Japanese imperial family to create a Black Eagle Trust controlled by a very select hand-picked cabal in Washington.<br />Originally used to fight communism, the Black Eagle Trust, according to the authors and as thoroughly documented by the book and the two CD-ROMS (which I am happy to have in hand), quickly became a global slush fund used to bribe national leaders and manipulate elections around the world.  This fund remains in existence today, making the Swiss Holocaust funds seem like loose-change.  According to the authors, major banks are \\"addicted\\" to the funds and would face collapse if public investigations resulted in a forced return of this gold and related certificates to the rightful owners.<br />The authors have produced a magnificent work of both scholarship and investigative journalism.  They document the extent of Japanese looting of Korea (beginning in 1895) and China as well as the other countries in the \\"co-prosperity sphere.\\"  They document the manner in which Japan hid most of the gold in the Philippines (some in Indonesia), and were forced to leave it there from 1943 onwards, when US submarine interdiction became too effective to risk shipments homeward.<br />I found the level of detail in this book to be quite gripping.  The ingenious nature of the Japanese burial sites, with caverns below the more obvious tunnels, with sea-water protection, with maps created in reverse--and the in-bred cruelty of the Japanese, thinking nothing of burying all of the US and other national slave labor *and the Japanese engineers* alive as the final stage of protecting the looted treasure, leave one stunned.<br />The authors document the central role played by Lansdale in recognizing the opportunity and then briefing MacArthur and then President Truman.  According to the authors, the architects of the Black Eagle Trust were three advisors to President's Roosevelt's Secretary of War, Henry Stimson: John McCloy (later head of the World Bank), Robert Lovett (later Secretary of Defense), and Robert Anderson (later Secretary of the Treasury).  They made the case to Roosevelt, and presumably to Truman after Roosevelt died, that it would be impractical to return the looted gold to the rightful owners, in part because many of the looted countries were now under Soviet control.<br />The authors, who conducted many interviews in support of the work, including interviews of former CIA deputy director Ray Cline, who they say was involved with Lansdale and the gold in the 1940's and remained involved with the black gold through the 1980's, provide copies of documents showing the redirection of the looted gold to 176 bank accounts in 42 countries.  The gold was then used to support the creation of gold bearer certificates that were in turned used to bribe the most senior officials around the world.<br />The authors tell a shocking tale of how quickly MacArthur chose to collaborate with the very leadership of Japan that declared war on the USA and was responsible for genocide and looting in Asia on a scale rarely achieved by anyone else.  Bringing the story up to date, the authors show how prior attempts to investigate the Black Eagle Trust have led to the ruin of individuals such as Norbert Schlei, at one time deputy attorney general to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson.  While I have no direct knowledge and cannot be certain myself, I believe the authors have provided a sufficiently compelling case to warrant an international investigation concurrently with a General Accounting Office investigation to be chartered by Congress with unlimited supeona powers specifically directed against classified personalities and archives.<br />If this story is true, and I personally think that it is, then the US government, in active collusion with the very people the American people fought to defeat in WWII, has been guilty of fraud and depravity on a global scale and against the best interests of both the American people, and the against the rightful owners of the looted gold and other treasures.  The authors may well have uncovered the last really big secret of the post-WW II era, and in so doing, opened the way for a restoration of the balance of power among diverse nations, and a sharp delimitation of the abuses that appear to characterize American leadership when it thinks it can rely on secret gold and stolen oil to engage in imperial adventures and domestic improprieties.  As an American citizen and voter, and as a person of faith who believes that we must do unto others as we would have them do unto us, I find this book to be shocking, credible, and a basis for popular outrage and demands for truth and reconciliation.s around the world.<br />The authors tell a shocking tale of how quickly MacArthur chose to collaborate with the very leadership of Japan that declared war on the USA and was responsible for genocide and looting in Asia on a scale rarely achieved by anyone else.

The ability of this individual and this organization to acquire and then exploit Russian, Chinese, and other third-nation source material has made them the single most important geospatial entity in the world after the National Imagery and Mapping Agency.<br />Every page is clearly printed and the maps, all in color, are extraordinary.  The fine print can be a burden if you have to read more than a few sections at a time, but was a necessity--the book would not be easily portable otherwise.<br />I understand that similar books are in the works for Iraq and other countries where terrain analysis is a vital element of reducing costs and increasing profits and operational successes.

An American, who would never have received the kind of direct official support provided to the author by the government of The Netherlands, could not have written it.<br />This is the only book that I know of that fully integrates deliberate studies of UN intelligence; Western and NATO intelligence (which the author correctly notes does not exist); Dutch intelligence; and belligerent party intelligence.<br />Several recurring themes of lasting value emerged from my reading of this book:<br />1) The UN is dangerously devoid of intelligence qua decision-support.  The culture of the UN leadership, the UN bureaucracy, and the UN delegates is one that places a higher priority on the semblance--the mockery--of lip service to open sources and legal methods, while sacrificing the lives of UN forces in the field.  One cannot read this book, and its superb documentation of how UN Force Commander after UN Force Commander pleaded for intelligence support, only to be told no by the staff in New York, without becoming very angry.  This book makes it perfectly clear that the UN leadership failed the Croats, the Serbs, and the international peacekeepers, in every possible way.  Toward the end of the book the author also focuses on the UN as a source for the belligerents, i.e. UN incapacity for operational security and secure communications in fact makes it a primary source for belligerents seeking to kill one another.<br />2) The West failed in Bosnia in part because it became over-reliant on technical intelligence (which it could not process or analyze with sufficient speed and reliability), and did not have adequate numbers of competent clandestine Human Intelligence (HUMINT) or even ground-truth observers in the region.  A contributing source of failure was the evidently deliberate decision on the part of the Clinton White House to downplay the conflict and to withhold such intelligence warning as they did have from the UN, in the misplaced belief that sharing such information would interfere with the peace process.  Tens of thousands died because of Clinton White House irresponsibility.<br />3) Intelligence &quot;liaison&quot; or structured sharing across national boundaries, was an ungodly mess made worse by the inherent biases and rose-colored glasses worn by the Americans and the British on one side, and the French and the Germans on the other.  &quot;Wishful thinking&quot; by policy makers interfered with proper assessments of the relative condition and intentions of the various belligerents.<br />4) The CIA clandestine endeavor was split, with one Station operating out of Sarajevo and another out of Zagreb, and no overall coordination or integration of sources and reports.<br />5) Civil Affairs (CA) as a military occupational specialty is blown forever by CIA Directorate of Operations (DO) abuses, most without the permission of the U.S. European theater commander.  CIA/DO managers should be disciplined for this breach of internal US government protocols.<br />6) The Dutch were not ready to field a major operational or tactical intelligence support architecture, and in-fighting among various elements prevented the various analysts from making the most of what little they could glean from varied sources.  The same was actually true of all Western intelligence communities--all had other priorities and too few resources [although language deficiencies are not emphasized by the author, one presumed a grotesque lack of required competencies across the Croat and Serb dialects as well as Yugoslavian, Turkish, and Arabic].  In the view of a senior officer whose quotations close Chapter 3, heads should be rolling for dereliction of duty--although the subject refers only to the Dutch, the reviewer would add US and British heads as well.<br />7) The book excels--is remarkable and perhaps unique--for its discussion of the secret arms supplies--not only the routes, the providers, the landing zone delivery means--butthe active violation by the US of the embargo, and the active role of US Special Forces in violating the embargo without a covert action &quot;finding&quot;, and hence also in violation of US law.  Other nations were equally at fault.  It is clear from the book that the UN needs not only operational and tactical intelligence for the specific area of operations, but an extended intelligence and operational capability sufficient to *interdict* incoming arms to the belligerents.  This book may well be the single best reference on this topic.<br />8) The sections of the book on signals and imagery intelligence are a work of art, combining historical scholarship with original research and a very fine tutorial aspect.  The listing of the 11 disadvantages of SIGINT (pages 224-228) is the finest I have ever seen.  The bottom line in both instances is: too much collection, too little processing and analysis.  The author uses a remarkable quote from a former Director of the National Security Agency to make this point: good news is that we can exploit a million messages a day; bad news is that we don't know which million out of the billions we capture to do...  Also interesting is the detailed accounting of belligerent party competencies in SIGINT and IMINT, to include the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and advanced methods.<br />9)  The book ends with two notes that I choose to emphasize, although the author makes many valuable observations in his conclusions that I will not repeat here:  first, support to UN operations was the *fifth* priority for Western intelligence, coming after force protection, after ground truth observation, after support for air targeting, and after support for NATO ground troop planning; and second, Doctors Without Borders, a non-governmental organization, was the *only* entity to get true validated warning of the Srebrenica genocide.<br />The index is terrible-names only.  Properly indexing the book for references to all intelligence sources and methods as well as events and practices, would make it 2X to 3X more valuable as a basic reference.<br />This book is highly recommended and a &quot;must have&quot; for every national security and international affairs library, and for every professional interested in peacekeeping intelligence.eans--but the active violation by the US of the embargo, and the active role of US Special Forces in violating the embargo without a covert action &quot;finding&quot;, and hence also in violation of US law.

His \\"MOSQINT\\" lectures draw packed houses of professional intelligence officers from over 40 countries.<br /><br />The book is a hard read, but if one desires to understand the murky inter-relationships among the *governments* of Pakistan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, among others, the businesses and charities working actively to channel government and private funds to terrorists, and the global loosely-knit network of \\"fellow travelers\\" and jihadists, then this book is \\"Ref A.\\"<br /><br />In my personal view, the author is a bit over the top in trying to link Iraq to bin Laden.  This reminds of the Claire Sterling-Ollie North school of \\"anything goes\\" as long as you believe it.  Having said that (and so has Vaclav Havel, President of Czechoslovakia, who personally dismissed a lie consistently told by the Bush Administration about a meeting in Prague between a terrorist known by the FBI to have been in Florida at the time, and an Iraqi intelligence officer), I give the book very high marks in all other respects.<br /><br />The Conclusion, appropriately Chapter 13, is titled \\"What Next.\\"  The book is worthy of purchase and recurring reference for this chapter alone.  Especially troubling is the documentation of how many terrorists are moving around the world on legitimate passports from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Turkey, Kuwait, Algeria, Albania, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, and other countries.  The book adds confirmation to the many other references I have seen (many posted to OSS.Net news and reference section) regarding the active involvement of the Pakistani intelligence service in funding and training and facilitating travel for bin Laden personally, for his top lieutenants, and for terrorists in general.<br /><br />The author's focus in the conclusion on the potential for Central Asia (all former khanates, all Muslim, all angry separatists from the Soviet Union) is especially interesting, as we see the beginnings of a \\"third front\\" there, with India-Pakistan being a fourth front, and South Asia a fifth front.  Latin America and Africa are the sixth front.  In brief, the author is one of those documenting the depth and scope of a global terrorism threat that the Bush Administration has unwisely chosen to attack with conventional military means, on six different fronts, none of which is sustainable in the medium or long term.<br /><br />The author anticipated terrorist attacks against the UN and NATO when he discusses, on page 403, the Muslim declarations that include the UN and NATO in the fatwas against the USA, because the Muslim world \\"is being deceived by [these organizations], because they are hostile to Muslims and are responsible for all the massacres being perpetrated against Muslims in Afghanistan, Lebanon, Palestine, Albania, and Kosovo.\\"  The UN in Iraq has been hit twice.  I expect NATO in Afghanistan to be hit several times between now and the end of 2003, and I expect US special forces units to be massacred in detail in Afghanistan, the Philippines, and Indonesia.<br /><br />Bin Laden, dead or alive.  Right.  Bin Laden could not, in his wildest prayers to Allah, have imagined a better partner for fostering terrorism around the world than hip-shooting cowboy and unilateralist George W. Bush.  Bin Laden created a global system of terrorism, the fire if you will, and George W. Bush and his neo-conservatives are blindly pouring $250 billion worth of tax-payer funded gasoline on that fire.<br /><br />The author has recently been the recipient of the Golden Candle Award from the international open source intelligence committee.  His citation reads:<br /><br />\\"For his global multi-lingual open source investigations into terrorism, and his extraordinary professional achievement in writing and publishing \\"BIN LADEN: The Man Who Declared War on America\\", years before the 9-11 World Trade Center demonstration of what well-funded suicidal terrorism can achieve when intelligence and policy both fail to focus on the threat.\\"<br /><br />Whatever research or opinion flaws might be contained in this book, it is an essential reference in understanding both the dangers of terrorism, and the futility of the current US \\"strategy\\" for defeating terrorism by hammering and then abandoning Afghanistan and Iraq.<br /><br />More recent books relevant to this one:<br />[[ASIN:1400030846 The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11 (Vintage)]]<br />[[ASIN:B000R33QW4 The Osama bin Laden I Know: An Oral History of al Qaeda's Leader]]<br />[[ASIN:0930852370 9/11 Synthetic Terror: Made in USA, Fourth Edition]]<br />[[ASIN:0812973380 Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism]]<br />[[ASIN:1400065763 Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency]]<br />[[ASIN:081170274X Wars of Blood and Faith: The Conflicts That Will Shape the 21st Century]]<br />[[ASIN:0143038915 Fiasco: The American Military Adventure in Iraq]]his global multi-lingual open source investigations into terrorism, and his extraordinary professional achievement in writing and publishing \\"BIN LADEN: The Man Who Declared War on America\\", years before the 9-11 World Trade Center demonstration of what well-funded suicidal terrorism can achieve when intelligence and policy both fail to focus on the threat.\\"    Whatever research or opinion flaws might be contained in this book, it is an essential reference in understanding both the dangers of terrorism, and the futility of the current US \\"strategy\\" for defeating terrorism by hammering and then abandoning Afghanistan and Iraq.

The author crafts a viable proposition for thinking really big and coming to grips, in time to avert the looming disaster of the baby boomer pensions and the collapse of health care and education, with the four biggest issues threatening the national security and prosperity of the United States of America: universal health care; equal education for all, a living wage for all, and sustainable reliable pensions for all.<br /><br />He sums it up in a gripping fashion: if we don't fund smart well-educated kids across the entire country, then we will not have the productivity we need to expand our pension funds and care for the boomers when they hit retirement.  Smart kids now, safe retirement for today's adults.  Any questions?<br /><br />He is candidly (but politely) blunt when he states, and then documents, that both the Republican and Democratic party leaders (less Howard Dean) are lying to us about the answers that are possible (Prologue, page xiii).  His book is an earnest--and in my judgement, hugely successful--attempt to create what the author calls an \\"ideologically androgynous\\" agenda for achieving social and economic justice in America with a commitment of just two cents on the tax-revenue dollar.<br /><br />On the issue of teaching, he documents the \\"teacher gap\\" as one of the primary reasons for varying levels of performance--a gap that is more important than genetics or environment, and that is also resolvable by sound educational policy and funding.  He brutally undresses both the Bush Administration, which is leaving every child behind, and the Democrats, who are \\"more symbol than cure.\\"  Republican hypocrisy and Democratic timidity receive an equal thrashing.<br /><br />On living wages, he documents the 25 million that are not covered; on pensions he documents the coming collapse of Social Security and other \\"off budget\\" and unprotected funds.<br /><br />He provides four reasons why we have a dysfunctional debate (and one can surmise: why we need to change the Presidential election process in order to achieve truly open and substantive debates): 1) paralysis from political party parity; 2) old mind-sets and habits shared by *both* Republican and Democratic leaders (less Governor Dean); 3) the failure of the national press to be serious and critical and to contribute to the debates; and 4) the tyranny of charades funded by political contributions.<br /><br />The book includes an excellent and understandable review of both economic and social justice theory.  Of special interest is the author's discussion of the Rawls Rule for social justice, which is to imagine everyone in an \\"original position\\" behind a veil of ignorance where no one knows what their luck will be in the future--the design of the social safety net should provide for the amelioration of any injustice that might befall anyone, and a social promotion system that prevents wealth concentrations that are not beneficial to the larger society--to wit, we must \\"set some limits on the power of luck to deform human lives.\\"<br /><br />The author concludes the book by suggesting that the public is ready for a revolution in U.S. political economic affairs, and in so doing points out how ill-served the U.S. public is by surveys that confuse myopia with honesty--surveys that ask generic questions without revealing the scope of the problem (40 million affected, etc.) with the result that the public is not informed of the depth of the problem--or, as the author suggests--they would *want to do something about it.\\"<br /><br />This is a sensible, heartening book.  It is a book that gives hope for the future and that displays a proper respect for the good intentions and ability to think of the average citizen.  It is a book that, if adopted by any Presidential candidate--or by all of them--could radically alter the public debates that lie before the public in the period leading up to the 2004 election.  Every American should read this book and the four books cited above.  If Thomas Jefferson was correct when he said, \\"A Nation's best defense is an educated citizenry,\\" then Matthew Miller just became the first tutor to the new Nation.<br /><br />New Comment: Between a Tobin tax on every Federal Reserve transaction, an end of income taxes on individuals, and this author's idea, I am quite certain that we can find and apply a trillion a year against global and domestic high-level threats from poverty to transnational crime, while winding down the military, secret intelligence, prison, and hospital complexes.

964876:US	50761804	RJXRFWN9DKHB4	0393058506	904288157	The Great Unraveling: Losing Our Way in the New Century	Books	4	110	116	N	N	Read Preface and Introduction, Skip the Rest	Edit of 21 Dec 07 to add comment and links.<br /><br />New Comment: the author was ahead of his time.  See new links below.<br /><br />The book is worth buying for the Preface and Introduction alone.  The rest of the book is a somewhat irritating replay of every column the author has ever written, and not nearly as well done or as riveting as, say, Tom Friedman's replays in \\"Longitudes & Attitudes\\".  However, if you have not read the author's columns, his bite-size descriptions of irrational exuberance, crony capitalism, the failure of the Federal Reserve, fuzzy math, how markets go bad, and global spoilage, then they are all certainly worth browsing.<br /><br />The Preface has three core ideas: 1) the elites are ruling badly and not beneficially for the majority of the population including all the voters and most of the stockholders; 2) politicians and corporation chiefs are getting away with blatant lies to the public because of a media that avoids critical inquiry; and 3) open sources of information--all that lies in the public domain--are more than adequate for anyone to get a grip on reality.<br /><br />The Introduction is a bit scarier and more pointed.  The author joins Mark Hertsgaard, author of [[ASIN:0312422504 The Eagle's Shadow: Why America Fascinates and Infuriates the World]] in suggesting that the radical right is creating nothing less than a Reichstag in America.  In the author's view, and he quotes Kissinger in chilling terms, the radical right is a revolutionary power that is very deliberately and with malice at all  times, rejecting and undermining the democratic rules of the game.  In the author's words, the radical right is \\"a movement whose leaders do not accept the legitimacy of our current political system.\\"  The author goes so far as to suggest that the radical right considers elections as \\"only a formality\\" and that they will do anything--including subversion of the Constitution--to \\"win\\" those elections and reap the domestic and foreign \\"looting rights.\\"<br /><br />Disclosure: I used to be a conservative Republican and used to think such ideas were simply over the top.  I have been radicalized by the last 200 books I have read (and reviewed on Amazon) and I have to say, while the third of the nation that is close-minded and ideologically-blindered on the right may give the author short shrift, the other two thirds--the drop-outs and splinter parties, and the failing Democrats--they should take Krugman very seriously.  He is an economist, teaching at Princeton, not a journalist nor a sensationalist, and in my view, when one combines his book with that of Clyde Prestowitz, a Presbyterian elder and solid Reagan Republican and fiscal conservative ([[ASIN:B000A1ETWO Rogue Nation: American Unilateralism and the Failure of Good Intentions]]), with that of William Greider, writing on the immorality and social costs of capitalism as we practice it today ([[ASIN:0684862204 The Soul of Capitalism: Opening Paths to a Moral Economy]]), one can only conclude that the Republic, and that for which it stands, have been hijacked, are being looted, and the American Democratic experiment is on very thin ice.<br /><br />The index to this book is helpful in running down specific individuals, corporation, and organizations that have committed crimes against the Nation that the author has addressed in his many columns for the New York Times, as repeated in this book.<br /><br />See also:<br />[[ASIN:159659098X The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism: How the Financial System Underminded Social Ideals, Damaged Trust in the Markets, Robbed Investors of Trillions - and What to Do About It]]<br />[[ASIN:1400065763 Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency]]<br />[[ASIN:0312424620 Running on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It]]<br />[[ASIN:0470098287 The Global Class War: How America's Bipartisan Elite Lost Our Future - and What It Will Take to Win It Back]]<br />[[ASIN:0312376960 Day of Reckoning: How Hubris, Ideology, and Greed Are Tearing America Apart]]Ideology, and Greed Are Tearing America Apart]]	2003-09-24

His bottom line: that the separation of church and state, and the divorce of social responsibility from both state and corporate actions, have so corrupted the political and economic governance architectures as to make them pathologically dangerous.<br /><br />His entire book discusses how people can come together, non-violently, to restore both their power over capital and over circumstances, and the social meaning and values that have been abandoned by \\"objective\\" corporations and governments.<br /><br />The book has applicability to Iraq, Afghanistan, and other places where the US is foolishly confusing military power with political power.  As he says early on, it is the public *will* that must be gained, the public *consent* to a new order--in the absence of this, which certainly does not exist in either Iraq or Afghanistan, no amount of military power will be effective (to which I would add: and the cumulative effect of the financial and social cost of these military interventions without end will have a reverse political, economic, and social cost on the invader that may make the military action a self-inflicted wound of great proportions).<br /><br />Across the book, the author examines three prevailing models for global relations: the universal empire model, the balance of power model, and the collective security model.  He comes down overwhelmingly on the side of the latter as the only viable approach to current and future global stability and prosperity.<br /><br />A quote from the middle of the book captures its thesis perfectly: \\"Violence is a method by which the ruthless few can subdue the passive many.  Nonviolence is a means by which the active many can overcome the ruthless few.\\"<br /><br />Taking off from the above, the author elaborates on three sub-themes:<br /><br />First, that cooperative power is much greater, less expensive, and more lasting that coercive power.<br /><br />Second, that capitalism today is a scourge on humanity, inflicting far greater damage--deaths, disease, poverty, etcetera--that military power, even the \\"shock and awe\\" power unleashed against Afghanistan and Iraq without public debate.<br /><br />Third, and he draws heavily on Hannah Arendt, here a quote that should shame the current US Administration because it is so contradictory to their belief in \\"noble lies\\"--lies that Hitler and Goering would have admired.  She says, \\"Power is actualized only where word and deed have not parted company, where words are not empty and deeds not brutal, where words are not used to veil intentions but to disclose realities, and deeds are not used to violate and destroy but to establish relations and create new realities.\\"<br /><br />Toward the end of the book the author addresses the dysfunctionality of the current \\"absolute sovereignty\\" model and concludes that in an era of globalization, not only must the US respect regional and international sovereignty as an over-lapping authority, but that we must (as Richard Falk recommended in the 1970's) begin to recognize people's or nations as distinct entities with culturally-sovereign rights that over-lap the states within which the people's reside--this would certainly apply to the Kurds, spread across several states, and it should also apply to the Jews and to the Palestinians, among many others.<br /><br />On the last page, he says that we have a choice between survival andannihilation.  We can carry on with unilateral violence, or we the people can take back the power, change direction, and elect a government that believes in cooperative non-violence, the only path to survival that appears to the author, and to this reviewer, as viable.<br /><br />This is a *very* important book, and it merits careful reading by every adult who wishes to leave their children a world of peace and prosperity.  We can do better.

It combines common sense, a deep understanding of the flaws of a capitalist system that has been hijacked by unethical elites, and an extraordinary diversity of interviews and sources that I found compellingly sensible and straight-forward.<br /><br />Politically and economically, this book offers the citizen-voter-consumer-stockholder an objective and balanced account of exactly what is wrong with the existing American way of capitalism (both at home and abroad), and how we might, over time, fix it.<br /><br />Most importantly, the author destroys all of the myths and lies about the rising American standard of living, and demonstates that when one revises the Gross Domestic Product calculations to substract rather than add the negative products such as prisons and health care stemming from unsafe products and practices, the over-all national economic indicators have been steadily declining for over thirty years.<br /><br />The author is brilliant--truly brilliant--in studying the work of others and putting together a case for redefining capitalism and the financial accounting for capitalism to include social costs and benefits as part of the evaluative calculus.  He excells at understanding and explaining the benefits to be had by introducing long-term sustainability, worker-friendly labor and management cultures, and balanced work force composition (save the middle class) and compensation (end the looting of America and its pension funds by an out of control corporate elite).<br /><br />In discussing the soul of capitalism, the author is in fact discussing America's soul.  His book is not only a handbook for grassroots and collective bargaining actions by all communities and assocations, it is a reference point by which Americans specifically, but all national in all nations, should be judging their political and economic and social leaders.  People *can* take back the power, but first they must understand that the existing economic situation is so unstable and unhealthy that it virtually guarantees life on Earth will end within the next 100 years.<br /><br />Although the book clearly mandates a reordering of both the American economic and the American political systems, and the author addresses those, he placed the bulk of his emphasis at the grass-roots level, and discusses how specific organizations and communities across America are \\"by-passing Washington\\" and establishing revolutionary new covenants for community-based, labor-friendly, sustainable economics.<br /><br />The book as a whole draws a clear distinction between what one might call Bush Economics (loot the commonwealth, enrich a very tiny elite that already has most of the wealth) and Dean Economics (recover the $500 billion a year in unwarranted corporate subsidies and financial fraud, restore the social side of the capitalist value system, share the wealth, sustain the environment).<br /><br />The author is a man of faith.  Throughout the book, but especially when discussing the Social Gospel movement and reform theologians with close ties to extreme suffering in communities that have lost everything, he can inspire tears of both sadness at what we have done to ourselves, and joy at the possibilities for the future if we the people take back the power.<br /><br />At every turn in the book one reads about the connection between capitalism and democracy--between corrupt capitalism and the falseness and injustice of American democracy and foreign policy (see our reviews of Paul Krugman's \\"The Great Unraveling\\", Jonathan Schell, \\"The Unconquerable World\\", and Mark Hertsgaard, \\"The Eagle's Shadow\\")--and between moral capitalism and democracy restored.<br /><br />Drawingon the work of David Ellerman, William Greider discusses the master-servant relationship between corporate employers and human employees, and concludes, as does Ellerman, that all of the injustices of capitalism are based on a legalized fraud.  \\"The 'fraud' is the economic pretense that people can be treated as things, as commodities or mahcines, as lifeless property that lacks the qualities inseparable from the human self, the person's active deliberation and choices, the personal accountability for one's actions.\\"<br /><br />Three additional notes (this review barely scratches the surface and cannot do justice to the wealth of knowledge the author is communicating in a very effective manner):<br /><br />1)  If the labor unions come together to use their pension funds as sledge hammers, they can do a great deal of good in both reforming Wall Street and nurturing labor-friendly and environmental-friendly corporate behavior.<br /><br />2)  The retired population in America represents an untapped national asset--a wise President would find ways to use this virtually unlimited pool of social and functional talent to revitalize communities, schools, families, businesses, and non-profit endeavors.<br /><br />3)  Both the corporate governance model and the enforcement model are so severely flawed that they must be over-turned.  Corporations should not have legal personalities that eliminate accountability for the individuals managing them, and the enforcement process needs to be turned on its head, focusing on incentives for higher social performance rather than punishments for the occasionally prosecuted rogue corporation.<br /><br />In relation to foreign economic relations, the author provides a superb complementary reading to Clyde Prestowitz's book, \\"Rogue Nation: American Unilateralism and the Failure of Good Intentions.\\"  As he puts it so nicely, in today's world walls do not work and there is no place for corporations to hide once the anger of the people is aroused.  America must not only clean its own house, but in so doing, in restoring the morality of capitalism and the realiy of democracy, America will again be a land of ideals instead of hypocrisy, a land of liberty instead of looting, a land that inspires the world instead of corrupting it.<br /><br />America, and the world, are at a turning point.  I pray that no fewer than 50 million Americans will read this book, and I urge every faithful Amazon customer to buy 5 copies of this book and give them out as part of re-engaging every adult in the vital process of restoring democracy and restoring morality to capitalism.<br /><br />High recommended books, with reviews:<br />[[ASIN:159659098X The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism: How the Financial System Underminded Social Ideals, Damaged Trust in the Markets, Robbed Investors of Trillions - and What to Do About It]]<br />[[ASIN:0670038520 Blessed Unrest: How the Largest Movement in the World Came into Being and Why No One Saw It Coming]]<br />[[ASIN:193213347X The Tao of Democracy: Using Co-Intelligence to Create a World That Works for All]]<br />[[ASIN:0759691681 Society's Breakthrough!: Releasing Essential Wisdom and Virtue in All the People]]<br />[[ASIN:0300125771 The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom]]<br />[[ASIN:1576753328 One from Many: VISA and the Rise of Chaordic Organization]]<br />[[ASIN:0872864758 A Power Governments Cannot Suppress]]p between corporate employers and human employees, and concludes, as does Ellerman, that all of the injustices of capitalism are based on a legalized fraud.  \\"The 'fraud' is the economic pretense that people can be treated as things, as commodities or mahcines, as lifeless property that lacks the qualities inseparable from the human self, the person's active deliberation and choices, the personal accountability for one's actions.\\"    Three additional notes (this review barely scratches the surface and cannot do justice to the wealth of knowledge the author is communicating in a very effective manner):    1)  If the labor unions come together to use their pension funds as sledge hammers, they can do a great deal of good in both reforming Wall Street and nurturing labor-friendly and environmental-friendly corporate behavior.    2)  The retired population in America represents an untapped national asset--a wise President would find ways to use this virtually unlimited pool of social and functional talent to revitalize communities, schools, families, businesses, and non-profit endeavors.    3)  Both the corporate governance model and the enforcement model are so severely flawed that they must be over-turned.

Regardless of who helps America to regain its balance, this book is 1 of a handfull utterly brilliant contributions that everyone should buy and read and discuss.<br /><br />As the only reviewer for Amazon who focuses exclusively on national security non-fiction, across the categories of information; intelligence; emerging threats; strategy & force structure; blowback, international relations, and dissent; and US political, leadership, and the future of life; I want to say quite clearly that I regard this book as one of the three \\"must reads\\" for every American between now and November 2008.  The other two are #1 William Greider, [[ASIN:0684862204 The Soul of Capitalism: Opening Paths to a Moral Economy]], and #2, Jonathan Schell, [[ASIN:0805044566 The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People]].<br /><br />This book is solid, serious truth-telling.  Those reviewers, including the so-called professional editorial reviewers, who demean this book are simply revealing their narrow self-centered arrogance--precisely the quality in many Americans that is most distressing to the rest of the world.  I find it of considerable importance that this book is favorably considered by the major intellectual newspapers and magazines across Europe and in the US, and including The Economist, the Christian Scientist Monitor, and Salon.com.<br /><br />Easy to read, well-organized, this is a story, not a documentary, and it should be appreciated in that light.  On page 10 the book's main argument is perfectly captured by a quote from a South African: \\"we know everything about you [Americans] and you know nothing about us.\\"  Therein lies the problem.  As the author notes later in the book, after a review of the decrepitude of both our media and our educational systems in relation to foreign affairs and national security, \\"Ignorance is an excuse, but it is no shield.\\"<br /><br />Although I have reviewed many other books that have much more detail and are more documentary in nature, I give this author credit for telling a story that is comprehensible and compelling to the normal citizen, one already disadvantaged by a mediocre news services and functionalist schools that do not teach, as I do, that the world has 32 complex emergencies (failed states), 66 countries distressed by tens of millions of displaced persons, 33 countries with massive starvation as a daily fact of life, 59 countries with plagues and epidemics this very day.  There are also 18 genocide campaigns that everyone is ignoring, this very day, massive water scarcity, energy scarcity at the poverty level, and corruption and censorship across 80 and 62 countries.  America has no clue....it is not only the average citizen that is ignorant, but the average elected official and the average federal bureaucrat as well.  This book helps remedy that situation.<br /><br />The author does a fine job of distilling both a broad literature and a broad survey of foreign views through direct interview, and it is a job good enough to put this book into my \\"top three\\" for the year.<br /><br />I will end by saying that this book persuaded me that the US has become a Third World nation, a lower-tier disadvantaged nation, in many respects.  Apart from the critical infrastructure, which has not been refurbished in a quarter century because of the fraud perpetuated on the public by deregulation, and the massive poverty, prisons, poor health, and so on, what we have in America today is massive injustice and a massive concentration of wealth so outrageous that in any other country it would have led to a violent revolution.<br /><br />This book has persuaded me that America needs not one, but  two Truth & Reconciliation Commissions.  We need a Truth & Reconciliation Commission, ideally managed by Colin Powell,to investigate the perversion of both capitalism and democracy in the US, and to outline a way forward such as William Greider discusses in \\"The Soul of Capitalism.\\"  We also need, even more desperately, a Truth & Reconciliation Commission, ideally managed by Nelson Mandela and Lee Kuan Yew, to catalog and acknowledge, and apologize to the world for, the war crimes, the unethical behavior, and the enormous political, social, cultural, economic, demographic, and natural resource costs we have imposed on the world  through our ignorance and arrogance.<br /><br />There are six billion people out there, waiting to see how America handles the emerging Reichstag known as the neo-conservative Cheney-Bush regime.  We cannot kill them nor contain them with force--as Jonathan Schell notes in \\"The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People,\\" there is one path and one path only toward a bright future: non-violent cooperative collective power.<br /><br />If every American reads this book, and every American votes in an informed manner in November 2008, we can save the world and in the process save America.<br /><br />Other recommended recent books:<br />[[ASIN:0312376960 Day of Reckoning: How Hubris, Ideology, and Greed Are Tearing America Apart]]<br />[[ASIN:0670018368 Independents Day: Awakening the American Spirit]]<br />[[ASIN:0805077979 The Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire Project)]]<br />[[ASIN:B000A1ETWO Rogue Nation: American Unilateralism and the Failure of Good Intentions]]<br />[[ASIN:1400065763 Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency]]<br />[[ASIN:0312424620 Running on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It]]<br />[[ASIN:159659098X The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism: How the Financial System Underminded Social Ideals, Damaged Trust in the Markets, Robbed Investors of Trillions - and What to Do About It]]y in the US, and to outline a way forward such as William Greider discusses in \\"The Soul of Capitalism.\\"  We also need, even more desperately, a Truth & Reconciliation Commission, ideally managed by Nelson Mandela and Lee Kuan Yew, to catalog and acknowledge, and apologize to the world for, the war crimes, the unethical behavior, and the enormous political, social, cultural, economic, demographic, and natural resource costs we have imposed on the world  through our ignorance and arrogance.

Even though it makes my summative reviews valuable as a trace, I have tried to get Amazon to realize that it should offer such books electrionically, micro-cash for micro-text, and Jeff Besoz just doesn't want to hear it.  I predict that Kindle will fail.<br /><br />The author has provided a very informed and well-documented view of the competing \\"axis of thinking\\" (unilateralism versus multilateral realism) and \\"axis of feeling\\" (isolationism versus engagement).  The two together create the matrix upon which a multitude of ideological, special interest, and academic or \\"objective\\" constituencies may be plotted.<br /><br />The endorsement of the book by the Managing Editor of Foreign Affairs is a very subtle but telling indictment of the unilateralist bullying that has characterized American foreign policy since 2000--indeed, the author of the book coins the term \\"ideological blowback\\" as part of devastatingly disturbing account of all the things that have been done \\"in our name\\" on the basis of either blind faith or neo-conservative presumption.<br /><br />The book received four stars because at the strategic level, Clyde Prestowitz' book, [[ASIN:B000A1ETWO Rogue Nation: American Unilateralism and the Failure of Good Intentions]] is better in all ways--easier to read, more detailed, more specifics.  Historically, I would bracket this book with the collection of Foreign Affairs[[ASIN:046500170X The American Encounter: The United States and the Making of the Modern World Essays from 75 Years of Foreign Affairs]] articles, , and I would add [[ASIN:B0000C4JBT Wilson's Ghost: Reducing the Risk of Conflict, Killing, and Catastrophe in the 21st Century]] by McNamara and Blight, Kissinger on [[ASIN:0684855682 Does America Need a Foreign Policy? : Toward a Diplomacy for the 21st Century]], Boren et al on [[ASIN:0806131233 Preparing America's Foreign Policy for the 21st Century]], and finally Joe Nye's, [[ASIN:0195161106 The Paradox of American Power: Why the World's Only Superpower Can't Go It Alone]]  There are many other books I have reviewed on these pages, and one could make a fine evening of reading only the reviews, as they are summative in nature.<br /><br />In any event, and the reason I mention other books above instead of in the last paragraph, is to make the point that everyone--other than a few obsessive neo-conservatives who happen to hold the reins of power--is saying the same thing: America must engage the real world, in a multilateral fashion.<br /><br />The author of this book differs from other authors in that he explicitly recognizes, in his preface and then throughout the book, the fact that a coherent U.S. foreign policy cannot be achieved without the U.S. public's first understanding what is at stake, and then making its voice heard.<br /><br />The author is also noteworthy in detailing the hypocrisy and ignorance of existing U.S. national security policies.  Although Prestowitz does this in a more useful fashion, this book is very valuable and has many gifted turns of phrase.  Consider this one, from page 10: \\"Despite a century of intense global engagement, America is still something of a colossus with an infant's brain, unaware of the havoc its tentative, giant-sized baby steps can cause.  We still have some growing up to do as a nation.\\"<br /><br />A third aspect of this book that I found compelling was the author's continued emphasis on the need to change mind-sets and emphasize *awareness* over \\"guts\\"--as he tells this compelling tale, Americans are too quick to show \\"toughness\\" when they perhaps should slow down, orient, observe, decide, and then act on the basis of a fully-informed appraisal of all the linkages and potential consequences of their actions.<br /><br />A fourth valuable feature of this book is the author's focus on one chapter on American vulnerabilities inthe age of globalization and super-empowered angry men.  He quotes the incoming Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in explaining to Congress the military's incapacity to intervene on 9-11, as saying \\"We're pretty good if the threat is coming from outside.  We're not so good if it's coming from inside.\\"<br /><br />This leads to the fifth and final aspect of the book that I found noteworthy: the author's discussion of the mismanagement--even lack of management--of the broad spectrum of the varied instruments of national power.  As Suzanne Nossel, a top Holbrook aide puts it, \\"Today, when it comes to U.S. diplomacy, one hand rarely knows what the other is doing.  The U.S. government has no central ledger in which bilateral relationships are tracked.  There is no place to turn to find out what the United States has done for a particular country lately, or what a country may want or fear.\\"  The book clearly supports what appears to be an emerging consensus within the Senate that some form of \\"Goldwater-Nichols Act\\" for civilian and joint civilian-military national security management.<br /><br />The endnotes are good, the index useful but annoyingly below 8 font type (possibly as low as 6) which is a very foolish act on the part of the publisher.  A readable index would have increased the reference value of this book by at least 10%.  The book lacks a bibliography, and here we urge the author to consider one for what we hope will be a second printing: books on realism, books on unilateralism, books on blowback (e.g. [[ASIN:0316164968 The Fifty-Year Wound: How America's Cold War Victory Has Shaped Our World]], or [[ASIN:1840465255 Why Do People Hate America?]]), etcetera.<br /><br />See also:<br />[[ASIN:0805044566 The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People]]<br />[[ASIN:0872864758 A Power Governments Cannot Suppress]]ncoming Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in explaining to Congress the military's incapacity to intervene on 9-11, as saying \\"We're pretty good if the threat is coming from outside.

It does not adequately discuss the non-violent traditional threats (water and resource scarcity, mass migration and genocide, pollution and corruption, inter alia), and it does not really discuss the future in creative ways.<br /><br />There is no index and the bibliography is marginal.<br /><br />There is one bright spot, and it alone makes the book worthy of purchase: Phil Williams, a top academic with superb law enforcement and national security connections at the working level, provides a preface that is concise and useful.  He begins by pointing out that Clinton as well as Bush to date have ignored non-state threats, specifically including terrorism, and failed to understand the gravity and imminence of the asymmetrical threat.  He lists five realities and three solutions:<br /><br />Reality #1: International security is more complex.  It is not sufficient to focus only on states.<br /><br />Reality #2: Distinction between foreign and domestic security is gone--one cannot have homeland security in isolation from global security, and vice versa.<br /><br />Reality #3: States are not what they were--the balance of power now requires that states, corporations, and organizations find new means of coordinating policies, capabilities, and actions.<br /><br />Reality #4: Non-state enemies are everything that states--and especially the USA--are not.  They are networked, transitional, flexible, learn from their mistakes, can embed themselves invisibly into existing financial and other communities, and possess a capacity for regeneration that national policy-makers simply do not appreciate.<br /><br />Reality #5: Globalization has down and dark sides.  It is imposing costs that lead to \\"blowback\\" and it is diffusing technologies and capabilities to non-state actors to the point that the complexity of Western infrastructures is now the greatest vulnerabilities of all of these state-based societies.<br /><br />He concludes with three solutions: get intelligence right (a draconian challenge); change mind-sets (an equally draconian challenge); and revitalize and revamp the entire institutional archipelago through which national security policy, acquisitions, and operations are planned and executed (also a draconian challenge).<br /><br />This is an excellent and reasonably priced undergraduate paperback, and a fine primer for those who are not already steeped in the literature.  It does not significantly advance the literature in and of itself.<br /><br />See also, with reviews:<br />[[ASIN:9211009588 A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility--Report of the Secretary-General's High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change]]<br />[[ASIN:9812704825 Seeing the Invisible: National Security Intelligence in an Uncertain Age]]<br />[[ASIN:0805044566 The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People]]<br />[[ASIN:0312422504 The Eagle's Shadow: Why America Fascinates and Infuriates the World]]<br />[[ASIN:1574888625 Imperial Hubris: Why the West Is Losing the War on Terror]]g policies, capabilities, and actions.

Although out-of-print, there are hundreds of copies of this book that can be obtained via Amazon's used book channels, and the author is writing a sequel that will be easier to understand if this book is digested first.<br /><br />In addressing the plans reality mismatch, the author is very effectively demonstrating that doctrine, technology and the budget are completely divorced from both real world threats, and real world logistics.<br /><br />With superb assistance from the editor, James Clay Thompson, who has converted the author's Pentagon-speak to plain English, the author documents the insanity and the irresponsibility of how we continue to spend the taxpayer dollar on so-called defense.  I say so-called because the Emperor has no clothes.  We can invade a country, but we cannot stop terrorism or keep our electrical system going reliably.<br /><br />Just one little vignette illustrates how jam-packed this book is with facts.  Discussing the F-15 and the move toward replaceable units as a means of reducing forward-deployed repair specialists and spare parts, the author blows the lid off the whole system.  It all comes down to the three computers each squadron of 24 F-15's needs to diagnose its 1080 line-replaceable units.  1) It turns out the three computers work 80% of the time.  2) It takes up to 30 minutes to connect the computer to an interface test adapter.  3) It takes an average of three hours and as many as eight hours for the computer to carry out a diagnostic reading of a single line-replaceable unit.  4) Very often the computer fails to replicate the problem, with lack of resolution fluctuating at between 25 and 41 percent of the time.  5) At the time Spinney wrote the book, and probably still today, not a single Air Force avionics technician was re-enlisting, because they could get three times the money, and a much better quality of life, by taking their taxpayer-funded training into the private sector.<br /><br />Spinney ends his book by saying, \\"In a nutshell, Pentagon economics discount the present and inflate the future.  Put another way, the future consequences of today's decisions are economically unrealistic plans that reduce current ability to meet the threat in order to make room (hopefully) for future money to meet a hypothetical threat. ... The across-the-board thrust toward ever-increasing technological complexity is simply not working.\\"<br /><br />It is not the book's purpose to propose an alternative national security strategy and a commensurate change in how America devises its concepts, doctrine, and capabilities for making war and enforcing peace, but if one reads the book by Robert Coram, \\"BOYD: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War\\" and also the book edited by Dr. Col. Max Manwaring et al, \\"Search for Security: A U.S. Grand Strategy for the 21st Century,\\" a picture will emerge.  People first, ideas second, hardware last.  The ideas in this book, although ignored in the 20 years since they were first articulated, are certain to play a large role in the redesign and redirection of the U.S. national security community over the next ten years.<br /><br />More recent books:<br />[[ASIN:0143038915 Fiasco: The American Military Adventure in Iraq]]<br />[[ASIN:0930852370 9/11 Synthetic Terror: Made in USA, Fourth Edition]]<br />[[ASIN:0805044566 The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People]]<br />[[ASIN:1400065763 Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency]]<br />[[ASIN:1416535748 Rumsfeld: His Rise, Fall, and Catastrophic Legacy]]]]	2003-08-31

This book is a professionally-prepared, well-documented catalog of the \\"platform of lies\\" that the incumbent (2000-2004) US Administration has pressed upon the public in the course of executing six wars (two public) and two occupations, both of which are going *very* badly, at great expense.<br /><br />I have to give very high marks to the authors and their employer, the Center for Media & Democracy, for this book represents a \\"must read\\" for every voter.<br /><br />Among the highlights (please note that all references to the US government actually refer to the political administration, which is abusing the good faith and loyalty of the millions of loyal Armed Services members as well as the civil service):<br /><br />1) Documentation of US government manipulation of images coming out of Iraq<br /><br />2) Documentation of how US government emphasis on manipulating the truth for the US public has actually left it unable to listen and hear and understand the truth as spoken by the Iraqi and Afghan people.<br /><br />3) Documentation of the clear and present need to restore the US Information Agency (USIA) as an independent organization with a considerably expanded budget--in the age of information America is losing the mindwar, the culture war, because it is overspending on a heavy metal military and underspending on information power--what Joe Nye calls \\"soft power.\\"<br /><br />4) Documentation of what the author's call America's \\"astonishing historical amnesia,\\" assuming they can go into the Middle East without reference to the history of British and US imperialism, including the deposition of the legitimate rulers of Iran and the continuing acceptance of Israeli disrespect for UN resolutions.<br /><br />5) Documentation of why Charlotte Beers failed America, in two parts:<br /><br />  a) She did not know how to, was incapable of listening to, Arab voices.  According to the New York Times, cited by the book, those who spoke to her \\"came away shaking their heads, saying American officials do not appreciate [their circumstances and views].<br /><br />  b) The product she was selling, the US \\"brand\\", is simply too defective, too unilateralist, too arrogant, too brutal, too harmful to multi-cultural and multi-national interests, to survive in the marketplace of the real world.  This is \\"unsafe at any speed\\" writ very large, very global, very angry.<br /><br />6) Documentation of the blatant (and expensive) manner in which the US government manipulated the message to the US public (if CIA had done this they would have been in violation of the law--when Hill & Knowlton does it is called \\"public relations\\" even though everything is a complete fabrication and a betrayal of the public trust).  The authors excel at one point in contrasting how Washington listens to a handful of talking heads on the Middle East, while ignoring \\"the 1,400 full time faculty members who specialize in Middle East studies at American Universities.\\"<br /><br />7) Documentation of US government plans, under the abusive grip on power of the neo-conservatives, to carry out future \\"over-whelming, non-surgical, nonproportional military force\\" actions against the governments of Iran, Libya, Syria, and Sudan, as recommended by Richard Perle and his colleagues.<br /><br />8) Documentation, over the course of the book, of both specific lies told to the US public and the world by the US government, and of the vast underlying insinuations, not quite the truth, misleading, and generally deceptive statements of all the senior political appointees, and especially Dick Cheney.  The authors essentially compare George Bush and his team to Orwellian vision of governments controlling the people through doublespeak, and they label this US government as being intellectual dishonest, through and through.<br /><br />9) Documentation (continuing from8) of how this government's manipulation of the truth can be compared with Hitler's.  They quote Goering to make this point: \\"but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.  That is easy.  All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.  It works the same way in every country.\\"  Sound familiar?  Remember Bush (and Clinton) saying that dissent is treason?  People, we have a problem here.<br /><br />There are many other important points documented in this non-fiction work--it is NOT humorous nor should the cover suggest it is told in comic fashion--but I will end with the ultimate point of it all: the author's document, on the pages leading up to page 195, that the US public is hearing and seeing and reading perhaps one tenth (1/10th) of the truth as it is available to European, Asian, Middle Eastern, and other audiences where the media is not under political and corporate control to the extent that exists in the USA.  At the end of this book, I was reaffirmed in my view that real patriotism, real national unity, comes from tough love and the full truth, nothing but the truth.  Against that criteria, and as documented by the authors of this book, George Bush Junior, Dick Cheney, Karl Rove, and all of their politically-appointed minions are liars who have betrayed the public trust and deserve to be impeached before or after they are thrown out of office in 2004.

However, it is important to emphasize that at the institutional and cultural level, the author's critique carries backward to the Clinton Administration and forward to all but one Democratic candidate (Bush Lites).<br />I consider it extremely important that the author is a conservative Republican, Christian, and patriot with a proven track-record as head of the Economic Strategy Institute--a man who understands what moderate Republicans have been trying to tell the incumbent all along: fiscal prudence, no deficit, multilateral treaty adherence, these all provide for stability.  If Bush is worried about 12% of the Republicans voting for Dean, after this book is read and absorbed by the educated and moderately-well off Republican base, he should start thinking in terms of losing 25%.  This book is political and economic DYNAMITE.<br />In ten thoughtful chapters, all well-sourced and well-indexed, and complemented by a *superb* five page list of additional recommended reading, the author lays out, with objective precision and a clear love of country extant throughout, why American unilateralism and all we have done since 2000 has been \\"stupidity, arrogance and ignorance in the exercise of power.\\"<br />His early use of Webster's definition of \\"Rogue\\" as \\"deviant, having an abnormally savage or unpredictable disposition\\" not only suits the unilateralist Bush team perfectly, but makes it clear that in objective terms, as perceived by the rest of the world--not just the Middle East, but the responsible Asian powers as well as what Rumsfeld revealingly denigrates as \\"old Europe\\"--the USA is indeed a \\"rogue nation.\\"<br />A few small quotes capture the value of this work, which I have heavily marked-up and which I recommend be read carefully, every word, by anyone contemplating their vote for November 2004 and beyond:<br />According to former EU Ambassador to the US, Hugo Paemen: \\"...while your intentions are usually good, your actions are frequently informed by ignorance, ideology, or special interests and can have very damaging consequences for the rest of us.\\"<br />One Latin American Ambassador is quoted as saying, \\"The United States mistrusts the whole world.  It relies only on military force and has no vision of itself working with others.\\"<br />Other authorities quoted by the author characterize US national security and foreign policy as \\"ambivalent\\", defined by \\"inconsistency and neglect.\\"<br />The author is especially strong on documenting the inconsistencies and incoherence of the over-all US national security strategy, and brings his special competency in international economic strategy to bear.  He says, \\"An important aspect of the American empire is that because Americans don't see it as such, few look at the totality or thinking about where it is going and what it needs, and certainly no one is in charge.  This inattention creates neglect and incoherent, often contradictory policy initiatives.\\"<br />Taking Africa in particular, a continent that Henry Kissinger says will be the ultimate test for US policy  (see my review of \\"Does America Need a Foreign Policy\\"), the author is brutally candid: \\"In West Africa, the face of American-style globalization and free trade is not the hope-inspiring one of Colin Powell, but a harsh, hypocritical one that inspires a drift to radicalism and perhaps to terrorism.  The cost of dealing with that would, of course, far exceed anything spent on subsidies or aid.\\"<br /><br />Skipping over the many other excellent and honestly presented thoughts the author presents in this book, which is a \\"must read, right now\\" book, I will end with three quotes that capture the urgency and relevancy of this book to the future of the Republic.<br />At the top of page 277: \\"The imperial project ofthe so-called neoconservatives is not conservatism at all but radicalism, egotism, and adverturism articulated in the stirring rhetoric of traditional patriotism.  Real conservatives have never been messianic or doctrinaire.  The very essence of conservatism, which the neoconservatives constantly preach, is limited government.  Yet the imperial project they are proposing will greatly increase the role of government both at home and abroad. ... This is not conservatism.  It is Big Government.\\"<br />At the bottom of page 281, \\"The procedure of American foreign policy badly needs to be reviewed.  It is terribly damaging when one or two powerful congressional chairpersons can dictate U.S. policy, despite a lack of significant public support.  Even more importantly, the question of who decides when America goes to war desperately needs to be clarified.  Congress seems to be less and less involved.  But America was not meant to be run by a Caesar.\\"  [The author goes on to discuss how a more democratic and openly derived holistic national security strategy would not only resolve the instability associated with mis-directed globalization, but also address the fundamental: water scarcity, disease, deforestation, soil depletion, and overpopulation.]<br />On page 284, the last page, \\"Particularly, I would like to remind my fellow Christians of the words of Oliver Cromwell, who enjoined in a letter to the Church of Scotland, 'In the bowels of Christ, please believe that you may be wrong.' As an elder of the Presbyterian Church, I [the author] want to emphasize that Christ was no about nations and power, and did not spread his gospel by force. ... Politicians who use God as prop for their campaigns should remember that 'God is not mocked.'  An America that stressed its tolerance rather than its might, its tradition of open inquiry rather than its way of life, and that asked for God's blessing on all the world's people and not just its own, would be the America the world desperately wants.\\"<br />This book brought tears to my eyes.  This is a great book, a worthy book, and the author merits our most earnest and respective attention and appreciation.oject of the so-called neoconservatives is not conservatism at all but radicalism, egotism, and adverturism articulated in the stirring rhetoric of traditional patriotism.

See the others below.<br /><br />Having read perhaps 20 of the best books on global issues and environmental sustainability, water scarcity, ocean problems, etc, over the past few years (most reviewed here on Amazon) I was prepared for a superficial summary, political posturing, and unrealistic claims.  Not this book--this book is one of the finest, most intelligent, most easily understood programs for action I have ever seen.  The book as a whole, and the 20 problem statements specifically, are concise, illustrated, and sensible.<br /><br />The author breaks the 20 issues into 3 groups.  Group one (sharing our planet) includes global warming; biodiversity and ecosystem losses, fisheries depletion, deforestation, water deficits, and maritime safety and pollution.  Group two (sharing our humanity) includes massive step-up in the fight against poverty, peacekeeping-conflict prevention-combatting terrorism, education for all, global infectuous diseases, digital divide, and natural disaster prevention and mitigation.  Group three (sharing our rule book) includes reinventing taxation for the 21st century, biotechnology rules, global financial architecture, illegal drugs, trade-investment-competition rules, intellectual property rights, e-commerce rules, and international labor and migration rules.<br /><br />The author's core concept for dealing with these complex issues intelligently, while recognizing that \\"world government\\" is not an option, lies with his appreciation of the Internet and how global issues networks could be created that would be a vertical complement to the existing horizontal elements of each national government.<br /><br />The footnotes and index are professional,  but vastly more important, the author's vision is combined with practicality.  This is a \\"doable-do\\" and this book is therefore my number one reading recommendation for any citizen buying just one book of the 360+ that I have recommended within Amazon.  Superb.<br /><br />See also, with reviews:<br />[[ASIN:0679768114 The Future of Life]]<br />[[ASIN:0670038520 Blessed Unrest: How the Largest Movement in the World Came into Being and Why No One Saw It Coming]]<br />[[ASIN:0759691681 Society's Breakthrough!: Releasing Essential Wisdom and Virtue in All the People]]<br />[[ASIN:0974952249 Green Chemistry and the Ten Commandments of Sustainability, 2nd ed]]<br />[[ASIN:1559633123 Ecological Economics: Principles And Applications]]<br />[[ASIN:0316353000 Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]]just one book of the 360+ that I have recommended within Amazon.

Not only are the people awakening to the truth, which is that they have been had through a combination of inattention and manipulation, but these two books and several others in this genre are validating what Chomsky was telling us all in the past 25 years.<br /><br />The ability to set the agenda and determine what is talked about and how it is talked about is at the root of hidden power in the pseudo-democratic society.  Chomsky was decades ahead of his time in studying both the power of language and the power of controlling the media message.  Today, as we recall that so-called mainstream news media *refused* fully-funded anti-war advertisements that challenged the White House lies (62 of which have been documented with full sourcing in various blogs, notably Stephen Perry's Bush at War blog), we must come to grips with the fact that America is at risk.<br /><br />Thomas Jefferson said \\"A Nation's best defense is an educated citizenry\\" and Supreme Court Justice Branstein said \\"The greatest threat to liberty is an inert public.\\"  Today we lack the first and have the second, but as Amazon rankings show, the people, they are awakening.  It is through reading, and following the links, and informed discussion, that the people can come together, using new tools for peer-to-peer information sharing and MeetUp's, and take back the power.<br /><br />Chomsky had it right.  It took 25 years for all of us to realize he had it right.  I rise in praise of this great man.<br /><br />Other links that validate his ethics and intellect:<br />[[ASIN:1400065763 Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency]]<br />[[ASIN:0312424620 Running on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It]]<br />[[ASIN:159659098X The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism: How the Financial System Underminded Social Ideals, Damaged Trust in the Markets, Robbed Investors of Trillions - and What to Do About It]]<br />[[ASIN:0670018368 Independents Day: Awakening the American Spirit]]<br />[[ASIN:0312376960 Day of Reckoning: How Hubris, Ideology, and Greed Are Tearing America Apart]]<br />[[ASIN:0758203519 Al On America]]on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It]]  [[ASIN:159659098X The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism: How the Financial System Underminded Social Ideals, Damaged Trust in the Markets, Robbed Investors of Trillions - and What to Do About It]]  [[ASIN:0670018368 Independents Day: Awakening the American Spirit]]  [[ASIN:0312376960 Day of Reckoning: How Hubris, Ideology, and Greed Are Tearing America Apart]]  [[ASIN:0758203519 Al On America]]	2003-08-22

It is a very  readable collection of short essays, ending with a concise collection of photographs that show the horror of war--on one page in particular, a pile of artillery shells labeled \\"Cause\\" and below is a photo of a massive pile of bodies, labeled \\"Effect.\\"<br /><br />Of particular interest to anyone concerned about the current national security situation, both its expensive mis-adventures abroad and its intrusive violation of many Constitutional rights at home, is the author's history, not only as a the most decorated Marine at the time, with campaign experience all over the world, but as a spokesperson, in retirement, for placing constitutional American principles over imperialist American practice.<br /><br />The following quotations from the book are intended to summarize it:<br /><br />\\"I helped make Mexico, especially Tampico, safe for American oil intersts in 1914.  I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in.  I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefits of Wall Street.  The record of racketeering is long.  I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909-1912.  I brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interests in 1916.  In China I helped to see to it that Standard Oil went its way unmolested.\\"  [p. 10]<br /><br />\\"War is a racket. ...It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives.\\" [p. 23]<br /><br />\\"The general public shoulders the bill [for war].  This bill renders a horrible accounting.  Newly placed gravestones.  Mangled bodies.  Shattered minds. Broken hearts and homes.  Economic instability.  Depression and all its attendant miseries.  Back-breaking taxation for generations and generations.\\" [p. 24]<br /><br />General Butler is especially trenchant when he looks at post-war casualties.  He writes with great emotion about the thousands of tramautized soldiers, many of who lose their minds and are penned like animals until they die, and he notes that in his time, returning veterans are three times more likely to die prematurely than those who stayed home.<br /><br />This decorated Marine, who understands and documents in detail the exorbitant profits that a select few insiders (hence the  term \\"racket\\") make from war, proposes three specific anti-war measures:<br /><br />1)  Take the profit out of war.  Nationalize and mobilize the industrial sector, and pay every manager no more than each soldier earns.<br /><br />2)  Vote for war or no war on the basis of a limited plebisite in which only those being asked to bear arms and die for their country are permitted to vote.<br /><br />3)  Limit US military forces, by Constitutional amendment, to home defense purposes only.<br /><br />There is a great deal of wisdom and practical experience in this small book--Smedley Butler is to war profiteering what S.L.A. Marshall is to \\"the  soldier's load.\\"  While a globalized world and the complex integration of both national and non-national interests do seem to require a global national security strategy and a means of exerting global influence, I am convinced that he is correct about the fundamentals: we must take the profit out of war, and restore the voice of the people in the matter of making war.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0001L3LUE The Fog of War - Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S.

Others include Charle's Perrow's \\"Normal Accidents: Dealing with High Risk Technologies\\", Norman Cousins, \\"The Pathology of Power\\", and the variety of books that focus specifically on corruption and deception by electrical utility companies around the world, but generally in the US, UK, and Australia.<br /><br />Summing the book up in one sentence: the industrial system disconnected the ethics of kinship and community from the production process.  It allowed \\"objective\\" industrial management to devise complex processes in which each individual plays a functionalist role with minimalist information, and no one person can see the relationship between their \\"objective\\" task, and the massively dysfunctional, pathological, and corrupt outcomes of the total industrial system.<br /><br />This is an erudite, well-documented, well-reasoned book.  It carefully addresses the manner in which sociopathological organizations--including militaries and the corporations that create them in their image--undermine national security and the national commonwealth.  It concludes on a positive note: restoring group governance, and restoring the connection between kinship, community, ethics, and the manner in which national security and national economic decisions are made, can reverse this destructive evil trend, and restore mankind to a state of grace among men and between men and nature.

Consider the author's opening statement:<br /><br />\\"Connected to the tendency of power to corrupt are yet other tendencies that emerge from the pages of the historians:<br /><br />* The tendency of power to drive intelligence underground;<br /><br />* The tendency of power to become a theology, admitting no other gods before it;<br /><br />* The tendency of power to distort and damage the traditions and institutions it was designed to protect;<br /><br />* The tendency of power to create a language of its own, making other forms of communication incoherent and irrelevant;<br /><br />* The tendency of power to spawn imitators, leading to volatile competition;<br /><br />* The tendency of power to set the stage for its own use.<br /><br />This is simply a brilliant, reasoned, well-documented and well-structured look at the greatest threat to any Republic's national security and prosperity: absolute power with its attendant absolute corruption.  All that the author has to say over his 13 chapters, from why Hiroshima to the reality of General MacArther to General and President Eisenhower's prophetic emphasis on \\"true\\" security rather than the \\"cooked books\\" false security of the military-industrial complex, every bit of this is directly applicable to the national security challenges--and the internal ethical challenges--facing the American people are their largely corrupt national political system at the dawn of the 21st Century.  Of course it applies to all other nations as well, but as the Americans are the largest bull, they do the most damage to themselves as well as to others.<br /><br />The author concludes with some \\"first principles\\" that are alone worth the price of the book, these are abbreviated here:<br /><br />* security of the human commonwealth above security of the state<br /><br />* well-being of mankind above well-being of any one nation<br /><br />* needs of future generations above the needs of current generation.<br /><br />* rights of man over the rights of the state<br /><br />* private conscience over public edict<br /><br />* ordeal of peace over easy drift of prosperity<br /><br />His final sentence will not be understood by those who \\"do not do nuances.\\"  He says: \\"The challenge, therefore, is to recognize that national security depends on a wide range of factors, some of them nonmilitary in nature.\\"  He goes on to list the freedoms and well-being of the society itself, the focus on making human development the highest national security priority; the selection of creative transformative rather than manipulative leaders; the articulation of national goals that win foreign support on their merits; the strengthening of international institutions; and finally, the recognition that governance must be focused on the common good, not on retaining power.  To lead properly is to be free of corruption.  Anything else is pathological and undermines national security.<br /><br />More recent books expanding on this theme, with reviews:<br />[[ASIN:1400065763 Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency]]<br />[[ASIN:0312424620 Running on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It]]<br />[[ASIN:159659098X The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism: How the Financial System Underminded Social Ideals, Damaged Trust in the Markets, Robbed Investors of Trillions - and What to Do About It]]<br />[[ASIN:1585422762 Weapons of Mass Deception: The Uses of Propaganda in Bush's War on Iraq]]<br />[[ASIN:0316166286 Blood Money: Wasted Billions, Lost Lives, and Corporate Greed in Iraq]]<br />[[ASIN:1400052688 Sleeping with the Devil: How Washington Sold Our Soul for Saudi Crude]]<br />[[ASIN:0767911792 Conspiracy of Fools: A True Story]]<br />[[ASIN:0767903277 The Informant: A True Story]]<br />[[ASIN:038551445X Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA]]<br />[[ASIN:0930852370 9/11 Synthetic Terror: Made in USA, Fourth Edition]]	2003-08-16

As the author notes, every incompetent in war has previously been promoted to his or her high rank in peacetime. Systems are adopted without serious battle testing or interoperability (and intelligence) supportability being assured, and doctrine takes a back seat to protocol and keeping up appearances.<br />2) Technologists are especially pernicious and dangerous to future warfighting capability when they are allowed to promulgate new technology under ideal peacetime conditions, and not forced to stand the test of battle-like degradation and the friction of real-world conditions.<br />3) Doctrine based on the lessons of history rather than the pomp of peacetime is the ultimate insurance policy.<br />4) Robust--even intrusive and pervasive--communications (signaling) in peacetime is almost certain to denigrate healthy doctrinal development, has multiple pernicious effects on the initiative and development of individual commanders, and can have catastrophic consequences when it is severely degraded in wartime and the necessary doctrinal foundation and command initiative are lacking.<br />This is a very long book at 708 pages, and I would hasten to note that the book is worth purchasing even if only to read Chapter 25, pages 562-601, in which the author brilliantly sets forth 28 distinct &quot;propositions&quot;. The balance of the book is extraordinary in its detail and a pleasure to scan over, but its primary role is to absolutely guarantee the credibility and industry of the author.<br />Each of the 28 propositions, one sentence in length with varying explanatory summaries, is compelling, relevant, and most critical to how we train both flag officers and field grade officers of all the services. Were the author so inclined, I would encourage him to develop the final chapter as a stand-alone primer for military leaders seeking to learn from history and avoid the dangerous juxtaposition of too much technology and too little thought. While the author draws his propositions from an excruciatingly detailed study of the Battle of Jutland and the British naval cultures in conflict before and after Jutland, this book is not, at root, about a specific battle, but rather about the constantly forgotten &quot;first principles&quot; of training, equipping, and organizing forces for combat. Hard to do in peacetime with the best of leaders, a tragedy in waiting with the more common peacetime pogues in charge. &quot;Ratcatchers&quot;, the author's phrase for those who do well in war, are crushed by the peacetime protocols, and this is perhaps the greatest lesson of all: we must nurture our ratcatchers, even place them on independent duty to travel distant lands, but somehow, someway, keep them in play against the day when we need them.nct &quot;propositions&quot;.

Book is available in paperback.<br /><br />Former spy Robert Baer, author of [[ASIN:140004684X See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIA's War on Terrorism]], makes the leap from intelligence reformist to national mentor with his new book, \\"SLEEPING WITH THE DEVIL: How Washington Sold Our Soul for Saudi Crude.\\" Indeed, his last sentence has the White House laying in the moonlight with its legs spread, lustfully eyeing the Saudi wallet on the bureau.<br /><br />This is an extraordinary compelling work, not least because it provides detailed and documented discovery not previously available, of how the U.S. government has over the course of several administrations made a deliberate decision to a) not spy on the Arab countries, b) not collect and read open sources in Arabic, c) not attempt to understand the sub-state actors such as the Muslim brotherhood, despite a long history in which these groups commit suicide to achieve their objectives, including the murder of several heads of state.<br /><br />Baer's most brutal points should make every American shudder: it is America itself that is subsidizing terrorism, as well as the corruption of the Saudi royal family. Baer's documented estimate is that $1 dollar from every barrel of petroleum is spent on Saudi royal family sexual misbehavior, and $1.50 of every barrel of petroleum bought by America ultimately ends up funding extremist schools, foundations, and terrorist groups.<br /><br />Baer has \\"gone back in time\\" to document how all of this terrorism began in the 1970's, but despite its terrible local consequences (including the assassination of heads of state), was ignored by Washington as \\"a local problem.\\"<br /><br />In one lovely real-life account, Baer, then duty officer at CIA while Iraq poised to invade Kuwait, found that the $35 billion per year system was useless, impotent. It came down to his calling the chief of station in Kuwait, who called a border guard, who lifted his binoculars and described the Iraqi tanks stopped for lunch. Baer says: \\"As I waited, I wondered: Is this what all that money for intelligence is buying us? A pair of binoculars?\\"<br /><br />Baer joins with Robert Kaplan in concluding that democracy in Arabia would be an out and out disaster. The decades of Islamic extremism and anti-Americanism run amok cannot be resolved by democratic elections because the very people who most hate America will be elected. Baer observes that \\"strongman tactics\\" such as used by Saddam Hussein and by the Syrian leadership--including a \\"scorched earth\\" campaign against the internal terrorist groups--are a more stable \\"rule of law\\". One can conclude that the US has made a mistake in destabilizing Iraq, and that the imposition of a democratic solution in Iraq will turn out to be vastly more difficult, and vastly more expensive, than the naive neo-conservatives understood when they set forth without bothering to establish who was in the majority within the population being \\"liberated.\\"<br /><br />Saudi Arabia has bought and paid for all the White House and Congressional influence it needs. This is why the recently released 9-11 report contains no mention of the secret documentation of Saudi Arabian complicity in the terrorism that took 3,000 American lives. As Senator Shelby noted on PBS NewsHour recently (he has read the secret report), 93% of the blanked out pages, and specifically those on Saudi sponsorship of terrorism against America and other nations, is a \\"con man's\\" effort to avoid \\"embarrassment.\\" As the families of the 9-11 victims have said, \\"we need to know.\\"<br /><br />Baer is extraordinary. He was a success as a case officer (a clandestine representive of America dealing with traitors and terrorists under conditions of extreme risk), and he has now become a sort of \\"Patrick Henry\\" of the modern era, warning us in clear and compelling terms that White House corruption (a non-partisan recurring corruption) and Saudi Arabia are the twin swords upon which this great Nation may yet impale itself.<br /><br />Other books Americans need to read (or at least read the reviews):<br />[[ASIN:1400065763 Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency]]<br />[[ASIN:0312424620 Running on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It]]<br />[[ASIN:0785262202 Breach of Trust: How Washington Turns Outsiders Into Insiders]]<br />[[ASIN:038551445X Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA]]<br />[[ASIN:0143038915 Fiasco: The American Military Adventure in Iraq]]<br />[[ASIN:159659098X The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism: How the Financial System Underminded Social Ideals, Damaged Trust in the Markets, Robbed Investors of Trillions - and What to Do About It]]<br />[[ASIN:0865715408 Crossing the Rubicon: The Decline of the American Empire at the End of the Age of Oil]]<br />[[ASIN:0060931841 Rule by Secrecy: The Hidden History That Connects the Trilateral Commission, the Freemasons, and the Great Pyramids]]<br />[[ASIN:0930852370 9/11 Synthetic Terror: Made in USA, Fourth Edition]]t impale itself.

It seeks to correct the impression, held by Allen Dulles, many world leaders, and myself, that the Vatican, as with other select religious organizations like B'Nai Brith, is a world-class intelligence network.<br />Although the book spends as much time discussing efforts by the Italians, Germans, and others to penetrate the Vatican, as it does discussing the Vatican's mixed and often non-existent intelligence and counterintelligence capabilities, on balance this is an extremely good personal effort, based on some unique documents and research, and it can be regarded as a cornerstone for any future research into Vatican intelligence.<br />The book suggested to me three &quot;big&quot; ideas that need to be considered by every national intelligence service:<br />1)  Structure and capabilties are needed to study religious intelligence and counterintelligence.  Renegade mid-level drop-outs from the specified religious order should be identified and leveraged as required.  Taking the Muslim brotherhood as an example (see Robert Baer's new book, SLEEPING WITH THE DEVIL), it is absolutely unforgivable and unprofessional of both the US Department of State and the Central Intelligence Agency to have been prevented from studying the fundementalist and extremist religious movements in Arabia from the 1970's forward.  Bottom line: we need to have relgious &quot;orders of battle&quot; and a clear understanding of what this important international player has in the way of capabilities and perceptions.<br />2)  Secure communications make a very important contribution to candor and accuracy.  Perhaps the most interesting part of the author's story can be found in his many annecdotes about how lack of a secure communications system led to self-deception, fantasy, conspiracy, and inaccuracy.  The author is also quite credible in discussing the mediocrity of most Papal cryptographic systems, the lack of manpower and resources for improving this, and the negative results that came about because of a lack of a reliable and truly trusted communications system.<br />3)Finally, while the author does not cover Vatican betrayals of its own people through the Inquisition, of Muslims through the Crusades, and of Jews during the Holocaust, it is clear from this book that for all its limitations, the Catholic Church is an important global player whose local nuncios and bishops and priests and lay personnel can and should be legally and ethically leveraged for sounder understandings across many cultural divides.  I would go so far as to resurface Richard Falk's 1970's idea about a world council of peoples and religions, with a twist: each Foreign Ministry must establish a separate Bureau of Religious Understanding, and devote considerable resources to studying and interacting with religious organizations (and cults, although these can be dealt with on a confrontational law enforcement basis).<br />Religons are one of the seven tribes of intelligence (the others are national, military, law enforcement, business, academic, and NGO-media).  The author has made a very important contribution here (albeit with no help from the publisher--the index *stinks*).

It will be especially valuable to that very rare breed of all-source intelligence analyst, those responsible for analyzing foreign leaders, and completely fed up with the sterile \\"biographic\\" analysis that lists job titles and honors.  The author expands substantially on the very immature but promising field leadership analysis by discussing in detail the concepts and practices of \\"traits-based\\" or \\"value\\" leadership.<br /><br />The author, himself already established as one of the best writers about leaders and leadership, breaks new ground in exploring the psychology of leadership, and creating a new inter-disciplinary and psychologically-rooted approach to understanding leadership at the national, organizational, and personal levels.  He concludes that transformative leadership is all too rare; that it can redirect the fate of nations (Ghandi stands out as an exemplar), and that nurturing true transformative leadership rather than mere industrial-era task-mandating and monitoring leadership, is the core competency for navigating into the 21st Century.<br /><br />The author is especially brutal when his idea are applied to the charismatic or ideologically-purified forms of leadership that pass for Presidential politics today.  \\"At best, charisma is a confusing and undemocratic form of leadership.  At worst, it is a form of tyranny.\\"<br /><br />He spends a great deal of time examining the founding fathers of America and the process by which they defined both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitute, and his findings are quite remarkable (especially in light of recent attempts by Republicans in Texas and in the House of Representives to totally silence Democrats and override dissenting votes without voice):<br /><br />1)  The minority is an absolutely essential part of collective learning and the great dialog that leads to sound decisions.  Repressing the minority is a prescription for disaster.<br /><br />2)  The pursuit of happiness, rather than property, was very deliberately selected by the founding fathers in order to focus on human values and collective learning, rather than property rights.<br /><br />3)  Rebellion from time to time is a feature, not a fault.  \\"...the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants\\" per John Adams.  He specifically focuses on the importance of the loyal opposition as a means of enabling principled change by the majority in the cauldron of informed debate.<br /><br />4)  The right to abolish the U.S. Government is specifically reserved to the American people.  The author notes that absolutist ideas inspire revolt, crowds have immeasurable power, and narrow ideologies with ritual tests of orthodoxy are an invitation to popular revolution.<br /><br />After reviewing a number of leaders across history, the author quotes Roosevelt, who said \\"Government by organized money is just as dangerous as Government by organized mob\\" and then sets the stage for his concluding section, which suggests that leaders must embrace deep values that accept the happiness of the people as the ultimate challenge for the community, that they must empower followers rather than merely engage them, and that the ultimate challenge for all leaders of all nations and organizations is global poverty and the need to eradicate global poverty if billions are to find some semblance of happiness (and implicitly, stability that reduces the threat to the United States and Europe).<br /><br />He quotes others in emphasizing that men in fear or want are not free men; that technology and money is not the answer to poverty, only values and liberation from fear and want, and--his final word, it the end it must be a \\"great people\\" rather than a \\"great man\\" that rises to the global challenge.<br /><br />America!

1051767:US	50761804	R1R3NG5LE31BJ7	0815734077	655014203	Bureaucratic Politics and Foreign Policy	Books	5	16	20	N	N	Essential Reference for Understanding Bad as Well as Unethical Decisions	Edit of 22 Dec 07 to stress importance of this book today, and add links.  This books says that one of the rules of the game is to lie to the President if you think you can get away with it.  Dick Cheney has created three new rules:<br /><br />1.  Ignore the President, Hijack the Presidency<br /><br />2.  Subvert Congress and Article 1 of the Constitution<br /><br />3.  Lie to the People, Over and Over, Even After the Lie is Known to be a Lie<br /><br />This book is quite extraordinary.  It is one of perhaps ten that I consider to be lifetime essential references for any national security official--not because I condone the rules for subverting and manipulating policy that the book documents, but in order to defend against them, for in the aggregate, they all undermine both the Constitution and the power of Congress.<br /><br />Part I is an introduction to national security interests, the organizations within the government that each take on a life of their own and interpret both what our foreign policy should be and how it should be pursued in their own terms, how Presidential interests--predominantly defined by domestic constituencies--compete with the bureaucracy, and how the various players from career officials to political appointees to others play against one another.<br /><br />Part II, the heart of the book, dissects the many strategies for manipulating decisions within the bureacracy.  The \\"rules of the game\\" include the manipulation of which agency gets the lead (tending to suppress all dissenting opinions from other agencies) to which staffer in the White House has the lead (pre-determining the outcome), to means of using foreign officials, the press, and business leaders to present supporting opinions, to manipulating the President.  [Although not cited in this book, having occurred many years later, John Lehman's ability to get President Reagan to pick three names for three aircraft carriers, was sufficient to blow away the Secretary of Defense view that only two were needed...as related in his Command of the Seas.]<br /><br />Part III is, if you will, the guerrilla campaign that  follows a decision.  As George Shultz, then Secretary of State, is on record in Congressional testimony as saying--we paraphrase from recollection: \\"nothing in this town is ever decided--every decision has to be refought every single day.\\"  The author concludes his extraordinary book with the rules of the game for distorting, undermining, or extending decisions through implementation decisions and actions in the field far from Washington.  We are reminded of Harry Truman's reflections on CIA, after he retired, to the effect that he had never intended for CIA to become an action arm or anything other than a central analysis organization.<br /><br />I cannot recommend a more useful nor more important book to those who would seek to understand how a handful of neo-conservatives, led by Dick Cheney, were able to manipulate the President, Congress, the Armed Forces (including the silent Joint Chiefs of Staff) and the American public, into an unjust war with Iraq.  Cheney knows the \\"rules of the game\\" better than anyone else including the President....this book reveals his methods of operation in a concise and easy to understand manner.<br /><br />Other books that build on this one:<br />[[ASIN:1400065763 Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency]]<br />[[ASIN:0312424620 Running on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It]]<br />[[ASIN:0785262202 Breach of Trust: How Washington Turns Outsiders Into Insiders]]<br />[[ASIN:0742532550 Breaking the Real Axis of Evil: How to Oust the World's Last Dictators by 2025]]<br />[[ASIN:0930852370 9/11 Synthetic Terror: Made in USA, Fourth Edition]]<br />[[ASIN:038551445X Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA]]<br /><br />Books that go in the right direction:<br />[[ASIN:0912453001 A Foreign Policy of Freedom: Peace, Commerce, and Honest Friendship]]<br />[[ASIN:0195161106 The Paradox of American Power: Why the World's Only Superpower Can't Go It Alone]]<br />[[ASIN:0805044566 The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People]]<br />[[ASIN:193213347X The Tao of Democracy: Using Co-Intelligence to Create a World That Works for All]]Superpower Can't Go It Alone]]  [[ASIN:0805044566 The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People]]  [[ASIN:193213347X The Tao of Democracy: Using Co-Intelligence to Create a World That Works for All]]	2003-07-12

We now know that Dick Cheney has hijacked the Presidency and subverted Article 1 of the Constitution for eight years and all the way back to the Ford Administration.  The question begs to be asked: why on earth are the Democratic contenders ignoring the need for both Electoral Reform, and impeachment of Dick Cheney?<br /><br />-----<br /><br />As America confronts the very real probability that the Administration manipulated and distorted and fabricated intelligence in order to go to war against Iraq, and as calls rise for the impeachment of the President and the Vice President (the one naive, the other conniving), this book takes on added value--Bob Woodward has done a superb job of documenting both the \\"keystone cops\\" nature of the Administration's \\"strategic deliberations\\", and the very specific manner in which Paul Wolfowitz (too controversial to be Secretary of Defense but a power in his own right) guided the Bush team toward a war on Iraq as a \\"solution\\" to problems they could not deal with directly, to wit, the war on terrorism.<br /><br />There is an Alice in Wonderland quality to this book--or more properly stated, to the conversations that are quoted among the principals. Their wandering short-hand conversations, the degree to which the President is mis-led about our capabilities, the inability of the Secretary of Defense to answer a direct question, always having to go back to his office for an answer--the entire book is, as one reviewer suggests, practically a recount of a handful of recollections about scattered conversations, as if the center of the world were one room in the White House, and nothing outside those walls really mattered. It is also somewhat revisionist--as I recall from published news at the time, all of the principals wanted to delay the taking of Kabul until the spring, and it was President Putin of Russia, speaking directly to President Bush, who made the case, based on his superior intelligence sources on the ground, for how quickly Kabul would fall, leading to the US acceptance of rapid advances by the Afghan warlords. The absence of this essential and openly known fact casts doubt on the entire process of writing the book, and how information was researched and selected for inclusion.<br /><br />There are, however, some major gems that make a careful reading of this book very worthwhile and I list them for consideration by other readers:<br /><br />1) The Directorate of Intelligence does not appear as a listed player--CIA special operations rather than CIA analysis appears to have been the DCI's best card to play;<br /><br />2) The clandestine service, as Dewey Claridge notes in concluding his \\"Spy for All Seasons,\\" died in the 1990's, with only 12 case officers in one year's class--the book misrepresents the increase from 12 to 120 as stellar--it was actually a return to the norm before a series of mediocre leaders destroyed the Directorate of Operations;<br /><br />3) The CIA had been \\"after\\" bin Laden for five years prior to 9-11, the DCI even \\"declaring war\\" on him, to zero effect. Worse, post 9-11 investigations determined that bin Laden had been planning the 9-11 attack for two years without any substantive hint being collected by U.S. intelligence--and at the end of the book, Rumsfeld reflects on how the three major surprises against the U.S. prior to 9-11 not only happened without U.S. intelligence detecting them, but we did not learn of them for five to thirteen years *after the fact* (page 320);<br /><br />4) Presidential-level communications stink--the Secretary of State could not talk to the President when flying back for seven hours from Latin America, and the National Security Advisor could not get a reliable secure connection to the President from her car right in Washington, D.C.<br /><br />5) The Secret Service idea of security for Presidential relatives in a time of crisis is to take them to the nearest Federal Center--the kind that got blown up in Oklahoma.<br /><br />6) Throughout the discussions, it was clear to the principals that the U.S. military is designed to find and destroy fixed physical targets with obvious signatures; it cannot do--it is incompetent at--finding mobile targets, whether vehicles or individuals (cf. page 174)...and of course as General Clark documented in his book, and David Halberstam repeats in his most recent tome, and as the principals learned again vis a vis Afghanistan, the U.S. Army does not do mountains.<br /><br />There are three remarkable aspects of this story, only one even remotely hinted at in the book: we failed to get bin Laden. The CIA went to Afghanistan with the right orders: \\"bin Laden dead or alive.\\" They promptly forgot their orders and settled for spending $70M to play soldier. The two stories that are not told in this book, but are clearly apparent: 1) Russia saved the day, both for the CIA and for the Department of Defense; and 2) Saudi Arabia never came up as a serious problem that needed to be dealt with sooner than later.<br /><br />Finally, and this only became clear to me after the early months of 2003 when the obsession of a few people in the Administration brought the world to a crisis over Iraq, the book provides really excellent documentation of how a tiny minority, led by Paul Wolfowitz, basically pushed the President to treat Iraq as an alternative to substantive action on global terrorists networks, and the book documents how the uniformed leadership of the Pentagon clearly opposed this line of thinking that is unsupported by intelligence, either on Iraq, or on the relative threat of Iraq (not imminent) in relation to many other threats that are both more imminent and more costly if not addressed now.<br /><br />This is a useful book, worthy of reading, but the real story with all the details will not be known for some time.  However, in the aftermath of the failed effort in Iraq, and the clear and compelling evidence that the American people and Congress were deceived about the Iraq threat, this book has an added luster, an added value, and become a \\"must read.\\"<br /><br />Other books (see also my lists, one on Evaluating Dick Cheney, the other on The Case for Impeachment).<br />[[ASIN:1400065763 Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency]]<br />[[ASIN:0312424620 Running on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It]]<br />[[ASIN:0785262202 Breach of Trust: How Washington Turns Outsiders Into Insiders]]<br />[[ASIN:0195174461 The Broken Branch: How Congress Is Failing America and How to Get It Back on Track (Institutions of American Democracy)]]<br />[[ASIN:0670018368 Independents Day: Awakening the American Spirit]]<br />[[ASIN:0312376960 Day of Reckoning: How Hubris, Ideology, and Greed Are Tearing America Apart]]<br />[[ASIN:193213347X The Tao of Democracy: Using Co-Intelligence to Create a World That Works for All]]<br />[[ASIN:0872864758 A Power Governments Cannot Suppress]]<br />[[ASIN:0787943118 Democracy's Edge: Choosing to Save Our Country by Bringing Democracy to Life]]<br />[[ASIN:0759691681 Society's Breakthrough!: Releasing Essential Wisdom and Virtue in All the People]]principals that the U.S. military is designed to find and destroy fixed physical targets with obvious signatures; it cannot do--it is incompetent at--finding mobile targets, whether vehicles or individuals (cf. page 174)...and of course as General Clark documented in his book, and David Halberstam repeats in his most recent tome, and as the principals learned again vis a vis Afghanistan, the U.S. Army does not do mountains.

Following this short review, which was originally written for national intelligence professionals, I have added an addendum with a specific experience in France that illustrates why this book is valuable to anyone willing to take the time to reflect on its fundamentals.<br /><br />------------------------<br /><br />This may be one of the top three books I've read in the last couple of years. It is simply packed with insights that are applicable to both the classified intelligence community as well as the larger national information community. The following is a tiny taste from this very deep pool: \\"Instead of fruitlessly trying to predict the future course of a competitive or market trend, customer behavior or demand, managers should be trying to find and deploy all the tools that will enable them, in some sense, to be ever-present, ever-vigilant, and ever-ready in the brave new marketplace in gestation, where information and knowledge are ceaselessly exchanged.\\"<br /><br />-----------------------<br /><br />ADDENDUM: In coming to post the above review I noted a number of negative reviews along the lines of \\"so 1970's\\", \\"no new ideas\\", etc.  Naturally any book is going to strike people with different levels of intelligence and experience differently.  Our advice to intelligence professionals and managers at any level is to dismiss those other opinions, spend $20 and 1-2 hours with this book, and judge for yourself.  Among many reasons why we found this book meaningful, given our focus on global coverage, weak signals, and being effective in 29+ languages, is the following experience:<br /><br />In 1994, attending the French national conference on information, we heard one of the leaders of the French steel industry discussing a multi-million dollar business intelligence endeavor (in France this includes business espionage and government espionage in support of business) against steel industries around the world.  The punch line, however, was stunning.  At the end of it all, he said, they failed because they focused only on the steel industry.  In the end, the plastics industry ate their lunch because it was able to develop very good plastic substitutes for automobile parts, including automobile under-carriage parts, and this hurt the French steel industry badly.  It was from this occasion that we crafted Rule 003 (Book 2, Chapter 15) on the importance of Global Coverage, whose sub-title could be \\"cast a wide net.\\"  McKenna has the basics right.<br /><br />Fast forward to:<br />[[ASIN:1885167679 The Age of Speed: Learning to Thrive in a More-Faster-Now World]]<br />[[ASIN:0300125771 The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom]]support of business) against steel industries around the world.

This could have been a great book--indeed it could have been three great books--but in the rush to publish a second book in order to profit from the justifiable applause for his first one, the editor and publisher and author have all failed.<br />There are three articles here: the first is about the inconsistencies of the drug versus the murder laws, the number of people in jail for marijuana, and the social implications of all this; the second is on the underground economy of illegal workers and profiteering abusive corporations (McDonald's is especially evil in this depiction); and the third is about pornography but with a twist, focusing on how hotels and other major corporations are profiting.<br />The books ends with a very short but thoughtful observation regarding the need to change the law and punishment so as to back away from life-ending punishments for individual behavior that is merely self-destructive or distastement, and focus the heaviest punishments on those who commit economic crimes against society and entire sub-sections of society.<br />In each of these three cases, there are other books that are better--Deep Cover by Michael Levine on the futility of drug enforcement and the corruption of Drug Enforcement Agency &quot;suits&quot;; Forbidden Knowledge by Roger Shattuck, on pornography among other things; and The Informant by Kurt Eichenwald, on the sweetheart triangle between national-level white collar corporate criminals, big law firms, and a compliant Department of Justice that lets the richest bad guys off easy.<br />I would caution the author to not do this again--the next book had better be as good as Fast Food Nation, or he will fall into the second rank of serial writers rather than culture-changing authors, where he deserves to stay.<br />I would also encourage anyone considering buying this book to do so--it does have useful information--but more importantly, if you have not read Fast Food Nation, go to that page and think seriously about buying and reading it now--as McDonald's gets blamed overseas for being the epidemy of all that is hateful to Islamics, as Kraft Food pays lip service to healthy food in its realization that Oreo cookies are killing kids, what Eric Schlosser did in Fast Food Nation is being appreciated more and more each day--with that book, he did indeed change national consciousness, an achievement that will stand in history as a turning point in creating a healthier America.ring buying this book to do so--it does have useful information--but more importantly, if you have not read Fast Food Nation, go to that page and think seriously about buying and reading it now--as McDonald's gets blamed overseas for being the epidemy of all that is hateful to Islamics, as Kraft Food pays lip service to healthy food in its realization that Oreo cookies are killing kids, what Eric Schlosser did in Fast Food Nation is being appreciated more and more each day--with that book, he did indeed change national consciousness, an achievement that will stand in history as a turning point in creating a healthier America.	2003-07-06

Strategically, in both political and economic terms, this book is a *major* contribution to how politicians, corporate chiefs, university and school administrators, religious leaders, and individuals themselves should think about their national diet.<br /><br />In combination with \\"Pandora's Poison\\" by Joe Thorton (a book about how chlorine-based chemistry is killing both America and the Earth), this book cuts to the very innermost corners of the national soul.<br /><br />It is also more timely, in 2003, than when first published in 2001 to such acclaim, because a book called \\"Why People Hate America\\" has ably documented the Islamic and general foreign perception of how McDonald's embodies the \\"hamburger virus\\" of capitalism run amok, and Kraft Food, among others, had just recently (July 2003) announced that it is completely revisiting its edibles, now that folks are realizing that Oreo's kill kids and sodas have ten tea-spoons of sugar in every can.  Food has become a fighting matter!  Food has become a cultural litmus test, and America is failing the test.<br /><br />We have also seen SARS, monkeypox, and multiple re-emerging infectuous diseases since this book was published.  Infected fast food is a clear and present danger to the American nation.<br /><br />What I find so dazzling about this work is its thoughtful integration and explanation of how fast food not only increases the gap between the rich and the poor by killing family farms and skilled labor as fast food corporations take over both farms and animal food chains so as to de-skill them and extract every penny of profit possible, but it is increasing the prospects for deadly disease entering the national bloodstream.  If Microsoft is a \\"Dutch Elm disease\\" threat to national security in cyberspace (a view published in ComputerWorld by Paul Strassman recently after leaving his post as Director of Defense Information), then McDonalds and the other fast food companies are a threat to national security in multiple ways--by destroying diversity among farms and in eating habits that support unique food chains, by increasing the numbers of people in poverty, by creating massive means by which several different nation-wide epidemics could occur.<br /><br />Obesity is actually the least threatening outcome of a political economy that permits fast food (and still does not regulate and enforce healthy meat processing).<br /><br />At every level, from the philosophical architecture of the book, with its concern about the targeting of children as both direct clients and intermediaries in getting parents to accept bad food for their whining children, to the selection of the topics to be covered by the individual chapters, to the earnest and richly-developed sources that are quoted, this is one of the finest books among the 375 plus that I have reviewed here on Amazon.<br /><br />This book is beyond five stars.  In relation to poverty, corporate corruption, government ineffectiveness, fast food as a disease vector, and in relation to obesity as a symbol of a nation in decline, this book is about as important as a book can get.  Totally, totally awesome.

It is simply not about &quot;asymmetric warfare&quot; as Ralph Peters, G.I. Wilson, Bill Lind or any of a dozen other authors including myself might speak.  This book provides a reasoned and respectable argument against limiting in any way the degree to which strategic nuclear and conventional forces might be utilized.  The author systematically discusses operational, legal, and moral constraints that, if permitted to stand, could in effect give a challenger relying on asymmetric means something of an advantage.<br />The book does not, however, consider for a moment that our existing heavy metal military is anything other than the ideal blunt instrument with which to wreak our will.  It does not discuss asymmetric challenges as a range, it does not evaluate the effectiveness or ineffectiveness (whether operationally, or in terms of cost and sustainability) of varying alternatives for dealing with asymmetric challenges (e.g. soft power including covert action), and therefore the book should more aptly have been titled &quot;The Curtis Lemay Handbook for Squishing Mosquitoes with Multiple Nuclear Bombs&quot; or even better, &quot;Don Rumsfeld's Press Briefing on Why B-2 Bombers Were Called in Against 18 Taliban Guerrillas in Afghanistan.&quot;<br />Asymmetric warfare, this is not...	2003-07-05

Although published after 9-11, and by an author who is surely aware of the 32 failed states, 66 nations with mass migration issues, 33 countries with starvation, 59 with modern plagues, many with water scarcity and ethnic conflict--18 of which have degenerated into genocide in recent times--he marches blithly on without reference to the inherent vulnerability of the US--not just US forces, but US businesses and US citizens and US children in the heartland--to terrorism, disease, illegal immigration, and countless other threats to global stability (and therefore to US prosperity and security here behind the water's edge).<br />On balance, I do not regret buying this book.  The author provides a tedious but worthwhile examination of why so many of our entangling alliances should be brought to an end--including NATO--and on this vital point we are in agreement.  This is not, however a strategy--it is a policy, and only a half-baked policy at that, unless it is accompanied by a larger consideration of ends, ways, and means that will prevent the rest of the world from imploding in a manner most threatening to the USA.	2003-07-05

I was disappointed.  The book achieves what strike me as its rather low objectives: showcase the earnest persistent attractive self--tell the story as blandly as possible while avoiding any of the really hard issues, like why Bill had to look for satisfaction elsewhere.<br />Of note, from a national security point of view, was the complete lack of reference to intelligence as in CIA, terrorism, analysis, or anything resembling attention to the facts.  As an intelligence professional, if Hillary were to be elected President, I would worry about her appointing her hair dresser as Director of Central Intelligence.  [Henceforth, I will evaluate every Washington biography for its attention to intelligence--looking back over several hundred such biographies I was struck by how few--George Shultz being the exception--actually discuss national intelligence and its role--or failure--within the national decision making process.]<br />Over-all, this book is a fast read and if you like Hillary, you will love the book, if you hate her sight unseen you will not like the book.  What disappointed me most was that it is not the kind of analytical &quot;what went wrong, what did I learn, what would I do if I were president&quot; read that I was hoping for.  Although she lightly dissects the failure of her health care reform initiative and the terribly unjust impeachment of Bill Clinton, I walk away from this booking thinking &quot;great personality, but no architecture for the future.&quot;	2003-07-05

Every chapter is good.<br />Chapter 1 by Richard Millet does an outstanding job of discussing the global security environment in terms that make it crystal clear that the highest probability threats are non-traditional threats, generally involving non-state actors in a failed state environment.  These are not threats that can be addressed by a heavy metal military  that is not trained, equipped, nor organized for humanitarian or constabulary operations.  Among his most trenchant observations: America can not succeed when the local elites (e.g. Colombia) are not willing to pay the price for internal justice and stability; sometimes the costs of success can exceed the costs of failure (Afghanistan?); what America lacks today is any criteria by which to determine when to attempt coalition building and when to go it alone; the real threat is not any single government or non-state organization, but the millions of daily decisions (e.g. to buy cocaine or smuggle medicine) that incentivise crime and endless conflict.<br />Chapter 2 by Robert Dorff dissects existing U.S. national security &quot;strategy&quot; and shows clearly, in a non-partisan manner, that the U.S. does not have a coherent inter-agency capability for agreeing on ends, ways, or means.  He calls what we have now--both from the past under Clinton and in the present under Bush, &quot;adhocery&quot; and he makes the compelling point that our failure to have a coherent forward-looking strategy is costing the U.S. taxpayer both money and results.<br />Chapters 3-7 are each little gems.  In Chapter 3 Max Manwaring suggests that our existing assumptions about geopolitics and military power are obsolete, and we are in great danger if Americans cannot change their way of thinking about national security issues.  He suggests five remedies, the most important of which is the establishment of a coherent inter-agency planning and operational control process for leveraging all sources of national power--political, diplomatic, economic, military, and informational--simultaneously and in balance.  In Chapter 4 Edwin Corr and Max Manwaring offer a fine discourse on why legitimate governance around the world must be &quot;the&quot; end that we seek as a means of assuring American security and prosperity in the face of globalization.  Chapter 5 by Leif Rosenberger addresses the economic threats inherent in globalization, including free flows of capital, concluding that fixed exchange rates divorce countries from reality, and that the US must sponsor a global early warning system dedicated to the financial arena.  Chapter 5 by Dennis Rempe is good but too short.  He clearly identifies information power as being the equal of diplomacy, economics, and military power, going so far as to suggest an &quot;International Information Agency&quot; that could eventually become a public good as well as an objective arbiter of &quot;ground truth.&quot;  I like this idea, in part because it is consistentwith the ideas I set forth in NEW CRAFT, to wit that we need to migrate from secret intelligence intended for Presidents (who then manipulate that intelligence and lie to their people) toward public intelligence that can be discussed and understood by the people--this makes for sounder decisions.  Chapter 7, again by Edwin Corr and Max Manwaring, discusses deterrence in terms of culture, motive, and effect--they are especially good in pointing out that traditional deterrence is irrelevant with suicidal martyrs, and that the best deterrence consists of the education of domestic publics about the realities of the post-Cold War world.<br />The book concludes with 2 chapters, the first by Edwin Corr and Max Manwaring, who discuss how values (education, income, civic virtue) must be the foundation of the American security strategy.  They then translate this into some specific &quot;objectives&quot; for overseas investments and influences by the U.S., and they conclude that the ultimate investment must be in better educating both domestic and international audiences.  They recommend the legitimacy of all governments as a global objective; End-State Planning (ESP) as the way to get there; and a new focus on holistic and long-term programs rather than &quot;adhocery&quot; as the best way to manage scarce means.  One can only speculate how differently Afghanistan and Iraq (and Haiti, now discarded for a decade) might have turned out if the US had rolled in with a Marshall Plan or Berlin Airlift equivalent the minute organized hostilities ceased.  Robert Dorff closes the book by pointing out that state failure is not the root cause, but rather the symptom, and that the U.S. must intervene before a state fails, not after.<br />I recommend this book, together with Colin Gray's &quot;Modern Strategy&quot; as essential reading for any national security professional.  The publishers should consider issuing a more affordable paperback (books cost a penny a page to produce, perhaps a penny a page to market, so anything over $5 on this book is pure profit).  This is a book, like Harry Summers on strategy, that should be available for $15 in paperback--if it were, I would buy 200 for my next conference.onsistent with the ideas I set forth in NEW CRAFT, to wit that we need to migrate from secret intelligence intended for Presidents (who then manipulate that intelligence and lie to their people) toward public intelligence that can be discussed and understood by the people--this makes for sounder decisions.

He has written an extraordinary book that ordinary people will take to be a sensationalist travel guide, while real experts scrutinize every page for the hard truths about the real world that neither the CIA nor the media report.  The 5th Edition is even better than the earlier version that I distributed to all the professional intelligence officers attending the annual Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) conference, so I am going to distribute the new improved version.<br />Unlike clandestine case officers and normal foreign service officers, all of them confined to capital cities and/or relying on third party reporting, Robert Young Pelton actually goes to the scene of the fighting, the scene of the butchery, the scene of the grand thefts, and unlike all these so-called authoritative sources, he actually has had eyeballs on the targets and boots in the mud.<br />I have learned two important lessons from this book, and from its author Robert Young Pelton:<br />First, trust no source that has not actually been there. He is not the first to point out that most journalists are \\"hotel warriors\\", but his veracity, courage, and insights provide compelling evidence of what journalism could be if it were done properly. Government sources are even worse--it was not until I heard him speak candidly about certain situations that I realized that most of our Embassy reporting--both secret and open--is largely worthless because it is third hand, not direct.<br />Second, I have learned from this book and the author that sometimes the most important reason for visiting a war zone is to learn about what is NOT happening. His accounts of Chechnya, and his personal first-hand testimony that the Russians were terrorizing their Muslims in the *absence* of any uprising or provocation, are very disturbing. His books offers other accounts of internal terrorism that are being officially ignored by the U.S. Government, and I am most impressed by the value of his work as an alternative source of \\"national intelligence\\" and \\"ground truth\\".<br />There are a number of very important works now available to the public on the major threats to any country's national security, and most of them are as unconventional as this one--Laurie Garrett on public health, Marq de Villiers on Water, Joe Thorton on chlorine-based industry and the environment--and some, like Robert D. Kaplan's books on his personal travels, are moving and inspiring reflections on reality as few in the Western world could understand it--but Robert Young Pelton is in my own mind the most structured, the most competent, the most truthful, and hence the most valuable reporter of fact on the world's most dangerous places.<br />What most readers may not realize until they read this book is that one does not have to travel to these places to be threatened by them--what is happening there today, and what the U.S. government does or does not do about developments in these places, today, will haunt this generation and many generations to follow. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who cares to contemplate the real world right now.eing officially ignored by the U.S. Government, and I am most impressed by the value of his work as an alternative source of \\"national intelligence\\" and \\"ground truth\\". <br />There are a number of very important works now available to the public on the major threats to any country's national security, and most of them are as unconventional as this one--Laurie Garrett on public health, Marq de Villiers on Water, Joe Thorton on chlorine-based industry and the environment--and some, like Robert D.

Hoover was clearly to blame for a culture of hostility between the two agencies and between the FBI and military intelligence--in one instance he actually suppressed early knowledge of Japanese intentions on Pearl Harbor obtained from a German agent tasked to fulfill their targeting requirements.<br />In later years the CIA took on more responsibility for shutting out the FBI, consistently refusing to brief them in to either internal counterintelligence failures, or foreign operations with a strong domestic counterintelligence matter.<br />What the author has done in the aftermath of 9-11 is update the book and make it even more relevant to every citizen and every elected official and every bureaucrat.  The earlier edition made me very angry about how the senior FBI bureaucracy can sacrifice the national interest at the altar of its own selfish agenda of self-preservation and aggrandizement--from Special Agent Rowley to Special Agent Robert Wright, the FBI leadership consistently spends more time censoring and punishing its own people for honesty, than it does chasing terrorists.  This new improved edition should make every citizen, every voter angry, and they should instruct their elected representatives that the time has come for a National Security Act that finally reforms national foreign intelligence, military intelligence, and law enforcement intelligence, and in passing, creates the homeland security intelligence act to create a federated system of state and local intelligence and counterintelligence cadres that operate under the jurisdiction of governors and mayors rather than the federal government.<br />Pogo had it right: we have met the enemy and he is us.ary intelligence, and law enforcement intelligence, and in passing, creates the homeland security intelligence act to create a federated system of state and local intelligence and counterintelligence cadres that operate under the jurisdiction of governors and mayors rather than the federal government.<br />Pogo had it right: we have met the enemy and he is us.	2003-06-19

Between aging and unrepentent faculty, the vanishing of liberal arts (or even quality education) for undergraduates, and the prostitution of graduate education to commercial purposes, there does appear to be a crisis.<br />After noting that America appears to spend more on prisons than on universities, the author makes several recommendations, all of which appear sensible.  They include a new emphasis on university support to primary and secondary education, a rationalization of information technology within communities to better link businesses with members of the university family, the exploration of distance learning alternatives (as much to reach the drop-outs inexpensively as for any other reason), and the resurrection of mid-career education or continuing education as a mainstream expectation for personal as well as business advancement.<br />The author, who clearly has a very strong ethical perspective, quotes Alfred North Whitehead, who concluded that any society that &quot;does not value trained intelligence is doomed&quot; and adds his own view, that &quot;the university that does not fully dedicate itself above all else to the continuing advancement of trained intelligence is also doomed.&quot;<br />This is a really fine book that should be in the library of anyone seeking to understand &quot;national intelligence&quot; as Thomas Jefferson understood it when he said &quot;A Nation's best defense is an educated citizenry.&quot;ntelligence&quot; as Thomas Jefferson understood it when he said &quot;A Nation's best defense is an educated citizenry.&quot;	2003-06-18

The prostitution of the universities, and the blandness of undergraduate education, are issued that will not be solved by any one community, any one state, or even by Congress.  This is going to require a President committed to national education and public health as the \\"first plank\\" of any national strategy to united and nurture what I think of as the \\"seven intelligence tribes\\": national (spies and counterspies), military, law enforcement, business, academic, non-profit and media, and religions-clans-citizens.<br />As we have seen in time since 9-11, all of these tribes appear to be failing--national on 9-11, military in Afghanistan and Iraq, law enforcement on Hamas and Pakistani terrorists still active within the US, business in general (Boeing being had by Airbus, for example), now in this book, the universities, the failure of the media to support the debate on going to war with Iraq, and of the New York Times in ethics specifically, the self-indulgent failure of the Catholic Church to police its own priests--this is not a pretty picture.  In all of this, the university is central to the creation of a public that should be fully versed in \\"civitas\\" and electing public officials who are liberally educated as well as scientifically trained.  That does not appear to be happening.  This book helps explain why.	2003-06-18

A book of this importance would indeed have benefited from an international advisory board of public health, medical, insurance, and policy experts; it would certainly have benefited from greater structure, firmer editing, and a foreword by someone like a former Surgeon General of the United States. As it is, it appears to have overcome these deficiencies with hyped-up marketing and sweetheart reviews, and this in some ways counterproductive because this book could have, should have, become a mainstream topic in the Presidential campaign. It failed to do so for several reasons, not least of which is the propensity of both candidates and their advisors to avoid serious thinking, but also because the book is not helpful to a popular understanding of the very real global and domestic threats to the health of our children today and in future generations. Having said all this, I commend the book for its content and do not recommend it as avocational reading. There are some very important points that the book brings out, and I will itemize these in order of importance: 1) Public health is about detection and prevention, medicine is about remediation. In the long run, investments in public health are vastly cheaper and more effective than after-the-fact medical intervention; 2) The insurance industry in the developing world has failed to support public health investments, and in a remarkable collusion with the pharmaceutical, hospital and managed health care industries, has created a very expensive and increasingly ineffective system focused on drugs (to which diseases are increasingly resistant) and hospitals; 3) Hospitals are no longer reliable in terms of protecting patients from both error and secondary infection from other patients. People are coming out of hospitals, in many cases, with more diseases than when they went in; 4) The health of our nation depends on the health of all other nations-not only does a collapse of public health in Africa lead to failed states and forced migrations, but it also is but an airline flight away from infecting Kansas; 5) Clean drinking water, uninfected food, and good environmental and occupational health conditions are at risk in many parts of the United States and Europe, not only in Russia and the rest of the world; 6) The United Nations, and the World Health Organization in particular, are in disarray and ineffective-in large part because of a lack of support from member nations-at dealing with the public health commons. There is no question but that the author has hit a \\"home run\\" in terms of describing the harsh reality of epidemics in India and Africa, the collapse of public health in Russia, the rapid migration of many diseases from Russia through Germany to the rest of Europe and the U.S., and the severe costs in the U.S. of a retreat from the collective good with respect to public health. Unfortunately, it is a home run hit in isolation, not a game-winning home run, because it fails to drive home, to the only audience that matters-the U.S. voter-exactly what political and economic initiatives are required to achieve three simple objectives: 1) re-establish the public health infrastructure in the U.S.; 2) redirect the entire health care industry toward preventive measures-including water and food quality controls-instead of remedial prescriptions; and 3) provide compelling incentives to the rest of the world for cleaning their own house (this presumes that we are able to clean our own first, a very questionable assumption at this point in time). This is a valuable book, a five in terms of intent, a three in terms of execution, and I am glad that I took the time to read it. It provides a wonderful foundation for enjoying, at an intellectual and policy level, the medical and public health novels by Robin Cook.pends on the health of all other nations-not only does a collapse of public health in Africa lead to failed states and forced migrations, but it also is but an airline flight away from infecting Kansas; 5) Clean drinking water, uninfected food, and good environmental and occupational health conditions are at risk in many parts of the United States and Europe, not only in Russia and the rest of the world; 6) The United Nations, and the World Health Organization in particular, are in disarray and ineffective-in large part because of a lack of support from member nations-at dealing with the public health commons.

Robert Kaplan has written many books examining failed states and lower tier nations and come to the same conclusion with respect to democracy, while George Soros has published &quot;The Crisis of Global Capitalism.&quot;  More subtly, Thomas Stewart, in &quot;The Wealth of Knowledge&quot;, slams much of what passes for effective industrial and corporate organization as archaic and inappropriate to the new environment.<br />What I found most intersting, having spent much of my life in Asia and Latin America, and been close to some Chinese elements in Singapore, was that much of the author's case is based on Chinese examples, not American.  This makes the book especially valuable to Americans, because when she speaks of a world on fire and the dangers of ethnic conflict coming out from under market-dominant minorities, she is speaking about Chinese examples, not American examples.  As the Godfather would say, &quot;This is not personal, this is business.&quot;<br />The author ends with a number of recommendations that appear sensible, but that at this point have no hope of every being considered by the US or other Western powers--or in China.  The author's recommendations require an educated public exercising its political power in the pursuit of both global stabilization and national prosperity as seen through a long-term lens.  It may take another 9-11, the meltdown of Arabia, and several more genocides in Malaysia and Indonesia, the utter chaos in the Congo, the Ivory Coast, Sudan, and Burundi, to name just four failed states that are testing the United Nations, before the public ultimately realizes that what is exported overseas &quot;in their name&quot; ultimately comes home on fire.  The book is well-titled, the author's thesis is important, and those who do not like this book are well-qualified to represent the problematic organizations that the author is discussing.to name just four failed states that are testing the United Nations, before the public ultimately realizes that what is exported overseas &quot;in their name&quot; ultimately comes home on fire.

Not this book--this book is one of the finest, most intelligent, most easily understood programs for action I have ever seen.  The book as a whole, and the 20 problem statements specifically, are concise, illustrated, and sensible.<br />The author breaks the 20 issues into 3 groups.  Group one (sharing our planet)includes global warming; biodiversity and ecosystem losses, fisheries depletion, deforestation, water deficits, and maritime safety and pollution.  Group two (sharing our humanity) includes massive step-up in the fight against poverty, peacekeeping-conflict prevention-combatting terrorism, education for all, global infectuous diseases, digital divide, and natural disaster prevention and mitigation.  Group three (sharing our rule book) includes reinventing taxation for the 21st century, biotechnology rules, global financial architecture, illegal drugs, trade-investment-competition rules, intellectual property rights, e-commerce rules, and international labor and migration rules.<br />The author's core concept for dealing with these complex issues intelligently, while recognizing that \\"world government\\" is not an option, lies with his appreciation of the Internet and how global issues networks could be created that would be a vertical complement to the existing horizontal elements of each national government.<br />The footnotes and index are professional,  but vastly more important, the author's vision is combined with practicality.  This is a \\"doable-do\\" and this book is therefore my number one reading recommendation for any citizen buying just one book of the 360+ that I have recommended within Amazon.  Superb.	2003-05-29

The book loses one star to poor decisions by the editors and publishers on dark paper, single spacing, small almost crowded type, and an over-all look and feel that makes this book annoying and difficult to read.<br />The authors discuss and document ten points in each of ten chapters:<br />1) The tyranny of the minorities has reached its ultimate peversion--single individuals, well-educated, well-off, get what they want, and the poor masses lose the power that came from groups with diverse backgrounds.<br />2)  Citizenship has lost its meaning--taxation is automatic, and the US can be said to be back in a situation where the broad masses are experiencing &quot;taxation without representation.&quot;<br />3) Elections now feature only the intensely loyal minority from each of the two major parties--the bulk of the voters have dropped out and elections are thus not representative of the wishes of the larger community.<br />4) Patronage has changed, with corporations rather than citizens getting to feed at the public trough, and the focus being on influencing policy after election, never mind who the people elected.  The authors also do an excellent job of discussing polling and the manner in which it misrepresents the actual concerns and beliefs of the people.<br />5)  Three chapters--one called &quot;Disunited We Stand&quot;, a second called &quot;From Masses to Mailing Lists, and a third called &quot;Movements without Members&quot; all make more or less the same point, but in different ways: political mobilization--people actually joining, doing, writing, demanding--are out, and instead we have micro groups, sometimes actually limited to the employed staff of an advocacy group, that raise funds, take stands, and get what they want, without ever having actually mobilized people to come together in a political manner.<br />6) A very thoughtful chapter covers the manner in which law suits and the judiciary have become a new battleground, a means of overturning laws and regulations made by the legislative and executive branches.  While the authors do not go into the recent scams where a &quot;nature conservation&quot; non-profit sells prime environmental land to rich people below cost, and then accepts their tax-deductible contributions, they might also have explored how the law is being used to subvert the public interest, often with the help of the very &quot;advocacy groups&quot; that are nominally representing the public interest.<br />7) The authors do an excellent job of discussing how the out-sourcing of government functions to private enterprises undermines accountability and lead to severe abuse.  Similarly, non-profits, including notional churches and other tax dodges, can enjoy enormous public subsidization in the way of tax breaks, while giving less than they should to the public treasury.<br />8)  The author's end by asking &quot;Does Anyone Need Citizens?&quot; and the last two words in the book are &quot;Who cares?&quot;  Today, the Administration's answer would clearly be &quot;no&quot;, we don't need citizens.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of the US public is both uninformed, and unengaged.  Citizens have allowed themselves to be side-lined, and by this excellent account from the authors, should they choose to re-engage, they will have very hard work in front of them as they seek to overturn a half-century of deliberate ventures all seeking to reduce citizenship, increase bureaucracy, and reward corporate patrons of individual politicians who choose not to act in the public interest, but only their own.s the manner in which law suits and the judiciary have become a new battleground, a means of overturning laws and regulations made by the legislative and executive branches.

Books	5	186	221	N	N	Ben Franklin &amp; James Madison Would Have Praised This Book	The heart of this book is not why people hate America, but rather on how Americans have lost touch with reality.<br />This book joins three others books I have reviewed and recommend separately, as the &quot;quartet for revolution&quot; in how Americans must demand access to reliable information about the real world.  They are Bill McKibben on &quot;The Age of Missing Information&quot; (a day in the woods contrasted with a year reviewing a day's worth of non-information on broadcast television); Anne Branscomb's &quot;Who Owns Information&quot; (not the citizen); and Roger Shattuck, &quot;Forbidden Knowledge.&quot;  These are the higher level books--there are many others, both on the disgrace of the media and the abuse of secrecy by government, as well as on such excellent topics as &quot;Who Will Tell the People: The Betrayal of American Democracy&quot; by William Greider, and &quot;The Closing of the American Mind&quot; by Allan Bloom.<br />Here are a few points made by this book that every American needs to understand if we are to restore true democracy, true freedom of the press, and true American values to our foreign policy, which has been hijacked by neo-conservative corporate interests:<br />1)  &quot;Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.&quot;  Dr. Samuel Johnson said this in 1775, on the eve of US revolution from British tyranny.  When patriotism is used to suppress dissent, to demand blind obedience, and to commit war crimes &quot;in our name,&quot; then patriotism has lost its meaning.<br />2) According to the authors, Robert Kaplan and Thomas Friedman are flat out *wrong* when they suggest that &quot;they&quot; hate us for our freedoms, the success of our economy, for our rich cultural heritage. Most good-hearted Americans simply have no idea how big the gap is between our perception of our goodness and the rest of the world's perception of our badness (in terms set forth below).<br />3) According to the authors, a language dies every two weeks.  Although there are differing figures on how many languages are still active today (between 3,000 and 5,500), the point is vital.  If language is the ultimate representation of a distinct and unique culture that is ideally suited to the environment in which it has flourished over the past millenium, then the triple strikes of English displacing the language, the American &quot;hamburger virus&quot; and city planning displacing all else, and American policy instruments--inclusive of the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund--eliminating any choices before the Third World or even the European policy makers, then America can be said to have been invasive, predatory, and repressive.  At multiple levels, from &quot;hate&quot; by Islamic fundamentalists, to &quot;fear and disdain&quot; by French purists, to &quot;annoyance&quot; by Asians to &quot;infatuation&quot; by teenagers, the Americans are seen as way too big for their britches--Americans are the proverbial bull in the china shop, and their leaders lack morals--the failure of America to ratify treaties that honor the right of children to food and health, the failure of America to respect international conventions-the average of two military interventions a year since the Cold War (not to mention two countries invaded but not rescued), all add up to \\"blowback.\\"<br />4) According to the authors, America is &quot;out of control&quot; largely because the people who vote and pay taxes are uninformed.  The authors of this book are most articulate.  Consider the following quote: &quot;And the power of the American media, as we repeatedly argue, works to keep American people closed to experience and ideas from the rest of the world and thereby increases the insularity, self-absorption, and ignorance that is the overriding problem the rest of the world has with American.&quot;<br />5) According to the authors, the impact of America overseas can be best summed up as a &quot;hamburger virus&quot; that comes as a complete package, and is especially pathological.  McDonalds &quot;serves&quot; rather than &quot;feeds&quot;.  The &quot;hamburger culture&quot; is eradicating indigenous cultures everywhere, and often this is leading, decades later, to the realization that those cultures had thrived because they were well suited to the environment--the &quot;hamburger culture&quot; assumes that electricity will provide for air conditioning, that everyone can afford a car once the cities have been paved over, etcetera.  When this turns out to not be the case, the losses that have occurred over decades cannot be turned back, and poverty, as well as ethnic strife, are the result.<br />6) Finally--and the authors have many other points to make in this excellent book, but this is the last one for this &quot;summative&quot; evaluation of their work--according to the authors the USA is what could be considered the ultimate manifestation of the &quot;eighth crusade&quot;, with Christopher Columbus and the destruction of the native American Indians (both North and South) having been the seventh crusade.  The authors are most interesting as they define the predominantly Catholic edicts from the Pope and from Kings and Queens, that declared that anyone not speaking their language (and therefore not able to understand their edicts) was a savage, an animal, and therefore suitable for enslavement.  In the eyes of much of the world, America is a culturally-oppressive force that is enslaving local governments and local economies for the benefit of a select wealthy elite that live in gated compounds, while demeaning, demoting, and destroying the balance of power and the balance with nature and the balance among tribes, that existed prior to the arrival of American &quot;gunboat diplomacy&quot; and &quot;banana capitalism.&quot;<br />There you have it.  According to the authors:<br />1) Americans are uninformed about the real world<br />2) Americans are not in charge of their own foreign policy<br />3) What is done in the name of all Americans is severely detrimental to the rest of the world, and Americans will pay a heavy price if they allow this &quot;hamburger/gunboat imperialism&quot; to continue.<br />May God have mercy on our souls, for we know not what we do.virus&quot; that comes as a complete package, and is especially pathological.

1111384:US	50761804	R24KXM1UPZQGKH	0300100019	940983123	The Work of the University	Books	3	4	8	N	Y	Well-Intentioned, Dangerously Narrow	I read this book at the same time that I read the book by Ziauddin Sardar and Merryl Wyn Davies, \\"WHY DO PEOPLE HATE AMERICA\\" because the central thesis of this other book is that Americans are uniformed about the real world, have no control over their own foreign policy, and what is being done in America's name overseas is severely detrimental to both the security and prosperity of the rest of the world, and thus, somewhat directly these days, to that of America.<br />Somewhat to my surprise, for I expect more from a Yale person (a lesser person would have received four stars--I hold university presidents, and Yale over Harvard or Stanford, to a higher standard) this book was not only disappointing, it confirmed the basic thesis of the Sardar-Davies volume.<br />The author of the book, \\"The Work of the University\\", is clearly educated, articulate, and well-intentioned.  The book shows, throughout, that he is a committed and talented advocate for education as a process that evolves values and the capacity for critical thinking; that he understands the relationship of the University to its alumni, its host city, and the nation at large; and--in an antiseptic sort of way--that China, to take the one example prominent in his book--merits attention, both as a source of students and a host for joint educational ventures.<br />Early in the book, I thought I was in for a treat when the author, in one of his welcoming speeches to a new class (this is a book of past speeches, not an integrated work) says: \\"You have the most to learn from those who are least like you; they will challenge you by asking questions you should ask yourself.\\" The rest of the book helped me understand that these \\"others\\" consisted of the Yale faculty and the Yale students, the latter predominantly American but with a full leaving of homogenized wealthy international students all dressed alike in Abercombie & Fitch ensembles.<br />The book went downhill from there.  Although the author makes passing references to overseas problems including genocides, it did not offer me the compelling mission statement I was expecting, of the university as the soul of a nation, the custodian of intellectual values and global awareness, the one place where tenure as well as enlightenment might combine to shed the light of truth on all manner of domestic and foreign policy.<br />Yale can and should be a \\"Citizen's Intelligence Network\\" that trains students to think critically, in the context of very strong moral values, such that a Yale student is by any standard a global thinker and actor.  That kind of compelling \\"pragmatic missionary\\" perspective is not reflected in this book.<br />George Will, \\"Statecraft as Soulcraft,\\", Yale Business School Dean Garten on \\"The Politics of Fortune,\\" these come closer to \\"the work of the university\\" than does this book.references to overseas problems including genocides, it did not offer me the compelling mission statement I was expecting, of the university as the soul of a nation, the custodian of intellectual values and global awareness, the one place where tenure as well as enlightenment might combine to shed the light of truth on all manner of domestic and foreign policy.<br />Yale can and should be a \\"Citizen's Intelligence Network\\" that trains students to think critically, in the context of very strong moral values, such that a Yale student is by any standard a global thinker and actor.

I hope that my review will provide a more balanced appreciation of this extraordinary book by an extraordinary former American of Jordanian extraction who, as a Princeton-educated professional, married to the King of Jordan, is able to summarize her life's work of building better bridges between the Arab world and the west.<br />I note as a preface that I am aware of the Jordanian hospital for terrorists recovering from combat wounds, that there are many things still running against the people in Jordan.  However, what I find in this double-spaced book--by no means a work of scholarship--is a personal story that is rich with wisdom, integrity, and insights into differing perspectives.<br />The true beginning of the book comes on page 32, when the author, then a student at Princeton, learned of the death of four students and injury of nine students at Kent State University at the hands of an undisciplined Ohio National Guard armed with real bullets.  Most Americans over 40 will never forget the photo of the young woman kreening over one of the dead.  That shooting leads to the following sentence in the book: \\"It was a seminal moment in shaping my view of American society.  While I loved my country, I found my trust in its institutions badly shaken.\\"<br />The value of the book for me is in the author's credible discussion of what she calls \\"a fundamental lack of understanding in the West, especially in the United States, of Middle Eastern culture and the Muslim faith.\\"  I took the entire book on faith myself--while rabid Jews may not agree, I am prepared to believe that Queen Noor has not been brainwashed, and that she is offering all readers a personal perspective on Arabs, Muslims, Israel, the Gulf War, the impact of US policies in creating millions of refugees and tens of thousands of dead, and so on.  If anything, the book, one of hundreds I have read in the past several years, confirms my growing sense of ignorance.  Every additional book I read in this area seems to confirm how little any one person can know, and how duplicitious and misleading most official accounts, or media stories, are.  We have a long way to go in truly understanding one another, and we can all start by a) reading and b) discussing.  Attacking this book, and this Queen, is not helpful.<br />Although I was was somewhat aware of the fact that Israel is in violation of United Nations resolutions calling for a separate and equal Palestine state, as well as compensation to the Palestinians driven from their lands and also are of the somewhat rocky start in the area from British mandates and Israeli terrorism utilized to drive the British from the area, I was unaware of Mahatma Ghandi's statement, \\"Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French.  What is going on in Palestine today cannot be justified by any moral code of conduct.\\"<br />The bulk of the book is less about affairs of state than it is about the loneliness of a Queen whose husband is public property and who never has any privacy.  It is, none-the-less, an absorbing personal account of many specific people and their ethics--one comes away dismayed that Barbara Bush would send word to Queen Noor that she was a traitor to America, and pleasantly surprised to find that Prince Charles proved to be the only balanced courteous English leader at a critical time.<br />At the end of the book, and this no doubt explains the hysterical Jewish attacks against this Queen, mother, and author, I was persuaded of three things: 1) the US public and the US government does not have a good grip on Arab politics, culture, or needs; 2) the combination of Jewish power within US policy; Arab inattention to playing US politics from within; and the Zionist \\"myths\\" that take on a life of their own, are a major reason why US policy is ineffective and unsustainable in the long run within this vital area; and 3) Queen Noor was as good a queen as the Jordanianpeople could have hoped for, given the circumstances.  This book was well worth my time, and I recommend it to every citizen who wishes to reduce conflict, increase understanding, and obtain a better return on how the U.S. taxpayer dollar is spent.Jordanian people could have hoped for, given the circumstances.

There is also much that is missing.  On balance, it is essential reading.<br />It's most important flaw is that the author completely discounts the possibility that suicidal terrorism might be both a rational strategy, and an inherent instinctive, acceptable means, for those groups whose religions and cultural dynamics literally groom children from birth for a glorious exit as a martyr.  COnsider the following, inserted to document this most important flaw in the book, from US News U.S. expert: Suicide bombers are not crazy by Haaretz Via Virtual Jerusalem News (Israel)on 24 May 2003: SAN FRANCISCO - A top expert on the psychology of terrorism who spent two decades in the CIA said on Thursday that suicide bombers are not crazy and are often seen as models of exemplary behavior in their societies.  Jerrold Post, who founded the Central Intelligence Agency's Center for the Analysis of Personality and Political Behavior, presented his findings after interviewing 21 radical Islamic extremists in Israeli and Palestinian prisons. \\"We should not think of these individuals as crazed fanatics, as seriously psychiatrically ill,\\" he told the American Psychiatric Association's annual meeting. ... \\"These are very normal-sounding individuals who have basically been bred to hate from very early on,\\" he said.<br /><br />I leave it at that.  Having addressed the negative up front, I now will emphasize the positives that demand this book be in the forefront of any discussion about dealing with terrorism.<br />First off, of all the books I have read on terrorism, most by either researchers or investigators of former spies, this is the one whose author is, by any standard, the most educated, most logical, most grounded in the precepts of rational law, and most articulate on why governments need to have firm and constant policies for dealing with terrorism in such as way as to \\"discourage others.\\"<br />Second, the author's 22-page list of acts of Palestinian terrorism that went unchecked prior to 9-11, is alone worth the price of the book.  While I do agree with one other reviewer who suggests that the author is obsessing on Palestinian terrorism (as opposed to Saudi or Pakistani or Egyptian-sponsored terrorism), he has a point and this list merits close attention.<br />Third, although I may not agree with all of his recommendations for imposing internal security while sacrificing considerable civil liberties, this is as close as I have seen anyone get to a comprehensive practical list of things that need to be done, to include controlling the media so that terrorists are not rewarded with publicity.<br />There is one minor shortcoming in the book--minor because so many of us have documented this across 15+ books in the 1999-2002 period: the author does not truly comprehend the ineptitude of the US Government, with its 1950's mind-sets, 1970's information technology, and 1990's ideologies that place cheap oil and tax cuts above homeland security and economic sustainability.  As a remedy to the author's shortcomings in this area I recommend Robert Baer, SEE NO EVIL (on the CIA's inability to penetrate terrorist groups), and a combination of books on the FBI's ineptitude: Aqil Collins, My Jihad, and Anonymous, TERRORIST HUNTER--most interestingly, both a US mujahid that has lost a leg to combat, and an Israeli researcher on US terrorism, agree that the FBI is extraordinarly inept, and remains so two years after 9-11.<br />This is an intelligent book that requires discipline to appreciate--it cannot be accepted without question, but it also cannot be ignored.

In the aftermath of 9-11 I was thinking about moving to Smith Mountain Lake, four hours drive to the South of Washington, D.C., and I wanted a sense of whether &quot;general aviation&quot; might provide me with a once a week &quot;commuter solution&quot; for getting back up to the National Capitol Area.<br />The book is fully satisfactory.  While some might complain that it tells a personal story, I found this perfectly useful as a means of understanding both the pros and cons of airline travel through &quot;hubs&quot; that impose time loss on the passengers for the convenience of the commercial airline companies, versus &quot;general aviation&quot; which allows point to point travel.<br />Most interesting to me was learning that with the hubs and the problems inherent in airline travel today, the average speed for any trip by air can be just about the same as the average speed if going by car--60 miles per hour.<br />I ended this book with three understandings that more than warranted its purchase:<br />1)  I, a non-pilot, could easily learn to fly and it would not only be worth my while, but great fun as well.<br />2)  General aviation, while not as robust as it could be, is alive and well in America, and new solutions (including an airplane that comes with its own parachute, lowering the entire plane, with passengers, in the event of an engine failure) are there.<br />3)  NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Agency) does a lot more than space flight--I was quite astonished to find that they are heavily engaged in thinking about general aviation solutions, and generally optemistic that in an era when time is the most precious commodity, and general aviation may be a solution for many businessmen as well as traveling families that shy away from the nightmare of getting kids through airports.<br />Bottom line: a great read, a great buy, and a vision into the future that is practical and fun.	2003-05-24

I have, however, decided to leave my review intact because she tells a very good story and its key points are right on target.  I recommend the book for purchase by all--on balance it is a fine contribution.<br />----<br />Although there are no endorsements or other means of validating the truth of this book, and \\"woman with four-children\\" may be a cover for a hyper-active Israeli man in his mid-20's who is of Arab descent, it reads with enormous credibility, it is loaded with correct references, and its many anecdotes about both the value of public records (open sources) and U.S. federal government ineptitude (especially the FBI but also including State, AID, INS, and the CIA) are in my opinion spot on.<br />This book is an excellent companion to Steven Emerson's book, AMERICAN JIHAD: The Terrorists Living Among Us. Indeed, it has occurred to me that the anonymous author of this book is, if not working directly for Emerson, then possibly in one of the Jewish-funded research elements that he relies upon for research assistance.<br />Among the many compelling points that I found to recommend the purchase and reading of this book are:<br />1) Israeli McCarthyism against any Jew willing to express need for a Palestinian state as part of regional stabilization<br />2) The Rabin assassination as the Israeli equivalent of the US Kennedy assassination--everyone remembers where they were<br />3) The vital importance of reading all Islamic charity information in Arabic, where the messages are violent and subversive--English for the fund-raising, Arabic for the incitement to terrorism<br />4) The catastrophic cost of American naivete pre-9-11 in putting all religious and charitable organizations off limits to US counterintelligence, however inept it might have been<br />5) The extraordinary utility of public records, not just within the US but from Israel and the Arab states, in nailing down relationships among charitable organizations, Saudi financiers, and specific individual terrorists<br />6) The extraordinary utility of historical (back ten years) Arabic newsletters and newspapers in nailing threatening statements and jihad intentions of people applying for US citizenship or already US citizens, because the federal government has no clue how to do proper open source research<br />7) The accuracy of the 1990 predictions of American proponents of jihad who claimed that the US's ultimate intent was to \\"occupy the Arab and Islamic oil sources\\"<br />8) The degree to which African Americans have been pulled into the jihad-aspects of Muslim extremism as practiced and preached in the US<br />9) The ineptitude of the FBI's \\"knock knock\\" neighborhood canvassing approach to basic information, completelely eschewing proper open source research and proper undercover collection<br />10) The ineptitude of the FBI in particular, but the US government in general, in sharing information about terrorists and their organizations (we are amused to note that Aqil Collins, in My Jihad, is virulent on this topic--evidently one thing both mujahids and Israeli counter-terrorism researchers can agree upon is that the FBI was and remains inept)<br />11) The suspect loyalties and competence of the FBI liaison to Saudi Arabia, who is of Muslim faith and refused to do proper undercover work against other Muslims while posted in the US<br />12) The pervasive and deep Saudi financial links to all aspects of US Muslim extremism, to include funding for mosques intended to be centers for radicalization over the long term<br />13) The early open source literature on how Bin Laden decided to apply his construction expertise to solving both smuggling and storage and protection issues in Afghanistan (we have in other reviews noted the importance ofthe book on Vietnamese tunnels, titled \\"The Tunnels of Cu Chi\\")<br />As I finished the book, I agreed completely with the author's basic premise, to the effect that open source information about US terrorist and charity ties, properly validated, should be posted to the Internet for all to see. This appears to be the only proper response to continuing federal ineptitude. The author is compelling in stating that in the years since 9-11, very little has improved. The FBI continues to refuse to share, the State Department continues to be incompetent at screening terrorists out (and in one instance, allowed the Agency for International Development to offer funding to a known terrorist organization), the list goes on.<br />This is a very impressive personal account. The author's proven accomplishments, well-documented in the book, lend credence to the value of open sources and methods in the war on terrorism--and lend credence to the legitimate concerns of citizens who are overly trusting in their federal government, which appears to still be, 2 years after 9-11, massively inept.ietnamese tunnels, titled \\"The Tunnels of Cu Chi\\")<br />As I finished the book, I agreed completely with the author's basic premise, to the effect that open source information about US terrorist and charity ties, properly validated, should be posted to the Internet for all to see.

1113090:US	50761804	R2HLEPB07KCGKR	0679463097	695257819	The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB	Books	5	124	133	N	Y	Extraordinary--Substantive History--Real World Good Stuff	This book is a fine read, and to my surprise, the contributions from The New York Times are quite worthwhile. In essence the primary author, Milton Beardon, wrote the core of the book, on his experiences with the Soviet Division in the Directorate of Operations at the CIA, and in Afghanistan and Pakistan driving the Soviets in Afghanistan, and then journalist James Risen filled in the gaps with really excellent vignettes from the other side. The two authors together make a fine team, and they have very capably exploited a number of former KGB and GRU officers whose recollections round out the story.<br />This is not, by any means, a complete story. At the end of thise review I recommend five other books that add considerable detail to a confrontation that spanned the globe for a half-century. Yet, while it barely scratches the surface, this book is both historical and essential in understanding two facts:<br />1) Afghanistan was the beginning of the end for USSR and<br />2) CIA made it happen, once invigorated by President Ronald Reagan and DCI William Casey<br />It may not be immediately apparent to the casual reader, but that is the most important story being told in this book: how the collapse of the Soviet effort in Afghanistan ultimately led to the collapse of Soviet authority in East Germany, in the other satellite states, and eventually to the unification of Germany and the survival of Russas as a great state but no longer an evil empire.<br />There are two other stories in this book, and both are priceless. The first is a tale of counterintelligence failure across the board within both the CIA and the FBI. The author excels with many \\"insider\\" perspectives and quotes, ranging from his proper and brutal indictment of then DCI Stansfield Turner for destroying the clandestine service, to his quote from a subordinate, based on a real-world case, that even the Ghanians can penetrate this place. He has many \\"lessons learned\\" from the Howard and Ames situations, including how badly the CIA handled Howard's dismissal, how badly CIA handled Yuchenko, to include leaking his secrets to the press, how badly both CIA and FBI handled the surveillance on Howard, with too many \\"new guys\\" at critical points of failure; and most interestingly, how both DCI Casey and CIA counterintelligence chiefs Gus Hathaway (and his deputy Ted Price) refused to launch a serious hunt for Ames and specifically refused to authorize polygraphs across the board (although Ames beat a scheduled polygraph later). The author's accounting of the agent-by-agent losses suffered by the CIA as Howard, Ames, and Hansen took their toll, is absolutely gripping.<br />The second story is that of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and how the anti-Soviet jihad nurtured by America and Pakistan ultimately turned back on both countries. It may help the reader of this book to first buy and read Milt Bearden's novel, \\"The Black Tulip,\\" a wonderful and smoothly flowing account in novelized terms. From the primary author's point of view, it was Afghanistan, not Star Wars, that brought the Soviet Union to its knees. The primary author provides the reader with really superb descriptions of the seven key Afghan warlord leaders; of the intricacies of the Pakistani intelligence service, which had its own zealots, including one who launched jihad across in to Uzbeckistan without orders; into how the Stingers, and then anti-armor, and then extended mortars (with novel combinations of Geographical Information System computers and satellite provided coordinates for Soviet targets, all 21st century equipment that was quickly mastered by the Afghan warriors) all helped turn the tide. As America continues to fail in its quest to reconstruct the road of Afghanistan, having severely misunderstood the logistics and other obstacles, one of the book's sentences really leaps out: the supply chain to the rebels \\"needed more mules than the world was prepared to breed.\\"<br />This book is a collector's item andmust be in the library of anyone concerned with intelligence, US-Soviet relations, Afghanistan, Pakistan, or Saudi funding of terrorism. It is a finely crafted personal contribution from someone who did hard time in the CIA, and made an enormous personal contribution, in partnership with the hundreds of CIA case officers, reports officers, all-source analysts, and especially CIA paramilitary officers (including Nick Pratt and Steve Cash, forever Marines).<br />A few other books that complement this one: Thomas Allen & Norman Polmar, \\"Merchants of Treason\\", Ladislav Bittman, \\"The Deception Game\\", Vladimir Sakharov, \\"High Treason\\", Victor Sheymov, \\"Tower of Secrets,\\" and Oleg Kalugin, \\"The First Directorate.\\" There are many more but these are my favorites.nd must be in the library of anyone concerned with intelligence, US-Soviet relations, Afghanistan, Pakistan, or Saudi funding of terrorism.

Throughout the book it is clear that the US Department of Defense has some extremely bright uniformed and retired (teaching) officers who are thinking great thoughts, and it is equally clear that they are not being listened to.  This book is probably ten years ahead of its time, and it will be ten years before this book is read and understood by a Secretary of Defense (or ten years before someone reading the book today will be eligible for that position).<br />I recommend this book be read together with Andrew Price-Smith's book on \\"The Health of Nations\\" (on re-emerging infectuous diseases), Laurie Garrett's book \\"Betrayal of Trust: The Collapse of Global Public Health\\", Marq de Villiers' book \\"WATER: The Fate of Our Most Precious Resource\\", David Helvarg's \\"BLUE FRONTIER: Saving America's Living Seas,\\" and Brian Czech's \\"Shoveling Fuel for a Runaway Train\\" (on errant economists and shameful spenders).ain\\" (on errant economists and shameful spenders).	2003-05-24

It is a fortunate circumstance that he overcame his reluctance to publish anything at all, and worked with the trusted William Hood, whose own books are remarkable, to put before the public a most useful memoire.<br /><br />Below are a few of the gems that I find worth noting, and for which I recommend the book as a unique record:<br /><br />1)  Puts forward elegant argument for permissive & necessary secrecy in the best interests of the public<br />2)  Defends the CIA culture as highly disciplined--he is persuasive in stating that only Presidents can order covert actions, and that CIA does only the President's direct bidding.<br />3)  Makes it clear in passing, not intentionally, that his experience as both a journalist and businessman were essential to his ultimate success as a spymaster and manager of complex intelligence endeavors--this suggests that one reason there is \\"no bench\\" at CIA today is because all the senior managers have been raised as cattle destined to be veal: as young entry on duty people, brought up within the bureaucracy, not knowing how to scrounge sources or meet payroll...<br />4)  Compellingly discusses the fact that intelligence without counterintelligence is almost irrelevant if not counterproductive, but then glosses over some of the most glaring counterintelligence failures in the history of the CIA--interestingly, he defends James Angleton and places the blame for mistreating Nosenko squarterly on the Soviet Division leadership in the Directorate of Operations.<br />5)  Points out that it was Human Intelligence (HUMINT), not Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), that first found the Soviet missiles in Cuba.<br />6)  He confirms the Directorate of Intelligence and the analysis it does, as the \\"essence\\" of intelligence, relegating clandestine and technical intelligence to support functions rather than driving functions.  This is most important, in that neither clandestine nor technical collectors are truly responsive to the needs of all-source analysts, in part because systems are designed, and agents are recruited, without regard to what is actually needed.<br />7)  He tells a great story on Laos, essentially noting that 200 CIA paramilitary officers, and money, and the indigenous population, where able to keep 5 North Vietnamese divisions bogged down, and kept Laos more or less free for a decade<br />8)  In the same story on Laos, he explains U.S. Department of Defense incapacity in unconventional or behind the lines war by noting that their officers kept arriving \\"with knapsacks full of doctrine\\".<br />9)  In recounting some of CIA's technical successes, he notes casually that persistence is a virtue--there were *thirteen* satellite failures before the 14th CORONA effort finally achieved its objectives.<br />10)  He gives Lyndon Baines Johnson (LBJ) much higher marks at a user and leader of intelligence, such that we wondered why Christopher Andrew, the noted author on US Presidents and intelligence, did not include LBJ is his \\"four who got it\\" (Washington, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Bush Senior).<br />11) He confirms, carefully and directly, that the Israeli attacks on the USS Liberty were deliberate and with fore-knowledge that the USS Liberty was a US vessel flying the US flag on US official business.<br />12)  He expresses concern, in recounting the mistakes in Chile, over the lack of understanding by President Nixon and Henry Kissinger (who writes the Foreword to this book) of the time lags involved in clandestine operations and covert actions.<br />13)  In summary, he ends with pride, noting that all that CIA did not only reduced fear, it saved tens of billions of dollars in defense expenditures that would have been either defeated by the Soviets, or were unnecessary.  There can be no question, in light of this account, but that CIA has more than \\"paid the rent\\", and for all its trials and tribulations, provides the US taxpayer with a better return on investment than they get from any other part of the US Government, and certainly vastly more bang for the buck that they get from the US Department of Defense.<br /><br />Richard Helms is a one-of-a-kind, and this memoire should be read by every intellience professional, and anyone who wishes to understand how honorable men can thrive in the black world of clandestine and covert operations.

So much for disclosure and \\"conflicts of interest\\".  The previous review, after a year of being irritatingly present, needs to be corrected.  Dr. Lowenthal was for many years the Senior Executive Service reviewer of intelligence affairs for the Congressional Research Service, then he went on to be Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence & Research (Analysis), and then he became the Staff Director for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, where he supervised one of the two really serious really excellent studies on all that is wrong with intelligence and what needs to be fixed.  OSS was lucky to have him contribute to its development for a year before he moved on to another corporation and then to the #5 position in the US Intelligence Community.  He needs no help from me in either articulating his ideas or doing good work.<br />What the previous reviewer fails to understand is that Dr. Lowenthal's book represents the *only* available \\"primer\\" on intelligence that can be understood by Presidents, Congressmen, the media, and the public.  While my own book (The New Craft of Intelligence) strives to discuss the over-all threats around the world in terms meaningful to the local neighborhoods of America, Dr. Lowenthal's book focuses on  the U.S. Intelligence Community itself--the good, the bad, and the ugly.  He is strongest on analysis and  the politics of intelligence, somewhat weaker on collection and counterintelligence covert action.  There is no other book that meets the need for this particular primer, and so I recommend it with enthusiasm.  It is on the OSS.NET list of the top 15 books on intelligence reform every written.	2003-05-02
1201070:US	50761804	R3IR54K1IMCTER	0300099762	492576397	Fixing Intelligence: For a More Secure America	Books	4	31	34	N	N	Useful Informed Opinion	There are two very important themes running through this book, and they earn the author a solid four stars and a \\"must read\\" recommendation.  First, the author is correct and compellinging clear when he points out that even the most senior intelligence professionals, including DCIs, simply do not understand the full range of intelligence organizations, capabilities, and problems that exist--just about everyone has spent their entire career in a small niche with its own culture.  Second, the author is unique for focusing on an area that is both vital and ignored today: that of creating joint and combined intelligence concepts and doctrine to ensure that minimal common understandings as well as training competency levels are reached across varied jurisdictions; and to enable competent community resource management, also non-existent today.<br />The author is positively instructive in this book, providing both trenchant indictments (for instance, of the National Reconnaisance Office for being oriented toward big budgets and inputs rather than missions and outputs), and many common sense observations that all need to be factored into whatever the Senate finally decides to do about intelligence reform.<br />Among the many important points that he makes, I especially agree with his pointing out the need to fully integrate the management of inputs and outputs within each of the major collection disciplines--as he notes, disconnecting the building of satellites, or aerial imagery vehicles, or unmanned aerial drones, from the actual needs of the end-user and the actual responsibility to produce imagery intelligence, leads to precisely what the National Imagery and Mapping Agency Commission Report of December 1999 noted as the major shortfall in national intelligence--close to a trillion spent on secret satellite collection, and nothing spent on tasking, processing, exploitation, and dissemination (TPED).  The author specifically identifies $6 billion in savings being achievable from the NRO budget over five years--savings that could be applied to enhancing analysis, creating competent clandestine collection capabilities, establishing global open source collection activities in each of the theaters, and creating a new national counterintelligence and homeland security intelligence program.<br />In passing, on page 146 the author \\"blows the whistle\\" on the deception imposed on the public by the CIA's clandestine service, which was actually largely incapable in Afghanistan in 2001, and was saved secretly by Russian sources & methods.  My own sources tell me that there are some very ugly stories yet to be made public, and the author--whose access and credibility cannot be questioned--is helpful in sharing what he knows on this--America needs a competent clandestine service, not one that pretends that clerks mixed with cowboys, all working from official installations, are anything other than a joke.<br />The author demonstrates a very deep understanding of the shortfalls of the intelligence bureaucracy, the intelligence culture, intelligence leadership, and the policymakers that fail to direct or exploit intelligence on behalf of the Nation.<br />There are a few weaknesses in this book, costing the author one star, and they are mentioned to correct the record, as it were--in no way do these weaknesses reduce the value of the book or the importance of the author's views when we finally get around to fixing U.S. intelligence.<br />First, he is limited in his understanding of the importance of  Global Coverage of lower tier issues that can be addessed by open source intelligence (OSINT), including commercial imagery and Russian military combat charts; and he is equally limited in his understanding of both OSINT, and the urgency of finding new means of supporting multilateral peacekeeping operations that mix both government militaries and government law enforcement missions with non-governmental and other private sector actors.<br />Second, hecontinues to have a modest obsession with technical solutions, and neglects to properly address the shortfalls in inter-agency information sharing and processing that could be partially resolved by enhancing the National Security Agency's considerable computational power to that it can become an all-source processing manager--at the same time, the author seriously over-states the availability of both bandwidth and tactical processing, while under-stating the enormous flood of unclassified information, including geospatial information, that must be processed if commanders are to be able to understand their combat environments in near real time.<br />Lastly, the author comes close to spasms of fury when referring to the Central Intelligence Agency, and to a lesser extent, to the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Department of State.  His anger and disdain with regard to these organizations are recurring  He is clear in his view that the \\"all source analyst\\" cannot and should not be centralized, that analysts must work for the end-users, and that both CIA and DIA should be abolished.  While I disagree with this viewpoint, it is a mature informed viewpoint that CIA and DIA managers must address--they ignore General Odom's concerns at their peril.<br />The book is based on the 1997 study by the National Institute for Public Policy that was chaired by the author and included such other thoughtful executives as LtGen James Clapper, today the head of the National Imagery and Mapping Agency.  The author has made his own statement in this book, and it is perhaps the most practical and the most focused on the public statements on the need for intelligence reform.

This is nowhere more evident than in this collection of 20th century essays, where he focuses on \\"statecraft as soulcraft.\\"  Thomas Jefferson understood that an educated citizenry was a Nation's best defense, and the Vietnamese have clearly demonstrated that a nation with a strong strategic culture can defeat the United States when it practices the American way of war (lots of technology, little public support for the war).  Today we are beginning to understand that the moral aspects of national character are 3-5 times more important than the physical and economic and technical aspects.  Michele Borba's new book, Building Moral Intelligence, together with George Will's dated but still powerfully relevant book, comprise the urgently needed elementary education for all adults who would be responsibile citizens--or leaders of citizens.	2003-02-28
1226621:US	50761804	R3H3L70VX6ARZB	0743234359	512466969	American Jihad: The Terrorists Living Among Us	Books	5	24	33	N	Y	Gives Citizens More Intelligence Than FBI Can Handle	The FBI--as shown by the recent Congressional testimony of its Director--is still hapless, flailing and clueless when it comes to understanding the specifics of terrorist fund-raising, recruiting, training, and planning based in the USA.  Pakistanis are fleeing to the Canadian border as this review is being written, because they know something the FBI is unwilling to compute: the greatest threat is not Al Qaeda, but rather Hamas and militarized Pakistanis, most of whom are legitimate US residents.<br />Steve Emerson, who first made history in the mid-1990's with his Public Broadcast Service documentary on mullahs in American mosques calling for the murder of Americans deep in the heartland of America, has produced a \\"citizen's handbook\\" that is vastly superior to anything the FBI or the White House has been able to offer its taxpayers--and we can buy this for under $12, which compares rather favorably with the $3 billion or so we pay for the FBI, and the $35 billion or so we pay for national intelligence overall.<br />There are really three stories in this book, which I urge every American--and every other citizen of the world--to read.<br />First, and most importantly, the book documents the wide-spread and robust network of Islamic \\"charities\\" and other front organizations--the most important based in Texas where they have been ignored--that do fund-raising for terrorism overseas as well as terrorist recruiting and training in the US.  The map at the end of the book showing over 50 terrorist nodes in over 30 US cities, is along worth the price of the book.  *More than 20% of the addresses and phone numbers in a top terrorist's phone book, when captured, where in the US.*<br />Second, the book provides insights into why the US Government is failing in the war on terrorism.  The reasons for failure are balanced between policy failures--a pure unwillingess to confront Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iran and other governments that nurture terrorists--and intelligence failures, including such mundane things as refusing to demand police record checks on individuals from countries known to be exporting terrorists, and poor relations (and a lack of unilateral clandestine penetrations) with key intelligence services such as the Sudanese, which knew about the \\"Day of Terror\\" well in advance but did not tell us...and if it did tell us, our Intelligence Community failed to notice and failed to communicate the warnings.<br />The third story in this book is about sources and methods and mindsets, and the bottom line is this: an open mind can use open sources of information to such advantage, that it makes our closed source and closed mind bureaucracy look pitiful in comparison.  The US taxpayer is not getting their money's worth from the US Government with respect to national security expenditures.<br />Finally, although perhaps not intended by the author, his insights are helpful in identifying four specific strategic psychological operations (PsyOp) or \\"cultural outreach\\" themes that the US should have been pursuing these many years since the Soviets left Afghanistan: 1) Arab-Afghans isolated and despised; 2) Arab arrogance in relegating all Pakistani's to \\"untouchable\\" nonentity status; 3) Oneness of umma fanatically pursued actually attacks and undermines the many varied Muslim cultures, especially non-Arab Muslim cultures; and 4) US has made mistakes--in crime, in morality, in support for repressive regimes--and seeks to change in the true spirit of the Koran.<br />The book's documentation of the crimes against the US of the American Muslim Council, to name just one ostensibly legitimate organization that is revealed in this book (which has been \\"lawyer-checked\\" and is bullet-proof against false claims of slander), and other similar \\"charitable\\" organizations, constitutes \\"citizen intelligence\\" at its best.  Every Muslim in America should read this book before donating another dollar to any organization pupporting to be helping Muslims.<br />There is one other cautionary note: the book addresses the specific strategy of bin Laden and other terrorist leaders of deliberately seeking out Muslim youth with US passports who can be used as couriers and suicidal volunteers.  The actual examples provided--real people with real terrorist support missions--easily destroy the common misperceptions of terrorists as \\"foreign.\\"  As the author documents, they are within us, they are of us, and what we are doing now  to defend ourselves is not likely to work in this context.<br />This is an easy to read, informative book with an excellent map, several tables of Islamic extremist organizations based in America, good notes and a good index.  I recommend it without reservation.ping Muslims.<br />There is one other cautionary note: the book addresses the specific strategy of bin Laden and other terrorist leaders of deliberately seeking out Muslim youth with US passports who can be used as couriers and suicidal volunteers.

On all these counts, Halberstam satisfies.  Indeed, having read his book several months ago, I have put off reviewing it because I wanted to spend more time pulling the nuggets out--as those who follow my reviews know, they are both evaluative and summative.<br />This book validates most of what General Wes Clark says in his own memoir, \\"Waging Modern War,\\" and thus in that sense alone it has great value: the Army was unwilling to trust the US General walking in Eisenhower's shoes with either ground troops or helicopters, and also unwilling to fight in mountains.  This is such a terrible self-condemnation of America's most important Armed Service that every citizen should be shuddering.<br />The second major theme I drew from this book was one that the author highlights toward the end of the book when he quotes Madeline Albright, then Secretary of State, as saying (on page 409), \\"We're just gerbils running on a wheel.\\"  For this the U.S. taxpayer pays $500 billion dollars a year?  For gerbils?  In combination with Pentagon deception of the President in railroading General Clark out of NATO early, and a wide variety of other practices between personalities in Washington that would get you fired in any serious corporation, the overall impression that one draws of the Washington foreign policy and national security establishment is one of inattention alternating with craven back-stabbing.  This is not an environment that is operating at peak efficiency, nor can it be trusted to act in the best interests of the voter and taxpayer.<br />A third theme, and this impressed/depressed me tremendously, is that of journalism and open sources of information getting it right early, only to be ignored.  The author--Halberstam--takes great care to tell a story of respect for the accomplishments of another journalist, Roy Gutman of Newsday, whose headline on 21 November 1991, \\"Yugoslavs Need West's Intervention,\\" was the beginning of a series of insightful articles that had little impact at the time.  Joining the insights of journalists was the ignorance of history by politicians--Halberstam comments particularly on the lack of European understanding of just how recognition of Croatia was the opening of a Pandora's Box of genocide.  I was especially struck, throughout Halberstam's accounting, as to how crafty the Balkan players were, how able they were at deception and distraction, and how inept the Americans and the Europeans were at interpreting the situation and the ploys--with massive genocidal consequences.<br />A fourth theme that was not emphasized by the book, but which I would highlight based on a passing observation by the author with regard to the lack of television coverage, has to do with the absolute imperative for America and Europe to have both a strong television industry that can go into the dark places where today only adventurers like Robert Young Pelton (\\"World's Most Dangerous Places\\") dare go--while at the same time governments need a \\"ground truth\\" cadre of observers who are accustomed to and can survive instability and combat, and are not trapped like rats in Embassies, reporting reality second or third hand.  We simply don't know.  We simply do not have trusted observers--or TV cameras--in 80% of the places where we most need to have reliable independent observation.<br />Finally, there were a number of recurring points across the whole book, points where I ended up making annotations:<br />1) Civilian-military relationships are not marked by trust<br />2) Presidential teams tend to lack depth, have no bench<br />3) Washington promotes the least offensive, not the most talented<br />4) Bush Sr. got no bounce from Gulf War--this is suggestive today, as the son follows the father's path.<br />5) Satellite imagery was used to detect Haitians building boats--this struck me as so symbolic of all that is wrong with the US intelligence community--rather than someone walking the beaches and seeing and sensing directly, we use satellites in outer space, at great cost, to do remote viewing...<br />6) Trust, Truth, and Morality--Halberstam may not mean to say this, but my reading of his book, influenced by Joe Nye's book on \\"The Paradox of American Power,\\" was just this: all the money and all the military hardware in the world will not win a conflict in the absence of trust among the civilian-military players; truth about the fundamentals on the ground; and a morality that empowers tough decisions early enough to prevent genocide.<br />The book ends on a mixed note--on the one hand, observing that prior to 9-11 (and many would say, even after 9-11) America has distanced itself from the world; and on the other, noting that this is a very strong country, slow to anger, slow to rouse, but when roused, capable of miracles.  More upbeat than I expected, I was almost charmed by the author's optimism, especially in light of the many books he has written about the corridors of power and the pitfalls of American adventures overseas.promotes the least offensive, not the most talented<BR>4) Bush Sr. got no bounce from Gulf War--this is suggestive today, as the son follows the father's path.<BR>5) Satellite imagery was used to detect Haitians building boats--this struck me as so symbolic of all that is wrong with the US intelligence community--rather than someone walking the beaches and seeing and sensing directly, we use satellites in outer space, at great cost, to do remote viewing...<BR>6) Trust, Truth, and Morality--Halberstam may not mean to say this, but my reading of his book, influenced by Joe Nye's book on \\"The Paradox of American Power,\\" was just this: all the money and all the military hardware in the world will not win a conflict in the absence of trust among the civilian-military players; truth about the fundamentals on the ground; and a morality that empowers tough decisions early enough to prevent genocide.<br />The book ends on a mixed note--on the one hand, observing that prior to 9-11 (and many would say, even after 9-11) America has distanced itself from the world; and on the other, noting that this is a very strong country, slow to anger, slow to rouse, but when roused, capable of miracles.

It is relevant, for example, to the matter of whether we should try to use nuclear bombs on Iraq--most Americans do not realize that there has never (ever) been an operational test of a US nuclear missile from a working missle silo.  Everything has been tested by the vendors or by operational test authorities that have a proven track record of falsifying test results or making the tests so unrealistic as to be meaningless.<br /><br />Edit: my long-standing summary of the author's key point: Simple systems have single points of failure that are easy to diagnose and fix.  Complex systems have multiple points of failure that interact in unpredictable and often undetectable ways, and are very difficult to diagnose and fix.  We live in a constellation of complex systems (and do not practice the precationary principle!).<br /><br />This book is also relevant to the world of software.  As the Y2K panic suggested, the \\"maze\\" of software upon which vital national life support systems depend--including financial, power, communications, and transportation software--has become very obscure as well as vulnerable.  Had those creating these softwares been more conscious of the warnings and suggestions that the author provides in this book, America as well as other nations would be much less vulnerable to terrorism and other \\"acts of man\\" for which our insurance industry has not planned.<br /><br />I agree with another review who notes that this book is long overdue for a reprint--it should be updated.  I recommended it \\"as is,\\" but believe an updated version would be 20% more valuable.<br /><br />Edit: this book is still valuable, but the author has given us the following in 2007:<br />[[ASIN:0691129975 The Next Catastrophe: Reducing Our Vulnerabilities to Natural, Industrial, and Terrorist Disasters]]	2003-01-27

There is corporate corruption, the buying of politicians, such that decisions are made that in effect transfer the taxes paid by individuals (who carry every government's costs) to unethical corporations focused on profit at any cost (to others).  This book documents the second kind of crime: where government agencies charged with protecting the taxpayer from drugs or crime or terrorists or other threats, themselves become allies with criminals, and seek to profit from crime while permitting field officers to go bad, steal money, and become nothing more than officially sanctioned criminals.  If and when each Nations cleans house within its \\"secret world,\\" the ethics of intelligence, and how to police the police, will be among the most fearsome challenges to be addressed.<br />This extraordinary book, at 1165 pages (1974 edition) is a deeply documented, thoughtful, credible account of the second kind of corruption.  It is strongly recommended for purchase by anyone who pays taxes.	2003-01-27

This book is *fascinating* and explosive, not least because of the very well documented coverage it provides of how Israel's intelligence service, the Mossad, used Robert Maxwell to penetrate not just the U.S. government, including the Department of Justice, the military, and the national laboratories, but many foreign governments including the Chinese, Canadians, Australians, and many others, with substantial penetration of their intelligence service databases, all through his sale of a software called PROMIS that had a back door enabling the Mossad to access everything it touched (in simplistic terms).<br />Also shocking, at least to me, was the extensive detail in this book about how the Israeli intelligence service is able to mobilize Jews everywhere as \\"sayanim,\\" volunteer helpers who carry out operational (that is to say, clandestine) support tasks to include spying on their government and business employers, stealing documents, operating safehouses, making pretext calls, and so on.  I am a simple person: if you are a Jew and a US citizen, and you do this for the Israeli intelligence service, then you are a traitor, plain and simple.  This practice is evidently world-wide, but especially strong in the US and the UK.<br />The book draws heavily on just a couple of former Israeli intelligence specialists to address Israeli use of assassination as a normal technique (and implicitly raises the possibility that it was used against Senator John Tower, who died in small airplane crash and was the primary \\"agent\\" for Maxwell and Israel in getting PROMIS installed for millions of dollars in fees all over the US Government).<br />Finally, the book has a great deal of detail about the interplay between governments, crime families, Goldman Sachs and other major investors, and independent operators like Robert Maxwell who play fast and loose with their employee pension funds.<br />This book is not boring.  Far from it.  It is shocking, and if it is only half-right and half-accurate, that is more than enough to warrant its being read by every American, whatever their faith.erators like Robert Maxwell who play fast and loose with their employee pension funds.<br />This book is not boring.

He addresses points that need to be addresses by every voter, for the people of America are losing their birthrights--their freedoms, their power over their own fate, their control of the resources of the nation that have been--quite literally--hijacked by a mandarin wealthy elite that would sooner cut deals with terrorists and their oil-field sponsors, than look after the best interests of the American public.<br />Interestingly, this book emphasizes something I had not considered that bears emphasis: although there were numerous intelligence failures in detail, Vidal suggests that the Director of Central Intelligence is correct when he claims that 9-11 was not (at root) an intelligence failure--but then leaves unsaid what Vidal says explicitly: it was a policy failure in that Bush-Cheney decided not to alarm the people and not to share the warning information, in part to avoid turbulence and in part because such an attack would be welcome--as Pearl Harbor was welcome--as a means to remilitarize foreign policy.<br />Indeed, Vidal focuses relentless on the fact that all of the terrorist planes were allowed to run their course, without being intercepted and shot down by any of the military aircraft in the area.  Although it would have taken a \\"strip alert\\" aircraft to be really effective, and it may not have been possible to load and launch aircraft on standby status in a hanger, it does appear that both the civilian and military chains of command avoided any active efforts to stop the airplanes from hitting their intended targets.<br />There are some extraordinary truths in this book that bear public discussion during the forthcoming Presidential campaign.  I list just a few:<br />1)  It is the US, in its obsessive anti-communism (perhaps aided by the desire of those in power to accummulate wealth and extend their power) which really kicked off the Cold War and were willing to support any dictator, commit any crime, violate any oath, in pursuit of anti-communism.  The number of US attacks within an *undeclared* war status is over 250--and this does not count the secret bombing runs into the Soviet Union in the early years when we were just testing their vulnerability.<br />2) Japan was trying to sue for peace, and the US not only refused to receive their emissaries, but chose to drop the atomic bombs (two of them) to intimate the Russians rather than finalize the Japanese.  He also addresses measures the US undertook to force the Japanese to attack Pearl Harbor.<br />3)  Vidal talks about the number of covert wars that have been fought using taxpayer dollars, but without the knowledge or the approval of the taxpayer-voter.  This is really a vital point--the people, and their elected representatives in Congress, have lost both the power of the purse and the power over war.<br />3)  Coming further forward, Vidal addresses some stark truths about the current American condition that include the incredible percentage of the population that is either in prison or on parole; the continuing abuse of black citizens, especially in Florida; the continuing censorship of the media in relation to the interests of its advertisers--to include the deceptive and manipulated findings of the polls sponsored by the media; the erosion of individual rights; and the continuing gutting of the US economy by the combined emphasis on arms sales (including to ourselves) and cheap oil that the elite managers of the commonwealth persist in pursuing.<br />Vidal ends with two notes: first, that a Constitutional Convention, demanded by the people, would allow a complete overhaul of the system--once \\"we the people\\" are assembled, they have all the power and can recast the system as they wish--what an exciting idea; and second, that the logical direction for a free people is toward a Swiss like confederation of cantons or city-states (or, as Joel Garreau suggested, \\"Nine Nations of North America\\").<br />In my view, Vidal stands alone, with Chomsky, in terms of speaking truth to power.  Others, like Joe Nye, Jeffrey Garten, Max Manwaring, and Howard Rheingold dance around the issues of policy, credibility, and survivability in capable ways, but Vidal cuts to the heart of the matter: do the people wish to think for themselves and take back the power, or cower as slaves in the gutter?  This is very refreshing reading.my view, Vidal stands alone, with Chomsky, in terms of speaking truth to power.

The details he provides in this book--as well as the moderate success stories where reforms have worked--are necessary.<br />The bottom line is clear: until the 60% of America that is eligible to vote but does not vote, comes back into the democracy as active participants who question candidates, vote for candidates, and hold elected representatives accountable *in detail and day to day,* then corporate corruption will continue to rule the roost and will continue to concentrate wealth in the hands of an unreasonably wealthy few at the expense of the general public.<br />Although I found the book inspiring, I also found it depressing.  Absent another 9-11 (or two--or suicidal shooters in an elementary school in every state of the union, or cataclysmic failure in Iraq and North Korea) I see no immediate prospects for America's dropped-out citizens \\"awakening\\" and taking back the power.

If anything, it has gotten worse. One page (43) really jumped out at me, as it contains a chart showing how many planes can be bought for the same amount of money (1000 F-5s, 500 F-4s, 250 F-15s) and then now many sorties per day they can do because of complex logistics and other constraints (2.5/day for F-5's, 1.5 per day for F-4s, 1 per day for F-15s), finally concluding on the \\"real force\\" numbers: 2,500 for the F-5, 750 for the F-4, and 250 for the F-15.<br />As General Wes Clark noted in his book of lessons learned as NATO Commander during the Kosovo crisis (\\"Waging Modern War\\"), he found the new USAF airplanes so unresponsive that they needed a full 24 hours notice to shift from one pre-planned task to another.<br />The author is equally effective in criticizing the Navy for its obsession with carriers and other big ships; and the Army for complex helicopter systems that--as General Clark documents in his book--they are loath to actually use in combat because they might not work as advertised or might be blown out of the sky.<br />In this book, the author gets the \\"constants\\" right, and they are still with us.  First, he  focuses on the rapidly changing nature of external threats, and the importance of having a military--we do not--that is agile and able to surge in varied directions.  The Cold War \\"one size fits all\\" military simply will not do....yet the current Administration continues to spend in that direction, with $7 billion for a lunatic anti-missile defense (we would be better off detecting cargo containers with nuclear bombs in them), and another $72 billion for ultra-modern (code for ultra-expensive) weapons systems that a) have not been defined, b) do not provide for the intelligence support needed to make them effective and c) have no connection to the real world of sub-state violence and instability.<br />The second thing he gets right is the importance of both oil, and instability, as the twin threats to American prosperity--with our over-dependence on cheap oil being a form of Achilles' heel, and our ignorance and tolerance of Arab and other instability and repression being the other side of that same coin.<br />The  third thing he gets right is the need for an independent test authority, because the US military services have proven over and over again that they are corrupt when it comes to weapon acquisition.  Whether it is the Navy or the Air Force or the Army is irrelevant--they all fail to do proper requirements analysis and concept development before jumping into bigger more expensive weapons systems that are both not needed for the kinds of threats we have today (America spends as much on national security as the next *twenty* countries, including Russia and China, *combined*), and that do not work as advertised.  The taxpayer needs and must demand an Independent Test Authority for all military as well as intelligence systems.<br />I found this book, and one other, by Paul Seabury and Angelo Codevilla, \\"WAR: Ends and Means,\\" to be very helpful starting points in thinking about whether the taxpayer's $500 billion a year that is spent on national defense, is spent wisely.  The other two, mentioned above, are the four book beginning to a 100+ book list on making America safe that I will be reviewing here on Amazon over the next 18 months.nues to spend in that direction, with $7 billion for a lunatic anti-missile defense (we would be better off detecting cargo containers with nuclear bombs in them), and another $72 billion for ultra-modern (code for ultra-expensive) weapons systems that a) have not been defined, b) do not provide for the intelligence support needed to make them effective and c) have no connection to the real world of sub-state violence and instability.<br />The second thing he gets right is the importance of both oil, and instability, as the twin threats to American prosperity--with our over-dependence on cheap oil being a form of Achilles' heel, and our ignorance and tolerance of Arab and other instability and repression being the other side of that same coin.<br />The  third thing he gets right is the need for an independent test authority, because the US military services have proven over and over again that they are corrupt when it comes to weapon acquisition.

There are some truly brilliant gems, but there is also a lot of rambling, and I fear that the author's brilliance as a science fiction writer may have intimidated the publisher and editor into settling for what they got, instead of what the author is truly capable of producing when diligently managed.  However, after thoroughly reviewing the book to write the review, I ended up going for 5 instead of 4 stars because this kind of writing is uncommon and provocative and my lack of patience may be the external limiting factor.<br />There are a number of gifted turns of phrase and ideas, and so I do recommend this book for purchase, for reading, and for recurring review.  The author focuses on generic engineering, imagining an order of magnitude of achievement beyond what is now conceptualized; he properly redefines education in the future as being disconnected from the schools that today are socializing institutions, beating creativity out of children and doing nothing for adults that need to learn, unlearn, and relearn across their lifetimes; he is brilliant in conceptualizing both crime as necessary and exported instability as tacitly deliberate--Africa as the whorehouse and Skid Row of the world; he recognizes oil as the primary source of instability and inequality, sees all politicians as devoid of grand vision (and we would surmise, character as well); he is hugely successful in talking about the mythical \\"American people\\" that do not exist, about moral panics after Enron or 9-11 that achieve no true reform; and his focus on the information age basics that make it cheaper to migrate business than people, that make it essential for the Germans to see through Microsoft's insecure code and thus to opt for LINUX or open source code for their military as well as their government systems in general.<br />He ends brilliantly in conceptualizing a new world order within a new world disorder, in which very rich individuals combine with very poor recruits from a nationless diaspora, a new network that looks like Al Qaeda but has opposite objectives.<br />In the larger scheme of things, as the author concludes, Earth is debris and the humans are on their way to being the Sixth Extinction.

The \\"author\\" is responsible for just 39 pages of overview, and what a superficial overview it is--without substantive reference to asymmetric warfare, environmental security, public health, or any of a myriad of emerging threats that are vastly more important to the future of US national security that a rehash of the Cold War.<br />The balance of the book is a mind-glazing and largely useless chronology, list of personalities, and list of references and organizations that is both uninspiring, and severely constrained by the US-centric and beltway-centric perspectives of the author.  The US Institute of Peace, among many, many other vital organizations, is not listed, and the eight web sites that appear to have been hastily added make a mockery of the concept of a book as a vehicle for imparting information.<br />With all due respect to the accomplishments and good intentions of the author and the sponsoring publisher, one would be better off browsing Amazon (or to be more specific, the 300+ books on national security and intelligence that I have reviewed) for a couple of hours, than in attempting to find any deep thoughts of lasting value in this reference work.  In all respects, it is the lowest common denominator.

If I were to recommend only two books on international relations, for any adult including nominally sophisticated world travelers, this would be the first book; the second would be Shultz, Godson, & Quester's wonderful edited work, \\"Security Studies for the 21st Century.\\"<br />I really want to stress the utility of this work to adults, including those like myself who earned a couple of graduate degrees in the last century (smile).  I was surprised to find no mention of the author's stellar service as Chairman of the National Intelligence Council--not only has he had full access to everything that can be known by secret as well as non-secret means, but he has kept current, and this undergraduate and affordable paperback was a great way for me--despite the 400+ books I've read (most of them reviewed on Amazon.com) in the past four plus years--to come up to speed on the rigorous methodical scholarly understanding of both historical and current theories and practices in international relations.  This book is worth anyone's time, no matter how experienced or educated.<br />Each chapter has a very satisfactory mix of figures, maps, chronologies, and photos--a special value is a block chart showing the causes for major wars or periods of conflict at the three levels of analysis--international system, national, and key individual personalities, and I found these quite original and helpful.<br />Excellent reference and orientation work.

I would not reprint it, but I would certainly recommend it as a used book acquisition, and I hope that a new set of authors comes together to provide a 21st Century \\"second look\\" in the aftermath of 9-11.  In the meantime, I would point folks toward Godson's \\"Dirty Tricks or Trump Cards,\\" Allen's \\"None So Blind,\\" and Zegart's \\"Flawed by Design,\\" inter alia.  If you want a list of my top 20 recommended books, send me an email.	2003-01-04

As a former infantry officer who also served in the CIA and knew something of the CIA's support for the anti-Soviet effort there, I was looking forward a deep look at what went wrong.<br />The book appears to have been censored, both with respect to its content and with respect to its photographs, none of which actually depict Soviet encampments, combat results, or anything beyond the most mundane equipment.  It offers little in the way of lessons learned or deep insights comparable, say, to \\"Afghan Guerrilla Warfare: In the Words of the Mujahiddeen Fighters.\\"<br />Having said that, I do recommend it for purchase because it is a personal memoire with many excellent black and white photographs of young Soviet men in Afghanistan, and represents, for the author, financial survival and emotional salvation.	2002-12-23

This book will make anyone laugh, cry, and think.  There is a deep spirit in this book, and knowing a little about all of this, I was quite simply stunned by the labor of love this book represents.  The author's skill and devotion to \\"getting it right\\" is breathtakingly evident across the book.  His sources, both those close to the subject and those more distant, have been exhaustively interviewed and the quality of this book is a direct reflection of some of the most serious \\"homework\\" I have ever been privileged to read.<br />On the theory of war, on the original contributions of John Boyd, the book renders a huge service to all military professionals by dramatically expanding what can be known and understood about the Energy-Maneuverability Theory and the nuances of the OODA Loop (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act--for the real Tigers, Observe-od-Act--a faster loop).  Two things stuck out, apart from the heroic manner in which Boyd pursued the intellectual side of combat aviation: first, Boyd consistently had his priorities right: people first, ideas second, hardware last--this is the opposite of the existing Pentagon priorities; and second, truth matters--the book has some extraordinary examples of how both the Air Force and the Army falsified numbers, with disastrous results, while also selecting numbers (e.g. choosing to list an aircraft's weight without fuel or missiles, rather than fully loaded, a distortion that will kill aviators later when the aircraft fails under stress).<br />On the practical side, the insights into Pentagon (and specifically Air Force) careerism and corruption, as well as contractor corruption and cheating of the government, are detailed and disturbing.  There have been other books on this topic, but in the context of Boyd's heroic endeavors as an individual, this book can be regarded as an excellent case study of the pathology of bureaucracy--the Air Force regarding the Navy, for example, as a greater threat to its survival than the Russians.  Especially troubling--but clearly truthful and vital to an understanding of why the taxpayer is being cheated by the government bureaucracy, were all the details on the mediocrity and mendacity of Wright-Patterson laboratories and organizations nominally responsible for designing the best possible aircraft.  The same thing happens in other bureaucracies (e.g. the Navy architects refusing to endorse the landing craft ideas of Andrew Higgins, who ultimately helped win World War II), but in this instance, the author excels at documenting the horrible--really really horrible--manner in which the Pentagon's obsession with building monstrous systems that increase budgets has in fact resulted in fewer less capable aircraft.  The book is a case study in corrupt and ill-considered (mindless) gold-plating and mission betrayal.<br />As a tiny but extremely interesting sidenote, the book provides helpful insights into the failure of the $2.5 billion \\"McNamara Line,\\" a whiz-kid lay-down of sensors in Viet-Nam that Boyd finally ended up terminating.<br />On a personal level, the author treats Boyd's family life, and his neglect of his family, in objective but considerate terms; the author is also quite effective in identifying and addressing those instances in Boyd's professional life when his fighter-pilot embellishments might be construed by lesser mortals to be falsehoods.  There are three sets of heroes in this book, apart from the subject: the ranking officers, including a number of generals, who protected Boyd against the corrupt careerists--there *are* good officers at the top; the enlisted and officer personnel that carried on in the face of poor leadership, mediocre aircraft, and daunting external challenges; and finally, the \\"Acolytes,\\" the six specific individuals (Tom Christie, Pierre Sprey, Ray Leopold, Chuck Spinney, Jim Burton, and Mike Wyly), each of whom endured what they call \\"the pain\\" to nurture John Boyd and his ideas.  I found the author's dissection and articulation of the personal relationships and sacrifices to be quite good and a most important part of the larger story.<br />Finally, a few tributes en passant.  The author does a great job of showing how Boyd ultimately was adopted by the U.S. Marine Corps rather than the U.S. Air Force, and how his ideas have spawned the 4th Generation and Asymmetric Warfare theories, for which the Pentagon does not yet have an adequate appreciation.  The mentions in passing of two of my own personal heroes, Mr. Bill Lind and Col G. I. Wilson of the U.S. Marine Corps, and the due regard to the roles played by Dr. Grant Hammond of the Air War College and Mr. James Fallows of the Atlantic Monthly, add grace and completion to the story.<br />This book is moving--if you care about America, the military, and keeping our children safe into the future, it *will* move you to tears of both laughter and pain.y, Ray Leopold, Chuck Spinney, Jim Burton, and Mike Wyly), each of whom endured what they call \\"the pain\\" to nurture John Boyd and his ideas.

I buy and read Cook's novels anytime I finish my pre-planned books on a trip, and was truly delighted to have a chance to pick up the anniversary edition, which I had not read previously.<br />Among the aspects of Cook's \\"formula\\" that I especially appreciate are 1) his provision of non-fiction background references that frame the novel in the real world; 2) his orchestration of vignettes so that one obtains real insights into the backroom operations and otherwise invisible nuances of hospitals and medicine; 3) his engaging characters; and, most importantly, 4) his dramatization of major threats that are not well-articulated to the public by any other means.	2002-12-13

I would never have found it otherwise.  It is a timely book, and it has direct relevance to the 9-11 catastrophe because everything this book talks about in terms of \\"cultures of catastrophe\\" (one could call them cultures of oblivion or cultures of inattention) resonates with the findings of the joint congressional panel on the many ways in which the CIA, FBI, and NSA failed America.<br />What most engaged me about this book, apart from its outstanding attention to the relationship between cultures of inattention or distraction and major catastrophic events (the book makes clear that catastrophe's don't have to happen--they make the jump from disasters when the over-all system of first responders and related parties fails to act quickly and correctly in harmony, precisely because of their past culture), is its focus on the total system, on every feature of society in relation to the environment.<br />The editors write: \\"One of the common sources of the policy-practice defect is its construction on culturally bound assumptions.  In disaster contexts, aid often gets delivred in inappropriate forms and according to unsuited principles.\\"  The book excells at looking at the uneven record of disaster preparedness, and the lack of understanding to local contexts that often help turn disasters into catastrophes.<br />I recommend this book as a primary reference for national security practitioners as well as state & local responders.  The ... billions now in the Homeland Security budget was not designed with this book's lessons in mind, and will in all likelihood do more damage than good when we are tested again.<br />The message of the book is so important it merits emphasis--no amount of money is going to prevent catastrophe--absent a commitment to creating a culture of attention and interoperability and information sharing, we will create our own catastrophes each time we are challenged by what could have been nothing more than a localized disaster.enged by what could have been nothing more than a localized disaster.	2002-12-13

The author, dean of the Yale business school, has rendered a most valuable service to the business leaders of America, and in the process opened the possibility that new forms of business education, new forms of business practice, and new forms of moral global governance might yet emerge in America.<br />Originally inspired by the \\"double-whammy\\" of 9-11 and Enron on business--(the one costing America, by Fortune's estimate for businesses alone, $150B in additional security measures, or close to 1.5% of the Gross Domestic Product; while others suggest 9-11 has reduced profits by 5-6%), the author provides an easy to read, well-documented overview of why CEOs have to engage in rebuilding the integrity of business, protecting the homeland, preserving global economic security and free trade, taking on global poverty, and influencing foreign policy.<br />The author excells at pointing out, in the most gracious way possible, how all of the preconceptions of the current administration, and in particular its penchant for unilateralist military bullying, have proven both unworkable in achieving their intended results, while also unsuitable in being translated to economic gains.  Military power does not translate into economic power or added prosperity.<br />This book is *loaded* with common sense and specific ideas for getting business leadership back into the global stabilization dialog.  The author focused on two ideas that I consider to be especially important: the need to reexamine how the taxpayer dollar is being spent on national security, with a view to redirecting funds (I add: from military heavy metal to what Joe Nye calls soft power: diplomacy, assistance, intelligence); and on the urgency of restoring the independence and expanding the mandate of the U.S. Information Agency so as to overcome the acute misperceptions of the US fostered by Saudi-funded schools for youths being taught to hate, and little else.<br />The non-governmental organizations come in for special scrutiny, and the author has many good ideas, not only for promoting better business-NGO partnerships, but for auditing the NGOs and not ceding to them the moral high ground.  As he points out, many organizations that oppose globalization or specific business practices do not have any standards or transparency with respect to who funds them, how decisions are made, and so on.<br />Finally, the author concludes with a focus on business education.  While citing many improvements made by many schools, he notes that a comprehensive study and reengineering overall has not occurred since the late 1950's and early 1960's, and that the time is long past when graduate business education must be completely revamped.  He is exceptionally astute and credible throughout the book as he explores the many things that CEOs need to know but do not receive training on, to include understanding and dealing with government, NGOs, citizen advocates, and the real world.  As he notes, Master's in Business Administration tend to train students for the first years in the corporation, not the long-haul.  He places some emphasis on the need to consider continuing education as an extension of the original program, and I immediately thought of an MBA as a limited-term license that must be renewed by recurring personal investments in education.<br />As someone whose opening lecture line to citizens and businessmen is \\"if the State fails, you fail,\\" I found this book extraordinarily valuable and urgent.  We get the government we deserve.  If citizens do not vote, if businessmen do not think of the larger social goods and social contexts within which they operate, then the government will prove incapable and at some point the party will be over.<br />Yale has always had an extra helping of morality and humanity; in this book the dean of the business school ably makes the case that business leadership and engagement in national security and global stabilization is the sine qua non for continuedprosperity.  He's got my vote--if I were a mature student looking for a place to learn, he's put Yale right at the top of my list.continued prosperity.

New material below in brackets.<br /><br />I found this book very much on target with its principal thesis, to wit, that the United States is too quick to take pre-emptory and often covert or illicit action against short-term threats, and that we pay a very heavy price over the long run for doing things like reinforcing despotic regimes, overturning anti-American regimes, and so on.<br />However--and I am one of those who first learned to admire the author when he was an authority, in the 1970's, on the causes of revolution--I found the presentation spotty, with errors of fact and perception in those areas where I have a solid background, specifically the U.S. Marine Corps on Okinawa, and the clandestine service of the Central Intelligence Agency. Neither of those two organizations is as evil or disorganized as the author seems to believe, and frankly, I found his bibliography with respect to both domains to be mediocre.<br />[Since reading this book I have been absorbed in a book not yet available in the US, Gold Warriors, by the Seagraves, and have been stunned by the crimes they document--to wit, the theft by the US, secretly and without the taxpayer finding out, of all the gold and other treasures looted by the Nazis and the Japanese during WWII, subsequently using this \\"black money\\" to fund global political corruption on a grand scale--all on the part of the U.S. Government, with specific assistance from the CIA, Treasury, and others.  Their book comes with two CD-ROMS containing 60,000 documents in support.  I am persuaded, and this book, among others I had forgotten on CIA money laundering and occasional drug running, causes me to credit Chalmers Johnson with more accuracy on his accusations than I in my naivete first appreciated.  His documentation still leaves much to be desired, but I perceive that he is more on the mark than off.]<br />This is a helpful book. If it were the only one it would be important in its own right, but in the light of books such as Daniel Ellsberg's \\"SECRETS: A Memoire of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers,\\" or Derek Leebaert's much more profoundly researched and documented \\"The Fifty-Year Wound: The True Price of America's Cold War Victory,\\" it falls from the front rank to the second shelf.<br />Among the critical points where the author is original and heed must be paid, is in his evalution of competing forms of economic management, and his very strong condemnation of the manner in which the US tries to impose a specific form of capitalism on the Asian economies, to their great detriment.<br />His book reinforces concerns others have articulated with respect to administrative secrecy enabling terrible policies to be enacted in the name of the people; to the military-industrial complex and its negative roles in arming and inciting to repression selected military around the world; to US guilt in human rights violations, to include the provision of encouragement for repression in both Indonesia and South Korea; and with respect to the value of North Korea to those in the US who want to fabricate a case for an anti-missile defense that most informed people agree is absurd in its concepts and extortionary in its pricing.<br />I am quite glad I read this book, quite glad to be reminded of the brilliant long-term contributions of the author to the field of Asian studies and the causes of revolution, and certain that those who specialize in studies the pathology of power--especially of imperial power such as is now enjoyed by the United States, will find much food for thought in this book.t appreciated.

It begins by emphasizing that the Cold War glorified certain types of institutions, personalities, and attitudes, and ends by pointing out that we paid a very heavy cost--much as General and President Eisenhower tried to warn us--in permitting our society to be bound by weaponry, ideology, and secrecy.<br />Two quotes, one from the beginning, one from the end, capture all that lies in between, well-documented and I would add--contrary to some opinions--coherent and understandable.<br />\\"For the United States, the price of victory goes far beyond the dollars spend on warheads, foreign aid, soldiers, propaganda, and intelligence.  It includes, for instance, time wasted, talent misdirected, secrecy imposed, and confidence impaired.  Particular costs were imposed on industry, science, and the universities.  Trade was distorted and growth impeded.\\" (page xi)<br />\\"CIA world-order men whose intrigues more often than not started at the incompetent and went down from there, White House claims of 'national security' to conceal deceit, and the creation of huge special interests in archaic spending all too easily occurred because most Americans were not preoccupied with the struggle.\\" (page 643)<br />Although the author did not consult the most recent intelligence reform books (e.g. Berkowitz, Johnson, Treverton, inter alia), he is consistently detailed and scathing in his review of intelligence blunders and the costs of secrecy--in this he appears to very ably collaborate the findings of Daniel Ellsberg's more narrowly focused book on \\"SECRETS: A Memoire of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers.\\"  He points out, among many many examples, that despite Andropov's having been head of the KGB for fifteen years, at the end of it CIA still did not know if Andropov has a wife or spoke English.  He also has a lovely contrast between how little was learned using very expensive national technical means (secret satellites) and open sources: \\"So much failure could have been avoided if CIA has done more careful homework during the 1950s in the run-up to Sputnik; during the 1960s, when Sovieet marshals were openly publishing their thoughts on nuclear strategy; or during the 1970s and 1980s, when stagnation could be chronicled in the unclassified gray pages of Soviet print.  Most expensively, the CIA hardly ever learned anything from its mistakes, largely because it would not admit them.\\" (pages 567-568).<br />The author's biographic information does not include any reference to military service, but footnote 110 suggests that he was at least in Officer Candidate School with the U.S. Marine Corps during the Vietnam era.  The biography, limited to the inside back jacket flap, also avoids discussing the author's considerable experience with information technology.  Given the importance of this critique of all that most Republicans and most 50-70 year olds hold very sacred, we need to more about the man goring the ox.  Future editions should have a much expanded biography.<br />Bottom line: America muddled through the Cold War, made many costly mistakes, and developed a policy-making process that is, to this day, largely uninformed due to a lack of a comprehensive global intelligence capability, or a sufficient means of consulting diverse experts (as opposed to the in-town intellectual harlots).  If ever we needed a clean-sheet look at how we make policy and how we provide decision-support to that policy process, this is the time.

1320217:US	50761804	RRGST2LLLI5H3	0521791995	170283976	Risk and Reason: Safety, Law, and the Environment	Books	5	35	38	N	Y	Huge Helping of Reason, Needs Salt	The bottom line on this book is clear: our governance of risk to the public tends to be managed by political gut reaction rather than informed investigation; there is no clear doctrine for studying and articulating risk (for example, distinguishing between high risks to a few and low but sustained risks to the many, or between three levels of cost-benefit analysis so that choices can be made); and the best form of risk management may be through the effective communication of risk information to the public rather than imposed costs on private sector enterprises.<br />As reasoned as the book is, it also constitutes a direct attack on all those who expouse the \\"precautionary principle.\\" While I do not agree completely with the author, who seems to feel that rational study allows for the discounting of any risk to the point where it can be economically and politically managed at an affordable cost, he certainly take the debate to an entirely new level and his book is--quite literally--worth tens of billions of dollars in potential regulatory risk savings.<br />Most compelling is his methodical aggregation of data from several sources to show that the cost of saving one life (he notes that we fail to distinguish adequately between a life saved for a few years and a life saved for many years, or between young lives saved for a lifetime and old lives saved for a brief span of time).  Table 2.1 on page 30 is quite astonishing--of 45 major regulated risks, one (drinking water) costs over $92 billion per premature death averted; eight including asbestos cost between $50 million and $4 billion; seven including arsenic and copper cost between $13 million and $45 million; 14 including various electrical standards cost between $1 million and $10 million per death averted; and 15 cost less than $1 million per death averted.<br />What cost human life?  Even on this there is no standard, and even within a single regulatory agency (e.g. the Environmental Protection Agency) there are different calculations used in relation to different risks being regulated.  The author does a really fine job of comparing the public perception of the value of a life saved ($1.3 million for automobile-related risks, $103 million for aviation-related risks) with the values used by the government and the courts, which vary widely (into the billions) but seem to hover between $10 million and $30 million per life saved and without regard the the number of life-years actually involved.<br />The heart of the book is in its conclusion, where the author proposes a four-part strategy for dramatically reducing the cost of regulatory risk management, suggesting that we focus on 1) disclosure of information to the public; 2) economic incentives; 3) risk reduction contracts; and 4) free market environmentalism.  With respect to the latter, he is strongly supportive of allowing the \\"sale\\" of pollution privileges between nations and industries and companies.<br />For additional observations on reducing risk to the future of life see my reviews of Joe Thorton on \\"Pandora's Poison,\\" Raffensperger and Tickner on \\"Protecting Public Health & The Environment,\\" Novacek on \\"The Biodiversity Crisis,\\" Czech on \\"Shoveling Fuel for a Runaway Train,\\" Lomberg on \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist,\\" Helvarg on \\"Blue Frontier,\\" and Wilson's \\"The Future of Life.\\"<br />Cass Sunstein and Lawrence Lessig join Jerry Berman and Marc Rotenberg and Mike Godwin as America's \\"top guns\\" in responsible law-making.

Their wandering short-hand conversations, the degree to which the President is mis-led about our capabilities, the inability of the Secretary of Defense to answer a direct question, always having to go back to his office for an answer--the entire book is, as one reviewer suggests, practically a recount of a handful of recollections about scattered conversations, as if the center of the world were one room in the White House, and nothing outside those walls really mattered. It is also somewhat revisionist--as I recall from published news at the time, all of the principals wanted to delay the taking of Kabul until the spring, and it was President Putin of Russia, speaking directly to President Bush, who made the case, based on his superior intelligence sources on the ground, for how quickly Kabul would fall, leading to the US acceptance of rapid advances by the Afghan warlords. The absence of this essential and openly known fact casts doubt on the entire process of writing the book, and how information was researched and selected for inclusion.<br />There are, however, some major gems that make a careful reading of this book very worthwhile and I list them for consideration by other readers:<br />1) The Directorate of Intelligence does not appear as a listed player--CIA special operations rather than CIA analysis appears to have been the DCI's best card to play;<br />2) The clandestine service, as Dewey Claridge notes in concluding his \\"Spy for All Seasons,\\" died in the 1990's, with only 12 case officers in one year's class--the book misrepresents the increase from 12 to 120 as stellar--it was actually a return to the norm before a series of mediocre leaders destroyed the Directorate of Operations;<br />3) The CIA had been \\"after\\" bin Laden for five years prior to 9-11, the DCI even \\"declaring war\\" on him, to zero effect. Worse, post 9-11 investigations determined that bin Laden had been planning the 9-11 attack for two years without any substantive hint being collected by U.S. intelligence--and at the end of the book, Rumsfeld reflects on how the three major surprises against the U.S. prior to 9-11 not only happened without U.S. intelligence detecting them, but we did not learn of them for five to thirteen years *after the fact* (page 320);<br />4) Presidential-level communications stink--the Secretary of State could not talk to the President when flying back for seven hours from Latin America, and the National Security Advisor could not get a reliable secure connection to the President from her car right in Washington, D.C.<br />5) The Secret Service idea of security for Presidential relatives in a time of crisis is to take them to the nearest Federal Center--the kind that got blown up in Oklahoma.<br />6) Throughout the discussions, it was clear to the principals that the U.S. military is designed to find and destroy fixed physical targets with obvious signatures; it cannot do--it is incompetent at--finding mobile targets, whether vehicles or individuals (cf. page 174)...and of course as General Clark documented in his book, and David Halberstam repeats in his most recent tome, and as the principals learned again vis a vis Afghanistan, the U.S. Army does not do mountains.<br />There are three remarkable aspects of this story, only one even remotely hinted at in the book: we failed to get bin Laden. The CIA went to Afghanistan with the right orders: \\"bin Laden dead or alive.\\" They promptly forgot their orders and settled for spending $70M to play soldier. The two stories that are not told in this book, but are clearly apparent: 1) Russia saved the day, both for the CIA and for the Department of Defense; and 2) Saudi Arabia never came up as a serious problem that needed to be dealt with sooner than later.<br />Finally, and this only became clear to me after the early months of 2003 when the obsession of a few people in the Administration brought the world to a crisis over Iraq, the book provides really excellent documentation of how a tiny minority, led by Paul Wolfowitz, basically pushed the President to treat Iraq as an alternative to substantive action on global terrorists networks, and the book documents how the uniformed leadership of the Pentagon clearly opposed this line of thinking that is unsupported by intelligence, either on Iraq, or on the relative threat of Iraq (not imminent) in relation to many other threats that are both more imminent and more costly if not addressed now.<br />This is a useful book, worthy of reading, but the real story with all the details will not be known for some time.he obsession of a few people in the Administration brought the world to a crisis over Iraq, the book provides really excellent documentation of how a tiny minority, led by Paul Wolfowitz, basically pushed the President to treat Iraq as an alternative to substantive action on global terrorists networks, and the book documents how the uniformed leadership of the Pentagon clearly opposed this line of thinking that is unsupported by intelligence, either on Iraq, or on the relative threat of Iraq (not imminent) in relation to many other threats that are both more imminent and more costly if not addressed now.<br />This is a useful book, worthy of reading, but the real story with all the details will not be known for some time.	2002-12-01

It should be required reading for every person--at entry, journeyman, or master level--who presumes to be an intelligence analyst for government or the military or law enforcement or business.  Although the author sets for himself the more modest goal of describing how historians think, what he has actually produced is a marvelously balanced overview of how to \\"do\\" deep analysis.<br />He is bluntly critical of the political science and social science communities, branding them with an inability to engage in methodical research or articulation.<br />His comments over the course of this 192-page gem, with a good index, world-class notes, but no bibliography, cover his methods in detecting larger patterns of the period being studied; distinguishing between the larger reality being studied and the representations of reality actually available to the student; the art of distillation and emphasis; the many trade-offs that must be made in depicting reality; the manipulation of time and space with the advantage of being able to see distant places simultaneously but the disadvantage of having fragmentary and conflicting depictions to work with; the craft of historical selectivity and shifting of scale to paint a picture as much as to document with scientific rigor; the use of abstraction as a relative truth, accepting that with all the objectivity possible, there is no such thing as absolute truth; how to create a theory of relationships among people, places, things, and events; and--skipping over many other points of tradecraft--how at the end of it all, the historian must be compelling in their presentation of the information.<br />History is a \\"denied area.\\"  When we combine our current lack of appreciation of history across all the disciplines, with our long track record of disdain for religion and culture as fundamental aspects of the total intelligence picture, we must recognize that we have created many \\"virtual denied areas\\" for ourselves, Islam being but one of many.  In that vein, this book can be considered a primer on how to go about understanding a \\"denied area\\" by substituting analytic tradecraft for the multiplicity of sources that characterize the more obvious targets of our interest.<br />Overall this work is a tribute to the value of historians to Presidents, Prime Ministers, and Chief Executive Officers: \\"to interpret the past for the purposes of the present with a view to managing the future.\\"  It ends by placing history as the foundation for teaching; for balance in society and between societies; and as a sine qua non for wisdom and maturity.<br />This is, quite simply, an elegant timeless piece of work.record of disdain for religion and culture as fundamental aspects of the total intelligence picture, we must recognize that we have created many \\"virtual denied areas\\" for ourselves, Islam being but one of many.

Only the host society can penetrate itself enough to effectively restrain or delegitimize its own suicide bombers.  Outsiders can't.\\"<br />In one paragraph, this thrice-winning Pulitzer Prize winner has marked the third major failure in the Administration's strategy against global terrorism (the first was the failure to cordon off Tora Bora in Afghanistan with reliable U.S. troops, because the U.S. Army can't do mountains; the second was to declare war on Iraq against the President's best instincts but yielding to the Vice President's obsession, if Bob Woodward's account in \\"Bush at War\\" is correct).  Although the U.S. is spending upwards toward $200M to destabilize Iraq, and perhaps another $100M in global bribery of local liaison services (themselves penetrated by terrorists, or supporting terrorism), we have failed to establish the kind of deep credible relations that lead to sustained and effective counter-terrorism by the host countries.  Pakistan is an excellent case in point--it consistently gives lip service to US demands, and fails to bring home the Al Qaeda leaders passing in and out of Pakistan at will.<br />Across many columns, the author hits again and again at the basics: \\"we have been allowing a double game to go on with our Middle East allies for years, and that has to stop.\\"  Either they cease supporting terrorists in return for a dubious poverty-ridden peace at home, or they join the target list; we must invest heavily in both a Marshall Plan and a Voice of America *in Arabic* that consistently and constantly counters all of the lies about America and against America that the Arab regimes permit as part of their strategy for peace at home; lastly, more subtly, we must get serious about standing up for our values and not allowing rogue governments to abuse our friendship and tolerance while fostering hatred of America among their repressed, using America as the opiate of the down-trodden.  The author seems to agree with Ralph Peters, author of \\"Beyond Terror\\" and \\"Fighting for the Future\\" in focusing on the importance of the Muslim outlands from Pakistan and India down through Malaysia and Indonesia, and he is especially strong at documenting the severe misunderstandings and misimpressions of America that persist across the Muslim world but especially in Arabia--otherwise serious people who really believe that bin Laden is good, 9-11 was justified, and everything will get better if America stops supporting Israel.<br />This particular book, down to earth and based on very direct observations, is a useful counter-balance to Bernard Lewis, \\"What Went Wrong.\\"  Both distinguished authors agree that the Arab regimes are their own worst enemies and have brought their poverty on themselves--but where the historian seems to deem this sufficient to permit disengagement, the correspondent takes the other tack and calls for major generational-changing engagement, utilizing all the instruments of national power, from coercive diplomacy backed up by the very real threat of military intervention amongst our pupported allies, to massive economic, educational, and cultural assistance and outreach.<br />Toward the end of the book, quoting the deputy editor of New Isvestia in Moscow, the author hits the final nail on the head: \\"It is not East versus West anymore.  It is the stable versus unstable worlds...\\"<br />China, Russia, Islam, water, disease, crime--terrorism, I conclude, is a very small part of the threat, and our greatest challenge right now is to devise a holistic national security strategy thatdoes not lose sight of the forest for the one burning bush.  Overall, the author has provided as fine a net assessment as any President could ask for.rategy that does not lose sight of the forest for the one burning bush.

Years later, last week actually, I picked up Michael Asher's book, \\"The Real Bravo Two Zero,\\" and was stunned by how a quality investigative journalist and former SAS'r fluent in Arabic, with three years under his belt living with the Bedouins, could actually trace back the exact paths outlined in the original book, only to reveal massive deceptions and fabrications.  I actually recommend buying McNab's book, because it has a lot of useful detail and the protagonists are heroes simply for surviving--but if you want to take your experience up an order of magnitude, and be just plain flat out amazed, buy both this book and Asher's paperback, and see just how he reconstructed the truth deep within Iraq, talking to Bedouin's (three of whom actually were the \\"hoards of Iraqi's with tanks and personnel carriers\\" during the fateful battle that broke the mission apart) and actually walking the ground and finding all the traces.	2002-11-11

He carefully considers the major issues of privacy, control, social responsibility, and group behavior.  He ends on very positive notes, but also notes that time is running out--we have to understand where all this is going, and begin to change how we invest and how we design everything from our clothing to our cities to our governments.<br />This is an affirming book--the people that pay taxes can still look forward to the day when they might take back control of their government and redirect benefits away from special interests and back toward the commonwealth.

The book covers seven areas I categorize as Background, History, Information Strategy, Pathology of Secrecy, Ethics, War Crimes, and Administrative.<br />By way of background, the book establishes that the author was not a peacenik per se, as some might perceive him, but rather a warrior, both in terms of Cold War ideology and from actual experience as a USMC infantry company commander and an on-the-ground observer traveling across Viet-Nam by jeep instead of helicopter, generally in the company of the top U.S. ground expert in Viet-Nam, John Paul Vann.  The book establishes-as George Allen has also told us in NONE SO BLIND, that intelligence did not fail in Viet-Nam, that Presidents do get good advice from good men, but that the position of President, combined with executive secrecy as an enabling condition, permits very irrational and ineffective policies, conceived in private without public debate, to go forward at taxpayer expense and without Congressional oversight.  The author is timely in emphasizing that the \\"spell of unanimity\\" is very dangerous and provides a very false image to the public-the stifling of dissent and debate at all levels leads to bad policy.<br />The author does an effective job of bringing forward the lessons of history, not only from Truman and Eisenhower forward, but from the Japanese and French occupations of Indochina.  We failed to learn from history, and even our own experts, such as Lansdale showing McNamara the rough equipment that the Vietnamese would defeat us with because of their \\"will to win,\\" were sidelined.<br />As a public administration and public policy text this book offers real value as a primary source.  The author provides valuable insights into how quickly \\"ground truth\\" can be established; on how the U.S.  Government is not structured to learn; on how the best answers emerge when there is not a lead agency and multiple inputs are solicited simultaneously; and most importantly, on how private truths spoken in secrecy are not effective within any Administration.  The author stresses that Americans must understand what Presidents are doing in their name, and not be accomplices to war crimes or other misdeeds.  He does a brilliant job of demonstrating why we cannot let the Executive Branch dictate what we need to know.<br />Interwoven with the author's balanced discussion of how to get ground truth right is his searing and intimate discussion of the pathology of secrecy as an enabler for bad and sometimes criminal foreign policy, carried out without public debate or Congressional oversight.  The author adds new insights, beyond those in Morton Halperin's superb primer on Bureaucracy and Foreign Policy, regarding the multiple levels of understanding created by multiple levels of classification; the falseness of many written records in an environment where truth may often only be spoken verbally, without witnesses; the fact that the Department of Defense created false records to conceal its illegal bombings in Laos and Cambodia, at the same time that the White House created false secret cables, used Acting Director of the FBI Patrick Gray to destroy evidence, and sought to bribe a judge with the offer of the FBI directorship.  The author presents a compelling portrait of an Executive Branch-regardless of incumbent party-likely to make major foreign policy miscalculations because of the pathology of secret compartmentation, while also being able to conceal those miscalculations, and the cost to the public, because of Executive secrecy.  He is especially strong on the weakness of secret information.  As he lectured to Kissinger: \\"The danger is, you'll become like a moron.  You'll become incapable of learning from most people in the world, no matter how much experience they have in their particular areas that may be much greater than yours\\" [because of your blind faith in the value of your narrow and often incorrect secret information. P. 236]<br />On such a foundation, the author discusses the ethics of Presidential leadership.  He is especially strong-and relevant today-in discussing how Presidential appointees regard loyalty to the President as a mandate for lying to Congress and the media and the public.  The author excels at bringing forward how our corruption in permitting corruption is easily recognized and interpreted by indigenous personnel-just as how whom we support is quick evidence of how little we know about local politics.<br />From here the author segues into the ethics of collateral damage and the liability of the American people for war crimes and naked aggression against the Vietnamese because of our deliberate violation of the Geneva accords and our support for a corrupt series of dictatorships in South Viet-Nam.  Much of what we did in Viet-Nam would appear to qualify for prosecution under the International Tribunal, and it may be that our bi-partisan history of war crimes in Viet-Nam is what keeps us from acknowledging the inherent wisdom of accepting the jurisdiction of the International Tribunal in future wars.  Tellingly, at one point his wife reads the Pentagon Papers and her tearful reaction is: \\"this is the language of torturers.\\"<br />Administratively we are reminded that the Pentagon Papers were 7,000 pages in total; that Neil Sheehan from The New York Times actually stole a set of the papers from Ellsberg before being given a set; that character assassination by the U.S. Government is a routine tactic in dealing with informed dissent; and that it is not illegal to leak classified information-only administrative sanctions apply, outside a narrow set of Congressionally-mandated exceptions.<br />This book is a \\"must read\\" for any American that thinks and votes.m most people in the world, no matter how much experience they have in their particular areas that may be much greater than yours\\" [because of your blind faith in the value of your narrow and often incorrect secret information.

I bought it and eventually read it because someone I respect very much recommended it.  I would not have bought it at my own initiative, and part of the my purpose in writing this review is to persuade you to take a chance on this book, whose title, while accurate, may be off-putting to those that think they are serious, action-oriented, &quot;just the facts&quot; get on with it types.<br />The author has done something special here, and it is especially relevant to those of us on the bleeding edge of change in the information and intelligence industries, each trying to communicate extraordinarily complex and visionary ideas to the owners with money or the bureaucrats with power--neither of these groups being especially patient or visionary.<br />The book accomplished three things with me, and I am a very hard person to please: 1) it compellingly demonstrated the inadequacy of the industry standard briefing, consisting of complex slides with complex ideas outlined in excrutiating detail; 2) it demonstrated how a story-telling approach can accomplish two miracles: a) explain complex ideas in a visual short-hand that causes even the most jaded skeptic to &quot;get it,&quot; and b) do this in such a way that the audience rather than the speaker &quot;fills in the blanks&quot; and in so doing becomes a stakeholder in the vision for change; and 3) finally, provides several useful appendices that will help anyone craft a &quot;story&quot; with an action-inducing effect.<br />The footnotes and bibliography are sufficient to make the point that this is not just a story, but a well-researched and well-documented real-world experience of great value to any gold-collar revolutionary struggling to overcome obstacles to reform.	2002-10-10

As the author documents so ably, it is not enough to have a job in America, you need to have one that pays enough to cover rent, food, and medicine.<br />I was especially moved by the many details the author provided on how life at the lower levels brings on more and more hardships--not enough money for good shoes, bad shoes causing major spinal and related injuries and pain.  The pain--the endless hours, the desperation for aspirin and other pain killers, cigarettes as the least expensive narcotic for the pain--this is very powerful stuff.<br />At a minimum, this book changes how I will evaluate politicians that speak in ignorance about welfare and poverty and safety nets--and it is going to substantially increase how much I tip and how I tip--from 15% to 25%, and in cash...  This might be a good time to think of ourselves, and follow the Golden Rule--our welfare system should be what we would want it to be if we were the ones asking for welfare./>At a minimum, this book changes how I will evaluate politicians that speak in ignorance about welfare and poverty and safety nets--and it is going to substantially increase how much I tip and how I tip--from 15% to 25%, and in cash...

Homer-Dixon is a professor (and himself author of \\"Environment, Scarcity, and Violence\\"), and is now a professor at the University of Southern Florida.<br />Although the Central Intelligence Agency got this right in the 1970's, clearly warning U.S. policymakers that AIDS and related diseases were \\"the\\" catastrophic threat to national security and regional stability in the closing quarter of the 20th century, and although the United Nations and its various agencies have clearly understood the relationship between disease, environmental degradation, and instability--with all that instability brings in terms of crime, forced migration, and so on, the author gets five stars for doing an absolutely brilliant job of putting all of this knowledge--and his own original contributions--into a readable volume that can be understood by the most loosely-educated policymakers we have, as well as the voting public.<br />The author does a superb job of both crediting others (e.g. Laurie Garrett, whose stunning book \\"BETRAYAL OF TRUST: The Collapse of Global Public Health\\" we reviewed last year) while weaving his own insights into the story. ERIDs are \\"emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.\\" They matter more now because, as the author summarizes it, modern man is in a very different situation today: \\"individuals can travel around the world rapidly by airplane, and overpopulation and the growth of megacities have created entirely new 'disease pools' that will allow new pathogens to emerge and flourish.\\"<br />The author has done a fine job of documenting how \\"human-induced worldwide environmental destruction\\" is both releasing pathogens from their hiding places in rain forests, launching new microbes that wreak havoc on aquatic life, and proliferating resistant strains of micobial terrorists we do not understand. Bacteria, in brief, are a thousand to a million times more deadly that any terrorist gang, and we would be wise to get our priorities straight as we set about pretending to govern.<br />As a general statement, the author appears to have done very very well as identifying intervening variables that could be analyzed, and his conclusions on what needs to be done are \\"President ready.\\" He not only makes his case, he ends by calling for a massive increase in \\"health intelligence,\\" and thereby demonstrates a wit lacking in most academics.<br />The notes are excellent, there is no bibliography, and the index is so mediocre it might as well not have been included--there is also no biography of this talented author, a grevious lack. The book should be reissued with this deficiencies being corrected.rorist gang, and we would be wise to get our priorities straight as we set about pretending to govern.<br />As a general statement, the author appears to have done very very well as identifying intervening variables that could be analyzed, and his conclusions on what needs to be done are \\"President ready.\\" He not only makes his case, he ends by calling for a massive increase in \\"health intelligence,\\" and thereby demonstrates a wit lacking in most academics.<br />The notes are excellent, there is no bibliography, and the index is so mediocre it might as well not have been included--there is also no biography of this talented author, a grevious lack.

Books	4	15	16	N	Y	Thoughtful, General, Missing the Big Bang	Last year we had some exceptional works on water scarcity (de Villier), resource wars (Klare), corporate razing of the environment (Czech), among many others that I reviewed here on Amazon. This year we have two extraordinary books, this is the second of the two in my estimation (the other being Andrew Price-Smith's \\"The Health of Nations: Infectious Disease, Environmental Change, and Their Effects on National Security and Development\\"- as both authors are from the University of Toronto, one can only applaud the collection of talent this organization seems to nurture).<br />The author is brilliant and has a longer track record than most for being both prescient and meticulous about in the arena of environmental scarcity.<br />His book is effective in making the point, but very candidly, did not go the full distance that I was hoping for--he is, in a word, too general and the book lacks a single chapter that pulls it all together with very specific rankings of both the variables and the countries.<br />The general proposition is clear-cut: environmental scarcity has social effects that lead to violent conflict. However, the author takes a side road in exploring \\"human ingenuity\\" as an ameliorating factor, and while he makes reference to crass corporate and elitist carpet-bagging and the social structures of repression, he fails to draw out more fully and explicitly the inherent association between repressive corrupt regimes with extreme concentrations of wealth and power, scarcity, and violence.<br />For myself, I found two gems within this book: the first, a passing comment on the crucial role that unfettered urbanization plays in exacerbating scarcity and all that comes with it (migration, disease, crime); the second, the author's prescriptive emphasis, extremely importance, on the prevention of scarcity rather than adaptation or amelioration of scarcity.<br />The endnotes would have been more useful as footnotes but are quite good. The bibliography and index are four star rather than five star, and I was quite disappointed to not have a single page about the author, nor a consolidated bibliography of his many signal contribution over time in the form of articles and lectures.re four star rather than five star, and I was quite disappointed to not have a single page about the author, nor a consolidated bibliography of his many signal contribution over time in the form of articles and lectures.	2002-10-10

Books	5	12	16	N	Y	Gold Collar Guide to Fame and Fortune	Bottom line on this book is clear: the path to fame and fortune for &quot;gold collar workers&quot; (a term I first saw used by Robert Carkhuff in &quot;The Exemplar: The Exemplary Performer in an Age of Productivity (Human Resource Development Press, 1994) consists of four parts: 1) establish a personal brand name by placing before the marketplace a *free* capstone idea, &quot;manifesto&quot; or other form of self-expression; 2) have a web-site with forwarding email that allows anyone who likes your idea to download it, read it, share it; 3) work hard at getting your idea to a few powerful &quot;sneezers&quot; (the author has an alliance with Malcolm Gladwell, author of &quot;The Tipping Point&quot; and also of the foreword to this book)--pay them if you have to; and 4) let the money flow in from the post-branding offers for speeches, consulting, and new books.<br />I was initially inclined to give this book only 4 stars because it is not a traditional book with a lot of references (it does have an acceptable index) but I realized that the author not only accomplishes all he sets out to do, but the book is a real value in terms of both its financial cost, and time cost--reading this book certainly suggested to me several actionable ideas that will make my web site and my efforts to spread the idea of intelligence reform better.  While the author is enamoured of &quot;Fast Company&quot; (the magazine) and works hard to pay back some favors in his text, the various web sites that he mentions, including Epinions, Planetfeedback, and Enfish, are generally relevant and therefore not objectionable.<br />There are two competing ideas in the book, both worthy of note--first, that the public attention span is so limited that most of the money is made in the first release/first sales period, and then one should move on; and second, that persistence pays and the real money is to be had from the post-branding streams of revenue.  I believe this stems from the juxtaposition of how companies make money if they have the wherewithall to to churn the market with a lot of new offerings; and how individuals make money by establishing personal brand names--in general the author is strongest when dealing with what single individuals can and should do to take what they are really good at, package it, put it out (free), and then systematically reap residual financial benefits.sition of how companies make money if they have the wherewithall to to churn the market with a lot of new offerings; and how individuals make money by establishing personal brand names--in general the author is strongest when dealing with what single individuals can and should do to take what they are really good at, package it, put it out (free), and then systematically reap residual financial benefits.	2002-10-06

Although I know and admire the author, who has spoken at my conference, when the book came out I thought--really dumb, but I mention it because others may have made the same mistake--that it was about building a cute clock in the middle of the desert.<br />Wrong, wrong, wrong (I was).  Now, three years late but better late than never, on the recommendation of a very dear person I have read this book in detail and I find it to be one of the most extraordinary books--easily in the top ten of the 300+ books I have reviewed on Amazon.<br />At it's heart, this book, which reflects the cummulative commitment of not only the author but some other brilliant avant guarde mind including Danny Hillis, Kevin Kelly (WIRED, Out of Control, the Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization), Esther Dyson, Mitch Kapor (Lotus, Electronic Frontier Foundation) and a few others, is about reframing the way people--the entire population of the Earth--think, moving them from the big now toward the Long Here, taking responsibility for acting as it every behavior will impact on the 10,000 year long timeframe.<br />This book is in the best traditions of our native American forebears (as well as other cultures with a long view), always promoting a feedback-decision loop that carefully considered the impact on the \\"seventh generation.\\"  That's 235 years or so, or more.<br />The author has done a superb job of drawing on the thinking of others (e.g. Freeman Dyson, Esther's father) in considering the deep deep implications for mankind of thinking in time (a title popularized, brilliantly, by Ernest May and Richard Neustadt of Harvard), while adding his own integrative and expanding ideas.<br />He joints Lee Kuan Yew, brilliant and decades-long grand-father of Asian prosperity and cohesiveness, in focusing on culture and the long-term importance of culture as the glue for patience and sound long-term decision-making.  His focus on the key principles of longevity, maintainability, transparency, evolvability, and scalability harken back to his early days as the editor of the Whole Earth Review (and Catalog) and one comes away from this book feeling that Stewart Brand is indeed the \\"first pilot\\" of Spaceship Earth.<br />It is not possible and would be inappropriate to try to summarize all the brilliant insights in this work.  From the ideas of others to his own, from the \\"Responsibility Record\\" to using history as a foundation for dealing with rapid change, to the ideas for a millenium library to the experienced comments on how to use scenarios to reach consensus among conflicted parties as to mutual interests in the longer-term future, this is--the word cannot be overused in this case--an extraordinary book from an extraordinary mind.<br />This book is essential reading for every citizen-voter-taxpayer, and ends with an idea for holding politicians accountable for the impact of their decisions on the future.

One wonders if those responsible for inserting our forces into Afghanistan in the failed effort to capture the Taliban and Al Qaeda leadership intact, ever read this book.  It is quite good.<br />Although it provides very professional U.S. commentary after each vignette, commenting on both Soviet and Mujahideen behavior in the combat situations, it fails on two counts: the index is terrible (mostly an index of names, rather than combat lessons), and the final chapter is a whimper rather than a sonic boom--this book should be re-issued immediately with a proper index and a concluding chapter that pulls together the concise troop leading \\"bullets\\" for each of the 14 combat situations depicted by the vignettes ennumerated above.<br />One final note: the availability of this book via Amazon.com deserves special commendation.  I have been trying for years to get the U.S. Army's Strategic Studies Institute to get all of its very superior and valuable publications made available via Amazon.com so that its taxpayer-funded knowledge would be more widely available, and have simply not been able to get them off the dime.

A few items that jumped out at me:<br />1) Training is a priority and has both return on investment and retention of employee benefits that have been under-estimated.<br />2)  All major organizations (he focused on business, I would certainly add government bureaucracies) have \\"legal underpinnings, ..systems of governance, ..management disciplines, ..accounting (that) are based on a model of the corporation that has become irrelevant.\\"<br />3)  Although one reviewer objected to his comments on taxation, the author has a deeper point--the government is failing to steer the knowledge economy because it is still taxing as if we had an industrial economy--this has very severe negative effects.<br />4)  As I read the author's discussion of four trends he credits to John Hagel of I2, it was clear that \\"intelligence\\" needs to be applied not only to single organizations, but to entire industries.  In my view, this author is quite brilliant and needs to be carefully cultivated by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, all of the industry associations, and by governments.  There are some extremely powerful \\"macro\\" opportunities here that his ideas could make very profitable for a group acting in the aggregate.<br />5)  This is one book that should have had footnotes instead of end-notes, for while the author is careful to credit all ideas borrowed from others, it is difficult in the text to follow his thinking in isolation.  One idea that is very pertinent to national intelligence and counterintelligence as well as corporate knowledge management is that of the reversal of the value chain--\\"first sell, then make,\\" i.e. stop pushing pre-conceived products out the door and get into the business of just enough, just in time knowledge or product creation that is precisely tailored to the real time needs of the client.<br />6)  The author excells at blasting those corporations (and implicitly, major government bureaucracies such as the spy agencies that spend over $30 billion a year of taxpayer funds) that assume that if they only apply more dollars to the problem, they can solve any challenge.  \\"Too often 'dumb power' produces a higher-level stalemate.\\"  One could add: and at greater cost!<br />7)  The bottom line of this truly inspired and original book comes in the concluding chapters when the author very ably discusses how it is not knowledge per se that creates the value, but rather the leadership, the culture, and infrastructure (one infers a networked infrastructure, not a hard-wired bunker).  These are the essential ingredients for fostering both knowledge creation and knowledge sharing, something neither the CIA nor the FBI understood at the management level in the years prior to 9-11.to follow his thinking in isolation.

The Director of Central Intelligence usually serves as the policy representative to intelligence in carrying out these abuses, rather than as the intelligence representative to policy.  The second failure is one of &quot;inconvenient warning,&quot; where solid professional intelligence estimates are set aside and ignored because the politicians don't want to be bothered, don't think it will cost them with their domestic constituencies, and are not truly committed to long-term national security.  This is a bi-partisan problem--until the American people appreciate the connection between voting, policymaker character, and intelligence success, we will continue to get the government--and the intelligence community--that our citizens deserve.	2002-08-29

The manipulation of truth from the Saigon end, and the refusal to listen to truth on the Washington end, resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, Vietnamese, Laotian, Cambodian, and American, as well as allied nationalities.<br /><br />Ethics--and intelligence--matter, and no treatment of Supreme Command should fail to address how these two should be but often are not the foundation for the civilian-military relationship.

1449858:US	50761804	R2TZMS3I8SWKMU	1574883550	484958359	Brassey's International Intelligence Yearbook: 2002 Edition	Books	3	10	12	N	Y	Useful but Incomplete and Does Not Add Original Thinking	I was quite interested to see this book very favorably reviewed in the International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence (IJIC), the top journal in the field, so it was with some disappointment that I found it to be less robust than I expected.<br />At one level, that of a very basis reference, it could be a solid four-star effort, and I give the author and publisher credit for having conceptualized and executed this on-going endeavor.  Especially bothersome is its limited coverage--a directory such as this, especially in the aftermath of 9-11, must be comprehensive and include countries like Colombia, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the Central Eurasian \\"stans\\" to name a number that are not covered.<br />I found both the updates and the further readings to be a very mixed bag, with too many countries that I am familiar with suffering from what appears to be either an over-reliance on one or two primary sources or somewhat random notation. It is clear to me that this book does *not* benefit from a systematic literature review, nor is it really current with the great web sites that are available, both in general terms as well as with specific country orientations--on top of the limited coverage, less than a third of the world, this really reduces its value.<br />This book has the potential to be a five-star reference work of enormous value, if it makes the following changes:<br />1) Create a broader board of advisors. The author performs heroically for one man, but clearly does not have the global network of true experts that is needed to make sure his coverage is world-class.<br />2) Add a State of Intelligence report to the front of the book, with regional overviews. The emergence of a European intelligence community, the impact of the Kosovo war on this movement as well as NATO, NATO's publication of an open source intelligence handbook, etc., the specific points of failure for 9-11 as well as the Afghan campaign that failed to capture the Al Qada leadership, all should be in there, together with the Homeland Security initiative and new relations among nations now quasi-committed to improved cooperation against terrorism--while decapitating their programs against crime. To be a proper reference work, this book must also take care in the overview to tease out the threads of progress among the varied intelligence communities that exist-national civilian, military, law enforcement, investigative journalism, business intelligence, and academic studies on intelligence. The fact that it does not reference such vital organizations as the Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals, or the International Association of Law Enforcement Intelligence Analysts, for example, suggests that the book is being put together along very old lines of thinking, and is not yet coming to grips with the dramatic changes occurring in the real world of intelligence.<br />3) The publisher, or a non-profit foundation, must fund a proper literature review. Even for the United States, the most obvious country, most of the intelligence reform books published between 1999 and 2002 and listed by the Council on Intelligence do not appear in this reference work, nor does it retain the Aspin-Brown Commission Report or the House Permanent Select Committee Report on IC21, as references of continuing relevance.<br />4) The index must be expanded to include all authors and organizations.<br />5) The acronyms must be expanded to be truly comprehensive. A one page listing that is mostly military ranks and failed to include the acronyms PfP (Partnership for Peace), OSINT (open source intelligence), or C4I (command, control, communications, and intelligence--a vital aspect of understanding where intelligence fits in the larger picture) is simply not serious.<br />Bottom line: I will keep this book as a light-weight reference, but I will not buy it again unless the publisher gets serious about producing a quality product that is truly international and reflective of the intelligence reform and intelligence failure lines of inquiry that are well-known to serious professionals who understand that intelligence is the core competency of both governments and organizations in the age of information.l and reflective of the intelligence reform and intelligence failure lines of inquiry that are well-known to serious professionals who understand that intelligence is the core competency of both governments and organizations in the age of information.	2002-08-06
1456822:US	50761804	R4FRED0UKWS4H	0312284330	800097894	Crashing the Party: Taking on the Corporate Government in an Age of Surrender	Books	5	45	45	N	Y	"Must Read" Indictment of Both Major Parties	I was among those who thought Ralph Nader was a \\"spoiler\\" and deprived Al Gore of the election.  After reading this book, I now realize that Nader is correct-the major premise of his book is that both the Democratic and Republican parties have become so corrupt and so removed from citizen interests as to be identically disqualified from putting forward viable candidates for the future.  He puts forth a vision for a new democracy in which the citizens take back the power and demand that third party candidates be allowed to join the Presidential debates and be heard by America.<br />Some will accuse Nader of name-dropping and self-aggrandizing in this book, but that is an unfair charge. He has dedicated 40 years of his life to a quest for fairness in American life.  As I went through the book and reflected on his very early efforts on everything from women's rights to product safety to the environment I could not help thinking that the breadth and substance of his accomplishments make the Democratic and Republican candidates look like Johnny-come-latelys who are also bluffing snake oil salesmen.  This guy is \\"the real deal.\\"<br />I recommend that two books be read prior to reading this one: Halstead & Lind's \\"The Radical Center: The Future of American Politics\\" and Ray & Anderson's \\"The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People are Changing the World\\".  Two other books could add useful underpinnings to the points Nader makes that I summarize below: Lewis' \\"LOSERS: The Road to Everyplace but the White House\\" which immortalizes citizen-businessman Morry Taylor (the \\"Grizz\\"); and Williamson's \\"IMAGINE: What America Could be in the 21st Century.\\"<br />A few points about Nader's book that I hope will dispel all the negative reviews and demonstrate that this is required reading:<br />1)  This is the only book that addresses the totality of the challenges and threats to America in a sensible balanced way, without platitudes and upon a foundation of fact.<br />2)  This is the only book representing the new political paradigm in which the citizen-voters take back the power by wiping out the ability of corporations to buy politicians.<br />3)  This is the only book that thoughtfully and convincingly demonstrates that the Democrats have morphed into shadow Republicans, and both parties have completely lost their ethical and popular foundation.<br />4)  This is the only book that bluntly confronts the fact that we get the government we deserve--democracy is hard work and demands citizen time and thought.<br />5)  Among the useful details that should outrage and mobilize citizens, and all according to Nader:<br />  a)  the Commission on Presidential Debates is a fraud perpetrated upon the public--it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Democratic and Republic parties created explicitly to displace the more honest League of Women Voters and to bar third party candidates from being visible to America in the crucial Presidential debates.<br />  b)  there is an incestuous relationship between the media, the polls (most funded by the media) and the Presidential debate and public policy process.<br />  c)  global threats are not well-understood by Americans, and a major effort spanning the next generation must be undertaken to restore global or foreign affairs and foreign trade understanding to the public.<br />  d)  public budgets are neither public nor honest.  They are massively distorted with a \\"proliferating array of taxpayer subsidies, giveaways, and bailouts (known as corporate welfare) to corporations.\\"  A recurring theme in Nader's book, based on factual legally-viable documentation, is the manner in which corporations are looting the commonwealth with the active connivance of our elected officials.  The people need to wise up.<br />  e)  the Internet has *not* has the anticipated leveling effect of bringing out citizen-voters to take back the power and stop corporate socialism.<br />  f)  the non-profit organizations and popular organizations (e.g. the Sierra Club, the AFL-CIO) consistently misrepresent their members by choosing the \\"lesser of two evils\\" in the two traditionalist corporate candidates, not realizing that a) a lesser evil is still evil and b) their members are smart enough to consider third party alternatives and could--if enough such organizations banded together, cause a third party to be instantly visible as a mainstream alternative.<br />  g)  the public commonwealth (the airwaves, land, water, etc.) has been taken away from the people.  It is time to get it back and demand, as one small example, that those using the airwaves granted by the public provide for free political time for all viable candidates, ending the advertising rip-off that also deprives the people of clear access to all competing views.<br />  h)  community building from the neighborhood up is the place to start.  We need to focus on empowering and exciting the young people and building a cadre of volunteer civic activists that will sustain progressive public interests for the decades to come.<br />  I would make one personal observation that was inspired by reading this book: I do not believe that any one President, from any party, is viable as a \\"one click\\" choice for leading America.  In my view, the next President should not be elected without two fundamental changes in how we elect Presidents: 1) instant run-off voting must be enacted, allowing second choice votes to play a role if a third party candidate is not elected (while qualifying the third party for funding in future elections based on the first choice vote); and 2) Cabinets must be announced in advance of the election and be the focus of at least one Presidential debate including at least three but ideally four parties.  It is time for a third party candidate to pull together a Cabinet that includes the best choice for key posts irrespective of parties, and specifically including the Pat Buchanan's, Sam Nunns, Colin Powells, and key others like Ross Perot, Morry Taylor, even Jello Biafra (as new Minister of Culture!).<br />This is really a superb book, in the tradition the Committees of Correspondence that helped bring about the American revolution, and I recommend it to all.nizations and popular organizations (e.g. the Sierra Club, the AFL-CIO) consistently misrepresent their members by choosing the \\"lesser of two evils\\" in the two traditionalist corporate candidates, not realizing that a) a lesser evil is still evil and b) their members are smart enough to consider third party alternatives and could--if enough such organizations banded together, cause a third party to be instantly visible as a mainstream alternative.<br />     g)  the public commonwealth (the airwaves, land, water, etc.) has been taken away from the people.

It is largely descriptive and does not include what I really was looking for, measures of effectiveness and deliberate enumeration and evaluation of tangible legislative successes by each caucus, mor does it describe and evaluate specific outputs or methods used by caucuses (e.g. web sites, monthly newsletters, email lists).  It also does not include the specifics of Member names in relation to each caucus, or of key experienced staff participants in caucus management, both of which would have been useful appendices (and must now be dug out from the Congressional Yellow Book).  Finally, it makes reference to but only gives passing attention to the very strong anti-caucus element within the Congress, in which very serious respected Members take issue with the lack of fiscal accountability and other negative elements of the caucus.<br />Having said all that, I completely recommend this book as the only really good book-level treatment of this issue in isolation.  The bibliography is superb, covering books on legislative policy making as well as articles and primary documents.  The index is acceptable but not exemplary.<br />The author's bottom line, based on original research and a fine overview of national, regional, state/district, industry, party, and personal interest caucuses, is that they provide a very substantial *complement* to the formal committee process, and thus render an invaluable service to Members.<br />Caucuses, in the author's investigative report, exist primarily to help Members deal with complex issues that are either multi-jurisdictional in nature, not covered adequately by existing Committee assignments, or lacking in political support or attention for various reasons--the High Altitude Caucus, to keep environmental regulations designed for sea-level from being too silly at high altitudes, is a good example of the latter.<br />Caucuses are primarily information collection and sharing vehicles, followed by agenda and policy setting tools.  They serve as valuable forums for orienting new Members or helping Members across various Committee jurisdictions focus on shared concerns.<br />The book finds that caucuses are perceived as policy actors, both within the legislative process and within the Administration.  In the 100th Congress, the focal point for the book, most caucuses were focused on economic issues, especially trade.  About a quarter focused on defense and foreign policy including international trade and immigration issues.  Roughly 20% worked trade issues, 17% defense issues, and 13% immigration, human rights, and terrorism issues.<br />At the time of the book's writing there were no caucuses on national information strategy or information technology applications relevant to improving government operations at the federal level, or between the federal and state/local levels.<br />Administratively, in the past caucuses could be recognized as legislative service agencies and given official funding and floor space.  These privileges were eliminated in the mid-1990's due to leadership concerns over accountability and propriety.  Some converted to non-profit status, others to a new form of caucus, the congressional member organization.  In the aftermath of the 104th Congress elimination of the older form of caucus, most have staffs that are very small, 1-2 at most, and tend to be managed by the leading Member.<br />This is a fine book and a good first start for what could be a new literature on new forms of democratic representation enabled by the Internet.  There is no reason why the emerging trends in cyber-advocacy and digital democracy at described so well by the Foundation on Public Affairs might not eventually be integrated into a larger digital caucus environment in which Members can matrix various grassroots civic offerings, industry information, and caucus-based filtering and analytic services, to get in closer touch with real-world information that is not filtered by the Administration or the constrained by the limitations of the Congressional Research Service, which does the best it can with excruciatingly limited resources.  I hope the author goes on to write this second book as her first is a valuable and helpful offering to policy-makers, citizen advocates, and students of the emerging new democratic processes made possible by the Internet.ic services, to get in closer touch with real-world information that is not filtered by the Administration or the constrained by the limitations of the Congressional Research Service, which does the best it can with excruciatingly limited resources.

1462262:US	50761804	RU8LCKG2I2BDS	0873327616	983294362	The Power of the Powerless: Citizens Against the State in Central Eastern Europe	Books	5	78	98	N	Y	Public Truth  Can Overcome Political-Corporate Corruption	Living within the truth is the ultimate act of citizenship, and such living, even in the face of totalitarian repression (as in Czechoslovakia) or consumerist subversion and corporate corruption of the political and financial systems (as in the USA) can ultimately empower the powerless.<br />This is an *extraordinary* book that is directly relevant to the circumstances that we now find ourselves in--what Ralph Nader calls \\"corporate socialism,\\" where the nominal owners of both the federal government (the voters) and the corporations (the stockholders) find themselves disenfranchised, abused, shut out, and their life savings looted by the most senior chief executive officers and politicians.<br />The book is slightly mis-represented, with \\"et al\\" in small print after Havel's name as the author.  I was even tempted to skip the additional small essays (his leading essay constitutes 44% of the total book, with ten other essays each being roughly 6% of the book) but that would have been unwise.  There is real value in the other essays.<br />Both Eastern Europe prior to the revolution, and the USA in particular but Western democracies in general, share a common overwhelming problem, that of the silenced majority.  As both Havel here and Nader elsewhere observe, the word \\"progressive\\" is contaminated and diluted, while democracy and capitalism (or socialism) in the ideal are completely compromised by a combination of asymmetric information (keeping the people uninformed) and corporate or bureaucratic or political corruption.<br />Havel opens by noting that \\"the system has become so ossified politically that there is practically no way for ...nonconformity to be implemented within its official structures.\\"  This forces the vast majority of the public to \\"live within a lie,\\" and accept, either consciously or unwittingly, the huge chasm between political freedom and economic fairness in the ideal, and what the totalitarian or hijacked capitalism models offer in reality.<br />Brutally stated, from the point of view of the normal wage earner, there is no difference between totalitarianism and corrupt capitalism.  In page after page, Havel, poet and president, documents this truth.<br />Speaking specifically of the West, Havel notes that Western leaders, \\"despite the immense power they possess through the centralized structure of power, are often no more than blind executors of the system's own internal laws--laws they themselves never can, and never do, reflect upon.\\"  Who does that remind us of?  Clue: it makes no difference which party is in power.  Havel specifically relates the Czech and Eastern European experience to the West, \\"as a kind of warning to the West, revealing its own latent tendencies...\\"<br />Havel places most of his emphasis on reform at the individual and community level, outside of politics and economics.  He is especially encouraging in speaking of how unlikely it is to predict the moment when widely differing groups can come together in truth and freedom to overcome an oppressive regime, and yet how likely it is, in today's environment, that such a change might occur.<br />In many ways his long essay reminded me of George Will's collection of thoughts published as \\"Statecraft as Soulcraft,\\" except that Havel has found the state (either communist or capitalist) to be a failure at its most important function--the people must instead constitute an alternative polis that is initially side-by-side with the state, and ultimately displaces the state with a fresh new start.  Incumbents beware, Havel finds that more often than not a clean sheet fresh start is the way to go.<br />As the USA confronts terrorism and a right-of-center approach to law enforcement, Havel offers a clear warning to citizens at risk of being labeled as terrorists when in fact they are only dissidents and speakers of truth.  He speaks of the communist regime \\"ascribing terrorist aims to the 'dissident movements' and accusing them of illegal and conspiratorial methods.\\"  Shades of the present in the West, where anti-globalization activists and legitimate Arab and Muslim personalities have been tarred with the terrorist brush, held without recourse to lawyers, and generally abused in the name of an ill-defined and badly-managed counter-terrorism program.<br />Among his deepest thoughts, and I will stop here for the essay needs to be read by the same thoughtful people that are reading \\"Cicero\\" and \\"What Kind of Nation\\" and \\"Crashing the Party\\" and \\"The Best Democracy Money Can Buy\\", is the following:  \\"The 'dissident movements' do not shy away from the idea of violent political overthrow because the idea seems too radical, but on the contrary, because it does not seem radical enough.  For them, the problem lies far too deep to be settled through mere systemic changes, either governmental or technological.\\"  Havel, perhaps in concurrence with Lawrence Lessig and his \\"Future of Ideas\\" finds both the law and the legal code to be oppressive and abusive of the people--the recent effort to modify bankruptcy laws to reduce the protections of the people from abusive credit card companies, are but one small example--the outrageous extension of copyright and patent laws to keep innovation from the marketplace are another.<br />Havel anticipates the \\"whithering away and dying off\\" of traditional political parties, \\"to be replaced by new structures that have evolved from 'below' and are put together in a fundamentally different way.\\"  He speaks briefly of technology being out of control, and of the ultimate war now taking place, between state control and social control.  He concludes that parliamentary democracies are essentially institutionalized forms of collective *irresponsibility*, and that only a moral reconstitution of society, the resurrection of core \\"values like as trust, openness, responsibility, solidarity, love\\" will show the way out of the \\"classic impotence of traditional democratic organizations.\\"<br />The other authors are not to be missed, and provide complementary but distinct views that are helpful to sparking debate and reflection.  This volume will in my opinion stand as one of the great basic texts for political science and public administration, and it has great value for courses and reflections on ethics, citizenship, sociology, and economics.and conspiratorial methods.\\"  Shades of the present in the West, where anti-globalization activists and legitimate Arab and Muslim personalities have been tarred with the terrorist brush, held without recourse to lawyers, and generally abused in the name of an ill-defined and badly-managed counter-terrorism program.<br />Among his deepest thoughts, and I will stop here for the essay needs to be read by the same thoughtful people that are reading \\"Cicero\\" and \\"What Kind of Nation\\" and \\"Crashing the Party\\" and \\"The Best Democracy Money Can Buy\\", is the following:  \\"The 'dissident movements' do not shy away from the idea of violent political overthrow because the idea seems too radical, but on the contrary, because it does not seem radical enough.

Roy Godson's work in the 1980's and 1990's on intelligence requirements, carrying on today with his advanced thinking on restoring covert action and counterintelligence as well as the synergy among these and collection with analysis, makes him the premier policy-scholar in this arena.  Jim Wirtz, author of the very insightful \\"The Tet Offensive: Intelligence Failure in War,\\" and now chairman of the Department of National Security Affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School where very advanced work is being done on the new craft of intelligence (both human and technical, both secret and open), adds a combat practitioners perspective.<br />While there are some similarities among a few of the contributions, on balance each one is sufficiently unique.  Two key thoughts that jumped out:<br />1)  Most of the lessons learned come from World War II.  The authors were hard-pressed to find modern examples.  The one used from the Gulf War (an amphibious feint) is in my recollection false--we were planning an amphibious attack, and it was only at the last minute that CINCCENT was persuaded to do a Hail Mary end run, prompted in part by some exceptional work from the Navy's intelligence center that showed the beach obstacles in great detail.<br />2)  Two perennial lessons learned are that policy makers do not want to hear about possible hostile denial and deception--they want to stick with their own preconceptions (which of course make denial and deception easier to accomplish against us); and second, that intelligence experts tend to be under great pressure to cook the books in favor of policy preconceptions, while also being generally unwilling to believe the enemy can deceive them or accomplish slights of hand that are undetectable.<br />All of the chapters are good, but two struck me as especially helpful today: J. Bowyer Bell's \\"Conditions Making for Success and Failure of Denial and Deception: Nonstate and Illicit Actors,\\" and Bart Whaley & Jeffrey Busby, \\"Detecting Deception: Practice, Practitioners, and Theory.\\"  The latter, building on a lifetime of study that included a review of eight strategic cultures as well as the cost of major deceptions (D-Day deceptions that fixed German forces cost less than 1% of the assets and could have saved the entire force), examined 47 seven different kind of \\"detectives\\" from scientists and bank tellers to biographers and private eyes, and creates nine categories of \\"detectibles\\", concluding with the Law of Multiple Sensors, something that most stove-piped intelligence communities simply will not grasp for at least another decade.<br />This is both a serious work of scholarship, and a very valuable policy reader.can deceive them or accomplish slights of hand that are undetectable.<br />All of the chapters are good, but two struck me as especially helpful today: J.

His series in the 1980's, and then again in the 1990's, on intelligence requirements, stand alone as efforts to define and measure key elements.<br />With this book, written and published prior to 9-11,Godson provides both a historical and a prescriptive treatment of the two most neglected and mis-managed elements of U.S. national intelligence: covert action (concealed influence) and counterintelligence (protecting our secrets by catching their spies and agents of influence).<br />While 9-11 demonstrated our incapacity in both these vital areas that comprise the black art side of national power, there is no other book and no other expert that has done more to itemize the details that must be contemplated (and are not now being contemplated) by those responsible for devising homeland security defenses.  The author's appreciation for pre-emptive \\"offensive\\" counterintelligence and covert action, and his understanding of terrorist and criminal and other nonstate actors (one should include rogue corporations, of which there are many), make him particularly well-qualified to advise the Administration and Congress as we move toward what must be a draconian reconstitution and revitalization of national intelligence.	2002-07-25

Of the four books, this is the best.  If you buy only one, this is the one.  (The other three were Vineyard & McCurley's \\"Best Practices for Volunteer Programs\\", Lee & Catagnus, \\"Supervising Volunteers\\", and what may be one of the originals (from 1994), Susan J. Ellis' \\"The Volunteer Recruitment and Membership Development Book.\\"  These latter three are reviewed in their own spaces.)<br />This book by Helen Little, as good as it is, would normally lose one star because it fails to provide an index or a guide to other readings (including web sites) in niche areas of volunteer management.  However, it does provide excellent forms for each step of the volunteer management process and these are all downloadable from a given web address, so we'll call it even.<br />By way of larger context, this book, and books on volunteer management in general, are valuable not only for organizations that use volunteers as a resource, but for those who would manage citizen activism, as well as teen-agers with chips on their shoulders and a reluctance to bear down on chores.<br />While others have outlined volunteer \\"needs\\" and how to address them, Helen Little does it best.  The 12 basic needs--applicable to neighborhood mobilization, regional political campaigns, and teen-ager \\"work for respect\\" programs--are very well and concisely listed: 1) specific manageable task; 2) task that matches motivation; 3) good reason for doing the task; 4) written instructions; 5) reasonable deadline; 6) freedom to complete the task; 7) everything necessary to complete the task; 8) adequate training; 9) safe, comfortable, friendly environment; 10) follow-up; 11) opportunity (for the volunteer) to provide feed-back; and 12) appreciation, recognition, and rewards.<br />As I read this thoughtful book, comparing what volunteers need at each step of the way--and the more advanced comments by the author on how to plan for succession at every level of the organization from neighborhood to national, I kept thinking to myself: \\"traditional political parties are dead.\\"  Both the Democratic and Republican parties are violating every single tenet of this excellent work on how to attract, motivate, and activate citizen-voters.  It remains to be seen if our neighborhoods might yet self-organize.  This would be a good book for anyone thinking about organizing any endeavor of free spirits, at any level of play.houghtful book, comparing what volunteers need at each step of the way--and the more advanced comments by the author on how to plan for succession at every level of the organization from neighborhood to national, I kept thinking to myself: \\"traditional political parties are dead.\\"  Both the Democratic and Republican parties are violating every single tenet of this excellent work on how to attract, motivate, and activate citizen-voters.

1466004:US	50761804	R7UFLRRALDING	0940576252	470292988	The Volunteer Recruitment (and Membership Development) Book	Books	4	27	27	N	Y	Somewhat Dated, Some Nuggets	This book (acutally an 8.5 by 11 manual), originally published in 1994 and based on 1980's readings, is somewhat dated and has been only marginally updated.  It falls into the second rank of the four books that made the cut from among the many available.  Helen Little's &quot;Volunteers: How to Get Them, How to Keep Them&quot; stands alone as the single &quot;must buy.&quot;  This book is co-equal to two others, each recommended as supplementary reading because each has something to offer at a secondary level: Sue Vineyard and Steve McCurley's &quot;Best Practices for Volunteer Programs&quot; and Jarene Frances Lee with Julai M. Catagnus, &quot;Supervising Volunteers: An Action Guide for Making Your Job Easier.&quot;<br />There are two aspects of this manual by Susan Ellis that I did not see in the other books: first, her emphasis on casting a wide net and reaching as many potential volunteers as possible....(&quot;Most people do not say 'no'; they simply never knew you wanted them to say 'yes'.)  While I am skeptical of wasteful advertising programs in this time of diminishing leisure hours, there is something to this.  The other vital chapter that this manual offers is the one addressing the importance of image, i.e. the public perception of the organization seeking volunteers, the reputation that it can specifically draw on as a resource.<br />There are a few flakey notes (e.g. one vignette about recruiting people to call parents and offer support as they are getting kids out the door to school.  Any normal parent, especially if one parent is absent or has an early work start, would be furious at any volunteer daring to call in the midst of the chaos that charactizes getting three kids out the door to three different bus pick-up times.)<br />This manual does have an index.  Bottom line: dated, some nuggets, if volunteers are vital to your success, worth getting.	2002-07-23

Instead of filtering and distilling and integrating knowledge that can be used, they are spewing out multiple volumes that require the buyer to spend precious time attempting to discover applicable knowledge.  Having said that, I recommend this specific manual for purchase.<br />Among its positive points are its distinction among the five generations from which volunteers are drawn, and the unique strategies that must be adapted to each generation's distinct needs and expectations; its focus on the importance of understanding the differences between staff and volunteers and how to devise strategies that play to the strengths of each in collaborative ways; its direct discussion of &quot;mandated volunteers&quot; who have been sentenced to community service or must perform community service as part of early retirement programs; and its specific attention to how short-term volunteer tasks can be used to attract and evaluate potential longer-term volunteers.<br />This is a serious manual and an excellent complement to Helen Little's core work cited above.	2002-07-23

In essence, while the authors may have brought together some of the best annecdotes and insights on supervising volunteers, they have not done the more difficult work of integration and simplification that would have allowed the busy manager to absorb this material comfortably.  Reading this book is a strain.<br />The book also appears to be part of a &quot;portal program&quot; that churns out books and articles on volunteer program management.  On balance, I would get the book if you are the one person responsible for program-wide oversight of volunteer supervision, and not get it if you are simply one of many people superivising small numbers of volunteers.	2002-07-23
1496844:US	50761804	R2MQ28WVI12CI1	0679734023	474526017	Disturbing the Peace: A Conversation with Karel Huizdala	Books	5	19	28	N	Y	Human-Centric Self-Governance--Take Back the Power	Edit of 17 Apr 08 to add links.<br /><br />This book should be read as an adjunct to the author's other major book along these lines on power to the powerless.<br /><br />The most gripping and troubling conclusion that I drew from this book is that the United States of America is today much closer to where Czechoslovakia was in 1968 than anyone other than the Chomsky's and Vidal's might be willing to admit.  We have both a federal government and a national corporate economy that thrives on elitist secrecy and blatant lies--even our non-profit sector is corrupt, from the Red Cross to United Way to many others.  The people, the citizen-voters, truly have lost all power, as well as access to the information that might give them back the power, and this is indeed a black, absurdist-realist situation.<br /><br />On a more positive note, the author offers up, in the course of a long series of interviews, a number of ideas that are relevant to America today, as well as to any other emerging or re-emergent democracies in the making.<br /><br />1)  Model of behavior.  When arguing with the center of power, do not get side-tracked with ideological debates over right or wrong.  Focus on very specific concrete things (e.g. term limits, campaign finance reform, neighborhood economics) and stick to your guns.<br /><br />2)  Popular coalitions.  Non-violent non-partisan popular coalitions are the core means of taking back the power.  They represent a means for bring together groups of people from widely divergent backgrounds, with genuine social tolerance.<br /><br />3)  Informal networks.  Even under conditions of repression and censorship, informal networks of dissidents and quasi-dissidents can be effective in sharing information through samizdat publications.  [With the Internet, these possibilities explode, although caution must be taken on the fringes since the Internet is easily monitored and the more radical leaders could be declared seditionist \\"combatants\\" ineligible for their rights as citizens...speaking of the Soviet Union, of course, not America.]<br /><br />4) Man versus Machine.  Havel reaches his own conclusions founded in Czech literature and his own experience, with respect to the urgency of restoring the kinship and human connections that used to drive politics, economics, and other aspects of organized living.  He is at one with Lionel Tiger among many others, with respect to the terribly consequences of the industrial era in terms of de-humanizing decision-making and allowing remote elites to treat individual workers as dispensable cogs in the machine, whose lives matter not a whit.<br /><br />5)  Neighborhoods, Politics \\"From Below\\".  He joins the authors of the Cultural Creatives (Paul Ray and Sherry Ruth Anderson) and of IMAGINE: What America Could be in the 21st Century (Marianne Williamson) in emphasizing the vital role that neighborhoods must play in any democracy.  From political self-governance to sustainable economics to low-cost healthy agriculture to cultural cohesion, neighborhoods are the sin qua non of democracy--without active neighborhoods, one can go so far as to say, national democracy is a sham, a false theater, fully equivalent to the centralized, repressive, inefficient totalitarian control states of earlier eras.<br /><br />6)  Small Numbers Can Make a Difference.  I was struck by how few were the original dissidents and organizers--in some cases, 20-30 in number, in others 70-80.  Earlier studies have suggested that Hitler took power over millions with just 25,000 people.  One can only hope that the anti-thesis is true, and that the 50 million cultural creatives can take back the power by getting serious about organizing across neighborhoods and into a national network.<br /><br />7)  Art and theater matter.  Even under conditions of severe censorship and control, art and theater can be the manifestation of uncensored life, \\"life that spits on all ideology and all that lofty word of babble; a lifethat intrinsically resist(s) all forms of violence, all interpretations, all directives....here stood truth...\\"<br /><br />8)  Absurdity is a warning.  Nihilistic and absurd theater or other works of art are a caution.  They \\"do not offer us consolation or hope (but) merely remind( ) us of how we are living: without hope.<br /><br />9)  Truth can be misappropriated.  The author experienced the misappropriation of his words and was both hurt and enlightened, ultimately creating a play about truth, the circumstances in which it is said, and the whom, why, and how of it.<br /><br />10)  Great men doubt themselves.  Most touching are the author's many retrospective and current references to his insecurities, to his doubting himself even as he made history and became President of Czechoslovakia.<br /><br />11)  Writers live to  tell the truth.  This is certainly not true of most American writers who write for money, but it reflects the ideal and merits thought.<br /><br />12)  Change the atmosphere.  If you can do nothing else, strive for a moral mobilization and a change in the atmosphere of governance, at any level.  We cannot even begin to conceive the magnitude of the positive changes that can occur overnight if the people begin to speak truth among themselves.  Work toward a process \\"in which people's civic backbones (begin) to straighten again.\\"<br /><br />13)  Role of the intellectual.  While I the reviewer would churlishly doubt that America has many intellectuals right now, the author's concluding words on the role of the intellectual strike me as very important:  \\"...the intellectual should constantly disturb, should bear witness to the misery of the world, should be provocative by being independent, should rebel against all hidden and open pressure and manipulations, should be the chief doubter of systems, of power and its incantations, should be a witness to their mendacity.\\"<br /><br />Any person concerned about the corruption and misdirection of their government and their corporate as well as non-profit entities, will be provoked and inspired by this book.  It speaks to the future of human life as it might be, were we willing to stand up straight and be counted at citizen-voters, active at every level beginning with our own neighborhoods.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0571144403 Living in Truth: 22 Essays Published on the Occasion of the Award of the Erasmus Prize to Vaclav Havel]]<br />[[ASIN:0415908086 Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom]]<br />[[ASIN:0872864758 A Power Governments Cannot Suppress]]<br />[[ASIN:1576753441 Leadership and the New Science: Discovering Order in a Chaotic World]]<br />[[ASIN:1576753328 One from Many: VISA and the Rise of Chaordic Organization]]<br />[[ASIN:193213347X The Tao of Democracy: Using Co-Intelligence to Create a World That Works for All]]<br />[[ASIN:0759691681 Society's Breakthrough!: Releasing Essential Wisdom and Virtue in All the People]]<br />[[ASIN:1576752585 The World Cafe: Shaping Our Futures Through Conversations That Matter]]<br />[[ASIN:097156616X Collective Intelligence: Creating a Prosperous World at Peace]]directives....here stood truth...\\"    8)  Absurdity is a warning.

1497445:US	50761804	R2VDFMCTO9RVJO	0786311487	509865106	Virtual Learning: A Revolutionary Approach to Building a Highly Skilled Workforce	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Very Fine Starting Point	I have not found any virtual learning book to be fully satisfactory, but this one provides a very fine start. I completely agree with the author's opening premise that organizational learning is adrift and largely bankrupt intellectually (and what is being spent in dollars is largely being spent in a mindless and counter-productive fashion).<br />The seven core ideas that I drew from it are:<br />1)  Learn by doing.  Training must be fully integrated into day-to-day responsibilities and available on the fly.<br />2)  Expert Modeling.  Web-developers, multi-media experts, all these folks are *useless* unless there is a cadre of proven subject-matter-experts who can be used to devise the substance of the training in an interactive fashion.<br />3)  Survey before modeling.  Apart from having experts integrated into the design team, a larger survey of experts prior to the module design is recommended.<br />4)  Embed failure.  The author is a leading proponent of the idea that the best lessons are those that are learned from failing.  They are, in a word, memorable.<br />5)  Provide options.  Building on the learning that occurs from failure, the author proposes strong emphasis on options menus that allow students to branch in different directions immediately after the failure.<br />6)  Include ambiguity.  The author suggests that avoidance of the &quot;school solution&quot; is helpful--there should be no one answer, but degrees of answer.<br />7)  Prototype and test draft module.  As obvious as it might seem, the author's experience suggests that too often distance learning modules go straight into production without being tested on real students, something he considers essential.<br />Missing from the book, which could do with a new edition, is a directory of virtual learning success stories apart from the author's own experience, and of virtual learning tools.  I would be especially interested in an appendix with a cross-section of URLs for successful distance learning examples across the various university degree areas as well as in vocational training.<br />The book did inspire me to conceptualize virtual training and distance learning as a new means of managing corporate knowledge.  I am very disenchanted with the years of nonsense coming from those championing &quot;knowledge management&quot; and as my own interests have moved toward collaborative work, external source exploitation, and organizational intelligence, I have come to the conclusion that a good strategy for any organization interested in perpetuating and leveraging its internal knowledge would be to take a distance learning approach that integrates a weekly open source intelligence report on the state of the knowledge segment; a distance learning menu related to that knowledge segment; an expert forum where completion of the distance learning is required before participating; and a virtual library of internal and external sources structured for efficient use.  The next step would be to expand the circle and share the burden with other organizations, ultimately creating an information commons for that specific knowledge segment.<br />This is a good book, and helpful to anyone wishing to reflect on how the future calls for continuous education, learning by doing, and doing by learning.nce learning examples across the various university degree areas as well as in vocational training.<br />The book did inspire me to conceptualize virtual training and distance learning as a new means of managing corporate knowledge.

This will also ensure the folks that follow my reviews (\\"See more about me\\" should really say \\"See my other reviews\\") are alerted to this really exceptional first-person story from a blond, blue-eyed American mujahid.<br />Table of Contents<br />Chapter 1: From San Diego to Afghanistan Through Frankfurt, Vienna, Pakistan, and Kashmir, 1993<br />Chapter 2:  Afghanistan, Winter 1993-1994<br />Chapter 3:  First Trip to Chechnya, 1995-1996<br />Chapter 4:  Youth (How an American Came to Islam and Jihad)<br />Chapter 5:  How the CIA (and the FBI) Betrayed Me, 1996-1999<br />Chapter 6:  Chechnya Revisited, 1999-2000<br />Chapter 7:  September 11, 2001<br />Endorsements<br />\\"This is a moving, detailed bird's eye view of both the realities of global conflicts in which innocents are called terrorists while governments do the terrorizing; and of the flagrant inadequacies of the CIA and the FBI, each full of good people trapped in monstrously politicized bureaucracies.  I know and admire this mujahid--he is a loyal American, a faithful Muslim, and a speaker of truth.  Hear him, and weep.\\"<br />Robert David Steele, former CIA case officer and author of ON INTELLIGENCE: Spies and Secrecy in an Open World<br />\\"An important book that takes you deep inside the world of jihadis and a disturbing indictment on why 9/11 caught the U.S. intelligence community by surprise.  If you want to understand the little-known world of Islamic jihad, read this book.\\"<br />Robert Young Pelton, author of \\"The Hunter, the Hammer, and Heaven\\" and of \\"The World's Most Dangerous Places\\"<br />Now for an additional comment: both the author of this book, and Robert Young Pelton, among others, have published accounts of how the Russian government, and specifically its intelligence services, have been blowing up apartment buildings in Moscow and creating excuses for committing genocide against the Chechnyan Muslims.  I myself had no personal knowledge of this until last week when I was in London and talking to very knowledgeable senior officers attending an intelligence seminar at Oxford University.  Among the things we discussed: the public disclosure on Russian television that it was the Russian intelligence service that was caught moving explosives into the building of a basement.  Tipped off by an alert citizen, the local police bagged all the perpetrators and went on television to claim credit for foiling a Chechnyan terrorist plot.  To their shock, they shortly discovered it was the Russian FSB (successor to the KGB) doing the dirty work, and a profusely sweating police major general, reading stiffly from a prepared statement, was forced to go on television to state that the earlier report was in error, that the FSB was running an \\"exercise\\" to test police alertness.  Right.  I am fully satisfied, based on open sources, that the Russians are committing genocide against Chechnyan Muslims (as well as Russian Tatars, another little story our State Department does not like to see discussed in public).<br />It's time for the U.S. public to get a grip on international reality, because the U.S. government is deliberately avoiding public discussion of the harsh realities of the real world that make it highly unlikely our grand-children will enjoy anything near our level of prosperity and security, marginal as it is for many of us.<br />This book is from a guy just like any American with a blue-collar job--he's been there, he's lost a leg to combat wounds, he's lost his livelihood to FBI and CIA incompetence, he has a great deal to teach all of us about the narrow slice of life that he has experienced on our behalf.  This is a very fine book, andI recommend it without reservation.d I recommend it without reservation.	2002-06-14

America is on a very slippery slope right now, and there is much to be learned from the efforts of Thomas Jefferson to prevent Federalist abuses against both the rights of the states and the rights of the people.	2002-06-14

Simon's \\"What Kind of Nation: Thomas Jefferson, John Marshall, and the Epic Struggle to Create a United States,\\" drives right to the heart of the matter, and is an excellent complement to this book: at what point, we must ask, is it necessary for a people to re-evaluate the balance of power between federal impositions, state dispositions, and popular values?<br />Jeff Shaara has given us a real gift with his work on the origins of the American rebellion against English tyranny and taxation without representation--and all of this material has more meaning today than most people seem to realize.  I look forward to his future books, hoping they will also have annotated bibliographies that encourage further reading, for I am absolutely persuaded, as Thomas Jefferson said early on, that \\"A Nation's best defense is an educated citizenry.\\"  This book is a very fine start for any adult seeking a quick fresh look at our Nation's early days and early ethical conflicts.for any adult seeking a quick fresh look at our Nation's early days and early ethical conflicts.	2002-06-14

The author opens the book with a recap of what is now *known* about the theft of the U.S. Presidential election through the deliberate removal of over 50,000 predominantly black and democratic voters from the Florida voting rolls.  The author captures a sense of public outrage that I have not seen in the media, and that I long to see emerge in the forthcoming Congressional elections--what kind of Nation allows its highest office to be stolen like this, with nothing said in any state?  We just let it happen and life goes on?  This says something about our lack of ethics and our lack of spine as individual citizens.<br />The entire book is full of common sense--\\"in your face\\" common sense delivered with a very fine mix of humor and outrage.  This is not a book that should be taken lightly--more conventional books such as those by Ted Halstead and Michael Lind (\\"The Radical Center\\"), Allan Bloom (\\"The Closing of the American Mind\\"), William Greider (\\"Who Will Tell the People: The Betrayal of American Democracy\\"), or Lionel Tiger (\\"The Manufacture of Evil: Ethics, Evolution and the Industrial System\\") are all in deep harmony with the key points the author is making.<br />Among them:<br />1)  The privileged elite, the \\"white boys\\" from Ivy League schools who have, despite C averages, overcome their mediocrity and lack of ethics through family connections and incestuous business relationships, are at the root of most of our problems as a Nation.  They have, in short, looted the commonwealth and prevented democratic investments in education, public health, and other \\"common\\" values.<br />2)  The poor state of education among the masses that cannot afford private schools is the other side of the problem--the author would suggest that our Congressional representatives have replaced our teachers as \\"the best of the servant class\\" and that it is the ignorance of our Congressional representatives, most of whom know nothing of the real world beyond their own districts, and the lack of Congressional support for a truly national educational system that stabilizes investments based on quality needed rather than local real estate values, is the core deficiency holding us back as a people.<br />This is a great airplane book, and it is a good starting point for anyone thinking ahead to how they might yet make America, and the world, a better place--a place that might support our future generations of children.  Apart from the books cited above, and the many others that I have reviewed (\\"See more about me\\" should really say \\"See my other reviews\\"), I would simply to say to anyone smart enough to be visiting Amazon.com at all, it's time you took responsibility for local, state, and national political decisions.

This is a non-trivial accomplishment, so 4 stars.<br /><br />However, the book is also--being brilliantly designed to be understood by the lowest common denominator, an undergraduate--somewhat shallow and empty.... especially when compared with Stephen Wolfram's \\"A New Kind of Science\\", 1197 pages not counting the index, which is at the other extreme.<br /><br />Although there are good notes, there is no bibliography, and the author fails to use network methodology to illustrate and document the emerging literature on networks--called citation analysis, this would have been a superb appendix to the book that would have taken it up a notch in utility.<br /><br />Among the key points that the author discusses and which certainly make the book worth buying and reading, my above reservations not-with-standing:<br /><br />1)  Reductionism has driven 20th century science (and one might add, all other knowledge), with the result being that we have experts who know more and more about less and less--and )as CIA and FBI recently found)while leaving us devoid of generalists and multi-disciplinary artists and scientists who can \\"connect the dots\\" across these fragmented foci.<br /><br />2)  Contrary to the prevailing wisdom about networks being equally distributed and thus largely invulnerable to catastrophic meltdown, the author does a fine job of documenting the importance of selected \\"hubs\\", so important that their removal ultimately breaks the network down into isolated pieces.  The functionality of the network, its strength, is also its weakness--vulnerability to deliberate attack against the hubs (the author does not mention the Internet domain directories except in passing while discussing a table error, but MAYEAST and MAYWEST would be two obvious directory hubs that could be better protected through replication).<br /><br />3) The author inadvertently makes a vital contribution to our understanding of how to defend America against terrorism--discussing why no single authority can close down the Internet by fiat, he notes \\"The underlying network has become so distributed, decentralized and locally guarded that even such an ordinary task as getting a central map of it has become virtually impossible.\\"  LOCALLY GUARDED--this is the key phrase.  Federalizing counter-terrorism, and using federal agents and computers at the state and local levels, will not be effective against terrorists in civilian guise within the homeland--only a complete extension of counterintelligence and counterterrorism methods to the state & local level--teaching them to fish for terrorists, rather than trying to catch the terrorists with federal trawlers, is the way to go.<br /><br />4)  The author flirts with what is known as nomadic computing, making the point that nodes built around individual people are becoming as important--some would say more important--in a networked economy than nodes built around static organizations.  There is a useful general discussion of how \\"fitness\\" in a networked economy is a combination of speed and scalability as well as diversity of linkages.  As a general rule, as the FBI found (and also CIA, INS, and the State Department), systems with a single hub resistant to initiative from the field offices will tend to be slow and ineffective.<br /><br />Missing from this populist overview is a discussion of the vital importance of geospatial information.  While the author helpfully notes the Earth is increasingly covered by an electronic \\"skin\\" with millions of measuring devices, with experts predicting that by 2010 there will \\"around 10,000 telemetric devices for each human on the planet\\" (one suspects this refers only to privileged humans, not the billions of dispossessed that lack telephones, never mindcomputers), he does not take the next essential step, which is to note that in the absence of an XML-GEO standard and a global push to associate geospatial as well as temporal tags with all data, much of what we collect will, like the trillions of bits we have collected with secret satellites, never get processed in a meaningful manner.<br /><br />This is a helpful book that will be of value to the general reader at the elementary (adult) level.<br /><br />See also:<br />[[ASIN:193213347X The Tao of Democracy: Using Co-Intelligence to Create a World That Works for All]]<br />[[ASIN:0465071929 Group Genius: The Creative Power of Collaboration]]<br />[[ASIN:0738202614 Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace]]<br />[[ASIN:0471419192 Global Brain: The Evolution of Mass Mind from the Big Bang to the 21st Century]]<br />[[ASIN:1576753328 One from Many: VISA and the Rise of Chaordic Organization]]<br />[[ASIN:0300125771 The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom]]<br />[[ASIN:0836920333 World Brain (Essay Index Reprint Series)]]<br />[[ASIN:0385721706 The Wisdom of Crowds]]<br />[[ASIN:1595551131 An Army of Davids: How Markets and Technology Empower Ordinary People to Beat Big Media, Big Government, and Other Goliaths]]computers), he does not take the next essential step, which is to note that in the absence of an XML-GEO standard and a global push to associate geospatial as well as temporal tags with all data, much of what we collect will, like the trillions of bits we have collected with secret satellites, never get processed in a meaningful manner.<br /><br />This is a helpful book that will be of value to the general reader at the elementary (adult) level.<br /><br />See also:<br />[[ASIN:193213347X The Tao of Democracy: Using Co-Intelligence to Create a World That Works for All]]<br />[[ASIN:0465071929 Group Genius: The Creative Power of Collaboration]]<br />[[ASIN:0738202614 Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace]]<br />[[ASIN:0471419192 Global Brain: The Evolution of Mass Mind from the Big Bang to the 21st Century]]<br />[[ASIN:1576753328 One from Many: VISA and the Rise of Chaordic Organization]]<br />[[ASIN:0300125771 The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom]]<br />[[ASIN:0836920333 World Brain (Essay Index Reprint Series)]]<br />[[ASIN:0385721706 The Wisdom of Crowds]]<br />[[ASIN:1595551131 An Army of Davids: How Markets and Technology Empower Ordinary People to Beat Big Media, Big Government, and Other Goliaths]]	2002-06-03
1526682:US	50761804	R1CBTLK3JA7SGW	0312285485	385557836	The Death of the West: How Dying Populations and Immigrant Invasions Imperil Our Country and Civilization	Books	5	46	55	N	Y	Hard Truth--Left, Right, or Independent, It Is The Truth	Patrick Buchanan has impressed me enormously with this book. For one thing, he has his facts right. The English-speaking peoples, as Churchill called them, and the Caucasian peoples, as our Russian colleagues as well as Europe might be inclined to describe them, are not replenishing their populations. Immigrants have been a blessing to this country (my mother, for instance), but in the absence of a judicious combination of repopulation, immigrant integration, and sustained civic duty by the larger population, we become hollow and fragmented.<br />Most interestingly to me, Patrick Buchanan and Lee Kuan Yew, former Premier of Singapore, perhaps the most intelligent man in Asia, are in total--and I do mean total--agreement on the vital importance of the family as the foundation of civilization and continuity. I grew up in Singapore, and have extremely deep feelings of respect for Lee Kuan Yew, and what I see here is two men, as far apart as the earth and philosophy might separate them, who agree on the one core value apart from religion (it does not matter which religion, only that one respect within a religion): FAMILY. Family is the root of cultural continuity and civil sustainability, and if we allow the traditional nuclear family to enter into minority non-replenishment status, we are in fact destroying the Nation.<br />Patrick Buchanan speaks of how we are no longer one nation under God--or one nation, period. There is a great deal to what he says. For one thing, Mexico has reclaimed American territory all the way up to the Guadalupe-Hidalgo treaty line, and the at least one major Republican family seems to be an active element in support of Mexico's illegal as well as legal immigration subversion of America. For another, and Joel Garreau did this in his book by this title, very intelligently, America is geographically, culturally, and economically really NINE nations in terms of geophysical and cultural separation.<br />The author also alludes to the growing separation between the federal government, which is agreeing to supra-national deals that hurt the states and the population at large--or refusing to sign off on deals (e.g. the Kyoto Treaty) that would actually benefit future generations.  One is left with the feeling that we have three different Americas--the federal bureaucracy, the state-level authorities, and the people, and somewhere in here our methods of governance are failing to reconcile the behavior of the first two with the values of the third--in part because the people are all over the lot in terms of values, and we have lost our social cohesion.<br />Bottom line: he may never be President, but Patrick Buchanan speaks to the core of American values, and he must always be respected and listened to at the high table of American politics.separation between the federal government, which is agreeing to supra-national deals that hurt the states and the population at large--or refusing to sign off on deals (e.g. the Kyoto Treaty) that would actually benefit future generations.

It is less effective at drawing generic lessons (other than &quot;sue them&quot;).  I would emphasize, however, that these are important stories and the book renders a valuable service in documenting them for on-going reference, similar in support status to everything written by Lester Brown.<br />Bottom line: E.O. Wilson's &quot;The Future of Life&quot; is the best of the lot, see my review of that book for the best in class slice.  The other book I recommend in support of E.O. Wilson's encompassing and specific work, is that by Brian Czech, on &quot;Shoveling Fuel for a Runaway Train: Errant Economists, Shameful Spenders, and a Plan to Stop Them All.&quot;	2002-05-29

One can only speculate how corrupt our media have become--how beholden to their owners and advertisers--if we cannot get front page coverage of the Florida government's disenfranchisement of over 50,000 predominantly black and democratic voters, prior to the presidential election; or of the raw attacks on our best interests by the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, and others linked in a \\"trigger\\" network where taking money from one demands all sorts of poverty-inducing and wealth theft conditions.<br />Even more timely are his stories about the current Administration continuing a practice of the former Administration, spiking, curtailing, forbidding intelligence investigations into Saudi Arabian government funding of bin Laden's terrorism as well as Pakistani production of the \\"Islamic\\" atomic bomb.<br />His exposes of corporate misdeeds, some criminal, some simply unethical, all costing the U.S. taxpayer dearly, are shocking, in part because of their sleaziness, in part because our own newspapers do not dare to fulfill their role as envisioned by the Founding Fathers, of informing and educating the people of this Nation upon which the government depends for both its revenue and its legitimacy.<br />Although I take this book with a grain of salt (wondering, for example, why he did not ensure that Gore's campaign had all that he could offer in time to challenge the vote disenfranchisement as part of the Supreme Court case), there is enough here, in very forthright and sensible terms, to give one hope that investigative journalism might yet play a role in protecting democracy and the future of the Republic.	2002-05-29

While I do not relish factual and temperate evidence that our clandestine operations in Viet-Nam were largely a sham; that we were the useful idiots to local authorities using us as a cash cow and tool of vengeance on their personal enemies; that most of our officers were drunk or adulturous or incompetent or all three at once; that our top agent really did not have the access he claimed to have but was simply a high-quality channel for his uncle to sell information collected from various local and mostly open sources--all this is depressing.  It is also instructive.<br />Other low points include the pettiness of Office of Security and Directorate of Operations officers, the excessive influence of selected prior military flag-level contract officers who manipulated or suppressed information; and the wholesale abdication of financial management at the local level to Vietnamese paramours who robbed us blind.<br />High points in the author's story include Air America, which never let him down in getting him in and out of places so far forward toward danger I had no idea polygraphers operated that tactically; a few really great case officers who tried to do the right thing; and the basic decency of this one human being, whom I take to be the norm for agency employees world-wide rather than the exception.<br />Viet-Nam brought out the worst in the CIA's operational service, and I have often thought to myself that Viet-Nam is where the DO learned to launder money, run drugs, and leave ethics at the door.  I applaud the author for articulating, in a no-nonsense manner, \\"ground truths\\" about Viet-Nam that could be used to instruct those being sent to Afghanistan, the Philippines, and back into Africa.  To the best of my knowledge, there is no other book by a polygrapher that covers this topic of \\"spies and lies,\\" and this book is therefore an instant classic and collectible, absolutely essential for any manager or student of intelligence operations.tion.<br />Viet-Nam brought out the worst in the CIA's operational service, and I have often thought to myself that Viet-Nam is where the DO learned to launder money, run drugs, and leave ethics at the door.

This book should be read in conjunction with Greg Palast's [[ASIN:0452285674 The Best Democracy Money Can Buy]]  Vidal's book should be subtitled \\"you get the government you deserve.\\"<br /><br />I cannot think of a book that has depressed me more.  There are three underlying issues that make this book vitally important to anyone who cares to claim the title of \\"citizen:\\"<br /><br />1)  Citizens need to understand what their government is doing in the name of America, to the rest of the world.  \\"Ignorance is not an excuse.\\"  All of the other books I have reviewed (\\"see more about me\\" should really say \\"see my other reviews\\") are designed to help citizens evaluate and then vote wisely in relation to how our elected representatives are handling national security affairs--really, really badly.<br /><br />2)  Citizens need to probe more deeply for how often the federal government (and many state and local governments) abuse their powers.  In the absence of citizen engagement at every level on a 24/7 (i.e. some of the people all of the time), the government falls prey to \\"The Pathology of Power\\" as Norman Cousins describes it.  We get the government we deserve--if we do not care enough to monitor our investments (both taxes and elected representatives) then we allow ourselves to fall prey to a combination of special interests with lots to gain from looting the public treasury by privatizing the commonwealth, and inept bureaucracies that respond to the loudest or most attractive offer.  The author recommends, among other things, cancelling tax exemptions for religions that have become fronts for lucrative real-estate holdings, and one surmises that he would favor equitable taxation of corporations as well, rather than leaving the burden on the people.<br /><br />3)More subtly, the author explores some \\"information\\" issues,using the McVeigh case (the Oklohoma bombing) as a case in point.  He starkly questions whether the government has honestly and fully investigated the larger group that helped McVeigh, at the same time that he suggests that the government has withheld information from the people in order to give greater credence to the government's proposition that McVeigh was a lone madman rather than a valiant soldier representing a broader group of grass-rooted Americans.  I will only comment that in the aftermath of both Oklahoma and 9-11, I have constantly been surprised and made thoughtful by the number of middle-class Americans across America who tell me they do not trust the federal government or its agencies, and would no more think of giving them leads than of harming a loved one.<br /><br />Vidal is focused on two great evils--the ongoing \\"police state\\" and the increased loss of liberties that have been occasioned by 9-11 (I for one strongly oppose the federalization of state & local security--a prescription for internal war); and the increased waste of the taxpayer dollar on a military-industrial system that is looting the commonwealth.  Whatever your point of view, his thoughts cannot be ignored for they are elegant and informed.<br /><br />He ends the book with a letter to the President that strikes me as terribly naive with all that we now know about Florida removing over 50,000 predominantly black and democratic voters from its voter roles (see Greg Palast's book recommended above), and the documented relations between the President's family, the President's closest advisors, and the barons of the economic fiefdoms that Vidal seeks to liberate.<br /><br />Suffice to say, this book forces one to consider that there may not be a safe zone, and one may be required to take sides on what could become an internal war in America.  I am deeply saddened and frightened by this prospect, but my first graduate thesis was on revolution, and I remember the Davies J-Curve very well--the people revolt, not under oppression, but when they have lived well and the barons remove one too many of their benefits.  Among the most importantprecipitants of revolution (as opposed to preconditions) that my study documented was a proven failure on the part of the state to provide security for the people--if there is another 911, particularly in the aftermath of the blatantly consistent statements to the effect that it is \\"inevitable,\\" then I would not be surprised to see an internal rebellion capable of dramatically altering the composition of the federal government.

There is real poetry and deep philosophy in all that he offers.<br />Ralph Peters is a man of the people, a man of humble origins whose global travels, military service, and literary accomplishments make him a national treasure--not to the government that would seek to disown him and silence him, but to the people.<br />He is caustically critical of the corruption in the U.S. as well as other governments that stem from oil company fortunes in bribery and illegitimate influence; he is brutally on the mark when criticizing the useless and very expensive military systems we procure with the taxpayer dollar, only to see them irrelevant in the war on terrorism; and he is chillingly prescient when he forsees the growing gap between the American people and their own government, a government unwilling to make available to the people all of the information is has in hand with respect to terrorism and what we need to do to root out terrorism--including terrorism funded by Saudi Arabian rulers desperately holding on to power with American support.<br />Among his most brilliant pieces are those on hucksters in uniform, on the black art of intelligence, and on the greatest threat to all mankind, the diverse manner in which information will be available or exploited or ignored by distinct cultures and social classes.<br />This book, this author, are unique. Any citizen, any elected official, any foreigner interested in the most advanced thinking and deepest insights on America, the world, and terror, will be very well served by carefully absorbing every line that Ralph Peters lays down, each line a guantlet--one can almost hear his body armor clank as line after line comes down hard on the table--slam...slam....slam....

He has spoken twice to my international conference of intelligence professionals from over 40 countries, and by common acclaim has been invited to join us each year, forever.<br />This is not a \\"tough guy\\" or thrill seeker.  Robert Young Pelton is an unassuming gentle person who created a niche for himself with his annually updated \\"World's Most Dangerous Places\\" and the related Discovery TV program \\"Come Back Alive,\\" and in the process discovered that most Embassies and most journalists don't look for the truth, much less find it.<br />In this book, he has done something useful that could not be achieved with his more focused and fragmented country by country almanac of world dangers.  He has chosen three representative renditions of hell on earth--one dealing with the greed and corruption of diamond mining in Sierra Leone; another dealing with religious intolerance and government terrorism in Chechnya; and the third dealing with massive environmental as well as economic issues in Papua New Guinea.<br />Each of the three stories combines a rather matter of fact but most interesting story of exactly how he gets in and out of places and who he sees and what they say; with his insights on where the various parties are clashing and how they are doing.  Each of these \\"case studies\\" is distinct, but taken together, they give one the sense of dispair that comes from reading Robert Kaplan, or William Shawcross, or Ralph Peters.<br />Robert Young Pelton is as close as I have found to a true global \\"intelligence minuteman\\" capable of getting at ground truth using only legal and ethical methods.  He is unique for having traversed the earth and seen it all, as well as for putting such knowledge in the hands of the taxpayers who fund our government's continuing exclusion of such places from the public debate over the future of our peace and prosperity.<br />If we are ever to get a grip on foreign policy and national security spending, it will be authors such as Robert Young Pelton that make it possible for \\"the people\\" to take back the power over how we spend taxpayer funds.will be authors such as Robert Young Pelton that make it possible for \\"the people\\" to take back the power over how we spend taxpayer funds.	2002-05-28

I give the editor and publisher low marks for the terrible maps (many seem to have lost their unit location markings and other key annotations) and the lack of tables showing \\"who knew what when...\\"<br />Three themes stayed with me as I put the book down:<br />1)  A great deal can be accomplished in terms of intelligence with even a very small number of people--as few as 1-2 on staff, 3-5 behind the lines.  We in America have substituted billions for technology and a cast of close to 100,000, for rather poor intelligence and counterintelligence.<br />2)  Maps, especially \\"information maps,\\" are worth their weight in gold.  I was reminded by this book that intelligence has in the past been an off-shoot of topographical engineering and map making, and do believe that we must restore the \\"hard-wired\\" connection between geospatial information and the \\"data\\" that our human, imagery, and signals professionals seek out.<br />3)  Deserters, prisoners, and legal travelers are a gold mine of information and must, must, must be systematically exploited.  No matter the degree to which they may offer up untruths and deceptions, the bottom line is that any commander who fails to plan for the systematic exploitation of these human resources, and to do so in a timely fashion, is derelict in their duty.  As I recall, we do not yet have a proper table of organization or equipment in the U.S. force inventory for handling such individuals--the worst battalion, or the over-burdened military police, or some kludge collection of reservists, seems to end up being the solution each time.  This dereliction is even more costly in \\"low intensity\\" environments.<br />I will not make too much of it, but I was especially pleased to see how much of Grant's intelligence came from enemy newspapers.<br />The author seeks to make much--perhaps too much--of how Grant did not allow himself to be immobilized by a lack of intelligence, substituting initiative when intelligence was lacking, but I for one don't buy it.

What a great book this is!  Every person that relys on their brain for a living, whether as an employee or consultant or teacher, can double their *perceived* value by reading and applying the lessons of this book.<br />A few of the author's well-discussed and well-illustrated ideas are offered here to complement the many other favorable reviews:<br />1)  Simplify access to your work!  [Learn how to create executive summaries, tables of contents, hyper-links, etc.--don't assume that everyone knows your value and is willing to spend time digging into your work.]<br />2)  Quality, speed, and price are *not* in competition, they must be offered simulaneously and at full value.<br />3)  What is your promise or value proposition?  Are you just showing up, or does every day offer a chance for you to show your value in a specific way?<br />4)  Don't just be the best in your given vocation, *change it* for the better and redefine what &quot;best&quot; means!<br />5)  Sell your relationship (and your understanding of the other person's needs), not just your expertise in isolation.  Your boss or client has  three choices and you are the last: to do nothing, to do it themselves, or to use you.  Focus on being the first choice every time.<br />6)  Execute with passion--and if you are a super-geek or nerd that does not have a high social IQ, form a partnership with a super-popular person and put them in front.<br />There are many other useful thoughts in this book.  If you want to know how to sell the invisible, the intagible, the value propositions that revolve around knowledge and insight instead of bending metal and assembling things, this is absolutely the best book one could ask for.  Really nicely presented.	2002-04-03

Any analyst or operator planning to spend time on the ground in Afghanistan will benefit from reading this book.  Published in India, it does take time to obtain (three months in my case), but the wait is worth it.  I would recommend that this book be read first, for atmospherics and historical cultural constancy, before moving on to some of the other works of more recent vintage.<br />Chapter headings are as follows:<br />01  The Afghan Character<br />02  Afghan Traditions<br />03  Border Warriors<br />04  A Frontier Valley (Kurram Valley, Shiahs and Sunnis)<br />05  The Christian's Revenge (medical overt action)<br />06  A Day in the Wards (patient case histories)<br />07  From Morning to Night (more medical case histories)<br />08  The Itinerant Missionary (India and Afghanistan)<br />09  Afghan Mullahs (early depiction of the Mullahs)<br />10  A Tale of a Talib (Christianity in conflict with Mullahs)<br />11  School-Work (Mullahs, education, Indians vs. English)<br />12  An Afghan Football Team (mostly about India)<br />13  Alam Gul's Choice (Missions schools versus the Koran)<br />14  Alam Gul's Choice Continued (Mullahs versus cricket)<br />15  Afghan Women<br />16  The Story of a Convert<br />17  The Hindu Ascetics<br />18  Sadhus and Faqirs<br />19  My Life as a Mendicant (travels in Pakistan)<br />20  A Frontier Episode (merchant caravans and native remedies)<br />21  Frontier Campaigning (native warriors, treachery)<br />22  Chikki, The Freebooter (tribal information)<br />23  Rough Diamonds (early converts and their troubles)<br />24  Deductions (lessons learned)<br />25  A Forward Policy (value of overt medical missions)	2002-04-03

She has hit an exposed nerve of the corporate system, and illuminated it in a manner that moves tens of thousands.  This book, a very short version of a much longer study, is very cogent and well-documented.  The bottom line is clear: the WTO operates in secrecy, for the convenience of corporations, and is systematically undermining and overturning higher standards of protections and sanctions related to the protection of children, public safety, and the environment.<br />It merits comment that Wallach (and her lesser known co-author, Michelle Sforza) would never have reached as many people with their thinking in the absence of the Open Media Pamphlet Series.  This series is addictive, brilliant, and consistently cuts to the heart of major issues.	2002-03-28

It is essential reading at a time when too many politicians do not yet make the connection between terrorism and what George Soros has called \\"the other axis of evil: poverty, disease, & ignorance.\\"<br />At a time when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is treating anti-globalization activists as just one step under terrorists (in one recent case denying a Canadian activist entry to the U.S. to honor an invitation to speak at a U.S. university), George Soros' is easily the most responsible and the wealthiest voice cautioning all of us that the combined forces of globalization (which reduces citizen sovereignty) and consumerism (which reduces citizen prosperity) could be the death knell of capitalism.<br />I am reminded of how the U.S. Secret Service ran amok against so-called \\"hackers\\" (the best of them trained at MIT and now multi-millionaires) because it did not understand that hackers are like astronauts, pushing the edge of the envelope, and it did not understand that it was the U.S. communications and computing industry that was criminally negligent in offering the consumer and the government a national information infrastructure that was incredibly fragile and full of security holes.  It was industry that failed to exercise due-diligence, and it was hackers that exposes these flaws well in advance of the Y2K panic.  The anti-globalization activists, Lori Wallach among them (and she has clearly influenced Soros in this book) are the 21st Century hackers for world peace and prosperity.<br />Globalization and consumerism threaten billions of Arabs, Chinese, Indians, Muslims, and Russians around the world--and thus they threaten us as well.  Although many brilliant minds foresaw these challenges in the 1970's, among them those speaking to the limits to growth, sustainable growth, and the need for new forms of world governance, it is only after 9-11 that the world appears ready to listen to George Soros and others who understand that we cannot continue to emphasize short term corporate profit over long term citizen survival.<br />His proposals for Special Drawing Rights are helpful, and merit adoption.  It is with a little concern, however, that I see his concession to \\"elite\\" management of these remedial resources.  I lean toward the view that the people are now both informed and connected, and that we must empower down to the neighborhood level if we are to restore civil society around the world (this includes no longer supporting repressive governments for the convenience of our corporations), so there is still a gap between Soros and the natural leaders down in the ranks with the people.<br />Thomas Jefferson said that \\"A Nation's best defense is an educated citizenry.\\"  Justice Brandeis said that the greatest threat to a nation's liberty is \\"an inert citizenship.\\"  George Soros may be said to be the first and foremost educator and leader on the critical matter of whether of whether or not this Nation might yet surmount great challenges of its own making.foresaw these challenges in the 1970's, among them those speaking to the limits to growth, sustainable growth, and the need for new forms of world governance, it is only after 9-11 that the world appears ready to listen to George Soros and others who understand that we cannot continue to emphasize short term corporate profit over long term citizen survival.<br />His proposals for Special Drawing Rights are helpful, and merit adoption.

1624163:US	50761804	RFMS5BR4IH6XS	0195150880	40612399	The Paradox of American Power: Why the World's Only Superpower Can't Go It Alone	Books	4	48	49	N	Y	Brilliant Strategic Insights, Operationally Disappointing	My highest complement for a book used to be how many pens I broke on it. This book leaps into a new category. I actually had to read it three times, short as it is. It is brilliant, with paragraphs of such substance that multiple readings are needed to \\"unzip\\" the implications. This is not an undergraduate text although it could certainly be used as such, to open deep discussions.<br />Among the strategic thoughts that I found most valuable were these: 1) a plenitude of information leads to a poverty of attention; 2) in the absence of time or means to actually review real-world information, politics becomes a contest of competitive credibility (with the Internet changing the rules of the game somewhat); 3) Japan has vital lessons to teach Islamic nations--that one can adapt to the new world while maintaining a unique culture; 4) we are failing to adapt our democratic processes to the challenges of the Earth as well as the opportunities of the Internet.<br />This last merits special attention. I found in this book an intellectual and political argument for restoring democratic meaning to our national policies. From its evaluation of the pernicious effect of special interest groups on foreign policy; to its explanation (\\"When the majority are indifferent, they leave the battlefields of foreign policy to those with special interests.\\"); to its prescription for healthy policies: a combination of national discussion (not just polling), with a proper respect for the opinions of others (e.g. foreigners), the author clearly sets himself apart from those who would devise national policies in secret meetings with a few preferred pals.<br />Throughout the book, but not given any special chapter as I would have preferred, the author is clearly cognizant of the enormous non-traditional challenges facing the community of nations--not just terrorism and crime, but fundamentals such as water and energy shortages, disease, genocide, proliferation, trade injustices, etcetera.<br />Operationally, the book is slightly disappointing. Despite the fact that the author has served as both the Chairman of the National Intelligence Council (and perhaps left the operational bit to his Vice Chairman, Greg Treverton, whose book, \\"Reshaping National Intelligence for an Age of Information\\" I recommend be read in conjunction with this one), and as an Assistant Secretary of Defense, I did not see two things in this book that would have bridged the gap from strategic reflection to operational implementation:<br />1) How must we change the manner in which our nation handles information? What should our national information strategy be, to include not only a vast new program for properly collecting, processing, and understanding foreign language materials that are openly available, for but improving our K-12 and undergraduate education with respect to foreign affairs?<br />2) How must we change the manner in which our nation authorizes, appropriates, allocates, and obligates the taxpayer budget? While noting that we spend 16 times as much on military hard power as we do on diplomatic soft power, the author left this issue largely on a single page.<br />On the topic of values and accountability the author excelled. Although I would disagree that values by themselves are the foundation of national power (\\"knowing\\" the world, in my view, is the other side of the coin of the realm), the author sounds very much like Noam Chomsky with a social make-over--we have to be honest on human rights and other core values, and not act nor permit our corporations to act in ways that are antithetical to our true national commitment to decency and honesty. The section on new forms of accountability and transparency being made possible by changing in information tools and practices are valuable--admitting non-governmental organizations to all bodies; accelerating the release of records into the public domain, and so on.<br />We learn from this book that the author is an avid admirerof The Economist, that he thrives on Op-Ed reading (I have never seen a more comprehensive use of Op-Eds in the notes), and that he is largely accepting of the World Trade Organization and other multi-lateral groups, most of which have not yet accommodated themselves to the new world of citizen-centered policymaking. As good as the notes are, the book would have benefited from a bibliography. The index is acceptable.<br />If we part ways on any one thing, it would be that I am less sanguine about any foreign policy, however much it might use \\"soft power,\\" being successful if it persists with the notion that we can cajole and seduce the world into wanting what we want. We've done that with Hollywood, and McDonalds, and chlorine-based plastics, and it is not working to our advantage. It may be that America must first recognize its own demons, adjust its global goals accordingly, and interact with the world rather than striving for a grander version of the \\"Office of Strategic Influence\\" that recently got laughed into oblivion. We appear to agree that the U.S. Information Agency must be restored as our two-way channel between our people and all others. I would dramatically expand USIA to also provide for a Global Knowledge Foundation and a Digital Marshall Plan on the one hand, and the education of all women on the other (Cf O'Hanlon's \\"A Half-Penny on the Federal Dollar\\").<br />This book opens the great conversation, and in doing so, renders a valuable service. Missing from the public conversation is the Department of State. Both the politically-appointed and the professionally-trained leadership of the diplomatic service appear to have been cowed into silence by a mis-placed coda that confuses abject compliance with loyalty to the larger national interest. If this book can draw State back into the public service, into a public debate on the urgency of protecting and expanding our most important soft power tools, then the author's ultimate impact on the future of American security and prosperity will be inestimable.irer of The Economist, that he thrives on Op-Ed reading (I have never seen a more comprehensive use of Op-Eds in the notes), and that he is largely accepting of the World Trade Organization and other multi-lateral groups, most of which have not yet accommodated themselves to the new world of citizen-centered policymaking.

He goes on to note that a distracted or apathetic or depoliticized public essentially \\"goes along\\" with this, resulting in the loss of community and the rise of consumerism.<br /><br />Chomsky himself, over the course of 167 pages, points out the damages of neo-liberalism (public abdicating power to corporations), not just to underdeveloped nations and their peoples, but to the American people themselves, who are suffering, today, from a fifteen year decline in education, health, and increased inequality between the richest and the poorest.<br /><br />Over the course of several chapters, he discusses various U.S. policies, including the U.S. policy of using \\"security\\" as a pretext for subsidizing the transfer of taxpayer funds to major arms dealers.  The declaration of Cuba as a threat to U.S. national security is one that Mexico could not support--as one of their diplomats explained at the time: \\"if we publicly declare that Cuba is a threat to our security, forty million Mexicans will die laughing.\\"<br /><br />At the end of it all, Chomsky comes down to the simple matter of protecting both civilization and the civilians from their own governments in cahoots with corporations.  His observations on the deaths by disease, starvation, and so on, at the same time that billions are being spent on arms which perpetuate the cycles of violence, are relevant.  So also are his observations on the dramatic increase in both the extent and the damages caused by increasingly unregulated financial markets.  He singles out the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) as an especially pernicious organization whose machinations are invisible to the public and harmful as well.<br /><br />I note with interest a review of this book that seeks to call Chomsky a liar, uninformed, and a laughingstock among \\"serious\\" scholars.  I wish to address that point of view kindly.  I can understand, when scholarship consists largely of going through the motions, reading a limited number of works, and answering by rote with the prescribed thought, how so many of our allegedly educated people in business and government are simply socially tuned in.  I have myself come to the conclusion that Washington runs on 2% of the available international information (and is largely witless about the 75% or so that is in foreign languages), and I also agree with Howard Bloom's observation in [[ASIN:0471419192 Global Brain: The Evolution of Mass Mind from the Big Bang to the 21st Century]], to wit, that half one's brain cells are killed off by the time one is an adult, due to normal biological adjustments to accommodate the prescribed social, cultural, and intellectual parameters that are demanded if one is to \\"get along.\\"  In that light, I view Chomsky as one of our more important vaccinations against premature stupidity among our loosely-educated adult policymakers.  For myself, with considerable reading and a 25-year national security career behind me, I find that while Chomsky is repetitious, he is generally meticulous about foot-noting (something that cannot be said for the lazy authors residing in most think tanks, all of them being paid to think along very specifically prescribed directions).<br /><br />The bottom line for me is clear: citizens must read and think, or perish from the earth as slaves to those who control money.  There is only one thing that matters more than money in this world, and that is the vote.  In a representative democracy, the vote can be bought with ease *until* the moment comes when citizens realize that they can combine the use of public sources to reach conclusions (open source intelligence) with self-organization via the Internet, with civil action (cyber-advocacy, street-advocacy, communication and voting) to *take back the power.*  It is not terrorism that scares the corporate carpetbaggers, it is something much more powerful: thinking citizens willing to spend the time keeping their corporate servants in line.<br /><br />Chomsky has labored for over fifty years to keep that part of our brain alive that our schools, seeking to train obedient factory workers, have worked so hard to kill.  It can be disheartening, to see citizens so freely give up their rights and their powers, but I do believe, that with the [[ASIN:0385720297 The Radical Center: The Future of American Politics]] (Halstead and Lind), [[ASIN:0609808451 The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People Are Changing the World]] (Rya and Anderson) and other books I have reviewed, there is, without question, a tipping point.  The Internet has changed everything-now we need for the people to notice, and act.  Chomsky sheds light in a way that no prostituted scholar or preppy business acolyte will respect-but if the workers wish to begin reading for the future salvation of their children's rights, Chomsky is as good a place as any from which to step off into true democracy.<br /><br />See also:<br />[[ASIN:071452929X The Manufacture Of Evil: Ethics, Evolution, and the Industrial System]]<br />[[ASIN:0676978010 The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism]]<br />[[ASIN:1576754634 Screwed: The Undeclared War Against the Middle Class - And What We Can Do about It (BK Currents (Paperback))]]<br />[[ASIN:0375708219 The Working Poor: Invisible in America]]<br />[[ASIN:0470098287 The Global Class War: How America's Bipartisan Elite Lost Our Future - and What It Will Take to Win It Back]]<br />[[ASIN:0743247469 The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power]]<br />[[ASIN:1576753093 The People's Business: Controlling Corporations and Restoring Democracy]]advocacy, communication and voting) to *take back the power.*  It is not terrorism that scares the corporate carpetbaggers, it is something much more powerful: thinking citizens willing to spend the time keeping their corporate servants in line.

An edited work, it brings together thirty-one authorities and integrates very high-quality editing, photography, and references. It even has an index.<br />As one who regards the collection of imagery as a supporting event, in support of the creation of geospatially-based all-source databases and integrated analysis, I would observe that this book must be regarded as skewed toward policies and capabilities related to commercial imagery collection. It does not address the many vital topics having to do with geospatial databases, the integration of diverse sources of geospatial imagery including Russian military maps and classified digital terrain elevation data, or the integrating of imagery into the all-source analysis process.<br />Commercial imagery is running roughly twelve years behind the early projections on both its adoption and its gross revenue potential. This is in large part because of a consistent prejudice against commercial sourcing by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Defense Mapping Agency (now the National Imagery and Mapping Agency). There are implications to this on-going negativity for the business marketplace--the cost of commercial imagery is still much higher than it need be, simply because the government is as yet unwilling to recognize that it should spend billions on acquiring commercial source imagery, not on building even more useless secret imagery satellites.<br />I recommend this book strongly, both for commanders who would like to exercise some control over national imagery collection policies and investments; and for business leaders who might wish to contemplate how the taxpayer dollar could be better spent in support of generic commercial imagery capabilities whose fruits can be easily shared with the private sector and especially non-governmental organization.<br />The editors and the authors of this book have excelled.

It has a special relevance and importance to citizens in the aftermath of 9-11 because he directly links our corporate criminality (\\"Justice Department estimates the cost of corporate crime as 7 to 25 times as high as street crime\\") to our national policies against human rights (poverty pays, for the corporate class that strives to liquidate Third World nations in their predatory roving of the planet).<br />He pointedly identifies the U.S. arms industry as being among the worst violators, but even more importantly, points out that U.S. policies favoring our arms dealers are opposed by 96% of the U.S. population.  While that number might be high, I believe there is no question but that Washington is being instructed by corporations rather than its citizens on this vital point of policy.  It is time for citizens to take the power back.<br />Chomsky notes that in 1996 the World Health Organization characterized extreme poverty as the world's most ruthless killer and the greatest cause of suffering on earth.  This ties in with the United Nations finding that human suffering is now a legitimate basis for intervention, and with George Soro's observation in The Washington Post of 24 February 2002, that \\"We can't be successful in fighting terrorism, unless we fight that other axis of evil--poverty, disease and ignorance.\\"<br />This little gem of a book also includes well-footnoted observations about how nations seek to carry out trade negotiations in secrecy, in part because they are agreeing to overlook if not actively participate in the looting of poor countries as a condition for prosperous trade among the already developed nations.<br />The book begins and ends with thoughts from Chomsky on the intellectual discipline he founded, the relationship between linguistics, ethics, and action.  He begins with pointed observations on how the most horrible crimes are allowed to go without comment because of *self* censorship, and ends by noting that our citizens do not need to be forbidden to speak of these monstrous deeds that our corporations and government are secretly agreeing to perpetuate, because we have chosen to remain ignorant and silent.<br />U.S. policy today is *not* founded on moral values, and it is *not* representative of the will of the people in so far as it is carried out in secret collaboration with major corporations and in opposition to the minimal mandatory needs of developing nations for water, food, disease, and economic security.<br />This is not about political ideology--Ralph Nader, the ultimate spoiler, has one thing right: the parties are irrelevant, this is now about the people versus the corporations.  Absent a huge popular turn-out *prior* to each election, to make it clear to candidates that they will be held accountable by the people for keeping all trade and other negotiations in the public domain, and for voting on issues mindful of the will of the people rather than their corporate Enron-like paymasters, then we are the ones ultimately responsible for U.S. policy's misdirection.e allowed to go without comment because of *self* censorship, and ends by noting that our citizens do not need to be forbidden to speak of these monstrous deeds that our corporations and government are secretly agreeing to perpetuate, because we have chosen to remain ignorant and silent.<br />U.S. policy today is *not* founded on moral values, and it is *not* representative of the will of the people in so far as it is carried out in secret collaboration with major corporations and in opposition to the minimal mandatory needs of developing nations for water, food, disease, and economic security.<br />This is not about political ideology--Ralph Nader, the ultimate spoiler, has one thing right: the parties are irrelevant, this is now about the people versus the corporations.

The essence of this book that captured my attention was not the impact of the West on the Middle East, but rather the divergent manner in which the West separated religion from business and government, while the Middle East generally did not.  I would point readers toward two other books: Seyyed Vali Reza Nasr, in Islamic Leviathan: Islam and the Making of State Power, has done a fine job of looking at the differing manner in which Malaysia on the one hand, and Pakistan on the other, utilized Islam as a means of legitimizing the state.  In the end, both states had to control their fanatics.<br />The other book, by Howard Bloom, Global Brain: the Evolution of Mass Mind from the Big Bang to the 21st Century, adds value to the very educated efforts of Bernard Lewis in this volume, because it points out that culturate training kills half the brain by the time one is an adult.  This is serious stuff, to wit: if religion and culture can embed in an entire region the makings for a sustained collapse of social and economic measures needed to achieve stability and a minimalist quality of life for the population, is it safe for us to stand back?  Are we to leave them to their own devices?

Certainly we cannot intervene with force nor confront our Islamic brothers, but we must ask ourselves: at what point should we consider substantial investments in both Islamic studies and socio-economic, even ideo-cultural and techno-demographic assistance, to the nations of Islam?<br />Are they our brother, or not?  If we are to respect the universal declaration of human rights, and acknowledge that human suffering is justification for intervention, ideally peaceful intervention, then at what point do we create a national capability for responding to these needs in a manner that is both appropriate to the tangible challenge and consistent with the religious challenge?<br />In my view, this book is most valuable for outlining the depths of the challenge of modernization in a deeply religious region, and rather than ending on a note of \\"on your own heads be it,\\" I wonder if we might not better ask, \\"what do we need to do differently to find a middle road toward modernization, one that can be accepted within the strictures of Islam?\\"peaceful intervention, then at what point do we create a national capability for responding to these needs in a manner that is both appropriate to the tangible challenge and consistent with the religious challenge?<br />In my view, this book is most valuable for outlining the depths of the challenge of modernization in a deeply religious region, and rather than ending on a note of \\"on your own heads be it,\\" I wonder if we might not better ask, \\"what do we need to do differently to find a middle road toward modernization, one that can be accepted within the strictures of Islam?\\"	2002-03-10

It is a very fine first start, and in the aftermath of 9-11, I would suggest to the editors of the series that they dramatically accelerate their other endeavors--at least three more books are needed on Islam in relation to state politics, in relation to political economy, and in relation to neighborhood or ethnic politics; and several others on the relationship of Judaism and Catholicism and Mormonism to state structures.  A special emphasis on religious education and how this affects political perceptions would be helpful.<br />This is a thoughtful book and one that should be part of the broader reading on Islam and global politics.	2002-03-10

These are shortcomings that should be corrected in the next edition.  The book is recommended, and should be standard reading in all conflict courses.	2002-03-10

Terrorism and the New War	Books	4	5	7	N	Y	Conventional Wisdom At Its Very Best--Missing the Edge	This is an extraordinary collection, conventional wisdom at its very best, and would have to be considered a fundamental and useful reference. It does, however, have a weak underbelly, and misses the edge of truly breath-taking genius.<br />I will sum it up concisely: every one of these pieces adheres to the core idea that that what we are doing in general is adequate, we simply need to do it a bit differently. Even authors who have been brilliant, such as Laurie Garrett, who clearly documents in her book Betrayal of Trust: The Collapse of Global Public Health, that the real enemy is bacteria and disease, and the collapse of preventive public health in favor of the more expensive medication and remediation approach, have been \\"subverted\\" as it were, in how they are represented here.<br />We spend half a penny of the taxpayer dollar on foreign aid--we spend 16 cents of the taxpayer dollar on military defense that is useful roughly ten percent of the time. Let me say this in a different way: we spent 32 times more on military weapons and forces useful only 10% of the time, than we do on addressing what George Soros calls \\"the other axis of evil--poverty, disease and ignorance.\\"<br />Several of the articles by folks I admire and respect, are simply off the mark--the article on intelligence, for example, tends to accept the attacks as unpreventable and unpredictable, while failing to note that we have been spending less than 2% of our intelligence budget on terrorism, and that our continuing excesses in technical collection (85% of the intelligence budget) have forced the consistent underfunding of everything else including serious clandestine operations, access to foreign-language open sources, and top-notch analysts who actually have the deep foreign historical, cultural, and language knowledge necessary to make sense of it all. The fact that our intelligence community spends $30 billion a year and more on the 5% of the information it can steal, and less than one half of one percent on foreign language open sources, suggests such a severe imbalance that in a person, this would be called lunacy--instead, we use secrecy to delay a full accounting, and elected politicians who don't know any better tell our citizens that we have the best intelligence we could have had. That is utter nonsense and should be exposed as ignorance at the highest levels about what intelligence can or cannot do.<br />Others refer to Afghanistan as unconquerable, a view that prevailed within the Administration until Russian President Putin persuaded our President that we could take Kabul before the winter set in. The articles on defense assume that we should spend a bit more on confronting rogue nations, but do not really get into the larger trade-offs, between hard power and soft power, between force and assistance, between state on state and people on people accommodations.<br />Nowhere in this book, which is excellent and a must read, do we learn of the daunting water shortages that threaten to further destabilize China, Turkey and Egypt, Russia, and other less developed areas already producing plagues, refugees, and corruption. This book addresses terrorism as an annoyance, as something we can deal with if we simply adjust our corporate organization a tad. It does not go deeply into the much larger issues, and rather than suggesting that such readings are available elsewhere (they are not, at least in a single work), I will end by complementing the editors of this work, and suggesting that they go to work immediately on a sequel--only this time, we need a sequel that highlights both the deep conditions of poverty, disease, conflict and ignorance that characterize the world within which we live, and the iconoclastic authorities-most of them not American and none of them \\"members of the club\\"-whose views will cause discomfort to those who still think they are in charge.half of one percent on foreign language open sources, suggests such a severe imbalance that in a person, this would be called lunacy--instead, we use secrecy to delay a full accounting, and elected politicians who don't know any better tell our citizens that we have the best intelligence we could have had.

Having concluded the book, however, I have to say this is really worth the effort. The author is laying bare the raw threats to the future of the electronic commons. He discusses in detail how very specific government policies to sell and control bandwidth, and very specific corporate legal claims being backed by \\"the people's\\" lawyers within government, are essentially \\"fencing\\" the Internet commons and severely constraining both the rights of the people and the prospects for the future of ideas and innovation.<br />I am not a lawyer and I cannot speak to the points of law, but I am a voter and I can speak to that; what is happening to the Internet through legal machinations that are largely invisible to the people is a travesty, a crime against humanity even if permissible by law, and perhaps grounds for a public uprising demanding the recall of any official that permits and perpetuates the theft of the commons by corporations and their lawyers.<br />In the aftermath of 9-11, when our secret national intelligence and counterintelligence capabilities failed us, there is a need for a restoration of the people's intelligence in the aggregate as our first line of defense against enemies both foreign and domestic. I regard this book as a very serious, thoughtful, and well-intentioned \\"public intelligence estimate\\" and warning, of the harm to our security and prosperity that will ensue from a legal system that is now \\"out of control\\" and not being audited by the common sense of the people.<br />This book makes it clear that if the people are inert and inattentive, they will be enslaved, \\"virtually speaking.\\"  If you thought Manufacturing Consent by Noam Chomsky was scarcy, or Norman Cousins' The Pathology of Power, then this book is for you.<br />Along with Internet standards acceptable to the people, we now appear to need a public advocacy group, funded by the people, to fight these corporate lawyers at every turn, whilst helping our less than stellar government lawyers cope...., we now appear to need a public advocacy group, funded by the people, to fight these corporate lawyers at every turn, whilst helping our less than stellar government lawyers cope....	2002-02-27

His numbers vary from $24 billion (one -time) to preserve 800,000 square kilometers already under protection, to $28 billion to preserve a (different?) representative sample. The bottom line: for a one-time $100 billion investment, 25% of what the US spends on its military *every* year, we could, at our own expense, save the world.<br />Subsidies for Unsound Acts Against Nature: $2 trillion per year and rising ($2000 per American alone--this refers to energy, water, deforestation, and agricultural subsidies that encourage and perpetuate unsound acts against nature as well as unneeded exploitation--one example: $20 billion a year in subsidies for fishing--this is the difference between the actual value of $100 billion and the lower subsidized revenues of $80 billion a year).<br />Wilson's book, in combination with those by Brian Czech and L. O. Stromberg, is in my view a capstone endeavor that moves the environment to the forefront of any intelligent person's agenda. As he concludes, we have entered the century of the environment--we must save it or lose it.have entered the century of the environment--we must save it or lose it.	2002-02-27

If lawyers are starting to write popular reformist tracts against unfettered capitalism and the export of the flawed U.S. approach to capitalism, something very interesting must be happening in the dark recesses of our national mind.<br />This is not an easy book to read but on balance it is a very important book and one that would appear to be essential to any discussion of how we might reform the relationship between the federal government with its 1950's concepts and regulations, corporations with their secularist and short-term profit and liquidation notions, and the people who ultimately are both the foundation and the beneficiaries (or losers) within the political economy of the nation and the world.<br />The author lays out, from a business law perspective, all the legal and financial reasons why our corporate practices today sacrifice the long-term perspective and the creation of aggregate value, in favor of short-term profit-taking.  He makes a number of suggestions for improvement.<br />Toward the end of the book, citing Lipsett but adding his own observations, he digs deep and summarizes our corporate culture as one that threatens traditional forms of community and morality (Lipsett), while increasingly dominating--undermining--foreign governments and cultures.  Elsewhere in the book the stunning failure of our form of capitalism in selected countries is explored.<br />Although there are adequate notes, there is no bibliography and the index is extraordinarily mediocre--not containing, for example, the references in the book to oversight, political, or regulation.  One star is deducted for this failure by the publisher to treat the book's content seriously.	2002-02-27

It is a reasoned attack on both government regulation and imposed technical standards.  To the extent that it seems to deny the value of any standards, any oversight, any structure, it is unreasonable.<br />Indeed, while I whole-heartedly agreed that government regulation has gotten completely out of control, I am much more concerned about corporate corruption (Enron simply being the latest case), and so I would say this book is valuable and worth reading but it is missing the bridge chapter to \\"what next?\\"<br />However, I like the book and I recommend it.  Its value was driven home to me by an unrelated anecdote, the tales from South Korea of my data recovery expert.  Bottom line: they are so far ahead of the United States, with 92% wireless penetration in urban areas, and free-flowing video and television on every hand-held communications-computing device, in part because they have not screwed up the bandwidth allocations and reservations as badly as we have.  I was especially inspired by the thought that we should no longer reserve entire swaths of bandwidth for the exclusive use of the military or other government functions--let them learn how to operate in the real world rather than their artificial construct of reserved preference.<br />The book is well footnoted but the index is marginal--largely an index of names rather than ideas.	2002-02-27

Unfettered capitalism and corporate consumerism is killing us, and is part of the problem between Western secularism and Islamic fundamentalism--we don't have a model for sustainable faith-based prosperity they can buy into (I am mindful of Bernard Lewis's What Went Wrong thesis).<br />Most recently, in The Washington Post of 24 February 2002, George Soros is quoted as saying, \\"We can't be successful in fighting terrorism unless we fight that other axis of evil--poverty, disease and ignorance.\\"  Right on.  Both The Future of Life and The Future of Ideas (see my reviews of those titles), and many other books now coming together in a critical mass, support basic propositions about the failure of politics, the erosion of moral contexts, and the dangers of capitalism upon public health, the environment, and the social fabric.<br />I would normally have rated this book with 4 stars for its lack of reference to others, but in light of the importance of the argument that George Soros makes, and the value of his own unique experiences bridging the worlds of poverty and wealth, American and Eastern European challenges and biases, I have to give this a 5--and wait to see our academic economists do better.	2002-02-27

Even the index is surprising in both its presence and its quality.<br />A few little gems jump out at me from all the detail:<br />1) Corporate corruption appears to not only be routine, but massive among more industries and companies than we might believe.<br />2) The government does actually try to regulate and prosecute, but this is both very expensive, and appears to result in the public *not* becoming conscious of the mis-deeds--no massive boycott, for example, seems to result.<br />3) The executives that conspire to cheat the public are remarkably ignorant.  I was stunned to read how one of the principals in this story fell victim to what I thought was a really well-known Nigerian scam for defrauding numerous Americans of tens of thousands of dollars each, claiming that it will \\"release\\" millions in hijacked funds from the national bank.<br />4) The government often mistreats its own people.  I was especially troubled, having seen employee abuse at other national agencies, when the book related how a senior FBI agent was not allowed to transfer--and save his mental health--because of his boss's selfish interests.<br />5) Lastly, I was left with the impression that there is an elaborate dance that goes on between the very expensive top law firms that protect corporate criminals, and the government.  While the government seems to have worked hard on this one, the general impression that is left is that the normal drill when the public has been defrauded of hundreds of millions of dollars, is for the culprits to plead \\"no contest\\" and agree not to do it again--in return for token fines and guaranteed immunity.<br />At the end of the book I was left feeling dismayed at the depth and breadth of corporate corruption, at the general inadequacy of government in keeping the private sector economy honest, and at the lack of alternative public advocacy devices for truly focusing public spotlights such that fair pricing and fair practices are widely understood and enforced by customers, not just under-funded over-worked oversight bodies.<br />Although the book is very very long at 629 pages, I would have liked to see an author's epilogue titled \\"What Is To Be Done?\\"  The author of this book can rightly claim to be among a select few intimately familiar with this problem in a manner no book by itself could communicate, and so a public policy analysis, some sort of prescription, would have been a valuable postscript to this excellent, really superior, investigative report.truly focusing public spotlights such that fair pricing and fair practices are widely understood and enforced by customers, not just under-funded over-worked oversight bodies.<br />Although the book is very very long at 629 pages, I would have liked to see an author's epilogue titled \\"What Is To Be Done?\\"  The author of this book can rightly claim to be among a select few intimately familiar with this problem in a manner no book by itself could communicate, and so a public policy analysis, some sort of prescription, would have been a valuable postscript to this excellent, really superior, investigative report.	2002-02-27

I have resurrected it in relation to my reading on federal budgeting and the dangers of the deficit spending now in vogue in Washington (2002).<br />This is the best book I have read on the strategic aspects of the federal budget--needed reforms, key issues in allocation policy, using the budget to stabilize the economy.<br />Where the book excels is in its analysis of how the federal budget should be used to steer private sector outlays--as Osborne and Gaebler suggested, we must steer rather than row--guide the private sector rather than use taxpayer dollars for direct products and services.<br />In his discussion of priorities, the author focuses heavily on the lack of investment in education and the resurrection of education both public and private.  As we enter the 21st Century largely ignorant as a Nation (of external realities, not at individuals), I cannot help but think that the time has come for the public to take charge of &quot;political economy,&quot; and begin actively setting forth its priorities.  Just this week, in The Washington Post of 27 February 2002, David Ignatius suggests that Washington has turned its back on the Nation.  Seems to me that's pretty dangerous, but if the Nation allows itself to be ignored by Washington, then we have the government--and the federal spending priorities--we deserve.	2002-02-27

This book should not be selling for more than $45.95.  It cost a penny a page to produce and they have not spend a dime on marketing, so go figure....<br /><br />It is always a shame when a really great book is badly marketed and consequently does not reach as many professionals and citizens as it should.  This is such a book.<br /><br />What the blurbs don't tell you, such as they are, is that the author was one of the true pioneers in the world of open source intelligence (creating useful actionable intelligence using only legal and ethical sources and methods).  His brilliant efforts in the early 1990's were easily a decade ahead of where the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) is today--using a wide variety of Latin American newspapers and lots of brainpower, he was able to create tactical intelligence that contributed significantly to the success of operational missions by the U.S. Southern Command and the Drug Enforcement Administration, leading the destruction of cocaine laboratories, the interdiction of aircraft, and the arrest of key people in the transnational criminal structure.<br /><br />This book is an essential reference for any agency or command library concerned with asymmetric warfare, unconventional threats, and non-traditional methods of providing intelligence support to those responsible for dealing with anything other than traditional war.  The sources and methods that the author discusses are especially pertinent to the study of terrorism, proliferation, transnational crime, cross-national toxic dumping, and other sub-state and non-state threats.	2002-02-13

Even for those who have read other campaign trail books, this book offers a combination of unvarnished sad truths (Presidential candidates speaking to empty rooms, waving to empty runways, all to create the &quot;virtual reality&quot; of having something to say and someone to listen to it) together with a sense of lost opportunities.<br />As campaign reform looms on the horizon, I found this book especially appealing for its detailed look at &quot;the people's candidate,&quot; Morry Taylor, the &quot;Grizz&quot;--a person I never heard of during the actual campaign.  The book really drives home how flawed our existing electoral system is today, as well as all the campaign contributions, &quot;rented strangers,&quot; and other anomalies that make good Presidents an accident rather than a choice.<br />I read the book shortly after reading Ted Halstead and Michael Lind, &quot;The Radical Center&quot;, on citizen-centered politics of choice, and there could be no better book for appreciating just how radical Halstead and Michael are, than this book.	2002-02-13

There is no other person who spent over 17 years focused on intelligence about Viet-Nam, and very rare is the person who can say they have spent over 50 years in continuous intelligence appointments, 20 of them after retirement.  It is a personal story that I consider to be balanced, deep, and trustworthy.  While it has gaps, these are easily addressed by reading, at least on the intelligence side, such books at Bruce Jones' \\"War Without Windows\\", Orrin DeForest's \\"SLOW BURN\\", Douglas Valentine's \\"The Phoenix Program\\", Jim Witz's \\"The Tet Offensive: Intelligence Failure in War\\", Tom Mangold & John Penycate's \\"The Tunnels of Chu Chi\\", and the Viet-Nam portions of Jim Bamford's \\"Body of Secrets.\\"<br />I mention these books in part to emphasize that George Allen has produced a book that will stand the test of time and should be regarded as an exceptional historical, policy, intelligence, and public administration case study.  It is truly humbling and sobering to read such a calm, complete, and broad treatment of the history of both American intelligence in relation to Viet-Nam, and the consistent manner in which policy-makers refused to listen to accurate intelligence estimates, while their Generals and Ambassadors steadfastly \\"cooked the books.\\"  The manipulation of truth from the Saigon end, and the refusal to listen to truth on the Washington end, resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, Vietnamese, Loatian, Cambodian, and American, as well as allied nationalities.<br />This book is gripping.  I could not put it down.  It is one of the most serious personal accounts I have ever read where the vivid realities of intelligence, ignorance, and policy come together.  The author excells at painting the details in context, and his many specific portraits of key individuals and situations are superior.<br />This book is relevant to today's war on terrorism.

The value of an index does not appear to be appreciated by those who publish these taxpayer-funded collections, and I continually lament the myopia that prevents the publishers from making such a useful collection even more valuable by taking the time to create an aggregate index.<br />I hope this is the last of the theoretical volumes. While it has some operationally-oriented contributions, one of the best being by Phil Williams on Transnational Criminal Networks, it is too theoretical overall, and much too US-centric. There are French, Nordic, and Singaporean, and Australian authorities, to mention just a few, that the editors must now make an effort to bring into a larger dialog. At the same time, it is now vital that we get on with much deeper study and discussion of the actual networks and specific practices--we must do much more in documenting the \\"order of battle\\" for netwar. One article, for example, lists a sample of Arabic web sites but goes no further--I would have liked to see some discussion of the 396 terrorist, insurgent, and opposition web sites, including the \\"Muslim Hackers\\" who asked for a clerical ruling on whether the Koran encouraged hacking as a means of war (it does, according to the same people that support bin Laden's views), and I would like to see much more integration with the investigative efforts of both law enforcement authorities and private sector security and fraud authorities. I am especially disappointed that all of these authorities appear to be largely oblivious to or at least not making substantive reference to the ten-year-long track record compiled by Winn Schartau and his InfoWarCon speakers and web site, an event that is arguably the only serious international venue for addressing these issues in a serious manner, with a commensurately valuable web site.<br />There is one other major gap in this book's approach to networks and netwars. With the exception of Paul de Armond's article on netwar against the World Trade Organization, there are no references to intelligence failures and intelligence requirements vis a vis this threat domain. The editors and authors need to establish intelligence concepts and doctrine for this threat.<br />This book represents the very best that DoD money can fund in isolation, and therein lies the problem. What few taxpayer funds are spent by DoD in addressing such important matters and not being spent wisely because there is no serious commitment to creating a data warehouse of all studies related to networks and netwar; there is no commitment to accessing and understanding the considerable lessons learned outside the somewhat nepotistic DoD network of standard experts; and there seems to be no commitment to creating a center of excellence that can nurture *public* understanding and new *public* standards for protecting both our critical infrastructure and the vital data that circulates on that infrastructure.<br />The editors and the authors are of the very highest caliber. They are also operating in a vacuum. I for one would like to see them get serious funding, to include the establishment of a public international center of excellence on netwar, with branch offices in London and Singapore.<br />We are losing the Third World War, between governments and gangs, in part because the military-industrial-congressional complex continues to define security in terms of very expensive mobility and weapons systems--communications, computing, and intelligence are an afterthought, and the authors are quite correct in the aggregate when they suggest that we are our own worst enemy in failing to redirect substantial funds toward cyber-war and cyber-peace. The editors and authors could be very helpful if they address in their next volume, both an intelligence order of battle against which capabilities might be created; and specific proposals for establishing international, national, and state & local capabilities. What should they be, what will it cost, who should manage them? \\"It ain't real until its the budget.\\" The authors are gracious to a fault, but it is clear from their work in the aggregate that they share a concern with our lack of preparedness for a 9-11 level of effort against our financial, transportation, power, and communications networks. They merit the greatest of respect and a full hearing from the public.g, and intelligence are an afterthought, and the authors are quite correct in the aggregate when they suggest that we are our own worst enemy in failing to redirect substantial funds toward cyber-war and cyber-peace.

The author, working mostly in the Near East (NE) Division of the Directorate of Operations, and then in the Counter-Terrorism Center when it was just starting out, has an extremely important story to tell and every American needs to pay attention. Why? Because his account of how we have no assets useful against terrorism is in contradiction to what the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) told the President and his top advisors at Camp David on Saturday 15 September. According to the Washington Post of 31 January 2002, page A13, on the 15th the DCI laid out an ambitious \\"Worldwide Attack Matrix\\" and told the President that the United States had a \\"large asset base\\" from its years of working the terrorism target. One of these two men one is closer to the truth than the other.  In my judgement, I believe Baer has three-quarters of the weight on his side.  This discrepancy warrants investigation, for no President can be successful if he does not have accurate information about our actual capabilities.<br />There are four other stories within this excellent book, all dealing with infirm bureaucracies. At one level, the author's accounting of how the Directorate of Operations has declined under the last three leaders (as the author describes them: a recalled retiree, an analyst, and a \\"political\\" (pal)) is both clearly based on ground truth, and extremely troubling. The extraordinary detail on the decline and fall of the clandestine service is one that every voter should be thinking about, because it was the failure of the clandestine service, as well as the counterintelligence service (the Federal Bureau of Investigation) that allowed 9-11 to happen...at the same time, we must note that it was a policy failure to not have investigated similar incompetencies when a military barracks in Saudi Arabia, two Embassies, and a naval destroyer were attacked, and it was clearly known in open sources that bin Laden had declared war on America and had within America numerous Islamic clerics calling for the murder of Americans--all as documented in an excellent Public Broadcast Service documentary.<br />At a technical level, the author provides some really excellent real-world, real-war annecdotes about situations where clandestine reporting from trusted operations officers has not been accepted by their own superiors in the absence of technical confirmation (imagery or signals).  As he says, in the middle of a major artillery battle and break-out of insurgent elements, screaming over the secure phone, \\"its the middle of night here\\".  We've all known since at least the 1970's that the technical intelligence side of things has been crushing human sensibility, both operational and analytical, but this book really brings the problems into the public eye in a compelling and useful manner.<br />At another level, the author uses his own investigation for murder (he was completely cleared, it was a set-up) by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and at one point by the Secret Service, to shed new light on the complete break-down of internal security processes within the CIA. At its lowest point, he is pressured by DO management with a psychological evaluation to determine his fitness for duty--shades of Stalinism! I know this technique, of declaring officers unfit for duty based on psychological hatchet jobs, to be a common practice over the past two decades, and when Britt Snider was appointed Inspector General at CIA, I told him this was a \\"smoking gun\\" in the 7th floor closet. That it remains a practice today is grounds for evaluating the entire management culture at CIA.<br />There is a fourth story in the book, a truly interesting account of how big energy companies, their \\"ambassadors\\" serving as Presidential appointees within the National Security Council, and corrupt foreign elements, all come together.  In this the spies are not central, so I leave it as a sidenote.<br />In my capacity as a reviewer of most intelligence-related books within these offerings, I want to make it clear to potential buyers of this book that the author is not alone. His is the best, most detailed, and most current accounting of the decrepit dysfunctionality of the clandestine service (as I put it in my own book's second edition), but I would refer the reader to two other books in particular: David Corn's \\"Blond Ghost: Ted Shackley and the CIA's Crusades\\"--its most memorable quote, on covert action in Laos, being \\"We spent a lot of money and got a lot of people killed, and we didn't get much for it.\\"--and Evan Thomas' \\"The Very Best Men--Four Who Dared: The Early Years of the CIA\\"--its best quote: \\"Patriotic, decent, well-meaning, they were also uniquely unsuited to the grubby, necessarily devious world of intelligence.\\" There are many other books, including twelve (12!) focused on reform and recommended by the Council on Intelligence.<br />The author is a brave man--he was brave on the fields of war and clandestinity, and he is braver still for having brought this story to the public.

The more I read the less I know, and the more I appreciate the absolute essentiality of getting all points of view face to face before a citizen's wisdom council.

I am updating this review to note that my basic points were recently validated when the Danish committee for scientific integrity slammed this book for dishonesty.  It is never-the-less a tour de force for Lomborg and his students (the latter appear to have done most of the tedious data gathering and basic analysis)--at its best, it provides a severe spanking for environmentalists who get careless with their data and their assertions. At its worst, it provides a semblance of cover for corporate carpet-baggers intent on liquidating what any child can understand is a closed system with limits.<br /><br />At root, Lomborg is a disciple and blind follower of the paradigm best articulated by Julian Simon, who has himself been discredited here and there by well-educated environmentalists. Lomborg's professionalism and devotion to data are not questioned here--one either shares his paradigm or one does not. It merits comment that there are now several web sites, one of them in Denmark founded by his own colleagues, dedicated to exposing the flawed assumptions and analysis that went into this corporately attractive politically-biased treatise.<br /><br />This is indeed a brilliant and powerful book, just as a nuclear explosion is brilliant and powerful--and very destructive. However well-intentioned--and I do not question, even applaud, the author's intentions, what we have here is a rather scary combination of fragmentary analysis in depth, combined with a strong belief system that accepts as a starting point the concept that the earth is infinitely renewable and no matter what happens, that is a \\"natural\\" turn of events.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Just as 9-11 was necessary before a paradigm shift in national security concepts could be achieved (now we know that individuals without weapons can turn our own civilian instruments against us in really damaging ways), I fear that a major environmental--perhaps even a terrorist-environmental event, such as exploding train cars full of chlorine, will be required before citizens as a whole experience the paradigm shift and understand that a) we live in the closed system and b) the burden of proof must be precautionary rather than exploitative.<br /><br />We are soiling our seed corn and the earth it grows in. Lomborg would have us believe that what we grow within such a paradigm is natural and good--no doubt he has an explanation for the dramatic drops in sperm counts around the world, the troubling increases in asthma across Canada and the East Coast and other nations reeling from antiquated coal-fueled power plants (most of them in the mid-West), and other documented demographic costs to uncontrolled liquidation of the earth.<br /><br />I will end with one very significant concession to Lomborg and his adherents: this book, compelling in isolation, makes it clear that nothing less than the full application of the distributed intelligence of the citizenry on a 24/7 basis, will be sufficient to monitor, evaluate, and comprehend the breadth and depth of our attacks on the earth. It is now clear to me that until we have a globalweb-based community of citizen observers able to enter data at the neighborhood level, using peer-to-peer computing power to analyze distributed data, that the citizens will continue to be at the mercy of corporate computers and political manipulation.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book, and Czech's book, as companion volumes framing a much higher level of data and debate that is now beginning.level, using peer-to-peer computing power to analyze distributed data, that the citizens will continue to be at the mercy of corporate computers and political manipulation.

In some ways this is the gold-collared knowledge worker counterpart book to Ted Halstead and Michael Lind's The Radical Center: The Future of American Politics (citizen-centered).  Those who liked The Cultural Creatives or IMAGINE: What America Could be in the 21st Century, can adopt this book as their user's guide for demanding change in information technology.<br />I recommend it because it is full of common sense, is the first really helpful \\"requirements document\\" for a clean sheet new approach to software and hardware and ergonomics ($3000 word for user friendly).  The bad news is that nobody is listening.  We are ten years away from this being a reality because the legacy providers (big hardware, one certain software company) are not about to retool their empires for the sake of delivering better value.<br />It is more than a little amusing to me to have this book endorsed by the CEO of the one company that prides itself on producing software with mutated migrated Application Program Interfaces that are used to extort tribute from third party software developers, where no sane consumer will invest in his products until they've had three years to \\"mature\\" in the marketplace.<br />The opening listings of the \\"standard faults\\" in today's \\"consumer electronics\\" is alone worth the price of the book--unintegrated systems fault; manual labor fault; human servitude fault; crash fault; excessive learning fault; feature overload fault; fake intelligence fault; waiting fault; ratchet fault...<br />The book ends on a low note and high note.  The low note is a description of Oxygen, a $50M project seeded by DARPA and including several major company partners such as HP and Nokia.  This project has some excellent ideas, including a new focus on an architecture for nomadic computing with three aspects: a Handy 21 (hand-held), Enviro 21 (intermediate personal computers at home, office, and in car), and N21 Network (Intentional Naming System, every computer and peripheral everywhere is in the public domain and broadcasting its location and status, use on the fly).  Good stuff.  What he doesn't mention is that the U.S. Government is spending over half a billion dollars on completely uncoordinated desktop analysis toolkits, and there is probably 2-3X that much being spent in the private sector.  He does note that we will never get our act together if we continue to develop hardware and software in a very fragmented and hardware-based manner.<br />On the high note, the author has clearly thought about the consequences of having an information revolution here in the USA, creating information royalty, while leaving the rest of the world dispossessed, in poverty, and unconnected.  He has a very practical appreciation for the fact that the USA must fund two distinct foreign assistance programs--a Digital Marshall Plan (my phrase) to jack in the entire world; and a commensurate literacy, birth control, disease control, and famine control program to stabilize populations to the point where they can be productive within the global grid.<br />I read this book on the airplane coming back from the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas (Federal Emerging Technologies Conference sub-set), and I was really struck by the contradiction between the vast fragmentation spread out over Las Vegas (the man who has everything also has to carry it) and the elegant simplicity of this book's vision--one hand-held able to be any of 100+ devices.  \\"It's the software, simpleton....\\"<br />What saddens me, especially when considering the billions of dollars being given away by our richest software developer, someone who seems to favor gestures on the margin instead of quality control and open source at the core, is that we knew all this in the mid-1980's.  The eighteen distinct functionalities needed for a desktop analysts' workstation were identified by CIA in 1986--everything from data ingestion and conversion softwares to modeling and simulation and pattern detectionand of course desktop publishing.  The year after the CIA prototypes were working so successfully on UNIX (Sun), CIA decided that the PS2 would be the standard \\"dumb\\" terminal, and all UNIX efforts were ordered to shut-down.  The big organizations, the ones with the power to make the revolution, chose control and dumb terminals over freedom and smart software.

The author excells at drawing out the relativism of intelligence as well as the changes--more concerned today with the security of others than of one's own state; and more committed (in the best of the services) to forecasting the future rather than manipulating the present.<br />The essay on intelligence and diplomacy is absolutely vital, beginning with the observation that we are now spending more on intelligence than diplomacy (in the US, 10 times more on secret intelligence than on normal diplomacy).  The author concludes, without belaboring the paucity of diplomatic resources, that the UK model of intelligence--the allied model in some respects--has done well in not abusing its special knowledge to influence policy.<br />Discussing intelligence and the Revolution in Military Affairs, there are several trenchant observations, among the most helpful being that the current RMA is too obsessed with technology applicable to &quot;things&quot; (both as tools and as targets) while completely over-looking a revolution in technology applicable to text and to thinking.  This is down-right brilliant and a long over-due issue for policy consideration.  Interestingly, the National Imagery and Mapping Commission Report concluded in December 2000 that the USA has spent billions on collection technology during the Cold War, without a commensurate expenditure in what the Americans call TPED: tasking, processing, exploitation, and dissemination.  If the Americans are to make a worthy contribution to allied intelligence in the 21st Century, one might hope they heed the author's observation and invest in global multi-lingual open source data ingestion, and multi-media analytic tools for &quot;making sense&quot; of the vast flows of readily available information--most of it not yet digital.<br />The middle section of the book covers many critical issues including the continued separation of security and and foreign intelligence, a separation that allowed 9-11 to occur in the USA.  Among the really brilliant gems in this section: &quot;The best test of an intelligence system is the all-source memory it builds up...&quot;  The reader can judge for themselves whether any intelligence organization can pass this rather plain-spoken test.  The author is in the vanguard in terms of tapping into external expertise, shifting priorities from collection to analysis, and substantially improving inter-departmental coordination of assessments at the action officer level.  Two reviews of Norwegian and New Zealand contributions and issues offer a helpful appreciation of where further gains might be made.  Over the course of several chapters the author addresses the lessons of history and answers the question &quot;did intelligence make a difference?&quot;  All of this material is quite stimulating, coming as it does from a man who was at the very heart of joint intelligence assessments, and his findings, some negative, must bear on how we adjust to the future.<br />Good as the first parts are, the best is held for last.  Part IV, titled &quot;Intelligence and a Better World&quot;, contains two chapters--one on intelligence and international ethics, the other an afterword on the attacks of 9-11.  These two are my most heavily marked sections, and in my own mind represent some of the author's freshest and most valuable thinking.  The author is fully aware of the importance of shifting attention to the sub-state and non-state actors, and also of the need to begin sharing all-source intelligence in a multi-lateral fashion, in effect (citing two former US intelligence leaders) treating intelligence as an international good.  He carefully explores the ethical and opportunity cost dimensions of covert intelligence activities against other sovereign state (certainly excluding rogue states), concluding that on balance open sources and good analysis are a better bet when combined with the increased trust that could result from eschewing intrusive covert penetrations that are not really necessary in relation to government secrets (terrorists of course being fair game for all available covert methods).<br />Addressing 9-11, the author has many helpful things to say, among them the observation that &quot;The problems of counter-terrorist intelligence cannot be solved just by throwing money at them.&quot;  He ends with the compelling observation that the United States of America is incapable of protecting itself from international threats, even with its vast resources, unless it first devises new means of sharing intelligence and cooperating more closely with all other governments.  I agree with him.  Both &quot;hard targets&quot; and &quot;global coverage&quot; are beyond the ken of any single nation, and the &quot;new craft of intelligence&quot; that I and others are devising seeks to harness the full distributed intelligence of the Whole Earth--not just the intelligence of governments, but of legal non-state actors and citizens--the intelligence &quot;minutemen&quot; of the future.  There are perhaps twelve really high-caliber commentators on intelligence in the English-speaking language, but this author, Michael Herman, continues to be the soft-spoken master of the domain--offering the best combination of erudition, experience, and ethical grounding--and we are lucky to have this book from him to help us all as we seek to revitalize intelligence in the aftermath of 9-11.<br />This book is especially recommended as a reader for university classes, and one hopes that gradually it will be understood within academia and business that intelligence is not some arcane secret priesthood, but rather the essence of governance in the age of information.

He puts forward a theory on the diffusion of insecurity, how this leads to arrested development, and why, for very practical reasons, the more developed nations must devise new means of structured and focused intervention leading to the creation of peace.<br />The author does not advocate intervention willy-nilly--if anything, he joins Jessica Matthews, William Shawcross, and others in pointing out that incompetent interventions actually make matters worse--external actors and external resources have a way of prolonging internal conflicts rather than resolving them.  Military forces, the ones most often used, are also the least effective--new combinations and new capabilities are needed.<br />He is especially effective at criticizing, in a very gracious but pointed manner, the institutionalist and realist schools that have never moved beyond sovereign states, political boundaries, conventional militaries, and a Euro-centric perspective.<br />He is much better than Fukiyama at dealing with reality, and the equal of Huntington in considering cultural clashes rooted in social identities and real-world resource difficulties.<br />I found two major observations in this work that merit broad repetition:<br />First, and the author gives due credit to the path-finding work of Ted Gurr and the Minorities at Risk project, there is an established pattern, world-wide, in which violent political action is always preceded by a period of nonviolent activity that was either ignored or repressed.<br />Second, once violence has been inculcated into a social group as the normative condition, there is a distinct loss of capacity to engage in meaningful exchanges, negotiation, etcetera.  Outcomes become irrelevant, and as Ralph Peters has pointed out so often, war and conflict become the raison d'être rather than any kind of rational means to a political end.<br />Throughout the book, and worthy of a focused chapter or future article, there are comments on data, information, and analysis that are extremely valuable when embraced and integrated.  Apart from numerous observations on the difficulty of obtaining reliable data on sub-state violence when the state is the normal analytical unit and also the repressor of information; the author has insights into how models drive what data is visible, collected, or accepted; and how the social units in conflict themselves become filters, channels, or barriers to communication.<br />The concluding recommendations for systemic policy call for a global arms moratorium; a migration from regional collective security arrangements to global normative security arrangements including an international stand-alone range of capabilities for monitoring, facilitating, and imposing non-violent conflict resolution; a general proscription of force by any nation or social group; regional associations or what he called a &quot;complex federalism&quot;; a decentralization of systemic authority, which really means a reduction of U.S. impositions in favor of localized influences with greater legitimacy; and a criminalization of individual acts of violence within war--the ending of war (or state sovereign direction) as an excuse for individual acts of violence and depravity.<br />If I had one criticism of the book--and in no way does this undermine the brilliance and utility of the work itself--it is that it does not include, either as a preface or as an appendix, a summary of the actual &quot;state of the world&quot; such as the author has helped create in the World Conflict and Human Rights Map project out of Leiden University (PIOOM).  A description and enumeration of the 29 complex emergencies, 67 countries with hundreds of thousands of refugees, 59 countries with plagues and epidemics, 27 countries with massive famine--as well as the torture, child soldiers, and other distinct manifestations of the sub-state instability the author studies so well--would have helped the non-academic and policy readers to better grasp the urgent vitality of this seminal work.<br />The author and his insights deserve the very highest levels of attention, for all that he has done here is call into question the out-dated political science concepts and the policies--including the defense acquisition and force structure policies--of every so-called modern nation.  The globe is burning, every President and Prime Minister is fiddling, and the author documents very clearly that this fire is headed straight for our homeland.Human Rights Map project out of Leiden University (PIOOM).

If this is the best our Department of State can do--if this bland account of endless repetitive meetings and meaningless demarches is the best that America can do in addressing the deep challenges of Sudan--then we need a whole new State Department.<br />It struck me immediately, as I worked through the book, that it is the diary of someone who means well, but has only his personal experience from which to judge the situation. Not only are there no references to learned studies, but the short-sighted thesis of the author is summed up on page 136: \\"The cumulative combination of factors putting Sudan in such a bad light (with the U.S. Government) began with the military takeover in July 1989.\\" When one contrasts this statement with the rich 200-year survey provided by \\"White Nile, Black Blood\\", one can only feel a deep sadness for the lower depths of our foreign service.<br />Early on in the book the author-ambassador confesses to not knowing Arabic and to having had six months training in Arabic before reporting. This demonstrates two things clearly: first, that the Department of State is incompetent in Arabic affairs if it does not have legions of qualified officers fluent in Arabic from whom it can select an Ambassador and second, that obviously the language is not considered critical to the job if six months will suffice--just enough to get to the toilet, not enough to accept directions across town.<br />This book is a travel diary. I have annotated page 148 with the note: \\"substitutes travel for thinking.\\" There is no analysis in this book, no grasp of history, no real grip on the regional realities (other than a passing reference to the fact that water is going to be a cause of war in the future--something well covered in Marq de Villiers \\"WATER: The Fate of Our Most Precious Resource\\". Neither de Villiers nor Michael Klare's \\"RESOURCE WARS: The New Landscape of Global Conflict\\" are cited by this book.)<br />At the very end there was a tiny glimmer of hope as the author began a chapter on working with the United Nations, and made it clear that the UN practice of allowing each of its agencies to appoint independent ambassadors to the same country, rather than subordinating all UN agencies to a single UN ambassador, was a big part of their problem. After three paragraphs, it became clear there was nothing else to be had from this chapter. I have the note \\"This is not a serious book.\\"<br />At one point in the book the author observes that neither Congress nor the U.S. public would allow the Administration to be more pro-active in Sudan. It immediately occurred to me that if this is true, then the Department of State has failed miserably, ignominiously, at informing the U.S. public of the true situation in Sudan, for any informed citizen would be sure to support extremely aggressive action against the (northern) Sudan despots and supporters of terrorism and genocide.: The Fate of Our Most Precious Resource\\".

His evaluation of the Sudan situation, and his detailed review of the impact on Sudanese reliant on the low-cost medicines from the factory bombed into oblivion on the now-disputed suggestion of the CIA, provides a perspective that needs more respect.<br />His lengthy discussion of the contradictory record of the United States on human rights--in favor when it does not interfere with business, actively obstructionist when it takes place in Saudi Arabia or Indonesia where financial equities (generally mining and energy company equities) are great, is disturbingly sensible.<br />I will always read Chomsky, for he provides a leavening of forthright candor and intellectual honesty that is too often absent from mainstream discussions.  Indeed, as I was reading the bit on Sudan, it occured to me that we are long over-due for the next revolution in learned discourse--the digitization of all such books so that a reader can, to take Sudan as an example, see on their screen a &quot;map&quot; of Sudanese issues, and then select from across a range of competing viewpoints on any issue.  One has to seek out Chomsky now--in the future it may be salutory to find him automatically served up as a side dish whenever the pundits wax too pontifical.	2001-12-10

It is unnerving in its calm and reasoned detailing of how genocide can take place, its survey of the millions upon millions of post-WWII holocausts taking place today--as the media and policymakers ignore these realities.<br />Citizen-voters, in my view, will benefit considerably from this book because it will help them understand that there are three worlds out there, and we as a nation are not dealing well with two of the three--the most dangerous two. There is the world of well-fed diplomats and businessman, traveling and negotiating in their warm safe buffer zones. There is the real world as experienced by normal people, many of whom are oppressed and poor and feel helpless in the face of dictatorial regimes and local warlords who may do as they wish absent the rule of law. And then there is the world of genocide, an underworld of such horrific pervasive violence and inhuman brutality that one can only wonder if we are all guilty of mass insanity for turning our backs on this murder of millions.<br />The author is a world-class scholar and ardent champion for informing the public and achieving informed policy in this vital area, and I can only hope that serious people put some money behind his thinking.	2001-12-10

It is especially helpful in setting aside the superficial views that ethnic conflict or European-drawn borders are  the root of Sudan's internal conflict issues, and it cuts to chase: &quot;it's about wealth, simpleton!&quot;.<br />The history of Sudan is well-drawn out, with the bottom line being that the southerners and their especially rich territory have been constantly besieged and ravished by the northern elite.  The only time of peace in the 200 year war has been when the British imposed that peace, and there is a suggestive air about that finding.<br />The varied discussions of genocide and &quot;cultural cleansing&quot;, including the forced rape of the women in the groups being eradicated, and the use of famine to kill two million, are dismaying in the extreme.<br />&quot;Ecology and economics provide controlling metaphors.&quot;  This is an excellent summary of the book.<br />Also helpful is the book's coverage of the relations between Egypt and Sudan (both historical and current), the explicit (northern) Sudanese sponsorship of terrorism and hosting of many Islamic and other terrorist groups within its territory, and the general references to the varying influences of the Turks, the British, and the missionaries.<br />This is a serious book, by serious people, and it does the Sudan issues full justice.  One puts the book down feeling somewhat aghast at the ignorance of the U.S. government, the incapacity of the United Nations, and the blatant malevolence of the northern Sudanese predators.  This book is strongly recommended for any person who wonders about their government's competence and compassion.  Sudan is a cancer, not just within Africa, but within the larger world, and the continued acceptance of the genocide and slavery and related plagues that characterize this place call into question the legitimacy, the ethics, the accountabilty, of all Western governments.y of the United Nations, and the blatant malevolence of the northern Sudanese predators.

Richard Marcenko did this to U.S. Navy Special Operations with &quot;Rogue Warrior&quot;, Winn Schwartau did this for American's vulnerability to anonymous electronic terrorism with &quot;Terminal Compromise.&quot;<br />O'Reilly was written a fascinating novel, one that is not only a first-rate thriller in its own right, but that also lays out some of the really outrageous manipulative and corrupt behavior that is common among senior network managers.  He introduces the concept of workplace terrorism (by managers), of &quot;bigfooting&quot; (the theft--plagarism--of good work by field reporters so that the pretty face names (both male and female) can be reinforced); and the falsification of market surveys for the purpose of slandering and firing really good people who refuse to be cowed by bad and unethical network managers.<br />This novel has it all--engaging truths, a solid plot, a sentimental love story, good police thread, and a dramatic climax.  I ended up buying a used copy and am glad I took the trouble.  If you ever wondered what traitors to our national intelligence community and some senior network managers have in common, read this book--O'Reilly has put a stake through their hearts.	2001-12-01

The opening document for citizen-governance	Those who have bought &quot;The Cultural Creatives&quot; by Paul Ray and Sherry Ruth Anderson, or &quot;IMAGINE: What America Could be in the 21st Century&quot;, will not only be thrilled by this book, they will understand that the &quot;citizen-centered&quot; system of governance is finally achievable and imminent--we should all try to buy, read, discuss and relate this book to the Congressional elections in 2002 and the Presidential election in 2004.<br />This book is *loaded* with common sense.  It is absolutely not a political spin manual, a manifesto for revolution, or a ponderous think tank &quot;blue sky&quot; prescription for curing all the ills of the world.  This book has three simple focal points and they are powerful:<br />1)  More Americans identify themselves as Independents than as either Republicans or Democrats, and the way is open for a new &quot;radical centrist&quot; choice of leadership;<br />2) The original social contract that placed highly educated experts in charge of everything (government, corporations, even non-profits), taking care of the largely ignorant masses, is *history*.  The people are smart, the people are connected, and the people want *choices* rather than ideologically-contrived menus.<br />3)  Young adults are the key to the future and will decide the next few major elections, but only (a huge caveat) if leaders of vision and charisma can come forth with truthful options grounded in reality--the authors are carefully critical of political &quot;triangulation&quot; that seeks to manufacture false representations of common interest, only to betray those the moment after election.<br />The bottom line in this book is that the artificial trade-offs imposed on the people by menu- and elite-driven party politics are no longer acceptable nor enforceable, and the opportunity now presents itself for the voting public to remake the government from the outside in.<br />They focus on the core segments and core values that make America great: the market with its liberty; the state with its equality of opportunity; and the community (including religions) with its solidarity and nurturing of civic virtues.<br />Among the core negatives they identify where citizens could and should be free to choose rather than accept imposed combinations, are:<br />1)  Elections tied to rigid political parties that have veto rights over candidates, and selections that allow minority winners where more than two candidates split the majority vote.<br />2) Pension and health care programs tied to organizations rather than individuals--trapping individuals and constraining innovation.<br />3)  Educational systems tied to mass conformity rather than individual customization--with gross inequalities across counties and states because property taxes fund education, rather than a national normalized program with equal investments for every child.<br />4)  Tax systems tied to loopholes, patronage, and earnings, rather than to consumption and savings (tax breaks for savings).<br />5)  Immigration policies tied to old needs for low-skilled labor instead of new needs for high-skilled labor and the protection of the nation from dilution, disease, and excess demands on our tax-payer funded safety nets.<br />There are many other gems in this well-written and self-effacing book.  The authors come across as very sensible, very devoted to America and its values, and very much ahead of the curve.<br />They conclude that major renovations of our society usually result from a combination of three factors: an external shock to the system; the emergence of new political alliances, and the availability of compelling new ideas for social reform.<br />They specifically note that an obstacle to innovation is the lack of a well-formed political worldview among both the new generation of young voters, and the new elites (most of whom have eschewed politics).<br />While they say that realignments are not excepted in the next presidential or congressional cycle, but rather over the next ten to twenty five years, I believe they underestimate the power of the Internet and self-organizing groups such as represented by the Cultural Creatives.<br />I hope the authors consider launching a &quot;Journal of Citizen Governance&quot; and a web-site where citizens' can self-organize, because unlike the cultural creatives and the imaginative individuals who focus in niche areas, these two authors have finally &quot;cracked the code&quot; in a common sense manner that anyone can understand and anyone can act upon.<br />This is a unique and seminal work that could influence the future of national, state, and local politics, and hence the future of the Nation.

However, in light of what is now known about Viet-Nam, we must find Kissinger guilty as a war criminal (first link below).<br /><br />The book begins with a lamentation that foreign policy has been neglected in the last three Presidential campaigns; that the American public is terribly apathetic about foreign affairs; and that Congress is overly interventionist--he refrains from adding the obvious caveat regarding most Members lack of knowledge of the world. In brief, we have a long way to go as a Nation before we can devise and sustain a credible foreign policy.<br /><br />The core point in this entire work is that both economics and technologies, including Internet and communications technologies, have so out-paced politics that the world is at risk. Globalization, terrorism, and other threats cannot be addressed with our existing international, regional, and national political constructs, and new means must be found--new political solutions must be found--if we are to foster security and prosperity in the age of complexity, discontinuity, and fragmentation.<br /><br />There are some useful sub-themes:<br /><br />1)  Each region must be understood in its full complexity, with special attention to both emerging powers and to the subtleties of relations between regional actors--we should not confine ourselves to simply addressing each actor's relationship to the United States.<br /><br />2)  We must take great care to never interpose ourself or allow ourselves to become a substitute for a regional power, e.g. in the dialog between North and South Korea, or India and Pakistan.<br /><br />3)  We must strive at all times to ensure that the historic context is clearly appreciated and underlying every policy formulation, at the same time that we must recognize and define the vast cultural differences between US approaches to foreign policy, and the approaches of others, such as China.<br /><br />4)  Military compromise, whether in the Gulf War, Bosnia, or Kosovo, leaves a strategic vacuum that will inevitably require attention.<br /><br />5)  Africa is the true test for whether a world community can be devised and new solutions found for addressing the severe conditions in Africa that ultimately threaten the well-being of the rest of the world.<br /><br />6)  Our foreign service officers and the political leaders they serve must have history and philosophy restored to their diets, or they will fail to devise long-range concepts, global strategies, and sustainable policies.<br /><br />Dr. Kissinger ends with what some might overlook and what I found to be absolutely core: no economic system can be sustained without a political basis. However much major multinational corporations may care to buy their comforts and their arrangements of convenience, at root, they prosper only because some set of political arrangements among great nations is providing a safety net, including the financial system with one major node in New York.<br /><br />The books ends with an appeal for American humility and discretion as it makes it way forward--we must act as if we are one of many co-equal nation-states, while recognizing that our pre-eminence demands more of us than might be expected from others.<br /><br />There is one major gap in this book, and I suspect it was deliberate: there  is no discussion at all of the means by which American foreign policy is to  be devised.  As America moves into the early months of the \\"war on  terrorism\\", it would have been helpful to have a really well-qualified rant  on how it is impossible for this great Nation to have a foreign policy when  we have gutted almost into extinction what passes for a Department of State  today.  Our Foreign Service, our Embassies, our foreign assistance  programs, our Peace Corps, our external research, our sponsorshipof  international conferences on topics of vital importance to the US, have all  faded into decrepitude.  If ever there was a time when Kissinger,  Brzezinski, and Powell should come together and champion a major  restoration--at least a $10 billion a year increase--in Program 150 (our  soft power), this is that time.  That they have all failed to do so  troubles me--that Senator Biden was castigated publicly for speaking the  plain truth about how the world perceives us--troubles me.

Eurudite, one of the best outlines I have ever seen for examining a truly chaotic situation, everything falling into place from chapter to chapter--yet at the end of it I simply did not have the guts of the matter in my hands.<br />I found the answer in other materials, including a special project to map all of the existing tribes, sub-tribes, and individual leaders where they could be identified.  The project required monitoring of local radio stations in various languages, some of which did not have print media.  At the end of it all what came across was massive--massive--chaos in a medieval environment where everyone, without exception, regards every foreign power--and especially the superpowers--as an intruder, and every other Afghan as someone to be killed, exploited, or followed, depending on the situation.<br />This is a very fine book, but when one examines the list of organizations (14) and key individuals (16), what comes across is antisceptic simplicity.  This is not a criticism of the author, the research (virtually every English-language reference of note), or the conclusions--all fit well within a very thoughtful approach to describing this failed state called Afghanistan.  What jumps out at me is the fact that we do not have the access to the same story as told in Russian, Chinese, Dari, Farsi, Pashto, Urdu, Hindi, and we have done nothing to actually get below the state level--what I call &quot;two levels down&quot;--to the sub-tribe level.<br />As the world gets more complex, as &quot;wild cards&quot; such as Omar bin Laden cause massive dislocations within major developed countries, not just in isolated failed states, it seems to me that we do not have the sources and tools in hand to get a truly comprehensive coherent view of any particular situation.  I would go so far as to say that each book such as this can only be considered a calling card--an audition--and that a real understanding of the Afghan situation could only emerge from a multi-national effort that brings together such talented authors, across cultural and national lines, and gives them the kind of collection, processing, modeling, and operational intelligence support that are normally reserved for just a few great nations.  In brief, what we understand about Afghanistan is now too important to be left to a single author or a single perspective--and certainly too important to be left to a single failed intelligence community that thinks only in English.I would go so far as to say that each book such as this can only be considered a calling card--an audition--and that a real understanding of the Afghan situation could only emerge from a multi-national effort that brings together such talented authors, across cultural and national lines, and gives them the kind of collection, processing, modeling, and operational intelligence support that are normally reserved for just a few great nations.

His notes are world-class, including a highly relevant note in the final chapter, to wit, that according to Soviet General Lebed's 1997 public statement that, \\"out of 100 suitcase-sized nuclear bombs manufactured for the Soviet Union's special forces, two-thirds could no longer be accounted for.\\"<br />To begin with, Van Crevald damns the state for its consistent increase of taxes and its decrease in public services.  The state has become, in a word, incompetent and archaic--its grossly over-funded militaries are increasingly helpless in the face of covert and guerrilla violence, at the same time that states are spending more and more on police forces and less and less on a rapidly growing politically deprived disenfranchised underclass.<br />He ends, as a historical purist, without making recommendations for change.  Indeed, he quotes Mao Tse Tung, \\"The sun will keep rising, trees with keep growing, and women will keep having children.\\"<br />In many ways Van Crevald's book serves as a capstone to the fifty or so books I have reviewed in the past year, most of them about strategy, threat, intelligence, and the so-called revolution in military affairs, for what I take from this work is that the state does have an extremely important role to play in assuring the common security and prosperity of the people, and we abandon the state at our own peril.<br />Every nation, but especially the most prosperous nations that have allowed virtually out of control immigration and set no real standards for citizenship, must very carefully examine its policies and premises, both with regard to what constitutes citizenship and loyalty, and what services it must offer to preserve and protect the commonwealth.<br />I am told that the FBI was prevented from searching the homes of several of the suspects in the weeks prior to the 11 September attacks, because we have granted to our visitors--illegal as well as legal--all those rights that might better be reserved for proven citizens.  Van Crevald's work is not, as some might take it, the death knell for the state, but rather the bath of cold water for the statesmen--and for those citizens who care to instruct their politicians on our demand for renewed focus on resurrecting the connection between citizenship, taxation, representation, and security.use we have granted to our visitors--illegal as well as legal--all those rights that might better be reserved for proven citizens.

The author's brilliant biography of William Casey, OSS Veteran and Director of Central Intelligence under President Ronald Reagan, was a much more satisfying book.  What we have here is by and large a mish-mash of the works of others, together with an original composition on FDR's involvement in intelligence that is uneven--partly because the subject did not put much in writing, and partly because the author chose to rely primarily on secondary published sources.<br />From the perspective of one interested in &quot;Presidential intelligence,&quot; that is, how does a President manage various means of keeping informed, the book is a must read but also a shallow read.  We learn that FDR was a master of deception and of running many parallel efforts, balancing them against one another.  We learn that FDR was remarkably tolerant of amateurism and incompetence, while good at finding the gems these same loose but prolific intelligence endeavors could offer.<br />Perhaps most importantly, we gain some insights into how Presidents, even when properly informed by intelligence (e.g. of Pearl Harbor in advance, or of the lack of threat from domestic Americans of Japanese descent) must yet &quot;go along&quot; and provide either inaction pending the public's &quot;getting it&quot;, or unnecessary action (the internments) to assuage public concern.<br />There are enough tid-bits to warrant a full reading of the book, but only for those who have not read widely in the literature of intelligence and/or presidential history.  The British lied to the President and grossly exaggerated their intelligence capabilities, in one instance presenting a man &quot;just back from behind the lines&quot; when in fact he was simply on staff and lying for effect.  We learn that the Department of State was twice offered, and twice declined, the lead on a global structure for collecting and processing intelligence.  We learn that FDR himself concluded that Croatia and Serbia would never ever get along and should be separate countries.<br />On the NATO side, we learn that Eisenhower went with bad weather and the invasion succeeded in part because of a successful deception and in part because of Ike's courage in going forward in the face of bad weather--fast forward to how weather incapacitates our high-technology today.  Most interestingly, we learn that FDR finally approved Eisenhower as leader of Overload, in lieu of his favorite, General Marshall, in part because he recognized that the allied joint environment required a general and a politician in one man.<br />This book is a hybrid, attempting to mesh presidential history with intelligence history, and perhaps this should gain the author some margin of tolerance.  Unfortunately, in focusing on the relationships among the various intelligence principals and the president, he seriously passes over the enormous contributions of military as well as civilian and allied intelligence to the larger undertaking, and one is left with the narrow impression that American intelligence consisted largely of a number of self-serving clowns vying for Presidential favor.<br />The flaws inherent in a Federal Bureau of Investigation dominated by J. Edgar Hoover, and the lack of cooperation between the FBI and other major intelligence activities that continues today, are noted throughout the book.<br />Bottom line: worth buying and reading to gain insight into the challenges facing a President who can become isolated from reality by a corporate staff, but nowhere near the quality of Christopher Andrew's For the President's Eyes Only, or any of many good histories of espionage in World War II.the lead on a global structure for collecting and processing intelligence.

As things now stand, we will lose the war on terrorism over time because of the perennial flaws in our system that this book identifies.<br />Don't Bother Us Now. The U.S. political system is not structured to pay attention to &quot;early warning&quot;. Kosovo (as well as Croatia and Serbia beforehand and later Macedonia) were well known looming problems, but in the aftermath of the Gulf War, both Congress and the Administration in power at the time said to the U.S. Intelligence Community, essentially: &quot;don't bother us anymore with this, this is inconvenient warning, we'll get to it when it explodes.&quot; We allowed over a hundred thousand to be murdered in genocide, because our political system was &quot;tired.&quot;<br />&quot;Modern war&quot; is an overwhelming combination of micro-management from across the varied nations belonging to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; a reliance on very high-tech weapons with precision effect that are useless in the absence of precision intelligence (and the lawyers insist the intelligence be near-real-time, a virtual impossibility for years to come); and an obsession with avoiding casualties that hand-cuffs our friendly commanders and gives great encouragement to our enemies.<br />Services versus Commanders. The military services that under Title 10 are responsible for training, equipping, and organizing the forces--but not for fighting them, something the regional commanders-in-chief must do--have become--and I say this advisedly--the biggest impediment to the successful prosecution of operations. The detailed story of the Army staff resistance to the use of the Apache helicopters is the best case study I have ever seen of how senior staff generals with political access can prevent operational generals with field responsibilities from being fully effective. In combination with the insistence of the services that forces be held back for Korean and Persian Gulf threats that might not be realized, instead of supporting a real war that existed in Europe, simply stated, makes it clear that there is a &quot;seam&quot; between our force-creating generals and our force-fighting generals that has gotten *out of control.* The fog of war is thickest in Washington, and the greatest friction--the obstacles to success in war--are largely of our own making.<br />Lawyers, Fear, and Micro-Management. Just as we recently witnessed a lawyer overruling the general to avoid killing the commander of the Taliban, General Clark's war was dominated by lawyers, a fear of casualties, and micro-management, from Washington, of his use of every weapons system normally left to the discretion of the field commander. This has gotten completely out of hand. Within NATO it is compounded by multi-national forces whose commanders can refuse orders inconsistent with their own national view of things, but reading this book, one is left with the clear understanding that General Clark was fighting a three-front war at all times: with the real enemy, with the media, and with Washington--his NATO commanders were the least of his problems.<br />Technology Loses to Weather and Lacks Intelligence. Throughout the book there are statements that make it clear that the U.S. military is not yet an all-weather military, and has a very long way to go before it ever will be. Aligned with this incapacity is a high-technology culture that suffers from very weak maintenance and an almost complete lack of intelligence at the level of precision and with the timeliness that is needed for our very expensive weapons to be effective. Nothing has changed since MajGen Bob Scales wrote his excellent Firepower in Limited War, pointing out that artillery still cannot be adequately supported by the intelligence capabilities we have now.<br />Strategic Mobility Shortfalls, Tactical Aviation Constraints. Although General Clark judges the air war to have been a success, and an essential factor in facilitating &quot;coercive diplomacy&quot;, he also communicates two realities about U.S. military aviation: 1) we do not have the strategic aviation lift to get anywhere in less than 90-180 days, and his request for a 75 day mobilization was not possible as a result; and 2) our tactical aviation assets are so specialized, and require so much advance preparation in terms of munitions, route planning, and so on, that they cannot be readily redirected in less than a full day. A full day. This is simply outlandish.<br />We Don't Do Mountains. No statement in the book hurt me more than one by an Army general telling General Clark that his plans for the ground campaign could not be supported by the U.S. Army because &quot;we don't do mountains&quot; This, in combination with the loser's attitude (no casualties) and the general reluctance of the services to put their high-tech capabilities like the Apache at risk in a real war, sum up the decrepitude of the U.S. military leadership and the Revolution in Military Affairs-Andrew Gordon in Rules of the Game has it exactly right-the post Viet-Nam and post Cold War era has left us with a bunch of high-tech chickens in control of military resources, and we need to find ourselves some rat-catchers able to redirect our military toward a lust for man to man combat in every clime and place-and the low-tech sustainable tools to do the job.<br />General Clark's concluding words, on page 459: &quot;In Kosovo my commanders and I found that we lacked the detailed prompt information to campaign effectively against the Serb ground forces. Most of the technologies we had been promoting since the Gulf War were still immature, unable to deal with the vagaries of weather, vegetation, and urban areas, or the limitations of bandwidth and airspace. The discrete service programs didn't always fit together technically.

The author is one of our top strategists, historians, and teachers of war and peace and this is very much a capstone presentation.<br />The settlement of disputes among groups whose grievances are so great they are willing to die rather than accept impositions from others, are a fact of life. As 11 September has shown us, we are vulnerable to unconventional attacks against civilians, within our own borders--this book is relevant and readable.<br />The core idea is that only organized nation-states that can command the loyalty and obedience of their citizens, are capable of preventing war and championing peace. The concepts of corporate peace and non-governmental peace are explicitly disavowed.<br />Legitimization and brutality are recurring themes in history--peace among nations occurs when mutual respect or fear legitimize the status quo, and incredible brutalities, including routine massacres of \\"infidel\\" civilians, occur when states fail to control themselves or their populations.<br />A major disruptive factor in today's world is the combination of educated but unemployed masses within the Arabian and Islamic nations, and the globalization of communications--but it is a one-way globalization, firehosing the Muslims with corporate consumerist visions and impositions, while a Muslim Press Service has yet to form. Individual states--one could suggest that the United States is among them--failing to nurture a clear definition of citizenship, and the requisite loyalties--are destined to suffer internal fragmentation and external attack.<br />Strong militaries are needed to win wars, but overt military intervention is not the route to a sustainable peace in today's complex environment--only diplomacy, cultural outreach, and mutually agreed consensus can create and sustain peace....this is the simple yet brutal message of this book, one our leaders have yet to grasp.yet to grasp.	2001-10-28

This book is strongly recommended for both military professionals, and the executive and congressional authorities who persist in sharing the fiction that technology is of itself an asymmetric advantage.<br /><br />It merits emphasis that the author's first conclusion, spanning a diversity of case studies, is that technology may be a catalyst but it rarely drives a revolution in military affairs--concepts are revolutionary, it is ideas that break out of the box.<br /><br />Their second conclusion is both counter-intuitive (but based on case studies) and in perfect alignment with Peter Drucker's conclusions on successful entrepreneurship: the best revolutions are incremental (evolutionary) and based on solutions to actual opponents and actual conditions, rather than hypothetical and delusional scenarios of what we think the future will bring us.  In this the authors mesh well with Andrew Gordon's masterpiece on the rules of the game and Jutland: we may be best drawing down on our investments in peacetime, emphasizing the education of our future warfighters, and then be prepared for massive rapid agile investments in scaling up experimental initiatives as they prove successful in actual battle.<br /><br />The book is noteworthy for its assault on fictional scenarios and its emphasis on realism in planning--especially valuable is the authors' staunch insistence that only honesty, open discussion among all ranks, and the wide dissemination of lessons learned, will lead to improvements.<br /><br />Finally, the authors are in whole-hearted agreement with Colin Gray, author of Modern Strategy, in stating out-right that revolutions in military affairs are not a substitute for strategy as so often assumed by utopian planners, but merely an operational or tactical means.<br /><br />This is a brilliant, carefully documented work that should scare the daylights out of every taxpayer--it is nothing short of an indictment of our entire current approach to military spending and organization.

Had America had an Operational Intelligence (OpIntel) Plot (24/7 operationally-oriented put it all together all the time watch center), I daresay the terrorist attacks on America would have been prevented in good time.<br /><br />I started reading this book the week prior to the attacks, having bought it off the shelves of the Army War College bookstore, whose judgment I have always respected, and I have been absolutely absorbed--thrilled--with the deep insights that this work provides on how best to manage an operationally-oriented watch center that does \\"all-source fusion\\" against a constantly changing real-time real-world threat.<br /><br />It became clear to me as I worked through every word of this superior work that modern intelligence has become too bureaucratic and that all-source analysis has become too distant from both the sources and the consumers. The Operational Intelligence Center (OIC) whose story is told here worked with no fewer than seventeen distinct sources streams, each with its own idiosyncrasies, its own fits and starts--and it worked directly with its operational clients, fully appraised of friendly plans and intentions and able to provide workmanlike inputs at every turn. We need to get back to this approach!<br /><br />There are a number of vital lessons to be learned from this book, which I recommend in the strongest terms as one of my \\"top ten\\" relevant *today*. Among them:<br /><br />Sharing Secrets Matters. It was the Russians who helped the British get started in 1914 with a gift of a German Naval Signal book, and it was the Poles who saved the day early on in World War II with a gift of two working Enigma machines.<br /><br />Ops Must Sleep With Intel. Too many times I have seen operators ignore intelligence because they do not understand it-there are too many breakdowns in communication along the way, and if the operators have not trained with, lived with, slept with, caroused with, their intelligence counterparts, the two cultures do not come together effectively in times of crisis.<br /><br />Ops Cannot Do Raw Sources. The corollary of the above is that Ops simply cannot keep up with the nuances of sources and is not able to evaluate sources in context to good effect.<br /><br />Intel Must Sleep With Ops. The intelligence propensity to compartment everything to the point of meaningless, and the \\"green door\\" mentality that is especially characteristic of the crypto-analysis community, amounts to a death wish. Some secret sources must be \\"ultra\\" secret, but some form of bridge is needed-the OpIntel Center (which the U.S. Navy, alone within today's US secret bureaucratic archipelago, does well) appears to be a vital and relevant solution.<br /><br />Plots Must Be Co-Located and Ideally Integrated. Early separation and distance between the intelligence plot, the commercial shipping plot and the operational plot leads to waste and death. Ultimately an integrated plot, or at least a blue-green plot next door to the red plot, is absolutely vital to effective prosecution of real-time war.<br /><br />Lose the Old Guys. The first thing that needs doing when preparing for a long war is to lose the old guys. No disrespect intended, but as has been documented time and again, those that get promoted in peacetime bureaucracies tend to be too conformist and too subservient to peacetime protocols to adapt well to unconventional and very fast-moving wartime conditions. [Present company always excepted!.]<br /><br />Hire the Retired. This is not a contradiction. Old guys with big egos and high ranks have to go-but bringing in the best of the retired, generally at the field grade level, can have an extraordinary positive impact in the rapid maturation and stabilization of the full-speed-ahead wartime watch.<br /><br />Doctrinal Disputes Kill. Unless there is a homeland defense doctrine that fully integrates and exercises the capabilities and internal cultures of the Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard, and civilian agencies (and civilian agencies!) there will be a year or two of major and almost catastrophic losses until it gets sorted out the hard way.<br /><br />Home Arrogance Kills (UK Version). The persistent unwillingness of home side personnel to admit that their own security measures can be broken by clever enemies, and the general sloppiness of all hands with respect to Operations Security (OPSEC) will take a heavy toll.<br /><br />Home Arrogance Kills (US Version). There is a theme with regard to the Americans. While their money and their manpower are gratefully accepted, their arrogance knows no bounds. They entered the war believing that there was nothing the British could teach them-further on into the war, the Americans risked Ultra by acting too aggressively on its information.<br /><br />Red Cell Oversight Needed. One thing that jumped out at me from this book was the urgent need for having a very senior person-a retired Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for example, managing a Red Cell to provide oversight over operational decisions to exploit the most sensitive sources. [By this I mean, a senior authority who can overrule and forbid operations whose success might endanger the special source.]<br /><br />Negative Reports Matter. I was really struck by the circumstances surrounding a German break-out up the Channel, in which a number of normally reliable and overlapping intelligence collection endeavors all were forced back by weather, broken down or what-not. From this I took the lesson that negative reports matter. By failing to report to the OIC on their non-status, they failed to focus the OIC on all the possibilities. Thinking the flank covered, the OIC left the flank open.<br /><br />Tommy Brown Matters. The book ends on a marvelous note, pointing out that without the heroism of Tommy Brown, a 16 year old cabin boy and youngest recipient of the George Medal as well as two other adults who died in the process of grabbing vital enemy signals materials off a sinking vessel, the allies would have been deaf for much of 1943. At the end of the day the best technical intelligence comes down to a brave human who risks all to make it possible.<br /><br />Most of my other reviews of intelligence non-fiction can be found by seeking out online<br /><br />Worth a Look: Book Reviews on Intelligence (Most)<br /><br />All reviews lead back to their Amazon page, and are sorted by category (e.g. all on CIA, on NSA, etcetera).<br /><br />Best wishes to all,<br />Robert David STEELE Vivas<br />THE OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING MANIFESTO: Transparency, Truth, & Trustnal cultures of the Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard, and civilian agencies (and civilian agencies!) there will be a year or two of major and almost catastrophic losses until it gets sorted out the hard way.<br /><br />Home Arrogance Kills (UK Version).

The one needs to be stamped out, and the other radically reformed--no matter what beliefs you aspire to.<br /><br />Where I see the vitality and promise of this generation is in the possible energizing of the publics of many nations, including the nations of Islam, and public engagement of the core question of our time: what changes must we make in our corporate and consumerist behavior in order to, at once, establish both a sustainable model for the quality of life and choice we aspire to, while simultaneously establishing new forms of regional political and cultural accommodations that respect very strongly held beliefs?<br /><br />There are two books that bracket this one in interesting ways.

When I went to see all the references to &quot;culture wars&quot;, the one somber note in this otherwise very positive assessment of the future, the lack of an index prevented me from using the book as a reference work.<br /><br />This gives rise to my one concern about this generation (I have three children in the Millennials), and that is their lack of international studies and comparative religion training.  It is my impression that even the best of our schools are failing to teach foreign affairs and global conditions, and failing to show how what happens beyond our water's edge has a direct bearing on our future peace and prosperitythe author's would have done well to spend more time on the differences between our US-born millennials and foreign millennials (whom they characterize as several years behind but on the same track), and to address the gaps in our education of this otherwise stellar generation.<br /><br />Every parent and teacher, and every politician who wants to be elected in the next 20 years, needs to read this book.

With patience, however, the book in its entirety is a rewarding experience for it calls into question much about how we organize ourselves politically, economically, and socially.<br /><br />The bottom line, and very consistently with other great books such as &quot;The Manufacture of Evil&quot; on the low end and &quot;Consilience&quot; on the high end, is that Western thinking has been corrupted to the point that the West has become, as the inside flap says, &quot;a vast, incomprehensible directionless machine, run by process-minded experts....whose cult of scientific management is bereft of both sense and morality.&quot;<br /><br />As my own interests run toward public intelligence and public effectiveness in guiding the polity, I found his several chapters related to secrecy, immorality, and the &quot;hijacking of capitalism&quot; to be especially worthwhile.<br /><br />He concludes that secrecy is pathological, undermining both public confidence and the public dialog.  Intelligence in his view is about disseminated knowledge, not secrets.<br /><br />Throughout the book the author discusses the contest between those who feel that the people cannot be trusted--the elites who strive to remain in power by making power appear an arcane skill with rites and formulas beyond the ken of the people--and those who feels that the people--and especially the larger consciousness of the people--are more in touch with nature and reality and the needs of the people than these elites.<br /><br />This is a difficult book to absorb and enjoy, but I recommend because it sets the broad outlines for the real power struggle in the 21st Century--not between terrorism and capitalism, but rather between the government-corporate elites with their own agenda, and the larger body of people now possibly ready to turn every organization into an employee-owned and managed activity.activity.<BR><br />	2001-09-22

This book is one of the core readings.<br /><br />Among the recommendations in this book that make it essential reading for anyone concerned with streamlining and revitalizing national security, I consider the following to be sensible:<br />1) cost savings should not be achieved through the wholesale abandonment of overseas commitments (13);<br />2) achieve additional cost savings as well as increased operational utility by sharply limiting spending on the most advanced weapons and mobility systems, applying the savings to maintaining readiness and buying larger numbers of &quot;good enough&quot; weaponry (83);<br />3) citing Stephen Rosen-he could also have cited Colin Gray-he urges a slowdown in the so-called Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) while emphasizing that true RMA's are less about technology and more about the very best mix of people, time, and information to produce innovation (88);<br />4) in this vein, he noted the continued excessive focus on mobility platforms rather than C4I or joint service experimentation (90);<br />5) homeland defense needs several billion more dollars per year (129), a recapitalization of the U.S. Coast Guard by with at least a $750 million a year increase (135), and a sharply increased focus on setting C4I security standards for unclassified communications and computing networks across the nation, with roughly $100 million a year additional;<br />6) politely put, National Missile Defense is best conceptualized as theater missile defense (TMD, 143); and<br />7) Taiwan would be a nightmare for all sides.<br /><br />Among the assertions in this book that give me pause are<br />1) defense down-sizing in the past ten years has been successful, trimming a third of the budget and manpower while retaining quality and cohesion (p. 1);<br />2) that 3% of the Gross Domestic Product is adequate for defense spending and we do not need to go to the less-than-traditional 4% (3-4);<br />3) that the Marine Corps should be employed to relieve Army troops in the Balkans (57) or Korea (80);<br />4) that North Korean armored forces would have great difficulty breaking through Allied lines to Seoul (71);<br />5) that rogue nations like North Korea would attempt to provide their infantry with chemical protective gear when using chemical weapons (73);<br />6) that US airpower is both a rapid-response solution for distant threats as well as an overwhelming response for sustained threats (76, passim);<br />7) that arsenal ships are survivable in off-shore loiter mode (111); and<br />8) that an overseas deployment rate of 8% of the total force is too high (227).<br /><br />Having said that, and with all my reservations about a book, no matter how talented the author, that does not preface its discussion of force structure with a review of the recommended strategy, and a discussion of the recommended strategy with a review of the real-world right-now threat, I have to rate this book a solid four in terms of seriousness of purpose and utility of content.<br />It would be twice as valuable if it included a thorough discussion of what kind of Global Coverage intelligence investment is needed in order to make defense forces relevant and capable in the future; and if it included a discussion of how defense forces are but the most expensive instrument of national power, and must be designed and funded in consonance with the other instruments, and especially the severely underfunded diplomatic, economic, and cultural instruments.<br /><br />The author, easily one of the top three citizen-reviewers of the national security spending program, ultimately recommends less expensive weaponry, a different two-war capability (&quot;1+A+i&quot;), selective reductions in overseas deployments, more defense and less nuclear offense, selective increases in homeland defense including the U.S. Coast Guard and joint experimentation, and a modest increase (roughly $25 billion) of the defense budget that would combine with his recommended savings to yield the $60 billion or so transformation delta that others have recommended.<br /><br />I like and recommend this book. Out of context, however, it is a dangerous book, for it will lead an inexperienced President and a Cold War team to the conclusion that only a transformation of the traditional military (Program 50) is necessary. O'Hanlon has done it again-he has provided the baseline from within which a reasonable public debate about defense transformation might ensue. The military issues he addresses comprise both the foundation and one of the four corners of our future national security-my concern about this book is that it is completely isolated and makes no mention of the other three corners without which we cannot maintain a proper roof over our heads: intelligence (threat understanding), strategy, and Program 150 soft power-power that today is both silent and emaciated.and a modest increase (roughly $25 billion) of the defense budget that would combine with his recommended savings to yield the $60 billion or so transformation delta that others have recommended.<BR><br /><BR>I like and recommend this book.

Beyond that, selected portions of the Shultz et al book on &quot;Security Studies for the 21st Century&quot;, where detailed comments are made about both knowledge gaps among our policymakers and non-traditional threats, are recommended.<br /><br />There is no question but that the Attack on America of 11 September 2001 has awakened and even frightened the American public.  It has elicited conventional assurances from other nation states.  What most Americans do not understand, what this book makes brilliantly clear, is that two thirds of the rest of the world is glad it happened.  I quote from page 52: &quot;...at least two-thirds of the world's people--Chinese, Russians, Indians, Arabs, Muslims, and Africans--see the United States as the single greatest threat to their societies.  They do not regard America as a military threat but as a menace to their integrity, autonomy, prosperity and freedom of action.&quot;<br /><br />Whether one agrees with their depiction of two-thirds or not (or whether they see the Attack as a well-deserved bloody nose or an atrocity beyond the pale), the fact is that the authors paint--together with the PIOOM map--a compelling picture of billions--not millions but billions--of impoverished dispossessed people suffering from failed states, crime, slavery, starvation, water shortages--and an abundance of media as well as propaganda showing the US fat and happy and living the consumer society dream on the backs of these billions.<br /><br />Of all the policy people I have followed over the years, Robert McNamara and Bill Colby are the two that have in my view matured and broadened the most after leaving the halls of power.  The deep insights that I find throughout this book-a partnership expert between McNamara with the global reality and power game insights, James Blight with the scholarly underpinnings-are extraordinarily applicable to the challenges that we face in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 Attack on America.  In particular, their dissection of the United Nations-what works and what does not-and their recommendations for future initiatives that are multilateralist and focused on the prevention and amelioration of the root conditions that are spawning our terrorist challenges, are vital reading for policymakers, diplomats, warriors, and financial magnates.<br /><br />I am very concerned by any effort to militarize our response to the terrorist challenge-this is a long war that requires a fundamental restructuring of national intelligence and counterintelligence; a $100 billion a year effort to address the root causes of instability worldwide and a redirection of US foreign and defense policy away from unilateralism (for instance, we must now support the International Tribunal and an international island prison for those convicted of war crimes as well as acts of terror).  Our military is still needed, but it too must be restructured to provide for four major capabilities all equally capable: CINCWAR, CINCSOLIC, CINCPEACE, and CINCHOME.

This book has Internet and music charts--but none of the charts are comprehensive, generally listing top and bottom countries, not all countries.  Bottom line: this is the best value for a portable book about global figures relevant to political economy.	2001-09-10

While I recommend The Economist Pocket World in Figures as the best value (one tenth the cost), I find that this...book is essential to any serious personal library.  However, for what the book costs, I would like to see a web-based password-access database offered that would allow data extraction and chart creation.  This book is superior to The Economist version in that it lists all countries for which data is available (generally 135-185), and it is a more diverse and well-presented collection of data.	2001-09-10

Buy Used if Publisher Does Not Reissue	As one of those who served on the Central American Task Force at CIA and in the field, I was fascinated to learn of this book by one of America's greatest espionage warriors--not only did he run the Afghan war from the field, he was also Chief of the Soviet Division and Chief of Station in Germany, the equivalent of an Olympic &quot;clean sweep.&quot; I read this book critically.<br /><br />It is simply super, and full of nuances that get better with a second reading. The most important of these is the thoughtful manner in which the fall of the Soviet military in Afghanistan is related to the subsequent weakening of the Soviet hold over Eastern Europe, a hold that eventually broke and led to the unification of Germany and chaos in those portions of Eastern Europe where neither Europe nor the US was ready to help convert communists to capitalists. This is an inspiring book that shows in great detail how covert action--behind the lines action--can serve a great nation. This book will cleanse the palate of all those who soured on covert action as done so badly (and occasionally in violation of the law) in Central America.<br /><br />Evidently I bought the last used copy, released for public sale by the Indianapolis Public Library--too bad, since we need more young spies from that area and they would have been highly motivated by this book. I hope the publisher reissues it, this is a tale that is much more truth than fiction, and of lasting value to those who would understand the deeper value of covert action in the national service. We still need spies, there is still great evil around the world, and I can only hope that books like this will help the clandestine service recruit those with &quot;the right stuff.&quot;	2001-09-04

It was, however, recommended by someone I trust, and I am glad I read it.<br /><br />The two most profound insights, insights every teacher and CEO should be required to repeat every day, are that our schools beat creativity out of our children, and our corporations suppress individual ideas and any attempts at diversity.<br /><br />I read this book twice.  The first time, like a cat circling a mouse, I would pick it up and read just one of the stories, expecting to collect enough evidence to discard it completely, and instead being drawn back for another story at random.  The second time, more sequentially, looking for the meat to review.<br /><br />Unfortunately, absent a major revolution in how we manage our organizations, this book does not suggest solutions.  Very few can survive on their own unless they are willing to drop down to subsistence living.  The sad fact is we have a school system designed over 100 years to deskill people to the point they could work in assembly line jobs (including white collar &quot;company man go along&quot; jobs), and in the same 100 years have focused on building companies in which everyone is replaceable, and no one person can hope to do the business development, product development, service, and billing for any given offering.<br /><br />Certainly the Internet offers some prospects--say 20 years down the road--for networks of &quot;virtual corporations&quot; to take effect, but in the meantime, I have to judge this book as a really excellent pate de foie gras, just the thing with which to torment the corporate slaves who want to dream of freedom.<br /><br />Great book, something we can use in another 40 years or so, if we have managed to get a grip on campaign finance reform, neighborhood cottage and networked industries, and radically restructured schools that get away from rote and celebrate the process of learning.  Until then, most people are going to have to focus on keeping the job they have, however distasteful it may be, because the harsh reality is that in this day and age, it is the large inefficient organization that provides gainful employment for the majority of us that have not been schooled to be anything other than drones.<br /><br />I'll end on a positive note: there is something called the Davies J-Curve, a political science finding that suggests that people do not revolt to acquire greater freedom or anything else, but rather when they have experienced all that they wish, and then it is taken away from them.  If we have a major recession that decapitates government and cleans out a good third of the small businesses and corporations that are hanging on by a string now, it may just inspire groups of people to revisit how they relate to one another.<br /><br />One more positive note: if you are a realist, and you know that you have to accept drone status, but want to be cheered up and contemplate little ways around the margins where you can exercise some freedom muscles,  this is the book for you.  I enjoyed reading this book, and it may be unfair to evaluate it at the strategic level-there is no question that the author is an inspired original thinker, and I hope the day comes when he is the norm, rather than the exception.nd networked industries, and radically restructured schools that get away from rote and celebrate the process of learning.

It is nowhere near an &quot;Enigma&quot; or &quot;The Unlikely Spy&quot; or &quot;The Black Tulip&quot;, my three favorites in this past decade, but for a first novel by someone with no field experience it is quite worthy and I will look forward to the next effort by this author.<br /> This is an honest solid book, worth the price and the time.	2001-08-28

Are they prepared to join the global grid of free thinkers and cyber-advocates that are finding that the Internet is the lever that will move the world and empower the people once again? The author argues, in a compelling, academically sound and morally encouraging way, that America above all nations finds itself in a new civil war, a war between the \\"liquidating class\\" and the \\"steady state\\" class.<br /> Besides citizens, this book will provoke and enlighten venture fund managers, political action campaign managers, and leaders of any organization. Others have certainly been down this road, the Club of Rome being especially noteworthy as an early attempt to establish trade-off values, but I believe this gentle, capable professional (with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Division of Refugees) has written a timely book that is in its own way the \\"Silent Spring\\" of this generation. Perhaps more to the point, he makes it clear that all environmental issues, all economic issues, are inherently political, and we the voters have a choice in every election: between the candidate indebted to corporate carpetbaggers, and the candidate beholden to the people.t is in its own way the \\"Silent Spring\\" of this generation.

There are four major points in this book that neither the publicity prose nor the earlier reviewers emphasize, and I focus on these because they are the heart of the book and the core of its value: <br /> 1) Peacetime breeds officers, systems, and doctrine that are unlikely to stand the empirical test of war.  As the author notes, every incompetent in war has previously been promoted to his or her high rank in peacetime.  Systems are adopted without serious battle testing or interoperability (and intelligence) supportability being assured, and doctrine takes a back seat to protocol and keeping up appearances. <br /> 2) Technologists are especially pernicious and dangerous to future warfighting capability when they are allowed to promulgate new technology under ideal peacetime conditions, and not forced to stand the test of battle-like degradation and the friction of real-world conditions. <br /> 3) Doctrine based on the lessons of history rather than the pomp of peacetime is the ultimate insurance policy. <br /> 4) Robust--even intrusive and pervasive--communications (signaling) in peacetime is almost certain to denigrate healthy doctrinal development, has multiple pernicious effects on the initiative and development of individual commanders, and can have catastrophic consequences when it is severely degraded in wartime and the necessary doctrinal foundation and command initiative are lacking. <br /> This is a very long book at 708 pages, and I would hasten to note that the book is worth purchasing even if only to read Chapter 25, pages 562-601, in which the author brilliantly sets forth 28 distinct &quot;propositions&quot;.  The balance of the book is extraordinary in its detail and a pleasure to scan over, but its primary role is to absolutely guarantee the credibility and industry of the author. <br /> Each of the 28 propositions, one sentence in length with varying explanatory summaries, is compelling, relevant, and most critical to how we train both flag officers and field grade officers of all the services.  Were the author so inclined, I would encourage him to develop the final chapter as a stand-alone primer for military leaders seeking to learn from history and avoid the dangerous juxtaposition of too much technology and too little thought.  While the author draws his propositions from an excruciatingly detailed study of the Battle of Jutland and the British naval cultures in conflict before and after Jutland, this book is not, at root, about a specific battle, but rather about the constantly forgotten &quot;first principles&quot; of training, equipping, and organizing forces for combat.  Hard to do in peacetime with the best of leaders, a tragedy in waiting with the more common peacetime pogues in charge.  &quot;Ratcatchers&quot;, the author's phrase for those who do well in war, are crushed by the peacetime protocols, and this is perhaps the greatest lesson of all: we must nurture our ratcatchers, even place them on independent duty to travel distant lands, but somehow, someway, keep them in play against the day when we need them. <br />	2001-08-04
1905190:US	50761804	R3400Z21VF3K3K	0440224675	313045692	Hannibal	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Finding the Greater Good and the Greater Evil	I suspect that many of us who so enjoyed The Silence of the Lambs on the big screen chose not to go to the movie sequel because of its 1) negative reviews, 2) emphasis on cannibalism, and 3) loss of Jodie Foster as the lead actress.  Buying and reading the book was my alternative, and I recommend it very highly.<br /> I read this book at the same time that I was reading Nigel Nicholson's Executive Instinct, Managing the Human Animal in the Information Age; Kurt Eichenwald's The Informant (about routine corruption in the highest levels of corporate America) and several other books which I am reviewing.  I mention this because in that context I do not find Hannibal to be about cannibalism, or find Starling to have converted to evil--instead what I see is one rennaissance man, so conflicted with the corruption in society at large that he chooses a very unconventional means of &quot;biting back&quot;.  I see Starling as his soul mate, someone who was bullied and terribly abused by the government system she swore to serve loyally, who in the end chooses to join Hannibal in exile, having upheld the law (protected Hannibal from torture and murder) and taken physical and psychological revenge against the book's true antagonist, slime-ball opportunist Krendler.<br /> I found this book so compelling that I bought a second copy when my first was left behind on an airplane, and in the second reading I found even more detail supportive of the above perspective.  Most of us will never be as talented as Hannibal, and most of us will never, thankfully, feel that our society is failing us so terribly that we must cast off the bounds of convention that maintain our stability and relative prosperity.  Most of us would--in extremis--kill but not eat another human--and I hope that this leaves us with the question the author intended: which is the greater evil: murder for the sake of revenge, or calculated selective dining on targets that are--even by the standards of the conventional critics--among the lower beings that society has to offer up--Donnie Barber, for example, the butcher of deer, or the final course, Paul Krendler, who violated every oath he ever took?<br /> I hope the author pursues this theme, for mankind is confronting itself these days with terrible misbehavior, from trade in women and children to toxic dumping to the legal poisoning of our domestic water and food supplies.  I would be most fascinated by how Hannibal might play if cast on a world stage, in the midst, say, of a G-8 or World Trade Organization Meeting.<br /> This is a seriously addictive story line by a very talented author, and it is very highly recommended for reading as a gentle means of provoking some of our deeper darker thoughts.  This book does not condone nor encourage cannibalism--that is but a vehicle for helping us think outside the box.

At its most strategic level, the book focuses on the fact that the problems facing nation-states and entire societies cannot be solved in the absence of ethical restraint.  Technology and law enforcement can address deviants in the minority, but not a majority that chooses deviance as a routine lifestyle.<br /> This is the first book I have encountered in my religious reading that actively respects all other religions as well as personal ethical systems apart from religion.  In essence, the Dalai Lama calls for each person to restore their spiritual base, either by honoring their chosen religion, or by adopting a personal ethical philosophy that is consistent with the generic teachings of various religions.<br /> At a very personal level, as I read this book I saw clearly how my competitive and confrontational instincts, honed over a half century by a &quot;dog eat dog&quot; culture, have in fact hurt me and hurt others.  I was reminded by this book that a Nobel Prize has been awarded to those showing that trust lowers the costs of business transactions--Fukiyama managed to get an entire book out of that one word.  Reflecting on this book, and its measured discussion of how each of us simply seeks happiness and avoidance of suffering, caused me to reflect on how often each of us reduces the happiness of others and impose suffering through rudeness, harm by omission (not sharing useful information) and in other more aggressive ways.<br /> On a global scale, and very consistent with other social science works on the complexity and inter-connectedness of the world, the book clearly addresses the urgent need for major world powers to understand that our existing life style and its damage to world resources is both unaffordable and suicidal.  This book on ethics applies to Nations and to organizations, not just to individuals.  It is a very elegant &quot;dummy's guide to survival in the 21st Century.&quot;pose suffering through rudeness, harm by omission (not sharing useful information) and in other more aggressive ways. <br /> On a global scale, and very consistent with other social science works on the complexity and inter-connectedness of the world, the book clearly addresses the urgent need for major world powers to understand that our existing life style and its damage to world resources is both unaffordable and suicidal.

While there are other books on attention qua economic good, this one focuses on us, the attention providers, and not on the media or entertainment or other attention thieves.<br /> The book is well-presented and what some might see as showmanship I consider to be good editing and publishing.  The book starts strong, focusing on &quot;attention deficit&quot; in both individuals and organizations, and the consequences of failing to pay attention to the right things at the right time--corporate CEOs and their business intelligence professionals, as well as government leaders and their national intelligence professionals, can learn a great deal from this book.<br /> Especially useful to me, and a major reason why I rank this book so highly, was its distinction between:<br /> 1) Global Coverage for AWARENESS<br /> 2) Surge local focus for ATTENTION<br /> 3) Domestic political focus for ACTION<br /> At a national level, I found myself thinking that this book could be the first step in an evaluation of how we spend our time--and how we compensate ourselves for spending our time.  Of course others have observed that we spend too much time in front of the television or eating fast food or whatever, but I found this book extremely helpful in thinking about the economics of personal and organizational information management.  Applying this book's lessons, for example, might cause any manager to forbid Internet access because of the very high negative return on investment--searches should be done by specialists who can be relied to avoid personal browsing on company time.  The author's specifically note that the Western culture is less well equipped to manage &quot;attention&quot; than other cultures.<br /> Also helpful to me were the book's focus on the fact that client attention and teamwork *compete* with innovation, and that some form of time management guidance is needed that permits employees to focus on just one of these as a primary duty.<br /> The author's identification of relevance, community, engagement, and convenience as the four key factors in attracting and holding attention from individuals--and the lengthy discussion in the book on each of these--is very worthwhile.  So also is their specification of four &quot;attention tracks&quot; that each individual must manage: focusing one's own attention; attracting the right kind of attention to oneself; directing the attention of those under one's oversight; and maintaining the attention of one's customers and clients (and one could add, one's family).<br /> This book is a vital contribution to correcting our long-standing overemphasis on collecting information (or ignoring information) without regard to what we do with it in human terms.  For me, the key sentence in this entire book, one that government and corporate managers would do well to &quot;pay attention to&quot; was, on page 216: &quot;Increasingly, managerial success will rely on the ability to ignore or at least filter the vast stream of information that hits the desk, ears, and eyeballs.  The ability to prioritize information, to focus and reflect on it, and to exclude extraneous data will be at least as important as acquiring it.&quot;  Their book is *not* a variation on the many confused knowledge management treatises (making the most of what you already know).  It goes well beyond the current state of the art and outlines new ideas that could and should have a fundamental impact on how we spend our time, what information services we buy, and how we use information technology.gement guidance is needed that permits employees to focus on just one of these as a primary duty. <br /> The author's identification of relevance, community, engagement, and convenience as the four key factors in attracting and holding attention from individuals--and the lengthy discussion in the book on each of these--is very worthwhile.

1905475:US	50761804	R1WFPP8WXO9GMV	0275969517	555370886	Clausewitz and Chaos: Friction in War and Military Policy	Books	4	8	9	N	Y	Doctrine, Discipline, Intelligence, &amp; Initiative = Victory	The author, and this book, may well be among the strongest elements of what I perceive to be a growing backlash against the prevalent technophelia characteristic of the military-industrial complex that President and General Eisenhower warned us against--a technophelia that advocates a &quot;system of systems&quot; with no provision for strategy, doctrine, or intelligence; and a Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that looks to micro-UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) and robotic ants as the primary means for defeating any enemy.  We will simply assume every enemy will conveniently expose themselves to the narrow range of capabilities that we have devised at great expense!<br /> The author provides as good a review of &quot;friction&quot; in war and in policy as one could hope for.  Although sometimes tedious and not always easy to follow, this book is a must for any serious scholar of future conflicts between states, nations, and organizations.  Above all, this book is a giant compressed Castor Oil pill for the techno-meisters so eager to believe they can shape a world where our money and our technology can overcome every obstacle and every opponent.<br /> A few highlights intended to recommend the purchase of this book and its digestion:<br /> 1) Friction is not receiving the attention it merits from modern social scientists, including all those on the Department of Defense payroll.  We still conceptualize our capabilities along techno-rational lines instead of human-normal chaos lines.<br /> 2) It is the combination of thoughtful doctrine, individual and unit discipline, initiative at all levels, and good intelligence (individual, organic, and external) that leads to victory through the reduction of friction--what General Alfred M. Gray, former Commandant of the Marine Corps institutionalized with his concept of &quot;commander's intent&quot; on top of training for war with the assumption that communications and computing *will* collapse in the heat of battle.<br /> 3) Although very brief in his coverage of intelligence per se, the author is helpful in reviewing Clausewitz's top eight sources of friction, the first three of which deal with information: insufficient knowledge of the enemy; unreliable information from patrols and spies; and uncertain knowledge of our own capabilities and dispositions.  The author administers the coup de grace to technophiles with some elegant quotes from these worthies claiming that the new world of satellite intelligence is taking us to a non-Clauswitzian world where friction can be overcome by &quot;information superiority&quot;--these are the same folks that cannot find Bin Laden and had to invade Panama in order to capture Noriega--the same folks that let a warlord in Somalia run amok and let a small crowd chase away a U.S. Navy ship of war from docking in Haiti...the same folks that ignore 18 distinct genocide campaigns on-going today, with all that implies in terms of forced migration and epidemic disease and failed states and rampant destabilizing crime.<br /> 4) The author's review of groupthink (Janis) and how this leads to policy fiasco's is very worthwhile, not only because it is acutely relevant to how we are making decisions today in defense, energy, health, and fiscal policy, but because it highlights so clearly the dangers that come from a leadership that thinks it is invulnerable, morally superior, self-censored, sharing illusions of unanimity, subject to stereotyped visions of the world, and--worst of all--protected from reality by self appointed &quot;mind guards&quot; who put direct pressure on &quot;deviant&quot; naysayers (or dump them from the team).<br /> 5) The author is one of the few to focus on the impact of friction on what Clausewitz calls the ultimate disconnect, that between ends and means in war.  As America prepares to rethink its military force structure, it is especially appropriate to note that we are planning to downsize the conventional forces while investing heavily in electronic capabilities, at the same time that the most advanced thinkers have moved beyond asymmetric war to non-traditional soft power including major emphasis on disease control, water preservation, transnational law enforcement, and major diplomatic and economic assistance options.  Looking at today's situation through the author's eyes and this book, one can see that we do not have a strategy; we don't even try to understand what everyone else's strategy might be; and we are completely ignoring the need to fully integrate home front and overseas defense, foreign affairs, and trade strategy and capabilities management.<br /> Over the course of 7 chapters, the author reviews friction both at the policy/acquisition level and the operational level of command, in relation to irrelevant and inflexible war plans; nuclear crisis management; within Desert Storm; in small wars, &quot;faux wars&quot; and peace operations; in modern deterrence; and in relation to mass destruction and information warfare paradigms.  In the latter instance, he is acutely sensitive to the teachings of Dr. Steve Blank, that one man's information &quot;warning&quot; attack is another man's signal for &quot;total war&quot;--witness Russian doctrine that considers a C4I attack to be fundamental and requiring an immediate &quot;dead hand&quot; retaliatory attack.<br /> The author concludes the book with a review of simple, compound, and complex friction in policy and operations, with examples, and for this section alone the book merits inclusion in any serious library concerned with international security.while investing heavily in electronic capabilities, at the same time that the most advanced thinkers have moved beyond asymmetric war to non-traditional soft power including major emphasis on disease control, water preservation, transnational law enforcement, and major diplomatic and economic assistance options.

It specifically &quot;blows&quot; a cover company, two specific kinds of aircraft, and several U.S. Special Operations Forces standard operating procedures.  I suspect that NSA and the CIA Centers dealing with terrorism and with crime and narcotics are having the same difficulties recovering from this book that NSA had when President Reagan inadvertently revealed in public that he was receiving transcripts of Politburo cell phone conversations made while in transit, from their car phones.<br /> Having said that, I find that the author has performed very responsibly as an investigative journalist, and that his story is superior in every respect.  I even find that he has withheld some key information out of respect for his sources,and that there are many lessons to be learned from this book about how we might improve our transnational campaign against non-state forces that have vastly more money, ruthlessness, and sheer people power than we do.<br /> I like and recommend this book--it is a real-world story, well-researched and well-told.	2001-07-25
1905759:US	50761804	R2LQKE7QZTGF32	0812931971	94222281	Executive Instinct : Managing the Human Animal in the Information Age	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Communities of 150, Stone Age Minds, and Other Tid-Bits	I liked this book because it flies in the face of conventional wisdom about human relations and organization, and because it provides an alternative perspective on leadership: recognizing that humans have an &quot;animal&quot; nature that is &quot;hard-wired&quot;, and that if we accept that rather than trying to &quot;program&quot; individuals, we will be more likely to create a vibrant organization.<br /> The author's &quot;eight point plan&quot; for capitalizing on creative spirit while minimizing irrationality could not be further from the current practices of most government and corporate activities:<br /> 1) Watch how you manage errors and mistakes.  Zero-tolerance cultures drive out exploration and prevent learning.<br /> 2) Train your managers to create a climate of psychological freedom in which curiosity is valued.<br /> 3) Give people space to express their emotions and time for reflection.<br /> 4) In areas of high information flow and complex decisions, don't trust your instincts.  Use decision-making aids and statistics...<br /> 5) Make sure that the climate is one in which diverse expertise and opinions get a real open airing.<br /> 6) Question your own assumptions and conventional reasoning before making any important decision.<br /> The entire book is valuable, and the above is but a glimpse of some its value.  Especially interesting to me was the author's conclusion that the reason most organizational communications programs fail is because they are trying to control behavior rather than create community--like many of the more intelligent writings on military doctrine being more important that military communications, the author makes a compelling case for using communications to create informal shared standards and expectations rather than to micro-manage individual behavior.<br /> The footnotes are especially worthwhile, and serve as a tour of various relevant literatures, all very pleasantly up to date.	2001-07-25

My reaction was largely a compliment to the author, whose deeper work on &quot;The Ends of the Earth&quot; I had just digested, and from whom I was expecting a &quot;capstone&quot; sort of work that was integrated and complete.<br /> Upon reflection, however, I realized that one should not confuse hors d'ouerves with the main course, and that this book is just that: a delightful set of simple samples from the author's much deeper and more complex writing and reporting.<br /> The author is strongest on historical continuity and ground truth reality.  He is weakest on intelligence issues but asks the right question: how do we reduce risk around the world when traditional military forces are unsuited to the task?<br /> Writing as he does for the prestigious and eclectic Atlantic Monthly, where he is the primary (some would say the only) voice on foreign policy matters, one can only hope that he will focus in the coming year on the fundamentals of information sharing across national, cultural, and organizational boundaries--this book, and all the other books by this author, are highly recommended because they open a window on the real world that has not been opened by our very expensive government intelligence and diplomatic capabilities, and is not available from our inexpensive but all too mundane media.  I would go so far as to suggest that this kind of personal travel and reflection--that the author represents so ably--is precisely the kind of future alternative intelligence capability (in the open legal ethical sense) that we must have more of, and so the question we should all be asking when we finish this book by Robert D. Kaplan is: how do we clone this guy so we have 1000 more like him, and all their reporting is easily accessible to citizens?<br /> If you like this kind of information, I highly recommend two other books: World's Most Dangerous Places, by Robert Young Pelton, and Deliver Us From Evil: Warlords, Peacekeepers, and a World of Endless Conflict by William Shawcross.by Robert Young Pelton, and Deliver Us From Evil: Warlords, Peacekeepers, and a World of Endless Conflict by William Shawcross. <br />	2001-07-13

He has written an extraordinary book that ordinary people will take to be a sensationalist travel guide, while real experts scrutinize every page for the hard truths about the real world that neither the CIA nor the media report.<br /> Unlike clandestine case officers and normal foreign service officers, all of them confined to capital cities and/or relying on third party reporting, Robert Young Pelton actually goes to the scene of the fighting, the scene of the butchery, the scene of the grand thefts, and unlike all these so-called authoritative sources, he actually has had eyeballs on the targets and boots in the mud.<br /> I have learned two important lessons from this book, and from its author Robert Young Pelton:<br /> First, trust no source that has not actually been there.  He is not the first to point out that most journalists are &quot;hotel warriors&quot;, but his veracity, courage, and insights provide compelling evidence of what journalism could be if it were done properly.  Government sources are even worse--it was not until I heard him speak candidly about certain situations that I realized that most of our Embassy reporting--both secret and open--is largely worthless because it is third hand, not direct.<br /> Second, I have learned from this book and the author that sometimes the most important reason for visiting a war zone is to learn about what is NOT happening.  His accounts of Chechnya, and his personal first-hand testimony that the Russians were terrorizing their Muslims in the *absence* of any uprising or provocation, are very disturbing.  His books offers other accounts of internal terrorism that are being officially ignored by the U.S. Government, and I am most impressed by the value of his work as an alternative source of &quot;national intelligence&quot; and  &quot;ground truth&quot;.<br /> There are a number of very important works now available to the public on the major threats to any country's national security, and most of them are as unconventional as this one--Laurie Garrett on public health, Marq de Villiers on Water, Joe Thorton on chlorine-based industry and the environment--and some, like Robert D. Kaplan's books on his personal travels, are moving and inspiring reflections on reality as few in the Western world could understand it--but Robert Young Pelton is in my own mind the most structured, the most competent, the most truthful, and hence the most valuable reporter of fact on the world's most dangerous places.<br /> What most readers may not realize until they read this book is that one does not have to travel to these places to be threatened by them--what is happening there today, and what the U.S. government does or does not do about developments in these places, today, will haunt this generation and many generations to follow.  I strongly recommend this book to anyone who cares to contemplate the real world right now.important works now available to the public on the major threats to any country's national security, and most of them are as unconventional as this one--Laurie Garrett on public health, Marq de Villiers on Water, Joe Thorton on chlorine-based industry and the environment--and some, like Robert D.

Kaplan gets three big things right: he studies history before visiting; he is firmly grounded in a geographical or geophysical appreciation of every situation; and he travels on foot and at the lowest common level.  The world he sees and reports on is not the world that the pampered and sheltered diplomats, businessmen, and journalists see or understand.<br /> Reading Kaplan is a treat for anyone who takes the rest of the world and America's naivete with some seriousness.  He is correct when he posits a new World War, &quot;a protracted struggle between ourselves and the demons of crime, population pressure, environmental degradation, disease, and culture conflict.&quot;<br /> He is at his best when mixing his historical reading with his personal intellect and observations, to arrive at conclusions that contradict conventional wisdom--for instance, his appreciation of Iran as a structured and stable society, and of Turkey as the next mega-power and the keeper of the Islamic flame.  His extremely sharp observations about Saudi Arabia as the hidden enemy of the United States of America are very very provocative, especially when one realizes that we are providing them with an extremely generous military and economic program at U.S. taxpayer expense.  Saudi funding of terrorism, including Bin Laden, is increasingly documented in the public domain, and U.S. taxpayers need to begin questioning U.S. policy in this specific area.<br /> This personal travel narrative is invaluable as a means of contemplating the realities of nations that exist (e.g. the Kurds) alongside states that continue to persecute and deny these nations a right to live.  Although another hundred pages follow, the real end of the book is on page 336 where he discusses a living map of the future world, one that is constantly changing and that reflects several realities--a reality of overlapping group identities such as those of language and economic class; a reality of legal boundaries and overlapping and sometimes conflicting cultural boundaries; a reality of power distributed and often shared openly between police, criminals, terrorists, white-collar thieves, and politicians; and a reality of population growth, disease, refugee migrations and genocide; as well as soil and water scarcity.<br /> His bibliography is quite worthwhile, and helps make his personal reporting even more valuable. I have but one disappointment, and that is that this prolific author and policy commentator, a major force (indeed, the only continuous voice on foreign policy matters for The Atlantic Monthly), has failed to provide a concluding section that pulls it all together in an executive briefing suitable for policy consideration.  There are many valuable lessons and observations in this book, I recommend it highly, but I fear that the policy-makers who most desperately need to be educated will never, ever actually read the book.ng the realities of nations that exist (e.g. the Kurds) alongside states that continue to persecute and deny these nations a right to live.

This is one of those books.  While there are some giant leaps of faith and unexplained challenges to the author's central premises (e.g. after an entire chapter on why Athenian diversity was superior to Spartan selection, the catastophic loss of Athens to Sparta in 404 BC receives one sentence), this is a deep book whose detail requires careful absorbtion.<br /> I like this book and recommend it to everyone concerned with day to day thinking and information operations.  I like it because it off-sets the current fascination with the world-wide web and electronic connectivity, and provides a historical and biologically based foundation  for thinking about what Kevin Kelly and Stuart Brand set forth in the 1970's through the 1990's: the rise of neo-biological civilization and the concepts of co-evolution.<br /> There are a number of vital observations that are relevant to how we organize ourselves and how we treat diversity.  Among these:<br /> 1)The five major elements of global inter-species and inter-group network intelligence are the conformity enforcers; the diversity generators; the inner-judges; resource shifters; and inter-group tournaments.  You have to read the book to appreciate the breadth and value of how these work within all species from bacteria to homo sapiens.<br /> 2) Bacteria have extraordinary strategies for rapid-fire external information collection and exchange, quick-paced inventiveness, and global data sharing.  Species higher up on the evolutionary scale do not always retain these capabilities--they internalize capabilities while losing organic connectivity to others.<br /> 3) Imitative learning, while beneficial in general, can be extremely hazardous to inventiveness and adaptation.  This ties in with his wonderful discussion of reality as a shared hallucination--fully one half of a person's brain cells are killed off by culturally-driven framing.<br /> 4) Non-conformists--diversity generators--are absolutely vital to the survival of any species because they are &quot;option generators&quot;--but too often those in power (e.g. a corporate presidency that thinks it knows all it needs to know) will shut out and even ruin the very non-conformists it most needs to adapt to external challenges it does not understand.<br /> 5) Labor theories of productivity that exclude calculation of the time and enegy spent on information exchange are out-moded and counter-productive.  In this the author is greatly reinforced by Paul Strassmann's many books on Knowledge Capital (TM) and information productivity--we have the wrong metrics for evaluating individual information productivity, something Alan Greenspan saw early, but we also have the wrong metrics for evaluting *group* information productivity, something most have not figured out yet: it is called the &quot;virtual intelligence community&quot; or the &quot;world brain&quot;, and that is the next information revoluton.<br /> 6) World War III is here now, and it is an inter-species group tournament in which we are losing because we are not collecting and exchanging vital information fast enough.  The rampant continent-wide diseases (not just AIDS but the square of AIDS, malaria-anemia, tuberculosis, and hepatitis, best described by Robert D. Kaplan's works as well as Laurie Garrett) and the antibiotic-resistant (and freezer resistant) strains of toxic disease and disease carriers will kill most of us much sooner than a gun in the hands of a fellow man....unless we figure out that early warning, global coverage, and rapid response non-military surge intervention is vital to our survival.<br /> 7) Language as well as culture are killers of thought.  The author is compelling and fascinating as he discusses this in detail, comparing different language-cultural &quot;toolkits&quot; for concepts like the environment, alternative food sources, discipline options, and so on.<br /> 8) The author, who clearly has suffered some himself from being excluded or not taken seriously, is careful to discuss both the positive and the negative aspects of the &quot;conformity police&quot;--the conclusion I draw from his overall discussion is that we are seriously at risk, as humans in general but as Anglo-Saxons in particular, because the conformity police control all the resources (including National Science Foundation grants) and the iconoclasts are being shunned and starved.<br /> 9)The chapters on the kidnapping of the mass mind and how reality is a shared group hallucination draw ably on earlier works such as &quot;The Social Construction of Reality&quot;.  The author excels at discussing how a very small number of people--25,000 in the case of Hitler's takeover of Germany--can combine cultural conformity traits with a little terror and corruption to dominate much larger groups of otherwise intelligent beings.<br /> 10) Internal processing matters more than external collection.  I found this fascinating.  Kevin Kelly and Stuart Brand and others have led the way in earlier decades, but the author does a great job of pointing out how an effective learning machine has far more internal connections than external windows, and that in a &quot;hive mind&quot; what you do with what you know individually--in terms of sharing with others--is vastly more important than how much you as a single individual might know.<br /> I am not as upbeat as other reviewers about how this book suggests endless possibilities for a return to the perfect earth and inter-galactic migration.  If anything, I am fairly concerned that the bacteria will win this war and that it will be another human species, billions of years from today, that may finally get it right.  While we know everything we need to know to radically alter the manner in which we collect, process, and share information, our political conformity police and our economic robber barons are intent on keeping us stupid as a people in this generation.  Nothing stands between us and Howard Bloom's vision for bio-diverse salvation but our own inherent timidity, rigidity, and inertness--we are chained by old ideas and loath to explore new ones.  We prefer death by habit to life by choice.

This is arguably the single best and most elegant presentation for why our $30 billion a year intelligence industry must be turned upside down and shift resources away from secret satellite technology and toward analysis, analytic tools, and access to open sources of information.<br /> The author very correctly focuses on the fact that intelligence is about getting useful tailored information to the policy consumer, not about secrets per se.  He is perhaps the best spokesperson for the view that the old paradigm--collecting secrets at great expense about a single enemy--must be replaced by the new paradigm--making sense of vast quantities of information that is not secret and covers a diversity of constantly changing targets.  He correctly focuses on the selection and intelligent analysis of information rather than the collection of isolated secrets--on making the most of open information.<br /> The book is rich with anecdotal examples and makes a compelling case for dismantling the current intelligence stovepipes while simultaneously dismantling the culture of secrecy that prevents the sharing of useful information, not just within the Nation (e.g. with state and local law enforcement) but with coalition government and non-government allies of the moment.<br /> The author, a past Vice Chairman of the National Intelligence Council and a learned man with deep ties to Harvard, the Council on Foreign Relations, and RAND, concludes on a bitter-sweet note that demands Congressional and Presidential reflection.  He firmly believes that both the intelligence community budget and as much intelligence analysis as possible should be made public and be in the public service.  This book is highly recommended, and could-together with the the other intelligence reform books published in the past two years--reasonably be used as the starting point for a complete make-over of the U.S. Intelligence Community.nd be in the public service.

Kosovo, for example, could have been a $1 billion a year problem if acted upon wisely and early, instead it became a $5 billion a year problem. I like this book very much because it makes his deep insights available to everybody in a very readable, well-illustrated, and concise book.<br /> I strongly recommend this book because it offers the only thoughtful explanation I have ever seen on the conflict between the senior decision-maker's attention span (can only think about $50 billion problems) and the early warning that *is* available but cannot break through to the always over-burdened, sometimes arrogant, and rarely strategic top boss. In this regard, his book is a fine complement to the more historical work by Willard Matthias on &quot;America's Strategic Blunders.&quot;<br /> This book also offers solutions. It is a book that should be required reading for all field grade officers in all military services, as well as state and local governors and majors, university and hospital and other non-profit heads, and of course the captains of industry who spend billions, often unwisely, because they have not established a scouting system that can be heard at the highest levels *in time*. America, among many other nations and organizations, has a habit of ignoring its iconoclasts and mavericks--in an increasingly complex world where catastrophic combinations of failure are going to be more common, such ignorance will eventually become unaffordable and threatening to the national security as well as the national prosperity of those who persist in thinking about old problems in old ways.<br /> There is one other aspect of this book that merits strong emphasis: it focuses on human understanding and human engagement with the world, and makes it clear that technology has almost nothing to do with how well we cope with the external environment that defines our future. There aren't five people in the US government, to take one example, that adequately understand the rich intellectual history of Islam nor the core difference between the Islamic emphasis on knowledge integration as the core value and the Christian emphasis on love as the core value. The author of this book is one of America's foremost authorities on the Balkan conflict and the deep importance of historical and cultural understanding as part of current political and operational competency--we need 1000 more intelligence professionals just like him.

It documents in great detail a number of extremely serious mistakes on the part of U.S. policy makers from World War II through to Reagan years, while also recounting the history of how the Pentagon helped destroy CIA's independent assessments capability.<br /> Time and time again throughout this book one sees references to &quot;state of mind&quot; and &quot;mindset&quot;, and this is important.  The author has a very fine grasp of how debilitating ingrained mindsets can be--the military mindset that focuses on buying more and more high technology even though it is demonstrably irrelevant to our most urgent strategic needs; the policy mindset that emphasizes the need for a tangible &quot;main enemy&quot; even as we destroy the environment and ignore catastrophic diseases and failed states; and the intelligence mindset that values secrecy and blind loyalty over public disclosure and public service.<br /> I am especially impressed by the author's past responsibility for preparing the &quot;Estimate of the World Situation&quot;, and how compellingly he distinguishes between the great days when such estimates were both produced and consumed, and today's state of affairs, where only &quot;hard targets&quot; are the object of our obsession, and &quot;rest of the world&quot; is poorly addressed.<br /> The integrity of intelligence is a theme than runs throughout the book, and for that reason alone I recommend it for every policy and intelligence professionals' library.  There are also compelling insights and thoughtful quotes.<br /> The author's itemization of seven structural anomalies and states of mind that were present in World War II and can be seen today is worth abstracting here: 1.  Absolute commitment to unconditional surrender eliiminated possibilities for undermining Hitler from within; 2.  Allied command structure was not unified in fact; 3.  There were no functioning lines of communication between tactical military and tactical (field) intelligence units; 4.  Military leaders had a tactical intelligence state of mind, not a strategic intelligence state of mind, and were overly dependent on signals intelligence; 5.  Military leaders were absolutely committed to established plans and unwilling to deviate or consider alternatives even in the face of compelling intelligence; 6.  Moral self-righteousness and political naivete blinded Allied political and military leaders to the efforts of moderating forces in Germany ready to start an internal war; 7.  Concept of war shifted away from the Clausewitzian &quot;trinity&quot; toward a &quot;total war&quot; emphasizing societal destruction and victory at any cost.<br /> As his book goes on to document, these problems have been with us through the entire Cold War period, and have resulted in great waste of the taxpayer dollar as well as extraordinary risk of nuclear war with the Soviets during the 1980's when we played a very confrontational game with very limited policy level appreciation of just how desperate the Soviets might be.<br /> This is not a book that offers solutions or suggestions for improving the vitality of intelligence or the attention span of policy makers, but it is an excellent contribution to what one can only hope will eventually be a truly public debate about the need for restoring America's strategic intelligence analysis capabilities, and making both intelligence producers and intelligence consumers accountable for &quot;informed policy.&quot;cture was not unified in fact; 3.

Concept of war shifted away from the Clausewitzian &quot;trinity&quot; toward a &quot;total war&quot; emphasizing societal destruction and victory at any cost. <br /> As his book goes on to document, these problems have been with us through the entire Cold War period, and have resulted in great waste of the taxpayer dollar as well as extraordinary risk of nuclear war with the Soviets during the 1980's when we played a very confrontational game with very limited policy level appreciation of just how desperate the Soviets might be. <br /> This is not a book that offers solutions or suggestions for improving the vitality of intelligence or the attention span of policy makers, but it is an excellent contribution to what one can only hope will eventually be a truly public debate about the need for restoring America's strategic intelligence analysis capabilities, and making both intelligence producers and intelligence consumers accountable for &quot;informed policy.&quot; <br />	2001-07-04

The fact that it is four years old (older if one considers the intellectual gestation period), simply adds historical proof that its author is, as the Chinese have noted publicly, America's greatest strategist.<br /><br /> This book is written in plain English. That alone sets it apart from the next level down.  This is a carefully presented essay that makes eminent sense.  It deals with the most important region in the world: the troubled Eurasian land mass. Rich in resources, rife with ethnic conflict and water scarcity issues, it is surrounded by major powers with global ambitions: France and Germany to the West, Russia to the North, China to East, and Iran and Turkey to the South.  A number of clearly presented maps add considerable value to the book.<br /><br /> With a level of calm and reason that is rare in books of this sort, Brzezinski provides an understandable yet sophisticated articulation of a real-world \\"grand strategy\\" essential to the future of America in this new century.  His strategic vision honors both France and Germany as co-equal and vital elements of a new European community; shows how the larger Europe (ultimately co-equal to America) is essential to the salvation of Russia; makes the case for an American-Chinese strategic accommodation as the anchor for America's involvement in Eurasia; carefully integrates America's direct and special relations with Japan, Korea, and India as the bowl beneath China and Eurasia, and then concludes with decisive evaluations of the future importance of drawing Turkey into the European community while encouraging Iranian-Turkish collaboration and Iranian commercial and commodities channels from Eurasia out to the world.  In passing, the author validates Australia's new strategy of working closely with Indonesia to resolve the latter's many ethnic issues while establishing a southern line against excessive Chinese influence in the region.<br /><br /> There are numerous subtle and deep insights throughout the book, from the observation that war may now be a luxury only the poorest of nations can afford, to why China should consider America its natural ally and why Russia is at risk of becoming genetically Asian instead of European within a generation or two.  The author proposes a new Trans-Eurasian Security System (TESS) that engages Russia, China, Japan and America-one would assume that at some point Turkey, Iran, and the new Europe would be included.  The author gores a number a sacred oxen, including those associated with the demonization of Iran (this should end) and the exaggeration of China as a global threat (it will at best be a regional super-power at the high end of Third World per capita earnings).  While other poor Nations have defeated America decisively (Viet-Nam, for example), the author deliberately itemizes China's 3 million men under arms, it's 9,400 tanks and 5,224 fighters, as well as its 57 surface ships and 53 submarines, and offers his final judgment that China and America have too many common interests to permit a demonization of China to become a self-fulfilling prophecy, as it might if China were confronted across the board and denied its reasonable historical claim to having influence over the region that hosts the \\"Middle Kingdom.\\"<br /><br /> A special note is in order about the importance of this book as an antidote to two viral infections now afflicting many otherwise excellent thinkers.  This book is a marvelous, deeply grounded treatment of the historical constancy of strategy qua \\"enduring interests\\" and grand players-as much as one may wish to speculate about the globalization and localization of international politics, Brzezinski puts it all in a grand strategic context that is compelling in its logic as well as its understanding of the deep cultural threads that we must weave together if we are to survive one another's less enlightened machinations.  Anotherstrength of the book is its avoidance of the technophilia that has corrupted strategic thinking at the highest levels.  The Revolution in Military Affairs and the \\"systems of systems\\", while well-intentioned, are both devoid of serious strategic reasoning-as Colin Gray among others have pointed out, technology is not strategy, nor does it follow that strong technology will defeat an enemy with weak technology but a stronger strategic culture and the ability to wage war by means other than force on force.<br /><br /> This book, together with Colin Gray's \\"Modern Strategy\\", Robert Young Pelton's \\"World's Most Dangerous Places\\", the two books by Robert Kaplan on his travels in the Eurasian region, and both Michael Klare's book on \\"Resource Wars\\" as well as Marc de Villier's book on \\"Water: The Fate of Our Most Precious Resource\\", will make any intelligent person as conversant as they need to be with the most pressing geopolitical issues of our time.  If one adds Joe Thorton's book on Pandora's Poison, David Helvarg's book on \\"Blue Frontier: Saving America's Living Seas\\", Larrie Garrett's book \\"Betrayal of Trust: The Collapse of Global Public Health\\", and William Shawcross on \\"Deliver Us From Evil: Peacekeepers, Warlords, and a World of Endless Conflict\\", the lesser but still vital long-term issues of the environment, public health, and ethnic conflict will be fully appreciated.<br /><br />Edit of 28 Sep 08:  Disillusioned with the last gasp of \\"confront China and Russia on two fronts.

In a nutshell, the current approach divorces &quot;good science&quot; (code for permitting what you can't prove will kill the planet today) from social consciousness and good policy; and the current approach insists on studying risk one contaminant at a time, rather than as a whole.<br /> This book is persuasive; I believe author has the right stuff and should be consulted on major policy issues.  I believe the underlying moral values and intellectual arguments that this book makes, about both science and social policy, should be adopted by the Cultural Creatives and the independent voters of America, and that the recommendations of this book are so serious as to warrant country by country translations and promulgation.<br /> This book is exceptional in that is combines a readable policy essay for the non-technical citizen, with deeply documented technical appendices and notes that support a middle ground series of chapters relating scientific findings to long-term policy issues.<br /> From many small actions come revolutionary change--this book is a necessary brick in the road to environmental reform.  The bottom line is clear: every year more and more toxins are building up in our blood streams, and this is going to have an overwhelmingly negative impact on the humanity, capability, and survivability of our great grandchildren three generations down--we have not have grandchildren seven generations down if the insights from this book fail to reach the people, and through the people, the policy makers and legislators.ople, and through the people, the policy makers and legislators. <br />	2001-06-02

On the most positive side, it is the only, and therefore the best, treatment of the issues of citizenship that I could identify, and that is why I bought it.  The range of authoritative essays that have been brought together is very worthy, and anyone contemplating this topic must take this work into account.<br /> On the other hand, as I went through chapter after chapter, what I tended to see was an awful lot of academic whining about how the world is getting too complex and too multi-cultural to be able to pin someone down to just one citizenship, let them have many.  Reality check needed here.  Governments exist to preserve and protect very specific moral, ideological, and cultural values, and governments are the means by which a Republic finances what are called external diseconomies--those things that are needed for the common good but not profitable for the private sector to do.<br />  There are glimmers here and there of how one might better integrate new immigrants and otherwise promote good citizenship, but overall what this book is missing is a major commitment to thinking about how one draws the line between nationalized citizens truly loyal to their newly chosen nation-state, and those who choose to retain another primary citizenship and simply enjoy the bounty of the land they have chosen to VISIT....<br /> Of all the contributions, the one that stood out for me was by Adrian Favell, on \\"Integration Policy and Integration Research in Europe: A Review and Critique.\\"  Despite the title, the heart of this chapter concerns the information \\"sources and methods\\" that underlie conclusions about citizenship and the policies on citizenship.  There is a great deal of meat in this chapter, and it could useful guide the next book in what I hope will become a series.<br /> I like this book.  It forced me to think and it certainly opened my eyes to how we are letting a whole bunch of people debate the nature of citizenship without ever really being committed to the idea that an oath of loyalty is fundamental--as universal service should be fundamental, not to flesh out the military, but rather to provide a common foundation for knowing one another intimately, for respecting one another from that common ground.  How one defines citizenship is fundamental to the future of every nation--this book both enlightens and frightens.izenship without ever really being committed to the idea that an oath of loyalty is fundamental--as universal service should be fundamental, not to flesh out the military, but rather to provide a common foundation for knowing one another intimately, for respecting one another from that common ground.

What is lacks, though, is a good summary chapter that lists how the &quot;precautionary principle&quot; should be applied across each of the top ten environmental areas of concern--something that could circulate more easily than the book, and perhaps have a beneficial policy impact at the local, state, and national levels--and I suggest this because the meat of the book is good, it needs an executive summary.<br /> The chapter that was most meaningful to me, the one that I think needs to be migrated into business education, international affairs education, science &amp; technology policy education, is by Gordon K. Durnil, Chapter 16, and it deal with &quot;How Much Information Do We Need Before Exercising Precaution.&quot;  This is a brilliant piece of work that dissects our current environmental policy information collection, processing, and analysis system, and finds it very deceptive, disingenuous, and consequently seriously flawed.<br /> For the best on the environment, read &quot;Pandora's Poison&quot;.  For the best on public health, read &quot;Betrayal of Trust.&quot;  For a very fine cross-over book that has good chapters from various good people, this is the book to buy and enjoy.	2001-06-02

And I don't see this book impacting on people the way \\"IMAGINE\\" or \\"Cultural Creatives\\" can impact--but if you have the time and the intellectual curiosity to go deep, this is a very engaging book that will take a long time to fully appreciate.	2001-06-02

Bearing in mind that this book made the cut from hundreds that I could have bought and read, and it made the second more rigorous cut to be reviewed, these comments should be taken as they are intended: this is a super book that got screwed up by the publisher and a lack of decent editorial guidance.  It should be fixed in the second edition, and I hope it gets to a second edition.  Given the author's clearly superior access to and understanding of the individual personalities and organizational players across America, I am really stunned and disappointed that there is not an appendix to the book listing all of these, with contact information and URLs.<br /> There is so much solid, worthwhile information in this book, including valuable insights in why Western political interests are undermining proper representation of our national oceans, coasts, and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in Congress, that I would urge those interested in the oceans (hugely more important to our future than the Amazon or globla forestry, just to make the point), to buy this book, suffer its limitations, and ultimately benefit from the wisdom and experience of the author, for whom my respect is unqualified and whole-hearted.  In passing, it would probably be helpful if the first thing we all demanded was that EEZ stand for Exclusive Environmental Zone, rather than treating the oceans as a for-profit target area.<br /> There is one other information-related observation I would make that emerged from reading this book: both the United Nations and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are clearly doing heroic and deeply important work vital to the future of the oceans--and they are doing a terrible job of communicating the basic information about the oceans and their work to the larger world of voters and concerned citizens.  What really came home to me as I reflected on what to emphasize in this review is that there is a very wide, almost impenetratable, barrier between what the UN and NOAA know, and what is being communicated to the citizens who have the right to know (they paid for that information with their tax dollars) and the need to know and the desire to know.  From this I would say  that the next big step for those who would seek to save the oceans, is to demand that all UN and US Government information paid for by the taxpayer be put online henceforth, available at no further cost to the public.  It is this information, the bullets and beans of the information war between corporate and citizen interests, that will decide the future of the oceans.they are doing a terrible job of communicating the basic information about the oceans and their work to the larger world of voters and concerned citizens.

Especially interesting to me were the technical topics (part III), not because I care about technical, but because they addressed the core global issues that have not yet been resolved and must be resolved if international peer-to-peer is to become the new new thing: metadata, performance, trust, accountability, reputation, security, and interoperability through gateways.<br /> The directory of peer-to-peer projects at the end of the book is really helpful--80 distinct projects are listed in 15 different categories--disappointingly, the editors chose not to do the courtesy homework of providing current contact information including a URL for each one, so thousands of people will have to duplicate that homework, a gross violation of the fundamental peer-to-peer ethic....one time data entry, universal access.<br /> This book is especially valuable to those following the early days of Ray Ozzie and the Groove Networks roll-out.  As one who is an enthusiastic early adopter, and who believes that NSA needs to get out of the way and let them export the full value of their security, I see this book as the &quot;first edition&quot; guide to peer-to-peer, and I agree with the reviewer from Norway: we now need the &quot;sons of&quot; books and products that address the meta-data and other technical issues that are touched on by this first really excellent overview book.	2001-06-02

He applies his social science frames of reference to discuss secrecy as a form of regulation and secrecy as a form of ritual, both ultimately resulting in a deepening of the inherent tendency of bureaucracy to create and keep secrets-secrecy as the cultural norm. His historical overview, current right up to 1998, is replete with documented examples of how secrecy may have facilitated selected national security decisions in the short-run, but in the long run these decisions were not only found to have been wrong for lack of accurate open information that was dismissed for being open, but also harmful to the democratic fabric, in that they tended to lead to conspiracy theories and other forms of public distancing from the federal government. He concludes: &quot;The central fact is that we live today in an Information Age. Open sources give us the vast majority of what we need to know in order to make intelligent decisions. Decisions made by people at ease with disagreement and ambiguity and tentativeness. Decisions made by those who understand how to exploit the wealth and diversity of publicly available information, who no longer simply assume that clandestine collection-that is, 'stealing secrets'-equals greater intelligence. Analysis, far more than secrecy, is the key to security....Secrecy is for losers.&quot;	2001-06-01

I like this book because as we all deal with the information explosion, it provides some important clues regarding what messages will &quot;get through&quot;, and what we need to do to increase the chances that our own important messages reach out to others.<br /> This book is in some ways a modern version of Kuhn's &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.&quot;  While more of a story than a thesis, there is a great deal here that tracks with some of the more advanced information theory dissertations, and the book could reasonably be subtitled &quot;The Precipitants of Social Revolutions.&quot;<br /> The most subtle message in this book is that substance is not vital--perception is.  The contagiousness of the idea, the life-altering potential of the smallest ideas, and the fact that revolutionary change is always cataclysmic rather than evolutionary, will frustrate those who think that years of intellectual exploration will be rewarded with acceptance.<br /> However, despite the revolutionary nature of the final &quot;tipping point&quot;, there is actually a clear path taking up to 25 years, from the Innovators to the Early Adopters, to the Early Majority, to the Late Majority.  My sense is that America today, with its 50 million Cultural Creatives, is about to cross over from the Early Adopters to the Early Majority stage, and will do so during the forthcoming Congressional elections when we see a rise in Independents and more attention to energy and other alternative sustainable lifestyle issues--hence, this book is relevant to anyone who either wants to promote a shift in America or elsewhere away from consumerism (or who wants to go on selling consumerism), or who wants to seriously revisit what many would call the failed strategies of the early environmentalist, human rights, and corporate accountability advocates.<br /> The book ends on an irresistably upbeat note--change is posssible, people can radically transform their beliefs for the common good in the face of the right kind of impetus.  Each of us has a role to play, whether as a Connector, a Maven, a Salesman, or a Buyer, and our role will not be defined in rational terms, but rather in social terms.  In many ways, this book is about the restoration of community and the importance of relationships, and it is assuredly relevant to anyone who thinks about &quot;the common good.&quot;t, human rights, and corporate accountability advocates. <br /> The book ends on an irresistably upbeat note--change is posssible, people can radically transform their beliefs for the common good in the face of the right kind of impetus.

His footnotes are quite satisfactory and strike a very fine balance--unusually good--between policy, military, and academic or industry sources.<br /> Sadly, I believe that this book, as with Laurie Garrett's book on the collapse of public health, will be ignored by the ...Administration, which appears to have decided that real war is only between states, that energy is something to be increased, not moderated in use, and that real men do not concern themselves with ethnic conflict, small wars, or scarcity of any sort in the Third World.<br /> As I reflect on this book, and its deep discussion of the details of existing and potential resources wars (it includes a very fine illustrative appendix of oil and natural gas conflicts, all current), I contemplate both my disappointment that the author and publisher did not choose to do more with geospatial visualization--a fold out map of the world with all the points plotted in color would have been an extraordinary value--and the immediate potential value of adding the knowledge represented by this book on resources and the Garrett book on public health threats--to the World Conflict & Human Rights Map 2000 published by PIOOM at Leiden University in The Netherlands.<br /> What I really like about this book is its relevance, its authority, its utility.  What I find frustrating about this book is that it is, like all books, an isolated fragment of knowledge that cannot easily be integrated and visualized.  How helpful it would be, if US voters could see a geographic depiction of the world showing all that the author of this excellent work is trying to communicate, and on the same geographic depiction, see the military dollars versus the economic assistance dollars that the U.S. is or is not investing.  The results would be shocking and could lead to political action as the community level, for what is clear to me from this book is that there is a huge disconnect between the real threat, our national security policies, and how we actually spend our foreign affairs, defense, and trade dollars from the taxpayers' pockets.<br /> A trillion dollar tax cut, or a trillion dollar investment in deterrence through investments in natural resource stabilization and extension?  Which would be of more lasting value to the seventh generation of our children?

Extremely big scoop.  Israel attacked U.S. military personnel aboard the USS Liberty with the intent of simulating an Egyptian attack on US forces that would permit a joint US and Israeli retaliation.  Even after the ship was destroyed, with very clear evidence from NSA tapes that the Israeli's deliberately attacked a US ship while the ship was flying US colors, President Johnson is reported to have betrayed his military and his Nation by covering this up, intimidating all survivors, and saying he would &quot;not embarrass our allies.&quot; In consultation with my naval colleagues, I am satisfied that the author has it right.<br /> #2. US SIGINT failed as North Korea invaded South Korea.  Our lack of preparedness, in both systems and linguists, was dereliction of duty at the highest levels. Fast forward to Sudan, East Timor, Burundi, Yugoslavia, Somalia, and Haiti.<br /> #3.  US &quot;Operations Security&quot; (OPSEC) is terrible!  Bad in World War II, bad in Korea, bad in Viet-Nam, bad in Somalia and bad today.  This book is a stark and compelling indictment of the incompetence of U.S. military and political leaders who refuse to recognize that the rest of the world is smart enough to collect our signals and predict our intentions with sufficient effectiveness to neutralize our otherwise substantial power.<br /> #4. Eisenhower, as President, controlled the U-2 operations over Russia and lied to the world and the people about his individual responsibility for those missions.<br /> #5.  US SIGINT failed in Arabia and against Israel.  &quot;The agency had few Arabic or Hebrew linguists and it was not equipped to eavesdrop on British, French, or Israeli military communications.&quot;  We are often unable to sort out the truth in conflicts between Arabs and Israel, and this allows Israel to deceive and manipulate American policy makers.<br /> #6.  In the early years of the Cold War, the US was the aggressor, and ran incredibly prevocational full bombing runs into northern Russia, simply to test for defenses and to see if it could be done.  Young American military personnel were sent as expendable cannon fodder, with the ultimate result that Russia spent billions more on its defenses than it might have if America have been a &quot;good neighbor.&quot;<br /> #7. The Joint Chiefs of Staff was &quot;out of control&quot; during our confrontations with Cuba, and proposed to the President of the United States that U.S. military capabilities be used to murder Americans in order to provide a false cover for declaring war on Cuba.<br /> #8. The most senior military officers serving under Kennedy did not have the moral courage to tell him that the Bay of Pigs was a doomed operation.  They allowed hundreds to die and be captured rather than &quot;speak truth to power.&quot;  NSA provided ample SIGINT.<br /> #9.  Imagery intelligence beat signals intelligence in answering the ultimate question about the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba.  Those who practice &quot;OPSEC&quot; can defeat our SIGINT capabilities.<br /> #10.  US telecommunications companies have for years been giving NSA copies of all telegrams sent by foreign embassies and corporations, compromsing their private sector integrity.<br /> #11.  US military power is hollow.  For both the USS Liberty and the USS Pueblo, a combination of screw-ups put military personnel in harms' way and a combination of incapacities helped get them killed and captured.  In all of Korea only six U.S. aircraft were available to help protect the USS Pueblo, and they required several hours to get ready.  The South Koreans, ready to launch defense forces instantly, were forbidden to do so, US leaders being more concerned about avoiding provocation of the North Koreans than about protecting U.S. military personnel.<br /> #12. US successes against the Russians and other targets were completely offset by the combination of the John Walker betrayal (turning over the key lists, this has been known) and the Soviet receipt from the Vietnamese (this has not been known) of a complete warehouse of NSA code machines left behind in Saigon.  The Soviets have been reading our mail since 1975, and NSA did not want the President or Congress or the people to know this fact.<br /> #13.  The North Vietnamese beat us on SIGINT, with 5000 trained SIGINT personnel and a system that stretched from Guam (where the B-52's were launched and the ground crew radios were in the clear) to the day-to-day operational orders going out to helicopters and fighters &quot;in the clear&quot;.  The book paints an extraordinarily stark contrast between North Vietnamese competence and US incompetence across all areas of SIGINT and OPSEC.<br /> #14.  There are others, but the final scoop is summed up in the author's concluding chapter on NSA's race to build the largest fastest computer at a time when relevant signals are growing exponentially: &quot;Eventually NSA may secretly achieve the ultimate in quickness, compatibility, and efficiency-a computer with petaflop and higher speeds shrunk into a container about a liter in size, and powered by only about ten watts of power: the human brain.&quot;capabilities. <br /> #10.

This book is designed for the citizen-reader worried about the future of the Republic. It is both easy to read and necessary to read--a very articulate and comprehensive starting point for devising new law appropriate to the 21st century. I recall Mike Nelson, the author assistant to then Senator Gore in the crafting of the National Information Infrastructure legislature, talking about the frustration of trying to manage 1990's technology with 1950's law. This book, and its author, represent the first decent intelligent brief I have seen connecting the first principles of our Constitution and our Supreme Court interpretations, with the realities of this century's information technology and the threat of chaos in cyberspace.<br />Gems abound. From the author's deep understanding of the dangers of undocumented computer code that contains pre-planned censorship and routing and privacy violation hooks, to his understanding of the need for diversity filters that expose one to contrasting viewpoints, to his discussion of emerging solutions from deliberative opinion polling (includes intelligence) to constructive URL linkages to the dangers of .coms over-whelming .orgs and .edus, this book is the best single lecture in the literature I have read in the past ten years--certainly important to the future of democracy in an electronic age.<br />The author concludes with a discussion of six reform possibilities, including deliberative domains; required disclosure by communications firms; voluntary self-regulation; economic subsidies for democracy-beneficial content and websites; \\"must carry\\" rules on *popular* websites (one might include pornographic websites) in the form of links designed to nurture exposure to substantive questions; and \\"must carry\\" rules on divisive highly-partisan websites in the form of links to contrasting views.<br />The book includes excellent biographical notes suggesting other readings, has strong and interesting footnotes, and a good index. This is an intelligent, moral, civic book.<br />The author renders us all a major service in bringing forth our foundational thinking--Mill on the importance of humans being exposed to the diversity of the human experience; Dewey on the infantile state of social knowledge, Brandeis on how public discussion is a political duty and that the greatest menace to liberty is an inert people--examining the current and projected legal and moral and social Internet and information trends--and suggesting how good law might yet lead to good results.<br /> At 202 pages, pocketbook size despite its hard cover, this is a well-developed contribution to the great conversation that should be owned and read by anyone who cares to speculate on the future of the Republic. Seriously powerful stuff--and an ideal gift to include when you write a check to your elected representatives.ed censorship and routing and privacy violation hooks, to his understanding of the need for diversity filters that expose one to contrasting viewpoints, to his discussion of emerging solutions from deliberative opinion polling (includes intelligence) to constructive URL linkages to the dangers of .coms over-whelming .orgs and .edus, this book is the best single lecture in the literature I have read in the past ten years--certainly important to the future of democracy in an electronic age. <br />The author concludes with a discussion of six reform possibilities, including deliberative domains; required disclosure by communications firms; voluntary self-regulation; economic subsidies for democracy-beneficial content and websites; \\"must carry\\" rules on *popular* websites (one might include pornographic websites) in the form of links designed to nurture exposure to substantive questions; and \\"must carry\\" rules on divisive highly-partisan websites in the form of links to contrasting views. <br />The book includes excellent biographical notes suggesting other readings, has strong and interesting footnotes, and a good index.

One sees both the heroism and the futility of United Nations activities.  Sadly, whereas the Texas Rangers might have gotten away with sending one great man to handle a major crisis, the United Nations, sending one great man and an assistant, is decades behind the times in terms of understanding what it is about and how to obtain results in today's world.<br /> The lessons from Burundi summarized by the author at the end of the book are an excellent conclusion:<br /> Problem Area #1:  Shortcomings in UN Machinery and Culture, including no intelligence gathering and analysis; weak institutional memory; lack of accountability; and luxury and inefficiency.<br /> Problem Area #2: Overreliance on Military Intervention<br /> Problem Area #3: Unintended Consequences of Humanitarian Assistance<br /> This book left me with a profound respect for the people that work for the United Nations, and with a continuing profound distrust and disrespect for the United Nations as an entity.  It is not working.  It needs a complete make-over, and one wonders if the time has not come for a new international gathering of governments and non-governmental organizations, to conceptualize a completely fresh start that harnesses distributed resources spanning the full range from civil economic assistance to police protection and training, to violent military intervention.<br /> Let me say this again: this is a very good book, it is only for the best and the brightest, and it calls into question the entire United Nations structure and management.  Instead of paying our dues to the United Nations, instead of Ten Turner giving them a billion dollar tax avoidance contribution, we should probably create a new international Fund for Peace that uses the Internet and the network effect to nurture &quot;many small acts&quot; instead of one large industrial-age monstrosity called the United Nations.et and the network effect to nurture &quot;many small acts&quot; instead of one large industrial-age monstrosity called the United Nations. <br />	2001-04-08

This book is not for them.<br /> What this book does, in a very nice way that reminds one of Drucker's belief that the best work is work as a &quot;calling&quot;--work as a beloved endeavor that brings out the best we have to offer--or of the 7 Habits book that emphasizes the urgency of protecting those activities that are important but not urgent (things like family time, exercise, and freedom from the telephone--or now, email)--is &quot;review the bidding&quot; on five different workstyles, and how to make them better.<br /> In a nutshell, this book is what results when Myers-Briggs and 7 Habits have children, and the children grow up to be artists.  It is a good read, and at a minimum it will help *anybody* bring more reflection and more peace back into their daily work routine.	2001-04-08
2063754:US	50761804	R3JLTQFO755Q9X	0750671858	997342783	Developing Knowledge-Based Client Relationships: The Future of Professional Services (Knowledge Reader)	Books	5	43	47	N	Y	Deceptively Simply, Seriously Valuable	A great deal of work went into conceptualizing and crafting this book, and I give very high marks to the author, who does a really superb job of integrating insights from knowledge management, information technology, cognitive modeling, and client relationship or account management.  This book makes the jump from airplane reading, to &quot;hold and read several times more.&quot;<br /> At the heart of the book, and many appear to miss this on the first reading, is the author's distinction between commoditized information services and differentiated information services.  The first, aided by automation, is on a downward spiral in terms of both value and pricing, and competition is fierce.  The second, partially aided by automation but ultimately being unique for rising to a higher level of knowledge service delivery that can only be done by expert humans, is where value pricing and differentiation can be found, and where professional services need to go if they are to remain profitable.<br /> The second urgent and valuable insight the author shares with us is the co-evolutionary nature of a service that evolves through constant knowledge transfer to the client and constant co-creation of new knowledge as the competitive advantage; and a very deep and broad relationship with the client at all levels of both organizations.  One leads to the other, the other leads to finding new business with the same client, and the cycle repeats itself.  This insight is especially relevant to all those who are using information technology to force single human account managers to handle more and more accounts remotely, all the while &quot;losing touch&quot; with their clients for lack of time to make the personal visit or personal telephone call.  This is also explicitly contrary to the prevailing &quot;black box&quot; model where knowledge is withheld as proprietary--the author makes it clear that in this new era, withheld knowledge is much less valuable and much less survivable--this is a dying model.<br /> Among the sections of the book that I found especially worthwhile, partly for their elegance of expression and partly because they represent a considerable professionalism in distilling vast arrays of writing by others, were those that itemized the seven processes for adding value to the client relationship by adding converting information into knowledge (filtering, validation, analysis, synthesis, presentation, ease of access and use, customization); the rare simplicity of the distinction between implicit and explicit knowledge and how to communicate both kinds of knowledge; the brief but sufficient discussion of four key humans in the loop: the senior representative, the relationship coordinator, the knowledge specialist, and the knowledge customer; and the more general discussion of the various means for communicating knowledge value to the client, both in terms of channels and in terms of events including scenarios and wargaming.<br /><br />Contrary to the publicity, this is not a case study book, although the several &quot;gray block&quot; inserts are both helpful and credible.  This book is an executive primer for managing value in the 21st Century, and it merits several readings, not one.<br /> Where the book falls short, and it may be that this is deliberate and better left for another book, is in the section on pricing knowledge services.  Despite a fine summary of the kinds of pricing that are used, from time and materials (both the predominant means and the least profitable) to retainer to contingency to commissions and tenders, one is left feeling that neither the author nor his otherwise excellent sources have really come to grips with the fact that clients are still mired in an industrial-age financial mindset that values fixed goods and is not yet ready to pay for intangible knowledge goods.  My own research suggests that fully half of the competition for knowledge professionals comes from client middle managers and senior sales or production experts who believe that they know everything they need to know to make good decisions--the other half comes from niche providers of very fragmented services, from the aggregators of online information (Factiva, Lexis-Nexis, DIALOG) to the market research firms (FIND/SVP, Fuld, SIS) to private investigative groups (Arkin, Kroll, IGI) to academic consultants (Harvard, UT) to localized information brokers listed in the Burwell Directory...and many many other sources including commercial imagery and Russian military maps of third world regions that most knowledge specialists--as well as their clients--overlook completely.  Somewhere in all this mix, the big accounting and legal firms are trying to leverage their access to clients by becoming portals to global knowledge, and they are *not* delivering the integrated value they should--a value that can only come when the author's wisdom becomes conventional, and every professional services person knows how to define the question, discover and validate the sources, discriminate and distill the many sources into a value-added compelling presentation, and do so in timely easy to use fashion.<br /> Some will be deceived by the very easy to read and well-organized sections into thinking this book is slightly superficial.  That is not the case.  This is a very well researched book that represents enormous value-added because the author has creatively distilled and organized at least four separate literatures, and done so in a fashion that will repay multiple readings of the book by the new standard: at least twice the value of your time taken for each reading.s and senior sales or production experts who believe that they know everything they need to know to make good decisions--the other half comes from niche providers of very fragmented services, from the aggregators of online information (Factiva, Lexis-Nexis, DIALOG) to the market research firms (FIND/SVP, Fuld, SIS) to private investigative groups (Arkin, Kroll, IGI) to academic consultants (Harvard, UT) to localized information brokers listed in the Burwell Directory...and many many other sources including commercial imagery and Russian military maps of third world regions that most knowledge specialists--as well as their clients--overlook completely.

2064800:US	50761804	RONQFF79MXH59	0609604678	581971925	The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People Are Changing the World	Books	5	112	120	N	Y	Not Yet a Movement, But Showing Serious Potential	Edit of 11 Sep 08 to add links.<br /><br />This book should be read together with [[ASIN:0451204697 Imagine: What America Could be in the 21st century]], edited by Marianne Williamson.  Taken together, the two books are inspirational while still being practical.<br /><br />Cultural Creatives as a book, and some of the other reviews, tend to over-sell the success of the emergence of an alternative lifestyle to Traditionalists (stereotyped as somewhat red neckish and religious rightists) and Moderns (stereotyped as ravish the earth anything-goes corporate carpetbaggers).  The reality is that there are as many \\"cultural creatives\\" as there are people with disabilities in the United States--50 million.  Not one quarter of the population, as one reviewer claims.<br /><br />Having said that, by way of somber stage-setting, I cannot say enough good things about this book.  It should be required reading for every citizen, every student, and every public official.  In a very real sense, this book strikes me as a truly seminal work that could help millions of individuals reframe their personal connection to one another, to their Republic, and to the earth.<br /><br />This is neither a tree-hugger book nor a mantras R us book.  This book provides a thoughtful review of how different movements--first the environmental movement, then the human rights movement, and finally the consciousness movement--have come together to define an alternative lifestyle and alternative paradigm for political and economic and social relationships in the larger context of a sustainable \\"whole\\" earth.<br /><br />I found this book motivational and meaningful at both a personal level and a larger national level.  At the personal level, its detailed and well-organized description of fifteen very distinct aspects of a \\"cultural creative\\" lifestyle helped me understand--as it has helped many others--that there is actually a category of people who have come to grips with and found solutions that enrich their lives--and this explains my great disappointment that the book does not offer a \\"resources\\" section at the end.  I would have been very glad to discover, for example, a \\"Cultural Creative\\" journal or magazine that combined a strong book review section, art and culture, a consumer reports section tailored to the higher standards of the \\"CCs\\", new innovations in home restoration and remodeling, vacation options known to be attractive to CCs, etcetera.<br /><br />At the higher political level, I found the book constructive and just this side of a tipping point.  An increasing number of people, all of them generally outside of Washington and not associated with Wall Street, clearly have some strong positive values and a real commitment to achieving reform through \\"many small actions\\".  What this group has lacked is a means of communicating and orchestrating itself on a scale sufficient to demand respect from politicians and corporation.  The Internet now provides such a vehicle--and as the Internet explodes from 3.5M people worldwide to 3.5B people worldwide, in the next ten years, I am convinced that Cultural Creatives may finally come into their own as a new form of global political party.  Cultural Creatives would sign the Kyoto Treaty (and know what it is); Cultural Creatives would demand a 100% increase--from a half-penny a dollar to a full penny a dollar--in America's foreign diplomatic and humanitarian assistance budget--and Cultural Creatives could conceivably give the Republican Party a real beating in the next Congressional elections if President Bush persists in breaking his campaign vow on reducing carbon emissions.  A peaceful revolution in our national agenda may truly be a near-term reality.<br /><br />This is not a book where a summary can do it justice.  It needs to be experienced at an individual level and ideally also at a community level, where it could be understood and accepted as a common point of reference for individual choosing to live \\"inrelation\\" to one another and to the world, at a level much higher and more satisfying than our current arrangements.

It is not.  It is practical (and political), it is enriching, and it is over-all a very high quality endeavor that has been well executed.<br /> Four &quot;great truths&quot; are articulated many times over across the various readings, and they merit listing here:<br /><br /> 1)  Campaign finance reform is the absolute non-negotiable first step that must precede every other reform.  Until the people can reassert their great common sense for the common good, and restore the true democratic tradition, nothing else will happen.<br /> 2)  Neighborhoods are the bedrock of both democracy and sustainable development, and we have spent fifty years building in the wrong direction.  New legal and economic incentives must be found to redirect both urban and suburban real estate management back in the direction of self-contained neighborhoods.<br /> 3)  Local production of everything, from electricity to food to major goods like automobiles) appears to be a pre-requisite for deconflicting high quality of life needs from limited resource availability.  The book includes several very intelligent discussions of how this might come about.<br /> 4)  Networking makes everything else possible, and by this the book means electronic networking.  I was especially fascinated by some of the examples of near-real-time sharing that electronic networking makes possible--everything from a neighborhood car to scheduled hand-me-downs of winter coats from one family to another.  We have not progressed one mile down the road of what the Internet makes possible at a personal and neighborhood level, and I would recommend this book for that perspective alone.<br /> The creative editorial role must be applauded.  From the identification and recruitment of the contributors, to the selection of the photographs that each tell their own story, to the quality of the paper used to create the book, all testify to the competence and knowledge of the editor.<br /> Lastly, it merits comment that the book serves as a very fine calling card from something called The Global Renaissance Alliance, a spiritually-oriented group that nurtures Citizens Circles and uses a web site to provide pointers to resources and other like-minded folk.e contributors, to the selection of the photographs that each tell their own story, to the quality of the paper used to create the book, all testify to the competence and knowledge of the editor. <br /> Lastly, it merits comment that the book serves as a very fine calling card from something called The Global Renaissance Alliance, a spiritually-oriented group that nurtures Citizens Circles and uses a web site to provide pointers to resources and other like-minded folk.	2001-03-18

It does not have a technical or a financial side and this was disappointing.  It would have been more useful to have a book that fully integrated human, technical, and financial success stories and failure stories to present an integrated picture of collaborative work principles in a global economy using the Internet as the backbone for collaborative work.<br /> The book is well-written, the figures are useful, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to sit quietly on an airplane and think about the authors' subtitle: why links between business units often fail, and how to make them work.	2001-02-24

Their cute &quot;tell a story&quot; and equally cute advice to have big boxes for customer stories in the forms provided for input, simply do not cut it with me.<br /> This book is a 5 for the one great idea, a 2 for beating the idea to death, a 3 for presentation, and a 4 overall because it was just good enough to keep me reading to the last page.	2001-02-24

Books	3	5	6	N	N	Written In 60 Days, and Reader Suffers Pain	One of a few books I bought in an airport bookstore rather than on amazon, my first thought is that the amazon process really does help--this book is flashy enough to get one to buy it on the fly, but probably would not survive in open competition when alternatives are easily visible in an electronic bookstore.<br /> The author notes that the book was written in 60 days.  It shows, and the reader is the one that suffers.  I have no doubt that the author, an attractive person by the photo, is a wonderful speaker with many insights to offer.  The book, however, is not well laid-out and one has the feeling that 100 different briefings have been sorted into chapter files and dumped into the book.  What couldn't be fit into the text was turned into sidebar or text figure.<br /> The book includes a CD-ROM I will never use, as well as a URL for a web address I will never visit.  I would rather they had put the money into better editing, more white space, and a much better structure for the book.<br /> My bottom line: the book should not be ignored, but I would recommend that the executive interested in these concepts have a strong younger manager of promise read this as one of 3-4 other similar books, and distill all of them into a ten page memo.	2001-02-24

I am especially impressed by the CISCO rules for successful acquisitions, by the CISCO distinctions between core competencies and outsourced manufacturing, and by the CISCO implementation of its enterprise information system and related web sales and service sites.<br /> As for the future, I agree with John Chambers that telephone calls will be free in the future.  Arthur Clarke said this 20 years ago.  Chambers' vision for a global multi-service (voice and data) offering that easily integrates wireless, fiber-optic, and other forms of transmission is inevitable, but CISCO is not necessarily pre-ordained as the dominant enterprise.<br /> Corporate and national information strategies must have four components: connectivity, content, coordination of standards and investments, and communications/computing security.  CISCO, as described by the book, has a superficial interest in encryption but does not really understand the urgency of establishing &quot;deep encryption&quot; that is embedded in all data (including data in storage) and unencumbered by the retarded US and European policies seeking to give their spies an easy back door to use.<br /> CISCO also appears to be overlooking two major opportunities for future expansion: first, in leading a much broader coordination of standards such as transparent and stable Application Program Interfaces (API) that would permit the remote integration of applications and multi-media data; and second, in exploring all aspects of data classification, indexing, and visualization, both in terms of data access and automated filtering, and in terms of pattern analysis across the network.<br /> There are so many over-hyped books on the Internet Revolution that I found this book to be a real pleasure.

The author shows a clear connection between existing global problems (ethnic violence, water scarcity, pollution, poverty, criminalization of society) and the earlier Western decisions to adopt scientific objectivity (with all of its inherent bias and ignorance) as well as the primacy of economic institutions such as have given rise to the consumerist society, regardless of the external diseconomies, the concentrations of ill-gotten wealth, and the cost to the earth resource commons.  The author is especially strong on the need to restore sprituality, consciousness, and values to the decision-making and information-sharing architecture of the world--only in this way could community be achieved across national and ethnic and class lines, and only in this way could environmental sustainability and justice (economic, social, and cultural) be made possible.  This is not a &quot;tree hugger&quot; book as much as it is a &quot;master's class&quot; for those who would be master's of the universe.  It is a very fine portal into the growing body of people who wish to be cultural creatives, and easily one of the guideposts toward the next major paradigm shift, away from scientific materialism and toward a new communitas in which people really matter.	2001-02-11

In honor of Eugene Garfield, arguably the most influential man in the sociology of knowledge in this century or any other, the book provides a wonderful collection of *methodological* articles about the bibliometrics and indicators associated with charting who quotes whom and what does it mean in terms of influence within and among nations, organizations, schools of thought, and individual cabals.<br /> I was intrigued to find that the book, perhaps because it is so original and represents the first book-length collection of its kind, did not include an article on a topic near and dear to my heart, that is, developing algorithms to identify anomalies in citation such that one can weed out those who are citing one another simply to &quot;beat the game.&quot;  As citation analysis becomes a more mainstream means of measuring intellectual contributions (it is still not mainstream--too many otherwise talented intelligence community managers of analysts have no clue it exists), some form of citation validation and policing will be needed.<br /> There are three other areas where I would say that this book is a vital and valuable foundation, and desperately in need of three distinct sequel publications:<br /> First, we need to migrate the value of citation analysis to the Internet, not only to electronic journals but to citations of self-published papers on web sites as well as to informed observations in expert forums.  Neither the classification schema nor the industry standards for making this possible exist today.  I would go so far as to suggest that a new Internet standards committee dedicated to this specific issue should be created, immediately.<br /> Second, an analagous situation exists with those experts who are not permitted to publish in the open literature, but who are very well known by virtue of their title, organizational affiliation, participation in conferences, or classified work revealed to a very few.  As the core competency of government becomes the nurturing of national knowledge--not only in science and technology but also in all international as well as domestic matters--some form of citation analysis process must be developed that makes these experts (or if not expert, then influentials by virtue of their position at the international, national, state/provincial, or local levels) and their counterparts in non-governmental organizations (e.g. Red Cross, World Bank, elements of the United Nations) readily identifiable.  The Internet, and the public availability of email communication pattern analysis information that does not intrude on the substantive privacy of electronic communications, may possible be helpful here.<br /> Third, and finally, we come to the area of interest that originally led to my purchasing this book, which is that of actually identifying centers of excellence and &quot;portals&quot; into the entire range of published and unpublished knowledge on any given topic.  Such a sequel publication must not only document, in an evolutionary or &quot;living&quot; way, who the top 100 people are across every social science and science topic, but also the top 25 institutions with deliberate distinctions between Asian, Americas, European, and African centers of excellence.  The Institute of Scientic Information (ISI) has been unwilling to do this as an internal investment, and has not heard from enough governments and corporations to warrant its moving aggressively to create what I would regard as an extraordinarily valuable and relevant guide for all manner of investments and improvements in international, national, and state-based research and education.  I would go so far as to say that such a guide, such a service of common concern, would go a very long way toward making possible extraordinary new means of leveraging distributed intellectual resources, lowering the cost of seminal research, and introducing new forms of transnational collaborative work.<br /> Garfield, and citation analysis and all those who have built on Garfield's work, together represent the first mile in a hundred mile journey toward creating the &quot;World Brain&quot; that H.G. Wells, among a select few, has envisioned.  There is much yet to be done.g distributed intellectual resources, lowering the cost of seminal research, and introducing new forms of transnational collaborative work. <br /> Garfield, and citation analysis and all those who have built on Garfield's work, together represent the first mile in a hundred mile journey toward creating the &quot;World Brain&quot; that H.G.

It was a good choice.  The author captures the essence of many other books as well as real-world experience with two fundamental points that every manager and every employee--including fast-food employees and others in &quot;drone&quot; jobs--needs to absorb: first, that the existing bureaucratization of the economy at every level is costing so much as to place those companies in jeopardy during the forthcoming economic shake-out, and second, that the sooner every individual begins the process of inventorying their personal capabilities and creating the networks for offering their personal services and knowledge via the Internet to all comers, the sooner they will be able to share in the profits associated with their direct individual contributions to the new economy.<br /> The Department of Defense acquisition and contracting examples are especially shocking because they show, so credibly and in detail, how we have institutionalized multi-billion dollar waste.<br /> This is a special book.  It is by a practical man who has drawn very personal and transformative lessons from the school of hard knocks, and whose recounting of those lessons have value for anyone who expects to work for a living today and in the future.  This is not a &quot;get rich quick&quot; book as much as it is a &quot;get rich together or get left behind&quot; book.	2001-02-11

This is a great book about the minutia and the value of a well-rounded military intelligence capability--it is relevant to U.S. and other operations going on right now.  I was especially impressed with four aspects: the emphasis on prisoner interrogation; the development of easy to install tactical signals collection devices that could be carried in and installed by deep reconnaissance units; the over-all commitment to long-range patrolling; and the clearly authorized commitment to &quot;behind the lines&quot; covert violence (assassination), using all the tools of intelligence to identify and then kill very specific individuals such as the two Egyptian Colonels believed to be guiding the Palestinian terrorist actions against Israel.  These are all areas where the U.S. military is weak (and in one case clearly forbidden to consider action), and I consider this book a helpful manual for military officers who wish to take a more active role in preparing defense intelligence for the future--we cannot do military intelligence the way the Israeli's do it, if we persist in thinking that desk-bound beltway analysts and overhead satellite collection are all that we need.	2001-01-10

Although the author concludes that the end of the Cold War should have produced a massive upheaval and did not, leaving &quot;too many of the old practices intact with little evidence that the intelligence community is ready to face the fast changing, frightening world that lies ahead,&quot; my impression was that the author was completely taken in by the party line and overlooked most of the really trenchant intelligence reform literature, including the open source revolution.  It is, however, replete with useful references, especially to what then DCI Bob Gates was thinking and talking about, and for that reason I would tend to include it in any serious intelligence library.	2001-01-10

It is not an easy read, between the British language form and the deep thinking, but it is, as Christopher Andrew says, &quot;the best overview&quot; and &quot;surely destined to become a standard work&quot;.  I especially liked its attention to components and boundaries, effects, accuracy, and evaluation.  Perhaps most usefully within the book is the distinction between long-term intelligence endeavors that rely primarily on open sources and serve to improve state understanding and state behavior, and short-term espionage that tends to be intrusive and heighten the target state's feelings of vulnerability and hostility.  No intelligence library is complete without this book--it provides a rock-solid foundation for serious thinking about the intelligence in the 21st Century.	2001-01-10

For all that failed, both in intelligence not getting it right and presidents not listening when it did, intelligence undeniably helped stabilize the Cold War and avoid many confrontations.  This book is extremely relevant to the emerging discussion, in 2001, about the need to depoliticize the position of the Director of Central Intelligence, and perhaps to consider a new National Security Act of 2001.	2001-01-10

First published in 1993 and now in the expanded edition, the bottom line on this book is that the Internet has finally made it possible for individuals to own the fruits of their own labor--the power has shifted from the industrial age aggregators of labor, capital, and hard resources to the individual knowledge workers.  The virtual community is the social manifestation of this new access to one another, but the real revolution is manifested in the freedom that cyberspace makes possible--as John Perry Barlow has said, the Internet interprets censorship (including corporate attempts to &quot;own&quot; employee knowledge) as an outage, and *routes around it*.  Not only are communities possible, but so also are short-term aggregations of interest, remote bartering, on the fly hiring of world-class experts at a fraction of their &quot;physical presence price&quot;.  If Howard's first big book, Tools for Thought, was the window on what is possible at the desktop, this book is the window on what is possible in cyberspace, transcending physical, legal, cultural, and financial barriers.  This is not quite the watershed that The Communist Manifesto was, but in many ways this book foreshadowed all of the netgain, infinite wealth, and other electronic frontier books coming out of the fevered brains around Boston--a guy in Mill Valley wearing hand-painted cowboy boots was there long before those carpetbaggers (smile).	2000-12-29

While there is a lot of focus on &quot;cool tools&quot; and all the paraphenalia of &quot;virtual reality&quot; qua artificial sensation and perception, the rock bottom foundation of this book can be found in Howard reflections on what it all means for the transformation of humans, business, and society in general.	2000-12-29

Originally published in 1985, this book was a &quot;must read&quot; at the highest levels of advanced information processing circles then, but sadly its brilliant and coherent message has yet to take hold--largely because bureaucratic budgets and office politics are major obstacles to implementing new models where the focus is on empowering the employee rather than crunching financial numbers.<br /> This book is a foundation reading for understanding why the software Bill Gates produces (and the Application Program Interfaces he persists in concealing) will never achieve the objectives that Howard and others believe are within our grasp--a desktop toolkit that not only produces multi-media documents without crashing ten times a day, but one that includes modeling &amp; simulation, structured argument analysis, interactive search and retrieval of the deep web as well as commercial online systems, and geospatially-based heterogeneous data set visualization--and more--the desktop toolkit that emerges logically from Howard's vision must include easy clustering and linking of related data across sets, statistical analysis to reveal anomalies and identify trends in data across time, space, and topic, and a range of data conversion, machine language translation, analog video management, and automated data extraction from text and images.  How hard can this be?  VERY HARD.  Why?  Because no one is willing to create a railway guage standard in cyberspace that legally mandates the transparency and stability of Application Program Interfaces (API).  Rheingold gets it, Gates does not.  What a waste!	2000-12-29

The book is a tour d'horizon on both the deficiencies of today's highly fragmented and bureaucratized archipelago of independent fiefdoms, as well as the &quot;new intelligence agenda&quot; that places public health and the environment near the top of the list of topics to be covered by spies and satellites.<br /><br />Highlights of this excellent work, a new standard in terms of currency and breadth, include his informed judgment that most of what is in the &quot;base&quot; budget of the community should be resurrected for reexamination, and that at least 20% of the budget (roughly $6 billion per year) could be done away with-and one speculates that this would be good news to an Administration actively seeking trade-offs permitting its promised tax cut program.  His overviews of the various cultures within the Central Intelligence Agency, of the myths of intelligence, and of the possibilities for burden sharing all merit close review.<br /> He does, however, go a bridge too far while simultaneously rendering a great service to the incoming Administration.  He properly identifies the dramatic shortfalls in the open source information gathering and processing capabilities of the various Departments of the Federal government-notably the Department of State as well as the Department of Commerce and the various agencies associated with public health-but then he goes on to suggest that these very incapacities should give rise to an extension of the U.S. Intelligence Community's mission and mandate-that it is the U.S. Intelligence Community, including clandestine case officers in the field and even FBI special agents, who should be tasked with collecting open sources of information and with reporting on everything from disease to pollution.  This will never work, but it does highlight the fact that all is not well with *both* the U.S. Intelligence Community *and* the rest of the government that is purportedly responsible for collecting and understanding open sources of information.<br /> On balance I found this book to be a very competent, insightful, and well-documented survey of the current stresses and strains facing the U.S. national intelligence community.  The conclusion that I drew from the book, one that might not be shared by the author, was that the U.S. Government as a whole has completely missed the dawn of the Information Age.  From the National Security Agency, where too many people on payroll keep that organization mired in the technologies of the 1970's, to the U.S. State Department, which has lost control of its Embassies and no longer collects significant amounts of open source information, to the White House, where no one has time to read-we have completely blown it-we simply have not adapted the cheap and responsive tools of the Internet to our needs, nor have we employed the Internet to share the financial as well as the intellectual and time burdens of achieving &quot;Global Coverage.&quot;  More profoundly, what this book does in a way I have not been able to do myself, is very pointedly call into question the entire structure of government, a government attempting to channel small streams of fragmented electronic information through a physical infrastructure of buildings and people that share no electronic connectivity what-so-ever, while abdicating its responsibility to absorb and appreciate the vast volumes of relevant information from around the globe that is not online, not in English, and not free.<br /><br /> It was not until I had absorbed the book's grand juxtaposition of the complementary incompetencies of both the producers of intelligence and the consumers of intelligence that I realized he has touched on what must be the core competency of government in the Information Age: how precisely do we go about collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information, and creating tailored intelligence, when we are all inter-dependent across national, legal bureaucratic, and cultural boundaries?  This is not about secrecy versus openness, but rather about whether Government Operations as a whole are taking place with the sources, methods, and tools of this century, or the last.  To bombs, bugs, drugs, and thugs one must add the perennial Pogo: &quot;We have met the enemy, and he is us.&quot;re no electronic connectivity what-so-ever, while abdicating its responsibility to absorb and appreciate the vast volumes of relevant information from around the globe that is not online, not in English, and not free.    <br /><br /> It was not until I had absorbed the book's grand juxtaposition of the complementary incompetencies of both the producers of intelligence and the consumers of intelligence that I realized he has touched on what must be the core competency of government in the Information Age: how precisely do we go about collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information, and creating tailored intelligence, when we are all inter-dependent across national, legal bureaucratic, and cultural boundaries?

I bought this book at the same time that I bought the more historically grounded &quot;While America Sleeps&quot;, and could not have asked for a better companion volume.  Finally, I understand the forces that are tearing George W. Bush in two-on the one side, the conservative isolationists, who believe that we must reject internationalism in all forms, and eschew intervention or &quot;911 missions&quot; at all costs-and on the other side, the conservative internationalists, who by this excellent account have both a pragmatic and realistic grasp of the lessons of history, of the shrinking globe that we find in the present, and of the speed with which &quot;regional&quot; threats can become global challenges.<br /> The two introductory contributions, one on the national interest and global responsibility, the other on the differences between conservative isolationists and conservative internationalists and all others, are extraordinarily essential readings for anyone who hopes to understand the early days-and contradictory signals-of the next Administration.  Individual chapters by very well-qualified experts cover the conservative internationalist view of China, Russia, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Europe and NATO, Asian Allies, and Israel.  More general chapters address the decline of America's armed forces and the strategic case for dealing with weapons proliferation.  The book concludes with three truly essential readings for any citizen, student, businessman, bureaucrat, or policymaker: on morality and foreign policy by William Bennett, on statesmanship in the new century by Paul Wolfowitz, and on strength and will in historical perspective by Donald Kagan.<br /> Well-footnoted and indexed, this is a very serious professional contribution to the rather lackluster national discussion about where our national security and foreign policy should be going.  As one who previously advocated a change from 2+ major regional conflicts (MRC) to 1 MRC and three separate forces for dealing with crime, environmental and cultural movements, and electronic and economic warfare (1+iii), I am now fully persuaded, mostly by the Kagan's book &quot;While America Sleeps&quot; but also by this book, that we absolutely must go toward a 2+iii national security strategy.<br /> My one concern about this book is that it completely ignores what is quaintly called Program 150-all that State Department,  Peace Corps, Agency for International Development stuff.  It also mentions intelligence and counterintelligence only in passing.  Conservative internationalists clearly have the brain power and the strategic vision and the historical understanding to be vital protectors of America's interests, but they must expand their vision to go beyond guns and consider the potential contributions of both diplomatic and economic butter, and applied intelligence.  There is in fact a need to have a very strong Presidential program that fully advances, in an integrated fashion, American investments in diplomacy, defense, transnational crime fighting, economic assistance including a Digital Marshall Plan, and cultural exchanges worthy of a great Nation.  This book lacks an appreciation for all the &quot;soft&quot; stuff, but it covers three of the four bases very nicely.

There is in fact a need to have a very strong Presidential program that fully advances, in an integrated fashion, American investments in diplomacy, defense, transnational crime fighting, economic assistance including a Digital Marshall Plan, and cultural exchanges worthy of a great Nation.  This book lacks an appreciation for all the &quot;soft&quot; stuff, but it covers three of the four bases very nicely.  A &quot;strong buy.&quot;	2000-12-08

Those who trust the Kagan's analysis-as does the distinguished Colin Gray, master of strategic thinking-may skip the first half of the book and go directly to the second half focusing on the American experience.<br /> This is not, as some might claim, an ideological treatise.  It is firmly grounded in history and the authors strive to present a balanced reasonable theme.  I believe they succeed.  Even for those steeped in the literature of the American military, there are new lessons in this book.  Perhaps the three most important lessons are these: 1) regional threats can become global threats without sufficient warning such as is necessary to reconstitute global defenses; 2) successful diplomacy is best founded on the immediate availability of armed force that can be projected to any point on the globe with great credibility; 3) national security, unlike domestic policies, is not something to be achieved by consensus-this is where the President earns their keep, by guiding and forging a consensus in the absence of domestic constituencies for spending on external affairs and external security.<br /> Especially gripping for anyone who anticipates a future in which Dick Cheney and Colin Powell have something to say about our national security, is the authors' analysis of their strategic decisions following the Cold War.  Both Cheney and Powell get very high marks for understanding that global strength is a pre-requisite for stability and security.  The Powell vision for a Base Force with Atlantic, Pacific, Strategic, and Contingency force elements is categorized as brilliant.  Powell does, however, get very low marks for being consistently unwilling to use force to impose order in the absence of clear objectives-the authors are very clear in calling the Weinberger Doctrine (setting conditions under which force may be used) completely out of date and at odds with today's needs.  Both President Bush and Chairman Powell are severely castigated for having ended the Gulf War too soon and without a decisive result-the author's compare this to the similarly indecisive outcome of World War I, an outcome that left the aggressors strong enough to come back and fight another day.<br /> The authors then go on to systematically review a series of major foreign policy and defense failures in the Clinton administration, an Administration characterized by a consistent failure to understand and address the mismatch between wandering and vacillating foreign policies and attendant commitments, and the real-world capabilities of a declining military force.  Especially dangerous, in the authors' view, was the Bottom Up Review approach that abandoned the Cheney-Powell appreciation for maintaining sufficient force to deter two regional surprise attacks (Russia and Iraq on one side, China and North Korea on the other), and instead adopted the premise that 6 months warning would be available, that reconstitution of both the force and its industrial base was possible, and that forces could be justified only in terms of existing threats, most of them from non-state actors.  Bosnia, Somalia, Haiti, Iraq inspections, North Korea inspections, these are all reviewed and all are found to have left America with a legacy of half measures.  &quot;By trying to ignore the problem, to leave it to others, whether the UN or NATO, by declaring it to be of no vital interest to the United States, by refusing to use any force once involved and then to use adequate force once committed, they [Bush Sr. and Clinton] found themselves making the very mistakes that brought defeat and disaster in Vietnam, the fear of which had played so great a role, first in their failure to act and then in their inadequate response.&quot;<br /> In their conclusion, the authors find that the next Administration will assume responsibility at a time when the rest of the world has learned, from the past eight years, that America is not willing to summon the forces to defeat aggression; that developing weapons of mass destruction is the fastest means to elicit billion dollar bribes from America; that ethnic cleansing and politically driven mass starvation will not inspire intervention by America.  &quot;The most likely American response will be neglect, at first, followed by some attempt at negotiation.  If, at last, driven to action, the Americans attack, it will be from the air, employing limited rules of engagement, and it will not destroy the aggressor.  Ground forces will almost certainly not be used until the aggressor himself invites them in as part of a negotiation  that gives him [the aggressor] most of what he wants.  Above all, he should be sure to develop weapons of mass destruction.  Even the hint of such a program in a threatening country will bring high-level American officials on top-secret missions to bribe its leaders to abandon the program.  They will probably be able to keep the bribe and to pursue the programs  they like, as well.  These are the lessons America has given the world in the past eight years...&quot;<br /> The book closes by concluding that the strategic pause is gone and it is almost too late.  Forces have declined severely (one can only lament the ill-considered Navy program for decommissioning destroyers and frigates that, once decommissioned, are almost impossible to resurrect), coalitions and alliances are in disarray, and non-state actors have learned how to play on the naivet&eacute; of the U.S. Government.

Across the various issue areas, including international, social, domestic, and governance policy domains, they present thoughtful recommendations.<br /> Unfortunately, despite their deep understanding of the dilemmas facing the next President, the book does not provide the two things I would most like to have seen: one or two page &quot;decision-papers&quot; that set out the choices to be made within each issue area, and the specific budget costs and timelines for those choices; and a larger over-all budget choice document in no more than 2 pages that outlines what changes might be made in both the budget construction already underway in CY 2001 that the new President can influence, and the budget to be prepared from scratch in CY 2002 that should reflect the vital trade-offs as well as the vital plus-ups that need to be made in defense, intelligence, public health, and education, to name just my top four.  In defense and intelligence, my specific area of interest, I would have liked to see some specific recommendations, and their costs, for restoring the 450 ship Navy, creating the contingency and peacekeeping force as well as the humanitarian assistance and disaster relief forces, and some specifics on considerably reinforcing diplomatic, peace corps, and economic assistance operations including a Digital Marshall Plan.  This is not to quarrel with findings and views of the authors, all of whom merit very serious consideration, but rather to note that the book does not go far enough, either in specific programmatic terms, or in politically useful presentation terms.<br /> This is an excellent book, but it is also a classic example of unfettered brilliance-without the concise decision papers and the over-all budget numbers, this book will only be read by staffers, not by principals, and that is a shame, because on balance I think there is a great deal to be learned from each of the authors contributing to this work.l budget numbers, this book will only be read by staffers, not by principals, and that is a shame, because on balance I think there is a great deal to be learned from each of the authors contributing to this work.	2000-12-06
2208852:US	50761804	R3LL3NYUUL6G76	0743204123	833686522	Maestro: Greenspan's Fed And The American Boom	Books	5	50	59	N	Y	Unconventional Wisdom Triumphs in Unconventional Times	I am quite taken with this book, which at 234 pages is &quot;just right&quot; and well crafted and edited to tell an important story.  This is a story about applied intelligence in the finest sense of the word.  It is a story about a man well-versed in traditional economic research, traditional models, traditional assumptions about the marketplace, who was put into the most important position in the global financial system at just the right time.  His intuition allowed him to detect unexplained changes in productivity and to direct new lines of research that helped persuade more conventional authorities to follow his strategy.  This is also a story about a uniquely successful partnership between a Republican central banker and a Democratic President-the very heart of the story centers around Greenspan's ability to persuade a very smart President that deficit reduction was the critical ingredient for a long-term restoration of American prosperity.  Aided by an equally smart Secretary of the Treasury, Rubin, it was the President's initiative to reduce the deficit by over $140 billion dollars that allowed all else to follow.  There is a clear message here for those who would reduce taxes before finishing the job of eliminating the deficit.  As a professional intelligence officer, I am very very impressed by the author's recounting of how Greenspan actually &quot;does&quot; the job of intelligence collection and analysis at his level-the Central Intelligence Agency could learn a great deal from this man.  The integration of constant (every fifteen minutes) monitoring of key indicators, the preparation of detailed research and statistics reports, and-by far the most important element-the continuous cycle of direct telephone calls and personal meetings across all sectors of the economy and around the globe, define what must be the most efficient and effective and valuable directed intelligence operation in the world-and one that does not steal the information it needs!  There are a number of observations throughout the book that are helpful at a strategic level: 1) deficit reduction is the single best thing any President can do-that enables the Fed to be effective; 2) we forget so quickly how desperate the American economy was in the late 1980's-in a volatile world it would be all too easy to enter a recession or have a major financial panic; 3) structured decision-making is extremely dependent on the models and the data-Greenspan's place in history is assured because he had the intellect and the patience and the gut instincts to realize that the data was incomplete or too aggregated and the modeling assumptions were dated and no longer sufficient to plot the course of the new economy;  4) the psychology of the marketplace is at least as important as the reality, and is likely to be hurt by loose-cannon White House elements with good intentions but out of bounds; 5) even the so-called best and brightest in any Presidential administration will categorize new ideas they do not understand as &quot;incoherent if not idiotic&quot;, as Greenspan's emerging new ideas were labeled by the top Treasury economists; 6) the concept of wealth redistribution fails to understand that even if $1 trillion from the 225 richest people in the world were redistributed to the poorest of the earth, this would only give them $1 a day for a year-Greenspan's focus is on underlying structural changes and the advancement of capitalism such that wealth can be created for the poor on a sustained basis; and 7) there will always be wild cards, such as the Savings &amp; Loan crisis, the LTCM (Long Term Capital Management) crisis, and the Mexico crisis, that require a financial management or central banking network able to capitalize on personal relationships and deep knowledge to find impromptu solutions.  On the latter note, it makes one realize that in an increasingly volatile marketplace, there should probably be much stricter limits on &quot;leveraged&quot; actions, where the majority of the money for gambling on the stock market or in the bond market-as much as 95% of the money-is borrowed and therefore likely to be defaulted if the wrong bet is placed.  There is nothing in the book regarding any steps that Greenspan has taken or is considering in order to bring added stability to the marketplace.  If I have one criticism of this otherwise superb book, a book that sheds light on many aspects of the Fed and its Chairman, it is that there is no hint here of what Greenspan has learned that might lead him to suggest legislative or regulatory changes intended to improve public transparency of key economic transactions, limitations on risk intended to prevent one rogue elephant (e.g. LTCM) from bringing down the market, and so on.  I would have liked to see a summation, even a two-page appendix, on the &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; economic models that Greenspan helped to change, and also some sense in the conclusion of what needs to be changed to keep future market crises within the bounds that can be managed by the Fed-Greenspan clearly has broad shoulders and a broad mind, but he can't carry the load forever and this book fails to focus on what changes are needed to institutionalize the Greenspan wisdom.ons, where the majority of the money for gambling on the stock market or in the bond market-as much as 95% of the money-is borrowed and therefore likely to be defaulted if the wrong bet is placed.

A book of this importance would indeed have benefited from an international advisory board of public health, medical, insurance, and policy experts; it would certainly have benefited from greater structure, firmer editing, and a foreword by someone like a former Surgeon General of the United States.  As it is, it appears to have overcome these deficiencies with hyped-up marketing and sweetheart reviews, and this in some ways counterproductive because this book could have, should have, become a mainstream topic in the Presidential campaign.  It failed to do so for several reasons, not least of which is the propensity of both candidates and their advisors to avoid serious thinking, but also because the book is not helpful to a popular understanding of the very real global and domestic threats to the health of our children today and in future generations.  Having said all this, I commend the book for its content and do not recommend it as avocational reading.  There are some very important points that the book brings out, and I will itemize these in order of importance: 1) Public health is about detection and prevention, medicine is about remediation.  In the long run, investments in public health are vastly cheaper and more effective than after-the-fact medical intervention; 2) The insurance industry in the developing world has failed to support public health investments, and in a remarkable collusion with the pharmaceutical, hospital and managed health care industries, has created a very expensive and increasingly ineffective system focused on drugs (to which diseases are increasingly resistant) and hospitals; 3) Hospitals are no longer reliable in terms of protecting patients from both error and secondary infection from other patients.  People are coming out of hospitals, in many cases, with more diseases than when they went in; 4) The health of our nation depends on the health of all other nations-not only does a collapse of public health in Africa lead to failed states and forced migrations, but it also is but an airline flight away from infecting Kansas; 5) Clean drinking water, uninfected food, and good environmental and occupational health conditions are at risk in many parts of the United States and Europe, not only in Russia and the rest of the world; 6) The United Nations, and the World Health Organization in particular, are in disarray and ineffective-in large part because of a lack of support from member nations-at dealing with the public health commons.  There is no question but that the author has hit a &quot;home run&quot; in terms of describing the harsh reality of epidemics in India and Africa, the collapse of public health in Russia, the rapid migration of many diseases from Russia through Germany to the rest of Europe and the U.S., and the severe costs in the U.S. of a retreat from the collective good with respect to public health.  Unfortunately, it is a home run hit in isolation, not a game-winning home run, because it fails to drive home, to the only audience that matters-the U.S. voter-exactly what political and economic initiatives are required to achieve three simple objectives: 1) re-establish the public health infrastructure in the U.S.; 2) redirect the entire health care industry toward preventive measures-including water and food quality controls-instead of remedial prescriptions; and 3) provide compelling incentives to the rest of the world for cleaning their own house (this presumes that we are able to clean our own first, a very questionable assumption at this point in time).  This is a valuable book, a five in terms of intent, a three in terms of execution, and I am glad that I took the time to read it.  It provides a wonderful foundation for enjoying, at an intellectual and policy level, the medical and public health novels by Robin Cook.tion depends on the health of all other nations-not only does a collapse of public health in Africa lead to failed states and forced migrations, but it also is but an airline flight away from infecting Kansas; 5) Clean drinking water, uninfected food, and good environmental and occupational health conditions are at risk in many parts of the United States and Europe, not only in Russia and the rest of the world; 6) The United Nations, and the World Health Organization in particular, are in disarray and ineffective-in large part because of a lack of support from member nations-at dealing with the public health commons.

The conclusion of the July 1932 article by Edwin F. Gay, &quot;The Great Depression&quot;, is instructive: &quot;The world war affirmed the international political responsibilities of the United States; the world depression demonstrates the economic interdependence of the United States with other states.  It cannot be a hermit nation.&quot;  With four seminal articles from each decade (1920's forward), including just about every great name in the international discussions of the century, this book is a fundamental reference point for those who would dare to craft a vibrant foreign policy for the United States in the 21st Century.  The book ends with several thoughtful pieces including, most fittingly, an interview with Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore on culture as destiny, an article whose subtitle might have been &quot;How extended families and the collective good still matter.&quot;	2000-11-11

Still Ref A.<br /><br />In excruciating detail, with substantial commonality between a number of case studies, this book examines the traditional public security (police, internal order) function in relation to failed states and external interventions.<br /><br />This is not a book about the larger issue of when and how to intervene in the internal affairs of states beset by internal conflict and it is not a book about the actual conditions around the world that require some form of imposed or reinforced public order.  Rather, it is the most detailed book one could hope for on the need for an international law enforcement reserve that is capable of rapidly filling the gap in local public police services that occurs when the indigenous capability collapses and traditional military forces arrive unprepared to meet this need.<br /><br />All of the case studies are world-class, with primary source detail unlike any normally seen in the literature.  All agree that this is a \\"force structure\\" issue that no government and certainly not the United Nations, has mastered, but most give due credit to UN civilian police operations for being the best available model upon which to build a future capability.<br /><br />The summary of conclusions by Ambassador Oakley and Colonel Professor Dziedzic are alone worth the price of the book.  If the Cold War era might be said to have revolved around early perceptions of a \\"missile gap\\", the 21st Century with its Operations Other Than War (OOTW) could reasonably be said to have two issues-natural conditions such as depleted water resources, which is not the book's focus, and the \\"globo-cop gap\\", which is-the book documents in a very compelling manner the fact that there is a major capabilities (and intelligence) chasm between preventive diplomacy on the one side, and armed military forces on the other, and that closure of this gap is essential if we are to improve our prospects for rescuing and maintaining public order around the world.<br /><br />The capabilities of U.S. military police and civil affairs specialists are touched on by several pieces, but I for one would have liked to see more emphasis on what changes in their force structure is required-my understanding is that we have not increased their numbers in the aftermath of the Cold War despite the fact that these units are being used up all over the world, without relief.<br /><br />The conclusion highlights the need for constabulary forces, and helpfully identifies the following specific national capabilities as being relevant (in this reader's interpretation) to a future standing international gendarmerie: U.S. Military Police and Special Forces, French gendarmerie, Spanish Guardia Civil, Chilean carabineros, Argentine gendarmes, Italian carabinieri, Dutch Royal Mariechaussee).  I would add the Belgian Gendarme, the first national force to establish an open source intelligence network across all police precincts in the entire country.<br /><br />It is clear from both the conclusion and the case studies that this constabulary-police capabilities requirement needs agreed-upon international concepts, doctrine, training, earmarked resources including surge capabilities and transport, and so on.  We do not appear to have learned any lasting lessons from the various interventions, in that civil affairs and military police continue to be \\"last in line\\" for embarkation into areas where military forces are being introduced, and there is no U.S. program within Program 150 where we can demonstrate a real commitment to \\"law and order\\" as part of our contribution to peace in the 21st Century.<br /><br />The book lacks an index, a typical shortcoming of think tank and defense educational institutions, and this is a major flaw that should be corrected in the next printing.  This book is \\"Ref A\\" for every foreign service, military, and law enforcement officer interested in doing a better job of integrating diplomatic, gendarmerie, and military capabilities in every clime and place.<br /><br />See also:<br />[[ASIN:0742532550 Breaking the Real Axis of Evil: How to Oust the World's Last Dictators by 2025]]<br />[[ASIN:140004684X See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIA's War on Terrorism]]<br />[[ASIN:1400052688 Sleeping with the Devil: How Washington Sold Our Soul for Saudi Crude]]<br />[[ASIN:0743200284 Deliver Us from Evil: Peacekeepers, Warlords and a World of Endless Conflict]]<br />[[ASIN:0805044574 The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People]]<br />[[ASIN:0805077979 The Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire Project)]]<br />[[ASIN:1574885553 War of the Flea: The Classic Study of Guerrilla Warfare]]<br />[[ASIN:0520237730 The Road to 9/11: Wealth, Empire, and the Future of America]]bilities in every clime and place.

The World Conflict and Human Rights Map (8 pages of graphics and 8 pages of fine print) out of Leiden University does vastly more to inform than does this book.  This book should never, ever have been published in its present form--I venture to say that if it were condensed to 150 pages and properly edited, with graphics and good synthesis, it might be worthy of a second look.  Time is the most precious commodity in the world--RAND managers and editors need to get serious about how they present possibly useful information to experts who want to know what RAND thinks, but cannot spare the time to get past cumbersome undisiplined--even lazy--preparations.  The topic of this book is extremely important--those who would invest their scarce time and money in doing research in this area deserve better from those who put together this book.	2000-10-13

This is a hard-hearted practical look at development aid, and so it should be. The &quot;official development assistance&quot; (ODA) element of Program 150, the international affairs budget commonly recognized as the &quot;preventive diplomacy&quot; budget that runs alongside Program 50 (the traditional military budget), is evaluated by the authors in terms of amounts (are we doing enough), allocations (are we giving to the right countries), and directions (are we doing the right things). It is a small amount of money that is being discussed--$9 billion a year in 1997 for ODA alone-said to represent a half penny of each dollar spent by the U.S. government. This works out to about $15 per year for the members of the targeted populations. Larger more populous states receive less aid per capita than smaller states. India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and China are especially disadvantaged. In contrast to today's $15 per person nvestment, the Marshall Plan provided in excess of $100 to $200 per person in Europe (but for only several years, working out to an equivalent amount when compared to sustained aid flows today).<br />Several thoughtful observations jump out from the book:<br />1) Foreign aid is not preventing conflicts from emerging (if anything, and this is not implied by O'Hanlon but is explicit in William Shawcross' book DELIVER US FROM EVIL: Peacekeepers, Warlords and a World of Endless Conflict (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2000), foreign aid contributes to instability by giving rise to warlords and black markets);<br />2) Foreign aid is of limited use in reconstructing societies ravaged by conflict, especially those with limited infrastructures that cannot absorb resources as well as European nations;<br />3) Foreign aid's best return on investment appears to be the education of women-even a few years of education has a considerable impact on birth control, health, and other areas of interest;<br />4)Foreign aid shapes both our own philosophy of foreign affairs, and the perceptions others have of our foreign role-it also shapes our domestic constituencies perception of why we should have a foreign policy arm;<br />5) Foreign aid does not play a significant role in most countries where there is access to open markets and stability does not frighten away investors-indeed the emerging expert consensus appears to lean toward debt forgiveness combined with private capital investment as the best approach to economic reform;<br />6) Foreign aid is least effective in those countries that are either unstable or have a range of harmful economic policies including trade barriers, large budget deficits, oversized public sectors, and overvalued exchange rates. Roughly half the countries receiving aid today have poor economic policies in place;<br />7) The U.S. is the least generous of the Office of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) members, providing just over one third as much of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as the other OECD countries-0.10 percent instead of 0.27 percent.<br />Having said all this, the author's document their views that our ODA investments need to rise from $9 billion to at least $12 billion a year, with other countries increasing their combined contributions from $51 billion to $68 billion per year. The authors favor increased foreign aid investments in poor countries with good economic policies, for the purpose of building transportation infrastructure, enhancing local health and education programs, and accelerating the expansion of utilities and communications services.<br />They also recommend a broader distribution of foreign aid for countries in conflict throughout Africa, and suggest that Public Law 480 food aid should be focused only on responding to disaster relief rather than indiscriminate distribution that benefits U.S. farmers but undermines foreign agricultural programs.<br />They conclude with the somewhat veiled suggestion that all of this could be paid for by a reduction of foreign military assistance to Egypt and Israel. One is left, at the end of the book, with two strong feelings: first, that U.S. foreign aid is on &quot;automatic pilot&quot; and rather mindlessly muddling along; and second, that this is a very small but very important part of the total U.S. national security budget, one that merits its own ombudsman within the National Security Council, and one that is worthy of no less than a penny on the dollar as we plan our future Federal investments.<br />What is left unsaid by the authors is whether the other $60-80 billion in foreign aid by various actors including the United Nations agencies, is well managed--one is left with the impression that the U.S. really faces two challenges: an internal challenge of improving its performance with respect to foreign aid, and an external challenge in demanding a more rational and coordinated approach to various forms of aid being sponsored by others.litary assistance to Egypt and Israel.

Under the guidance of Stephen E. Ambrose, well known for his books on the citizen-soldiers of World War II, the author has produced a very readable and moving book about one brilliant caustic citizen's forgotten contributions to World War II.  Two aspects of this book jump out at the reader: the first is that Americans are capable of anything when motivated.  Andrew Jackson Higgins and his employees, most trained overnight for jobs they never thought to have, was able to create an assembly line producing one ship a day.  He was able to design, build and test gun boats and landing craft on an overnight basis.  He is remembered by Marines, and especially General Victor Krulak, for having given America the one missing ingredient necessary for successful amphibious landings-in this way, he may well have changed the course of the war and the history of our Nation.  The second aspect that jumps out at the reader is that of bureaucratic pettiness to the point of selfishly undermining the war effort within the Department of the Navy and the Bureau of Boats.  In careful and measured detail, the author lays out the history of competition between trained naval architects with closed minds, and the relatively under-trained Higgins team with new ideas, and shows how the bureaucracy often conspired to block and demean Higgins at the expense of the Marines and the sailors on the front line.  There is less of that sort of thing these days, but it is still with us, as we contemplate the need for a 450-ship Navy that is fully capable for Operations Other Than War (OOTW).  This book should be included on the Commandant of the Marine Corps and the Chief of Naval Operations lists of recommended professional readings, and it should be studied by anyone contemplating the hidden dangers of bureaucratic interests that often override the public interest and undermine our national security.	2000-10-13

It complements Amy Zegart's broader book, Flawed By Design, in an excellent manner.  This book, focusing as it does on the CIA alone, and on internal sources not readily available to Zegart, fills a major gap in our understanding of the CIA's origins.  The author excels at demonstrating both the actual as opposed to the mythical origins of the agency, and pays particular heed to the role of the Bureau of the Budget and that Bureau's biases and intentions.  At the end of it all, the author notes that the agency was moving in controversial directions within four years of its birth, quickly disturbing Harry Truman, who is quoted as saying, twenty-years after the fact (in 1963), &quot;For some time I have been distributed by the way CIA has been diverted from its original assignment.  It has become an operational arm and at times a policy-making arm of Government....I never had any thought when I set up the CIA that it would be injected into peacetime cloak-and-dagger operations.&quot;  The author himself goes on to conclude that &quot;the nature of the new threats and the revolution in information acquisition and dissemination have thrown traditional ways of intelligence organization, collection, evaluation, and distribution into question.  ...  CIA has entered the second half-century of its existence striving to avoid the fate of its OSS parent.  In the process, it is groping for new missions and purposes while blighted by the legacy of its past derelictions, and while operating amid a rapidly changing global environment and technological revolution that are rendering its sources, methods, organizations, and mystique obsolete.&quot;  I would hasten to add, as my own book documents, that we will always have hidden evil in the world and will always needs spies and secret methods to some extent, but this book, combining academic rigor with insider access, must surely give the most intelligent of our policy, legislative, and intelligence managers pause, for it very carefully documents the possibility that 75% of what we are doing today with secret sources and methods need not and should not be done.

His introductory review of the RMA schools of thought (system of systems, dominant battlespace knowledge, global reach, and vulnerability or anti-access or asymmetric), with appropriate notes, is helpful to any adult student.  The heart of his book can be distilled down to one chart showing the expected rates of advance in the various technical domains relevant to military operations.  Of 29 distinct technical groups across sensors, computers and communications; projectiles, propulsion, and platforms; and other weapons, he finds only two technology areas-computer hardware and computer software-capable of revolutionary change in the foreseeable future.  Eight others-chemical sensors, biological sensors, radio communications, laser communications, radio-frequency weapons, nonlethal weapons, and biological weapons-are judged capable of high but not revolutionary advances.  All other technical areas, namely those associated with mobility platforms and weaponry itself, are unlikely to develop at anything above a moderate pace.  In the course of his discussion of each of these he brings forth the basics of physics and real-world constraints and points out that even the best of our sensors are frustrated by heavy rain and other man-made countermeasures.  He correctly evaluates the inability of our existing and planned Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) to keep up with targeting needs, particularly in urban and heavy canopy terrain.  He also notes in passing that human intelligence may well prove to be the sustaining element in finding individual people, and that there has been no significant change since World War II in the numbers of troops needed per 1,000 inhabitants-infantry is still the core force.  He systematically dismisses a variety of RMA claims, among the most dangerous being that we can afford to stand down many of our forward bases, by pointing out that combat aircraft continue to have short ranges, ground forces continue to require heavy logistics sustainment, ships remain slow to cross oceans, and it continues to be extremely difficult to seize ports and other fixed infrastructure.  He concludes the book with a number of budgeting recommendations, both for the USA and for its allies.  For the USA he would emphasize communications and computing, the one area truly open to an RMA in the near term.  Other areas meriting immediate investments include strategic sea and air lift, the rapid development of a lighter tank and a mine-resistant infantry vehicle, and improvements in naval mine warfare.  He supports the National Missile Defense and would sustain more robust RDT&amp;E experimentation.  For a major US ally, with a fraction of our funding, he recommends a $15 billion total investment over several years to acquire a thoughtful mix of advanced C4I enhancements including ground stations, a fleet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), 1000 cruise missiles, 5000 short-range munitions, 500 advanced air to air missiles, a squadron of stealth aircraft, and several batteries of theater missile defense radars and missiles.  A very nice listing of major Pentagon acquisition programs supports his recommendation that we economize on major weapons platforms and pursue a high-low mixed strategy, limiting, for example, our procurement of the F-22 and joint strike fighters so as to afford more F-15s and F-16s.  Overall this book fulfills its mission of reviewing technologies in relation to the future of warfare, and it provides the reader with a very strong stepping stone for venturing into the literature of defense transformation.  Those who would criticize this work for failing to consider the competition or the metrics of evaluation have a point, but only a point-the book does what it set out to do.  It evaluates specific technologies in relation to the inflated and often delusional claims of the proponents of the RMA.  One book cannot solve all our problems, but it can, as this book does, blow away some of the foggy thinking emanating from the Pentagon and other places where a number of flag officers and their staffs have lost sight of ground truth.n delusional claims of the proponents of the RMA.

The author studies a number of cases of &quot;adjustment failure&quot; where great powers, at the height of their strength, engaged in self-defeating behavior-either overly cooperative behavior that resulted in strategic exposure, or overly competitive behavior that resulted in self-encirclement or over-extension.  The author pays special attention to the inter-relationship between economic versus military resources (means) and international commitments (ends).  Strategic culture is defined and discussed in an integrative fashion, in relation to the three levels of analysis (system, state, and individual), and is found to be the critical factor that constrains elites by trapping them in a strategic paradigm of their own making-one used to justify major expenditures that are now counterproductive, but whose abandonment would exact too high a domestic political price if reversed (such as a Revolution in Military Affairs?)  The author finds that strategic culture, unlike individual strategic beliefs, is resistant to incoming information and to change.  States that are in decline and states that are rising tend to fall prey to &quot;adjustment failure&quot; and consequently to present other states with instability issues.  In both cases elites tend to utilize national propaganda and education to inculcate a mass understanding may support their intermediate objectives but ultimately frustrates strategic adjustment when they realize that what they are doing is only increasing their vulnerability.  Most interestingly for the United States of America, the author finds that it is only when a state is truly in a position of strength, that it can best recognize and adapt to radical changes in the external environment-in other words, now is the time to dump the 2+ Major Theater War strategy and adopt a competing strategy that more properly integrates economic and military means to achieve our national security ends.  The author concludes with several specific prescriptions that clearly pertinent to forthcoming Presidential and Congressional decisions at the dawn of the 21st Century and that must be appreciated if we are to have an effective national security policy in the next decade or two.  First, the author is at one with Donald Kegan and Colin Gray in noting that the dissolution of the Soviet Union does not mean the end of U.S. strategic responsibilities in Europe; second,  that at a time when there are many rising states emerging from the dissolution of the Soviet Union (as well as the fragmentation of larger states elsewhere) it is vital that these states be buffered against economic shock so as to avoid the instability conducive to the rise of aggressor governments; third, that there must be deliberate international programs in place to suppress or eliminate domestic pathologies that lead to aggressive behavior, and these must be progressively strong, beginning with economic assistance to eliminate the root causes of the instability; to sanctions and information operations as well as military preparations; and finally to outright military intervention with overwhelming force.  The author explicitly notes that the international community must exercise great care to identify and decisively stop emerging aggressors before they can become full-blown aggressor states-history as documented in the case studies contained in the book suggests that when confronted by a full-blown aggressor state, members of the international community will tend toward strategic accommodations policies and tolerance of aggression rather than the decisive interventionist action easiest to adopt at an earlier stage.  Finally, the author offers a prescription for avoiding surprise and confrontation, recommending that some form of international body be used to monitor and sanction any use of nationalist propaganda (such as generally precedes genocidal campaigns), and that this monitoring range from normal public sources down to educational materials used in the schools as well as government archives.  By intention, the book focuses only on Europe and only on relations between states--there is much that could be done to broaden these useful insights to inform our strategy toward Asia, the Third World, specific failed states and &quot;states of concern&quot;, and non-state groups.mpaigns), and that this monitoring range from normal public sources down to educational materials used in the schools as well as government archives.

The fact of the matter is that we are creating an increasingly dangerous environment for ourselves, with cross-contamination, increasingly resistant strains of difficult to diagnose diseases, and so on.  The naive will lambast the book for scare-mongering, and they will be wrong--if this book gets you through an airline flight, or an afternoon, and causes you to think just a tiny bit about the reality that we can no longer trust our government to protect the food supply and preparation process, and to think just a tiny bit about how you might protect your children from inadequate &quot;due diligence&quot; by the food service industry, then you will be richly rewarded.  The author himself recommends the non-fiction book by Nicols Fox, SPOILED: What is Happening to Our Food Supply and Why We Are Increasingly at Risk (Basic Books, 1997 or Penguin, 1998).  The bottom line is that this novel is for serious people, and chillingly worthwhile for those who like to learn while being entertained.	2000-10-06

The author provides a balanced and well-documented view overall.  His final chapter on solutions explores conservation, technical, and political options.  Two statements leapt off the page: first, that it is the average person, unaware of the fragility of our water system, that is doing the most damage, not the corporations or mega-farms; and second, that for the price of one military ship or equipped unit ($100 million), one can desalinate 100 million cubic meters of water.  The bottom line is clear: we are close to a tipping point toward catastrophe but solution are still within our grasp, and they require, not world government, but a virtual world system that permits the integrated management of all aspects of water demand as well supply.

In the foreword to the book, William Crowe, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and then Ambassador to the Court of Saint James, observes that &quot;A reappreciation of government is also in order.&quot; He clearly articulates both the range of challenges facing us (most of them non-military in nature), and the disconnect between how we organize our government and how we need to successfully engage.<br />His bottom line is clear: we are not spending enough on the varied elements of national security, with special emphasis on a severely under-funded and under-manned diplomatic service.<br />From Gaddis Smith and Walter Mondale to Sam Nunn and Robert Oakley, from David Gergen to David Abshire to David Boren, from Kissinger to Brzezinski to Kirkpatrick, in combination with a whole host of lesser known but equally talented practitioners, capped off by comments from five Directors of Central Intelligence, this books sets a standard for organized high quality reflection on the future of U.S. foreign policy.<br />Most interestingly, there is general consensus with David Abshire's view that we are in a strategic interregnum, and still lacking for a policy paradigm within which to orchestrate our varied efforts to define and further our vital interests.<br />David Gergen clearly articulates the shortfalls in our national educational, media, and political patterns that leave the vast majority of Americans ignorant of our foreign interests and unsupportive of the need for proactive engagement abroad. Reading this book, I could not help but feel that our national educational system is in crisis, and we need both a wake-up call and a consequent national investment program such as occurred after the first Sputnik launch.<br />David Boren is clearly a decade or more ahead of most current commentators in his call for a new paradigm, for a new analytical framework, for the internationalization of American education across the board. I am reminded of the quotation from early America: &quot;A Nation's best defense is an educated citizenry.&quot; Interestingly, he cites Daniel Boorstein's caution that we must not confuse information with knowledge, and in the next sentence notes: &quot;I watched during my term as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee while the CIA greatly increased its information, its raw data, but became overwhelmed and unable to separate the important from the unimportant.&quot;<br />I would itemize just a few of the many, many useful insights that this book offers:<br />1) Diplomacy is the sum total of familiarity with the role, knowledge of the component parts of the overall national security policy, and the ability to design and implement comprehensive policies that achieve the national objectives;<br />2) Politicians and policy-makers are losing the ability to think objectively and act with conviction...they are too dependent on short-term domestic polling and opinion;<br />3) (Quoting Donald Kegan): Power without the willingness to use it does not contribute to world peace;<br />4) We must strengthen the domestic roots of national power if we are to have a sound strategy;<br />5) Future of U.S. education and strength of U.S. family unit will quite simply determine whether U.S. can meet the economic challenges of the 21st Century;<br />6) Our domestic insecurity and domestic violence-and resulting foreign perceptions and disrespect for our competence at home-reduce our effectiveness overseas;<br />7) U.S. is its own worst enemy, with declining attention to foreign policy matters;<br />8) Weapons of mass destruction are our only substantive vital interest today;<br />9) Hunger, pestilence, and refugees within Africa will affect all nations;<br />10) Corruption has replaced guerrilla movements as the principal threat to democratic governance;<br />11) Commerce rather than conflict will be the primary concern of 21st century foreign policy;<br />12) The environment joins trade and commerce as an essential objective for foreign policy;<br />13) Long-term non-military challenges, and especially global financial markets, require refocusing of our security perspectives;<br />14) Asia will edge out Europe as our primary trading partner;<br />15) China in Asia and Turkey in the West are linch-pin nations;<br />16) NATO will survive but we must take care not to threaten Russia;<br />17) The UN is not very effective at peacekeeping operations-it is best confined to idea exchanges;<br />18) Our military is over-extended and under-funded but still the best in the world;<br />19) For the cost of one battalion or one expensive piece of military equipment, one thousand new Foreign Service officers could be added toward preventive diplomacy;<br />20) Lessons from the Roman empire: its decline results in part from a loss of contact with its own heartlands, a progressive distancing of the elite from the populace, the elevation of the military machine to the summit of the power hierarchy, and blindness in perceiving the emergence of societies motivated by nationalism or new religious ideologies; and<br />21) We may need a new National Security Act.<br />If I had one small critical comment on the book is would be one of concern-concern that these great statesmen and scholars appear-even while noting that defense is under-capitalized-to take U.S. military competence at face value.

This is a  well-documented and heavily fact-laden book-the authors as individuals and  the case they make in general terms-must be heeded by the next President  and the next Congress.<br /><br />Where the book does not go, and a companion book by  the same authors would be of great value, is into the detail of<br /><br />WHAT  threat,<br /><br />WHAT force structure.<br /><br />They accept, for example, the Navy's  304-ship Navy that keeps adding gigantic carriers and does nothing for  littoral warfare or putting Marines within 24 hours of any country instead  of 6 days.<br /><br />Similarly, they accept Air Force emphasis on fewer and fewer  bigger and more sophisticated platforms of dubious utility in a 21st  Century environment that requires long loiter, ranges of several hundred  nautical miles without refueling, full lift in hot humid weather, and  survivability in the face of electromagnetic weapons in the hands of thugs.<br /><br />This book demonstrates a clear mastery of defense economics, and it is an  important contribution to the bottom line: our national defense is  desperately underfunded, and this must be in the \\"top three\\"  issues facing the 43rd President and the 107th Congress.<br /><br />What we buy, and  why, has not yet been answered to my satisfaction.	2000-08-30

They wisely avoid the debate  swirling around the so-called Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA)-but  deserve credit for their predecessor &quot;offset strategy&quot;-and simply  note that the absence of &quot;A List&quot; threats gives us an opportunity  to strengthen and maintain our traditional nuclear and conventional  capabilities against the day when a Russia or China may rise in hostility  against us.  The book as a whole focuses on the &quot;B List&quot; threats,  including Russia in chaos, a hostile China acting aggressively within its  region, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and catastrophic  terrorism.  They note, correctly, that most of the spending and effort  today is focused on responding to the crisis de jure, some but not enough  resources are applied to preparing for the future, and virtually nothing is  being done against the latest concept, that of &quot;shaping&quot; the  environment through &quot;forward engagement.&quot;  Perhaps most  importantly, they introduce the term &quot;defense by other means&quot; and  comment on the obstacles, both within the Administration and on the Hill,  to getting support and funding for non-military activities with profound  security benefits.<br />Although others may focus on their discussion of  Russia and NATO as the core of the book, what I found most helpful and  worthwhile was the straight-forward and thoughtful discussion of the need  for a new national strategy, a new paradigm, for dealing with potentially  catastrophic terrorism.  Their understanding of what defense resources can  be applied, and of the impediments to success that exist today between  state &amp; local law enforcement, federal capabilities such as the Federal  Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA) and defense as well as overseas diplomatic and intelligence  capabilities, inspire them to propose several innovative approaches to this  challenge.  The legal and budgetary implications of their proposals are  daunting but essential-their proposals for dealing with this one challenge  would be helpful in restructuring the entire U.S. government to better  integrate political-diplomatic-military-law enforcement operations with  judicial and congressional oversight as well as truly all-source  intelligence support.<br />Interesting side notes include 1) the early  discovery in US-Russian military discussions that technology  interoperability and future collaboration required the surmounting of many  obstacles associated with decades of isolated (and often secret)  development; 2) the absence of intelligence from the entire book-by this  account, US defense leaders spend virtually all of their time in direct  operational discussions with their most important counterparts, and there  is very little day to day attention to strategic analysis, estimative  intelligence, or coordination with diplomatic, economic, and law  enforcement counterparts at home; 3) the difficulty of finding a carrier to  send to Taiwan at a time when we had 12 carriers-only four appear to have  been &quot;real&quot; for defense purposes; and 4) the notable absence of  Australia from the discussion of security in Asia.<br />The concept of  Preventive Defense is holistic (requiring the simultaneous uses of other  aspects of national power including diplomacy and economic assistance) but  places the Department of Defense in a central role as the provider of  realigned resources, military-to-military contacts, and logistics support  to actual implementation.  Unfortunately the concept of Preventive Defense  has been narrowly focused (its greatest success has been the dismantling of  former Soviet nuclear weapons in the Commonwealth of Independent States),  and neither the joint staff nor the services are willing to give up funds  for weapons and manpower in order to make a strategy of Preventive Defense  possible.<br />This resistance bodes ill for the other half of the 21st  Century security challenge, what the author's call the &quot;C  List&quot;-the Rwandas, Somalias, Haitis and Indonesias.  They themselves  are unwilling to acknowledge C List threats as being vital to U.S. security  in the long-term (as AIDS is now recognized).  I would, however, agree with  them on one important point: the current budget for defense should be  repurposed toward readiness, preparing for the future, and their concept of  preventive defense, and it should not be frittered away on &quot;C  List&quot; contingencies-new funds must be found to create and sustain  America's Preventive Diplomacy and its Operations Other Than War (OOTW)  capabilities.  It will fall to someone else to integrate their concept of  Preventive Defense with the emerging concepts of Preventive Diplomacy,  International Tribunals, and a 21st Century Marshall Plan for the festering  zones of conflict in Africa, Arabia, Asia, and the Americas--zone where  ethnic fault lines, criminal gangs, border disputes, and shortages of  water, food, energy, and medicine all come together to create a breeding  ground for modern plagues that will surely come across our water's edge in  the future.  On balance, through, this book makes the top grade for serious  bi-partisan dialogue, and they deserve a lot of credit for defining  solutions for the first half of our security challenges in the 21st  Century.to make a strategy of Preventive Defense  possible.  <br />This resistance bodes ill for the other half of the 21st  Century security challenge, what the author's call the &quot;C  List&quot;-the Rwandas, Somalias, Haitis and Indonesias.

It is in my view a very fine structured  reading program for the adult policy maker who is well beyond the need for  going back to school, but much in need a fast means of coming to grips with  the dramatic changes that have occurred in our international security  environment.  Early on it addresses the competing approaches to security  studies-from the traditionalist national, international, and regional  security approaches to the emerging transstate (non-state actors  acknowledged as major sources of conflict and instability) to the global  (to include human rights, environmental protection, economic prosperity,  and social development as fundamental security issues).  It's iteration of  the weaknesses of 20th century security studies reads like a list of  current biases inherent in those prescribing defense reform today:  overemphasis on theory (or worst-case scenarios); insufficient attention to  non-combat missions for military forces in peacetime; excessive focus on  the US, Europe, and Russia to the exclusion of the rest of the world; too  little attention to culture and the relationship of culture to conflict  deterrence and resolution; insufficient attention to history prior to World  War II; and finally, a neglect of non-military instruments of power and  their interaction with the military.  Intelligence in particular is singled  out as being a relatively recent open topic for discussion, meriting more  study.  The chapters on Transstate Security by Roy Godson (on non-state  actors and the growing prevalence of &quot;global ungovernability&quot;)  and on Nontraditional Uses of Military Force by George H. Quester, as well  as the introduction and conclusion by Richard H. Schultz, Jr., are each,  alone, worth the price of the book.  Each chapter, with its course outline,  discussion, and recommended references, is worthy of careful examination by  any serving or aspiring policymaker.  However distinguished one's pedigree,  we are all students today, and Graham E. Fuller is correct when he notes on  page 124 that &quot;most policymakers do not even fully realize the  dynamics of the new world we live in.&quot;, and recommended references, is worthy of careful examination by  any serving or aspiring policymaker.

On balance it provides several important  contributions, but its core assumption that technology can be a substitute  for people is flawed, as is its completely insupportable assumption that  our allies might be willing to follow us down this very expensive and  dubious interoperability trail.  Perhaps even more troubling, the school of  thought represented by this book suffers from the severe delusion that  everything that needs to be seen can be seen by national technical means,  and processed in time to be relevant to the commander.  Nothing could be  further from the truth-fully 90% of what is needed to succeed in today's  environment is not in digital form, not in English, and not collectible by  technical means.  The most important point made in the whole book, and here  I give the author high marks, is its compelling description of why military  reform cannot be achieved from within: because there is no decision process  by which a &quot;joint&quot; leadership can determine force structure and  weapons acquisition without fear of service politics.  His approach to  reform, shifting from a focus on system stovepipes to joint mission areas,  is valuable and could be helpful in defense transformation if it were  cleansed of its unhealthy obsession with expensive technology and forced to  face the fact that three-quarters of our challenges in this new century are  Operations Other Than War (OOTW) that call into question virtually every  dollar being spent under existing RMA auspices.  The book is also helpful  in pointing out the redundancy between the four services, the 12:1 support  ratio in personnel, and the need to embed information handling capabilities  in all future mobility and weapons systems.  Perhaps most disappointingly,  this book by a distinguished Admiral and apparent out-of-the-box thinker  fails to outline a force structure, including a 450-ship Navy, capable of  dealing effectively with all four levels of war in every clime and place.pointingly,  this book by a distinguished Admiral and apparent out-of-the-box thinker  fails to outline a force structure, including a 450-ship Navy, capable of  dealing effectively with all four levels of war in every clime and place.	2000-08-29

This remains a priceless reference work.<br /><br />This book is serious, scholarly yet down to earth, compassionate, insightful, terribly relevant and most useful to any citizen, overseas  practitioner, or policymaker.  By the books own rendering, \\"good will  without strength can make things worse.\\"  Most compellingly, the  author demonstrates both the nuances and the complexities of \\"peace  operations\\", and the fact that they require at least as much  forethought, commitment, and sustainment as combat operations.  Food  scarcity and dangerous public health are the root symptoms, not the core  issues.  The most dangerous element is not the competing sides, but the  criminal gangs that emerge to \\"stoke the fires of nationalism and  ethnicity in order to create an environment of fear and vulnerability\\"  (and great profit).  At the same time, humanitarianism has become a big  part of the problem-we have not yet learned how to distinguish between  those conflicts where intervention is warranted (e.g. massive genocide  campaigns) and those where internal conflicts need to be settled  internally.  In feeding the competing parties, we are both prolonging the  conflict, and giving rise to criminal organizations that learn to leverage  both the on-going conflict and the incoming relief supplies.  Perhaps more  troubling, there appears to be a clear double-standard-whether deliberate  or circumstantial-between attempts to bring order to the white western or  Arab fringe countries and what appears to be callous indifference to black  African and distant Asian turmoil that includes hundreds of thousands  victim to genocide and tens of thousands victim to living amputation,  mutilation, and rape.  When all is said and done, and these are my  conclusions from reading this excellent work, 1) there is no international  intelligence system in place suitable to providing both the global coverage  and public education needed to mobilize and sustain multi-national  peacekeeping coalitions; 2) the United Nations is not structured, funded,  nor capable of carrying out disciplined effective peacekeeping operations,  and the contributing nations are unreliable in how and when they will  provide incremental assistance; 3) we still have a long way to go in  devising new concepts, doctrines, and technologies and programs for  effectively integrating and applying preventive diplomacy, transformed  defense, transnational law enforcement, and public services (water, food,  health and education) in a manner that furthers regionally-based peace and  prosperity instead of feeding the fires of local unrest.<br /><br />See also:<br />[[ASIN:0195311450 The Bottom Billion: Why the Poorest Countries are Failing and What Can Be Done About It]]<br />[[ASIN:0143036580 The End of Poverty: Economic Possibilities for Our Time]]<br />[[ASIN:0131877291 The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty Through Profits (Wharton School Publishing Paperbacks)]]<br />[[ASIN:0805079831 The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism]]<br />[[ASIN:0452287081 Confessions of an Economic Hit Man]]<br />[[ASIN:071452929X Manufacture of Evil: Ethics, Evolution, and the Industrial System]]<br />[[ASIN:0393330877 Plan B 3.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization, Third Edition]]<br />[[ASIN:0679450785 The Future of Life]]<br />[[ASIN:0970053495 The leadership of civilization building: Administrative and civilization theory, symbolic dialogue, and citizen skills for the 21st century]]onal  peacekeeping coalitions; 2) the United Nations is not structured, funded,  nor capable of carrying out disciplined effective peacekeeping operations,  and the contributing nations are unreliable in how and when they will  provide incremental assistance; 3) we still have a long way to go in  devising new concepts, doctrines, and technologies and programs for  effectively integrating and applying preventive diplomacy, transformed  defense, transnational law enforcement, and public services (water, food,  health and education) in a manner that furthers regionally-based peace and  prosperity instead of feeding the fires of local unrest.

This book remains priceless & relevant.<br /><br />First published in 1999, this is an original tour d-horizon that is essential to any discussion of the theory and practice of conflict in the 21st Century, to include all those discussions of the alleged Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), the need for \\"defense transformation\\", and the changing nature of civil-military relations.<br /><br />I am much impressed by this book and the decades of thinking that have gone into it, and will outline below a few of its many signal contributions to the rather important questions of how one must devise and manage national power in an increasingly complex world.<br /><br />First, the author is quite clear on the point that technology does not a revolution make-nor can technology dominate a national strategy. If anything-and he cites Luttwak, among others, with great regard-an excessive emphasis on technology will be very expensive, susceptible to asymmetric attack, and subversive of other elements of the national strategy that must be managed in harmony. People matter most.<br /><br />Second, and this is the point that hit me hardest, it is clear that security strategy requires a holistic approach and the rather renaissance capability of managing a multiplicity of capabilities-diplomatic, economic, cultural, military, psychological, information-in a balanced manner and under the over-arching umbrella of a strategy.<br /><br />Third, and consistent with the second, \\"war proper\\" is not exclusively about force of arms, but rather about achieving the national political objective by imposing one's will on another. Those that would skew their net assessments and force structure capabilities toward \\"real war\\" writ in their conventional terms are demeaning Clausewitz rather than honoring him.<br /><br />Fourth, as I contemplate in this and other readings how best to achieve lasting peace and prosperity, I see implicit in all that the author puts forward, but especially in a quote from Donald Kegan, the raw fact that it is not enough for America to have a preponderance of the traditional military and economic power in the world-we must also accept the burden and responsibility of preserving the peace and responding to the complex emergencies around the globe that must inevitably undermine our stability and prosperity at home.<br /><br />Fifth, it is noteworthy that of all the dimensions of strategy that are brought forward, one-time-is unique for being unimprovable. Use it or lose it. Time is a strategic dimension too little understood and consequently too little valued by Americans in particular and the Western alliance in general.<br /><br />Sixth, it merits comment that the author, perhaps the greatest authority on Clausewitz in this era, clarifies the fact that the \\"trinity\\" is less about people, government, and an army, than about primordial violence, hatred, and enmity (the people); chance and probability on the battlefield, most akin to a game of cards (the army); and instrumental rationality (the government)-and that these are not fixed isolated elements, but interpenetrate one another and interact in changing ways over time and space.<br /><br />Seventh, the author devotes an entire chapter to \\"Strategic Culture as Context\\" and this is most helpful, particularly in so far as it brings forward the weakness of the American strategic culture, notably a pre-disposition to isolationism and to technical solutions in the abstract. Perhaps more importantly, a good strategic culture with inferior weapons can defeat a weak strategic culture with an abundance of technology and economic power.<br /><br />Eighth, and finally, the author courageously takes on the issue of small wars and other savage violence, seeking to demonstrate that grand strategy applies equally well to the savage criminal and warlord parasites that Ralph Peters has noted are not susceptible to our traditional legal and military conventions. Whilehe does not succeed (and notes in passing that Clausewitz's own largest weakness was a failure to catalogue the enemy and the dialog with the enemy as a major factor in strategic success and failure), the coverage is acceptable in making three key points:<br /><br />1) small wars and sub-national conflicts are generally not resolved decisively at the irregular level-conventional forces are required at some point;<br /><br />2) special operations forces have a role to play but lack a strategic context (that is to say, current political and military leaders have no appreciation for the strategic value of special operations forces); and<br /><br />3) small wars and non-traditional threats-asymmetrical threats-must be taken seriously and co-equally with symmetrical regular conflicts.<br /><br />At the end of the day, this erudite scholar finds common cause with gutter warrior Ralph Peters and gang-warfare iconoclast Martin Van Crevald by concluding his book with a quote from Alexander Solzhenitsyn: \\"In the Computer Age we will live by the law of the Stone Age: the man with the bigger club is right.

In three separate articles by internationally-recognized humanists, it  makes three important points: first, that U.S. policies toward &quot;rogue  states&quot; comprised largely of embargoes that result in infant  mortality, local epidemics, starvation, infertility, and so on, are a  direct violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; second, that  the U.S. appears to have been both an active practitioner of bio-chemical  warfare resulting in the deaths and deformation of hundreds of thousands of  South Vietnamese civilians (Agent Orange) as well as a passive practitioner  in biological warfare qua disease promulgation through embargo and  non-intervention; and third, that the U.S. has consistently refused to  abide by international arbitration and other means for settling disputes,  but instead generally utilized force as its preferred vehicle for getting  its own way, regardless of international agreements to which it has been a  signatory.  Too few write credibly in this vein, and this pamphlet is  therefore a helpful off-set to the more conventional wisdom that comes from  the military-industrial complex and the politicians this complex supports.	2000-08-27

This book is unabashedly populist and seeks to make this very  complex threat entertaining and understandable, and for that reason alone  it is worth the time to consider.

Future Shock and  PowerShift remain their two most important works, this one comes in third.  They start off with a compelling reason for buying the book, a quote from  Trotsky: &quot;You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in  you.&quot;  Today, right now, there are 26 conflicts going on around the  world killing more than 1000 people a year; 78 &quot;low intensity&quot;  conflicts killing more than 100 but less than 1000 people a year; and 178  violent political conflicts causing fewer than 100 deaths per year--source  is the PIOOM project in The Netherlands.  There are also 16 genocidal  campaigns ongoing as we speak, and another 18 emerging--from Rwanda and  Burundi to Sri Lanka to East Timor to obscure sections of China and Russia.  This is a serious book by serious researchers who had the good fortune to  be prescient and to become world-renowned futurists.  The book is strongest  on Third Wave wars and niche wars, does a very creditable job of covering a  wide range of unconventional forms of conflict, and ends, somewhat  disappointingly, with a useful but less than gripping discussion of  &quot;peace forms&quot;.

This is much more than a book of graphic generalizations; as a  researcher myself I especially appreciate the specific identification of  the sources that were consulted, and the summaries of each of the major  political-legal, socio-economic, techno-demographic, ideo-cultural, and  natural-geographic conditions threatening the stability of the &quot;Whole  Earth&quot;.  I dare to think this book should be required reading for our  elected representatives as well as our military commanders charged with  &quot;shaping&quot; their regional environments.	2000-08-19

As the  international media becomes less and less useful as a means of appreciating  how global conditions threaten our own internal security and prosperity,  guide books like this one become all the more valuable to citizens and  their elected representatives.  This is an essential desk reference for  every student striving to learn how to think, not just memorize, and for  every adult who cares to understand just how unstable and diminishing is  the world we are leaving to our children.  The book is *not* out-of-date in  2000, but we would all benefit from a new edition coming out that might  expand on the core value of the 1997 edition.	2000-08-19

This is still a valuable  work, largely because of the process and the framework it provides for  thinking about geographically and culturally based sources of conflict.  Published in 1986 it missed some big ones: Somalia, Rwandi-Burundi, the  Congo, the break-up of Yugoslavia with the Kosovo aftermath.  We'll give  them credit for the Gulf flashpoint.  What's the point?  No one can predict  with any certainty where major humanitarian conflicts will emerge, but if  one combines Keegan and Wheatcroft's approach with environmental and  economic and social overlays (such as are offered by several other  &quot;States of the World&quot; endeavors), then a useful starting point is  available for asking two important questions: what kinds of conflicts will  we be dealing with, under what kinds of terrain and cultural conditions;  and second, given those realities, what kinds of forces and capabilties  should we be developing?  Against this model, the U.S. Joint 2020 vision  falls woefully short, and the NATO alliance appears equally unprepared for  a future that will be characterized by &quot;dirty little wars&quot; well  out of NATO's area but highly relevant to the well-being of the NATO  population.  One might also make the somewhat puckish point that it does  not take a $30 billion dollar a year spy community to create a common-sense  strategic document such as this--it can be had for under $20.	2000-08-19

Stuart, whom I know as one of the most thoughtful and self-effacing Colonels in military intelligence,  wisely chooses to focus on the two most important cases in recent U.S.  military history. For a catalog of all the others, see &quot;Merchants of  Treason&quot; by Tom Allen and Norman Polmar. A few things about this  valuable book bear emphasis here: 1) early on, the FBI tried to shut the  CIA out of the first case, and Col Herrington very wisely insisted on  including them--leading to critical CIA contributions without which the  case would not have been solved; 2) counterintelligence is incredible  tedious, boring, *hard* work, and it takes a special kind of commander to  maintain morale under such circumstances; 3) both Defense and Justice  lawyers screwed up big-time by not being aware that military intelligence  activities in Austria were illegal in Austria and therefore warranted early  involvement of the Austrian government--this ignorance cost us heavily; 4)  allowing soldiers to &quot;homestead&quot; in sensitive intelligence  positions anywhere is very dangerous; and finally--bringing to bear some  personal knowledge here--5) success is temporary, failure is forever...I'll  wager the Army's Foreign Counterintelligence Activity has gone downhill  since this book was written, and that the old &quot;go along easy&quot;  habits of those that have been homesteading too long at FCA are again  rearing their ugly heads. Counterintelligence is still a backwater, and any  commander, however exceptional, is going to need strong Service-level  support if they are to keep their senior civil servant (bureaucratic)  elements in line.  This book is an excellent touchstone for Congressional  members and staff, Service and DoD chiefs who care little for  counterintelligence but need to do more, and for citizens who need to know  that counterintelligence is on the &quot;front lines&quot; every day, in  every clime and place.is on the &quot;front lines&quot; every day, in  every clime and place.	2000-06-28

Very much focused on how a world-brain might alter national policy-making, how Public Opinion or  an &quot;Open Conspiracy&quot; might restore common sense and popular  control to arenas previously reserved for an elite.  The information  functionality of the World Brain easily anticipated the world wide web as  it might evolve over the next 20-30 years: comprehensive, up to date,  distributed, classification scheme, dynamic, indexes, summaries and  surveys, freely available and easily accessible.  We have a long way to go,  but the framework is there.  The communication functions of the world brain  would include a highly effective information retrieval system, selective  dissemination of information, efficient communication facilities,   effective presentation, popular education, public and individual awareness  for all issues, and facilitate social networking between organizations,  groups, and individuals.  The world brain is the &quot;virtual intelligence  community&quot; qua noosphere.  This is one of the fundamental references  for anyone thinking about the future of politics, economics, or social  systems.	2000-05-29

He stressed the need for &quot;busting  loose from the technology legacy&quot;, the need to dramatically transform  both the information management and human resource management concepts and  also a turning on its head of how government works-from centralized after  the fact &quot;leveling&quot; and gross national security to decentralized,  proactive nurturing of individual opportunity before the fact, providing  individual security through individual opportunity and prosperity within  the network.	2000-05-29

The author does break new ground and add valuable new detail to the history of Allen Dulles, and  his hard work in bringing us this book merits appreciation.  Having said  that, I confess to three disappointments: 1) the use of years to demarcate  the chapters, rather than meaningful titles, is both boring and  representative of the book's lack of presentational &quot;zing&quot;;  2)  the book obsesses on Allen Dulles as the center of the earth and leaves out  the context within which Dulles achieved his successes-casual references to  how he operated two additional French networks, for example, without  covering the arduous and detailed path that led to the creation and  maintenance of those networks, leave one feeling as if Dulles simply waved  a magic wand to create networks whole-bodied and in full force; and 3) the  conclusion of the book, purportedly a review of what Allen Dulles would see  and feel if he examined today's intelligence community, is generally on  target but rather terse-nothing that one could take to an incoming  President to energize him into revitalizing and enhancing our national  intelligence community.  There are some gems in this book that reflect the  author's dedication and merit notice: Richard Helms reflecting on how  America came much too close to losing World War II; Walt Rostow on calming  the Kennedy's and preventing a rash counter-attack once the Bay of Pigs was  known to be a disaster-this is the stuff of history, and I therefore  heartily recommend this book as a valuable contribution to our  understanding of Allen Dulles' place in history.	2000-05-28

Bob Gates has served his  country, and five presidents, as earnestly and capably as anyone might, and  there is much to learn from this book.  The level of detail is quite good.  He is very critical of the Directorate of Operations for both misbehavior  and a lack of management control in relation to Central America, and as one  who was there I have to say, he is absolutely right.  We disagree on the  point of intelligence (he would say, &quot;secrets for the president&quot;,  I would say &quot;knowledge for the Nation&quot;) but I believe we would  agree on this: intelligence is important, and intelligence merits deep and  sustained interest by the President.	2000-04-08

DeForrest was a former military  enlisted man who ended up managing a great deal of the prisoner  interrogation for a major Agency facility in-country.  His story ties  together a number of important themes, from the failure of Ivy League types  to understand what they were dealing with to the inadequacies (and  sometimes the superiority) of vast numbers of &quot;contract&quot; case  officers who would normally not have been hired, to the very real value of  systematically debriefing all prisoners and entering the results into a  database amenable to search and retrieval, something we don't know how to  do today.  Across every major military operation since Viet-Nam, it has  been my experience that we have no table of organization and equipment,  completely inadequate numbers of trained interrogators and translators, and  no commitment to the tedious but essential work of extracting knowledge  from large numbers of hostile prisoners.	2000-04-08

Or stupid.  It can liberate.  Or enslave.  Norman joins a select group of thinkers advocating a human-centered approach to technology.  Inspired (or, more accurately, depressed) by Jerry  Mander, he wrote this book to examine the differences between humans and  machines, and to establish some ground rules for policy that protected the  one and leveraged the other.  Norman notes that when technology is not  designed from a human-centered point of view, it produces accidents and  more often than not the human is blamed.  He focuses especially on the  distinction between experiential cognition and reflective cognition, and  laments that television and entertainment are swamping us with the  experiential and not teaching us the reflective.  He is concerned that our  ever-lengthening chain of technology dependence is forcing us to deal with  ever-increasing loads of information at the same time that it weakens our  inherent  capabilities further.  People first, science second, technology  as servant.	2000-04-08

They address  America's vulnerability in both U.S. based logistics and in overseas  transport means-&quot;Destroying even a portion of American supply vessels  could so disrupt the tempo of a logistical build-up as to delay offensive  operations indefinitely.&quot;  They have a marvelous section on the  weaknesses of U.S. data gathering tools,  noting for example that  satellites provide only a static picture of one very small portion of the  battlefield, rather that the wide-area and dynamic &quot;situational  awareness&quot; that everyone agrees is necessary.  They go on to gore  other sacred oxes, including the Navy's giant ships such as the carrier  (and implicitly the new LPH for Marines as well as the ill-conceived  arsenal ship) and the largest of the aircraft proposed by the Air Force.  They ultimately conclude that the future of war demands manned space  stations that are able to integrate total views of the world with control  of intercontinental precision systems, combined with a complete  restructuring of the ground forces (most of which will be employed at the  squad level) and a substantial restructuring of our navel force to provide  for many small fast platforms able to swarm into coastal areas.	2000-04-08

The authors place intelligence in the larger context of information, and draw a plethora of useful comparisons with emerging  private sector capabilities and standards.  They place strong emphasis on  the emerging issues (not necessarily threats) related to ethnic, religious,  and geopolitical confrontation, and are acutely sensitive to the new power  of non-governmental organizations and non-state actors.  The heart of their  book is captured in three guidelines for the new process: focus on  understanding the consumer's priorities; minimize the investment in fixed  hardware and personnel; and create a system that can draw freely on  commercial capabilities where applicable (as they often will be).  Their  chapter on the failure of the bureaucratic model for intelligence, and the  need to adopt the virtual model-one that permits analysts to draw at will  on diverse open sources-is well presented and compelling.  Their concluding  three chapters on analysis, covert action, and secrecy are solid  professional-level discussions of where we must go in the future.	2000-04-08

It includes a chapter by Mel Goodman that some thought  was to have been a full-blown book.  The chapter by Richard A.

For instance, the superiority of amateurs from the ham radio ranks over the so-called professional military  communications personnel, in the tricky business of breaking patterns and  codes; the many &quot;human in the loop&quot; breaks of otherwise  unbreakable technical codes, from the Italians with hemorrhoids (not in the  code book, spelling it each day broke the code) to the careless Russians.  He also touches on security cases in both the U.S. and England.  In his  conclusion, one sentence jumped out at me: &quot;The old spirit of RSS,  with its emphasis on voluntary effort, has been replaced by a bureaucracy  of civil servants who preferred to stifle, rather than encourage,  initiative.&quot;  As the current Director of NSA has discovered, NSA today  is in mental grid lock, and its culture is oppressive in the extreme.	2000-04-08

We were distracted by Khe Sanh, the  commanders did not want to hear it, &quot;intelligence to please&quot; was  the standard within the Military Assistance Command Viet-Nam intelligence  bureaucracy, and when we finally did grasp, one day before the attack, its  true strategic nature, we failed to disseminate the warnings to the  tactical commanders with sufficient effectiveness.	2000-04-08

They address, in a manner understandable by the complete layman, the intersection of  competitive intelligence, corporate security, and WarRoom operations.  They  have a number of very useful and thoughtful figures.  The book is  unquestionably at the head of the class with respect to WarRoom operations  and exploiting information technology and basic planning and execution and  visualization concepts.  Where I have a real problem with this book is in  its advocacy of elicitation and other deceptive techniques, no doubt a  hang-over from Steven's days as a CIA case officer.  There is absolutely no  place in U.S. competitive intelligence for such methods, and any discussion  in that direction must be forcefully opposed if we are to succeed in  creating a legal, ethical, overt network of intelligence professionals able  to reinforce each other in providing open source intelligence to businesses  as well as non-governmental organizations.	2000-04-08

The National Performance Review identified a number of substantive objectives for intelligence reform, and the  intelligence bureaucracy was successful in ignoring the White House.  I  suspect it has something to do with one of the fundamentals:  &quot;Unleash-but Harness-the Pioneers.&quot;  The U.S. Intelligence  Community can't stand pioneers unless they are spending billions of dollars  on something really, really secret that has a high probability of failure.  Reinvention boils down to uncoupling or deconstructing a whole bunch of  stuff, and then allowing the pieces to compete.

This book reviews leadership of both  domains and nations, with case studies on Margaret Mead (Culture), J.  Robert Oppenheimer (Physics), Robert Maynard Hutchins (Education), Alfred  P. Sloan, Jr. (Business), George C. Marshall (Military), Pope John XXII  (Religion), Eleanor Roosevelt (Ordinariness and Extraordinariness), Martin  Luther King (Minority) and Margaret Thatcher (National).  The best leaders  that emerge are those who are willing to confront authority and take risk,  while also creating networks of contacts that number in the hundreds or  thousands rather than tens.  Most tellingly,  aleader in a discipline (e.g.  intelligence) only emerges as a long-term leader if he finally realizes  that &quot;he is  more likely to achieve his personal goals or to satisfy  his community if he addresses a wider audience than if he remains  completely within a specific domain.&quot;  The six constants of leadership  are the story, the audience (beginning with a message for the unschooled  mind), the organization, the embodiment, a choice between direct (more  practical) and indirect (more reflective and often more enduring)  leadership, and a paradox-the direct leaders often lack knowledge while the  indirect leaders often have greater knowledge, and transferring knowledge  from the indirect leader to the direct leader may be one of the central  challenges and opportunities of the 21st Century.	2000-04-08

At best it is a place-holder, a means of keeping the economy stable.  There is a strong  element of accountability throughout the book, first with respect to the  managers of governments and corporations, and finally with the managers of  schools that must ultimately be held accountable for producing students who  are competent at both learning and sharing knowledge.  For Drucker, the  organization of the post-capitalist society must commit itself to being a  destabilizer able to change constantly.  &quot;It must be organized for  systematic abandonment of the established, the customary, the familiar, the  comfortable-whether products, services, processes, human and social  relationships, skills, or organizations themselves.  It is the very nature  of knowledge that it changes fast and that today's certainties will be  tomorrow's absurdities.&quot;  So speaketh Drucker of the U.S. Intelligence  Community....	2000-04-08

One contributor, Robin Winks, concludes that US  intelligence (CIA) is not getting &quot;the right stuff&quot; now for four  interlocking reasons: 1) academia by and large no longer cooperates with  the intelligence community; 2) academia lost its interest in being helpful  when it became apparent that the covert action tail was wagging the  intelligence dog; 3) the intelligence community, apprehensive about  recruiting from open institutions permitting violent war protests, made the  clearance process so convoluted that it began averaging eighteen months;  and 4) the agency began to recruit people who badly wanted to join and were  willing to put up with a recruitment and clearance process that the best  Yale students, the ones who withdrew from consideration, described as  &quot;curious, stupid, degrading, and off-putting&quot;, with the result  that the agency ultimate lost access to &quot;the self-assured, the  confident, the questioning, and the adventurous-precisely the qualities  that has been so attractive to the OSS-in the process.&quot;  I myself know  from discussions with the head of the office responsible for evaluating  incoming Career Trainees, that the standard profile of a desirable  candidate has always been &quot;the company man&quot; who goes along,  except in two years-1979 and 1982-when they went after  &quot;self-starters.&quot;  Within five years, both those classes lost  fifty percent of their numbers to resignation, and I believe that this  problem continues to persist.  I was in the 1979 class, and hung in there  for nine years.	2000-04-08

It is a  disturbing and valuable book, and I took from it several lessons: 1) CIA  puppies with no military background, and military detailees with no law  enforcement background, have no business getting into the gutter with  foreign thugs; 2) if we support indigenous arrest, torture, and  assassination programs they need to have some serious multi-cultural  analysis and counterintelligence support lest we simply give one faction  the means of killing off the other without regard to our interests; and 3)  our general approach to interference in the internal affairs of other  nations is corrupt and increases local corruption.  We throw money at  personalities rather than insight at institutions.  We train and equip  local units to inflict covert violence, and then wonder why the situation  destabilizes further.	2000-04-08

It follows James Jesus Angleton, who tied the Agency in knots and went so far as to  privately tell the French that the CIA Station Chief in Paris was a Soviet  spy, and William King Harvey, who literally carried two six-guns both in  the US and overseas &quot;because you never know when you might need  them.&quot;  Included in this book are some serious details about the  operations against Cuba, a chapter appropriated titled &quot;Murder  Corrupts&quot;, and a good account of how Harvey, in perhaps his most  important achievement, smelled out the fact that Kim Philby was indeed a  Soviet spy.  The concluding thought of the book is exceptional:  &quot;Immersed in duplicity and insulated by secrecy, they (Angleton and  Harvey) developed survival mechanisms and behavior patterns that by any  rational standard were bizarre.  The forced inbreeding of secrecy spawned  mutant deeds and thoughts.  Loyalty demanded dishonesty, and duty was a  thieves' game.  The game attracted strange men and slowly twisted them  until something snapped.  There were no winners or losers in this game,  only victims.&quot;	2000-04-08

Below are links to some others I recommend.<br /><br />Our answer to Levy, but an order of magnitude more practical and steeped in some of the best endnotes I've ever enjoyed.  Consilience is the \\"jumping together\\" of  knowledge across boundaries, and the  greatest enterprise of the mind.  He begins with an example, showing how  biology, ethics, social science, and environmental policy must all come  together to properly resolve a global environmental issue, but actually do  not-the learned individuals are fragmented into four separate communities,  and within those communities further fragmented into nationalities and  cliques and jobs, and it is our greater loss for we cannot arrive at the  best policy without being able to integrate the knowledge across all these  boundaries.  He emphasizes that the public must be educated and have access  to this unified knowledge, not just the policymakers.  He poses, and then  answers across the book, this question: \\"What is the relation between  science and the humanities, and how is it important to human welfare?\\"  In my own mind, Edward O. Wilson has defined both national and global  intelligence writ large, and done so in way that suggests the \\"virtual  intelligence community\\" is a very practical and achievable vision.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0679768114 The Future of Life]]<br />[[ASIN:0300110561 The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom]]<br />[[ASIN:0385500718 The Wealth of Knowledge: Intellectual Capital and the Twenty-first Century Organization]]<br />[[ASIN:038552207X Revolutionary Wealth: How it will be created and how it will change our lives]]<br />[[ASIN:0553292153 Powershift: Knowledge, Wealth, and Power at the Edge of the 21st Century]]<br />[[ASIN:075067184X Infinite Wealth: A New World of Collaboration and Abundance in the Knowledge Era]]<br />[[ASIN:081297607X The Age of Missing Information]]<br />[[ASIN:0156005514 Forbidden Knowledge: From Prometheus to Pornography]]<br />[[ASIN:0738208612 Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution]]<br />[[ASIN:0962041386 Information Productivity: Assessing Information Management Costs of U.

This book is about creativity, competition, and the natural order of things.  Mutants are most important during times of  violent change (the end of a paradigm) when they offer substantial  variation from the non-workable past and hence improve the shift toward  survival by being more fit for the new circumstances.  Interestingly, each  successive transport infrastructure (canals to rails to roads to airways)  provides an order of magnitude improvement in productivity.  One could  consider the personal computer and modem a way station on this trend, with  networking and true global collaborative work tools as the next node.  In  the life spiral of change 1996 is the center of a &quot;charging&quot;  period with new order and new technology, and will lead to tension and grow  in the 2000-2010 period followed by a discharge boom and then relaxation  and recession in the 2010-2020 period.  Pollution is the next &quot;global  war&quot; that needs to be fought, and we will not have a global village  until we can reduce the travel time between any two points anywhere to 70  minutes and a cumulative cost for a year of such travel to 15% of the  average global income.	2000-04-08

If it were not for the fact that Intelink is largely  useless to the rest of the world and soon to be displaced by my own and  other &quot;extranets&quot;, this book would be triumphal.  As it is, I  consider it an extremely good baseline for understanding the good and the  bad of how the U.S. Intelligence Community addresses the contradictions  between needing access to open sources and emerging information  technologies while maintaining its ultra-conservative views on maintaining  very restricted access controls to everything and everyone within its  domain.  I have enormous regard for what these folks accomplished, and wish  they had been able to do it openly, for a much larger &quot;virtual  intelligence community&quot; willing and able to share information.  For a  spy, information shared is information lost-until they get over this, and  learn that information not only increases in value with dissemination but  is also a magnet for 100 pieces of information that would never have  reached them otherwise, the U.S. Intelligence Community will continue to be  starved for both information and connectivity....an SGML leper in an XML  world.	2000-04-08

How the book treats the CIA-FBI relationship, for  example, is probably representative of how most CIA insiders feel.  The  book does not reflect a deep understanding of open sources and tends to  accept the common wisdom across the intelligence bureaucracy, that all is  &quot;generally okay&quot; and just a bit of change on the margin is  necessary.  In this respect, it is a good benchmark against which the more  daring reformist books may be measured.	2000-04-08

The  information explosion is drowning our senses and cutting us off from more  fundamental information about our limitations and the limitations of the  world around us.

Dewey's bottom line is  clear: he concludes that &quot;the Clandestine Services (sic) is finished  as a really effective intelligence service.&quot;  He has other worthwhile  insights, ranging from the inadequacy of the information reaching CIA  analysts from open sources (e.g. Nepal), to the &quot;wog factor&quot;  dominating CIA analytical assessments (e.g. Pakistan will never attack  India), to the sterile and politically-safe approaches to intelligence by  the leadership of NSA and the some of the military intelligence services.  My bottom line on Dewey is also clear: he was typical of the case officer  talent pool, he tried very hard, and the system still failed.  He was a  good person in a very bad system.	2000-04-08

It breaks new ground in understanding the bureaucratic and political realities that surrounded the emergence of the National Security Council, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and  the Central Intelligence Agency.  The CIA was weak by design, strongly  opposed by the military services from the beginning.  Its covert activities  emerged as a Presidential prerogative, unopposed by others in part because  it kept CIA from being effective at coordinated analysis, for which it had  neither the power nor the talent.  Most usefully, the book presents a new  institutionalist theory of bureaucracy that gives full weight to the  original design, the political players including the bureaucrats  themselves, and external events.  Unlike domestic agencies that have strong  interest groups, open information, legislative domain, and unconnected  bureaucracies, the author finds that national security agencies, being  characterized by weak interest groups, secrecy, executive domain, and  connected bureaucracies, evolve differently from other bureaucracies, and  are much harder to reform.  On balance, the author finds that intelligence  per se, in contrast to defense or domestic issues, is simply not worth the  time and Presidential political capital needed to fix but that if reform is  in the air, the President should either pound on the table and put the full  weight of their office behind a substantive reform proposal, or walk away  from any reform at all-the middle road will not successful.	2000-04-08

From the  FBI's failure to communicate its very early knowledge of Japanese  collection requirement on Pearl Harbor via the Germans, to the  assassination of President Kennedy, the World Trade Center bombing and the  Aldrich Ames case, this book makes me ashamed and angry about how  bureaucracy and secrecy subvert loyalty, integrity, and common professional  sense on both sides of this &quot;wedgie&quot; contest.	2000-04-08

Written from a transatlantic perspective, integrating the best  of American and European thinking in his references, the author addresses  the nature of information, its structuring, the dynamics of sharing  information, learning cycles, institutional and cultural contexts, and ends  with this thought: that we have spent close to a century  &quot;de-skilling&quot; the population to suit assembly line needs and now  must spend close to a century &quot;re-skilling&quot; the population to  deal with complex information tasks where every action and reaction will be  unique.	2000-04-08

As I read this book,  originally obtained to put secrecy into perspective, I suddenly grasped and  appreciated two of the author's central thoughts: knowing too much too fast  can be dangerous; and yes, there are things we should not know or be  exposed to.  Who decides? Or How do we the people decide? are questions  that must be factored into any national knowledge policy or any national  information strategy.  This book left me with a sense of both the sacred  and the scary sides of unfettered knowledge.  This is less about morality  and more about focus, intention, and social outcomes.  It is about the  convergence of power, knowledge, and love to achieve an enlightened  intelligence network of self-governing moral people who are able to defend  themselves against evil knowledge and prosper by sharing good knowledge.	2000-04-08

This book, a collection of essays from the 1980's, is  the only one I have ever found that truly grasps the strategic long-term  importance of intelligence in the context of culture and general knowledge.  The heart of the book is on page 177:  &quot;(There is a need) to  recognize that just as the essence of knowledge is not as split up into  academic disciplines as it is in our academic universe, so can intelligence  not be set apart from statecraft and society, or subdivided into  elements...such as analysis and estimates, counterintelligence, clandestine  collection, covert action, and so forth.  Rather, and as suggested earlier  in this essay, intelligence is a scheme of things entire.  And since it  permeates thought and life throughout society, Western scholars must  understand all aspects of a state's culture before they can assess  statecraft and intelligence.&quot;  The 25-page introduction, at least,  should be read by every intelligence professional.	2000-04-08

This is really the only down-to-earth book that combines \\"a day in the life of a spy\\" with a serious practical discussion of just how and why spies do what they do.  It is fun and easy to read, and offers some real world annecdotes that do not violate security but offer instead glimpses of the joys, the insanities, and the terror (10% of the time) or boredom (90% of the time--such as spending hours if not days waiting for a senstive asset to show up) that characterize the life of a spy.<br /><br />To his credit, Copeland understood very early on that the spy world was missing out on what is known today as Open Source Intelligence (see my own book, \\"The New Craft of Intelligence\\" or view the 30,000 free pages at OSS.Net).  The description on  pages 41-42 (of the original hard-cover version) of how \\"Mother\\"  concocted an entire network and got the head of Secret Intelligence to  agree its production was worth $100,000 a year (big money in 1946), only to  reveal that his source was actually five issues of The New York Times  \\"demonstrated not only the naivet&eacute; of our nation's only existing group  of espionage specialists but the value of ordinary New York Times reporting  on matters regarded as being of high-priority intelligence interest.\\"  Nothing has changed in 50 years.  We still need our spies, but they need to be a bit more serious, a bit less white, a lot older, and much more focused.  We lack--we need--men of the caliber of Dulles and Copeland today.	2000-04-08

With that disclosure, I will offer the observation that this book,  which has gotten enormous attention within the U.S. military, is an  excellent companion to Brigadier Simpkin's book, and the two, perhaps with  General Scale's book, could be used to drive any graduate-level course on  structuring a future warfighting and peacekeeping force.  Toffler brings us full circle, back to SunTzu: the acme of skill is to defeat the enemy without fighting.  I predict that it will be last least ten years before the Department of Defense discovers that \\"stabilization and reconstruction\\" are the other side of the defense coin, and that early warning and peaceful preventive measures--as General Al Gray, Commandant of the Marine Corps emphasized in 1988, are the key to victory.	2000-04-08

This is all really great theory.<br />Taking the U.S. Intelligence Community--which failed spectacularly on 9-11 after resisting change for just over a decade--as an example relevant to both business and the public, one can readily see that great theory simply does not translate into relevant action.<br />Most helpful would be a new edition of this book, but one that places fully half the book's emphasis on identifying the obstacles to reform and learning, with each obstacle then addressed from both a top-down and a bottom-up perspective.<br />9-11 demonstrated that the theory of this book is badly needed within the ultimate \\"learning\\" community, the U.S. Intelligence Community.  Even after 9-11, the leadership of that community refuses to admit it failed, and refuses to propose or acknowledge the substantial changes recommended by over 15 books--a huge critical mass--recommended by the Council on Intelligence.

Still, they sum it up nicely in the concluding chapter: &quot;The formal practice of developing technical  intelligence in American business is only in its infancy.&quot;  They have  a nice appendix of sources on scientific and technical intelligence that is  missing a few big obvious sources like the Canadian Institute for  Scientific and Technical Information (CISTI) and the Defense Technical  Information Center (DTIC) as well as the Institute of Scientific  Information (ISI) and several smaller sources.  On balance, this technical  intelligence community is, as Bradford notes, in its infancy.  It is U.S.  centric, does not yet understand operational security and  counterintelligence, is weak of cost intelligence,  relies too heavily on  registered patents, and has too few practical successes stories.  Especially troubling is the recent trend within DIA and the Air Force of  cutting off all funding for open source exploitation of Chinese and other  foreign S&amp;T sources, combined with a dismantling by many corporations  of their libraries and most basic market research functions.

There is no getting around this.  While the authors are much more diplomatic than I could ever be, the raw fact is that most policy makers are very loosely-educated and generally do not have a high-quality international affairs education or substantive experience dealing with foreign affairs or even national affairs.  They are local lawyers, businessmen, \\"friends of the President,\\" etcetera.<br />2) Objective, internationalist intelligence will always be in conflict with subjective, domestic politics unless--and this is the other new theme just now emerging, years after the author's published their work--there is a public intelligence community and the citizen-voters are receiving sufficiently compelling intelligence they can use to demand and vote for early and thoughtful action instead of in extremis reaction.<br />3)  The book breaks new ground in establishing the importance of history, not only for drawing intelligence conclusions (understanding ethnic conflict, for example, is best done in the context of 200+ years of prior history), but for translating, converting, interpreting foreign events, threats, and opportunities in domestic historical terms that can be more easily absorbed by very busy policymakers.<br />I do not mean to suggest that the authors are condescending.  Far from it.  They take a very difficult and complex matter, that of speaking truth to power about foreign issues, and offer it up in a very sensible and understandable form.<br />The best of the students using this book for coursework will understand that it is a \\"keeper,\\" of lasting value as a future reference, worth returning to from year to year for a refresher on the value of history in both understanding and communicating.he authors are condescending.

As Paul  alludes in one of his footnotes, the Network today is somewhat in  relationship to the &quot;horseless carriage&quot; stage of the automobile,  and we have a very long way to go before policy helps make computers as  user-friendly and reliable and interoperable as the telephone and the  automobile are today.	2000-04-08

Not only is the power to define madness, criminality, and sexuality addressed, but also the active use of criminals, and sex, to suppress and subjugate the populace.  Somewhat more  difficult to wade through but similar to Norman Cousins,  it helped provoke  my thinking on how top-down unilateral command based on secrets is  inevitably going to give way to bottom-up multicultural decision-making by  the people based on open sources evenly shared across networks.  This is  really very heavy stuff, and it helps call into question the  &quot;rationality&quot; of both the Washington-based national security  policymaking process, and the &quot;rationality&quot; of spending $30  billion a year on secrets in contrast to what that $30 billion a year might  buy in terms of openly-available insights and overt information  peacekeeping.	2000-04-08

Well, in the U.S. Government, before you get a  real housecleaning, it appears you have to build the vacuum cleaner from  scratch every few years, and even then you only get the big dirt on the  margins.  This book is a very important book with all the more value today  as we finally get serious about intelligence reform.  Loch's professional  and extraordinarily detailed account of the entire Church Committee  investigation, its findings, White House attempts to avoid reform, and the  rather bland outcomes that finally resulted, should be considered the key  to understanding where we are today and why we so desperately need  legislation to achieve substantive reform.  Had Senator Church been chosen  by Jimmy Carter as Vice President (Church was favored by the convention,  with Mondale and Stevenson tied behind him), who knows what good might have  come of his White House service.	2000-04-08

First published by the National  Defense University Press in 1990, this book reflects deeply on the  limitations of firepower in limited war situations, and the conclusion is a  telling indictment of our national intelligence community and our joint  military intelligence community, neither of which is willing to break out  of their little boxes to find a proper response to this statement:  &quot;The common theme in all five case studies presented here is the  recurring inability of the side with the firepower advantage to find the  enemy with sufficient timeliness and accuracy to exploit that advantage  fully and efficiently.&quot;	2000-04-08

From this book I realized that virtually  everything we are doing in U.S. education and U.S. personnel management and  training today is way off the mark and at least a decade if not two or  three decades behind where we could be in human productivity management.	2000-04-08

An analyst and political  staffer by nature, the strength of this book rests on the premise in the  title: that intelligence should be about informing policy, not about  collecting secrets for secrets' sake.	2000-04-08

Erik Bloodaxe, one of the major characters in the book and my friend as well as a trusted security engineer, inscribed this book as  follows: &quot;Robert, Hope you enjoy this classic example of 3rd rate  speculative fiction.  So much for journalistic integrity, eh? /s/.  I also  know Phiber Optic, and tried to keep him out of jail, even offered to house  him and hire him on parole, but to no avail.  This is a good story that  crosses over frequently into speculative reporting, but it may be better  for that, capturing some of the spirit of competition that exists between  very talented hackers who by and large do no harm.	2000-04-07

He stressed the need for &quot;busting  loose from the technology legacy&quot;, the need to dramatically transform  both the information management and human resource management concepts and  also a turning on its head of how government works-from centralized after  the fact &quot;leveling&quot; and gross national security to decentralized,  proactive nurturing of individual opportunity before the fact, providing  individual security through individual opportunity and prosperity within  the network.	2000-04-07
